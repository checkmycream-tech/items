    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>A modified bob cut is perfect for me, but it does require some upkeep.</li>
            <li>I have found that self grip rollers are perfect.</li>
            <li>so this is really impressive to me.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>, this is a great price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>, if you want best results, you should thoroughly brush out each section of hair before you roll it up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li>These are wonderful...</li>
            <li>Great!  </li>

            <li>fantastic price, excellent product, very easy to use</li>
            <li>So happy I found these, I love using them to set blow outs.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be great, as my hair always slips out of most rollers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with these rollers.  </li>
            <li>so these are great to use more than once a day if I need to.  </li>

            <li>I love these rollers!</li>
            <li>pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>excellent product for those of us who still use rollers; very good price; would recommended to all gals with long hair</li>
            <li>So, if you need a set of curlers, these are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Gets tangled in the hair and ends up pulling it out rather than leaving nice curls</li>
            <li>Nice quality</li>
            <li>Nice gift for hairdressor</li>
            <li>There are many good videos on YouTube about velcro rollers, so you&#x27;ll know why I recommend this easy-to-store set.</li>
            <li>Container keeps everything nice and tidy</li>
            <li>Surprisingly the rolled hair tolerates being slept on much better than when I let it curl on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have yet to try these</li>
            <li>with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use duck clips to hold these in place though they probably would hold on their own, depending on your hair length &amp; texture.  </li>
            <li>They rolled up nicely and stayed with the help of a bobby pin.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to buy them and Rey them on my own.</li>
            <li>They are loving them.</li>
            <li>I have some experience with cosmetology, but I had never put curlers in my own hair.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order this kind..</li>
            <li>It is a nice assortment of sizes to share with someone.</li>
            <li>I was torn between a 3 or 4 star review and am being nice with 4.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for creating volume and giving your &#x27;do a nice, polished look with some OOMPH!</li>
            <li>Good strong Velcro, rollers stay in place without bobby pins.</li>
            <li>These are great for quick setting and drying.  </li>
            <li>Trying to grow out my hair and these rollers gave my hair body and were very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to pull off.</li>
            <li>Unroll and voila amazing volume :)</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how fast and easy they are to use, and the beautiful wave it gives your hair!</li>
            <li>Easy to put in my hair, they stay put and gives me a lot of body!</li>
            <li>I purchased separate duck bill hair clips since my hair is very fine and the self-grip rollers needed additional support.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used these velcro rollers and they have worked really great.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Helps my fine hair gain volume that stays!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice on your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These nice velcro rollers are easy to put in and take out.  </li>
            <li>These are kind of a nightmare for those of us with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Most of them stuck in her hair and it was a disaster getting them out.  </li>
            <li>And I am extremely pleased with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Make sure you unroll, and not pull them out?</li>
            <li>Love these rollers.</li>
            <li>Love that there are so many varied sizes to use on all lengths of hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had issues with holding styles for more than a couple hours</li>
            <li>The rollers gave me a smoother wavy look that I love.</li>
            <li>My hair likes this much better</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use them on my clients :)</li>
            <li>Ok grip.</li>
            <li>It could have a better grip.</li>
            <li>with body enhancing shampoo/conditioner (whichever is your favorite) - comb through conditioned hair while it sits&lt;br /&gt;-Once</li>
            <li>, I thought for sure</li>
            <li>Pick another option :)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m confident I will be nappy.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>l love these rollers.</li>
            <li>so I have purchased 2 more boxes.</li>
            <li>you use the biggest curler, I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than the gentlest of curl-ins at the ends.</li>
            <li>It looks like more of a blow out.</li>
            <li>They did grip to the hair for the most part</li>
            <li>I bought these because they were inexpensive and self gripping.</li>
            <li>I roll the top layer of my hair, heat them with a blow dryer, spray with hairspray, and then take them out after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Today I tried it one more time---dried my hair with a hair dryer to damp, put them in</li>
            <li>Stays in much better too.</li>
            <li>Result is volumized hair and a cute curl/slight wave at the end.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the Velcro would be able to hold all my hair</li>
            <li>Love not needing to use pins to hold the curler in the hair.  </li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these rollers.</li>
            <li>Love them....</li>
            <li>After about 15 minutes my hair is smoother and has more body</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this rollers</li>
            <li>Would love to have 12 large-med and an appropriate size container for them.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, and they stay in even over night.</li>
            <li>I figured I would try these rollers out because they are self gripping.</li>
            <li>You can get a better price at Walmart</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because they work ok, but do not hold my hair like i was hoping.</li>
            <li>Love these curlers.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the fullness and bounce.</li>
            <li>Stay perfectly in place even with my super fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to gently unroll a smooth, beautiful curl</li>
            <li>grip is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I find the best results are when your hair is damp and for me I leave them in for 2 hours because my hair is so long, but</li>
            <li>They are easy to put in, stay without pinning, hair dries quickly, and they come in a nice variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>They did not stay in the hair well, and the curl was minimal at best.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use them more</li>
            <li>Full, lifted and shiny!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Convenient packaging - easy to pack up and store or keep</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get these things out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li>Adheres to hair easily, and pulls out just as easily.  </li>
            <li>Not so easy to take out</li>
            <li>The ones that I could get out without a lot of fuss didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair and my hair is easy to curl.</li>
            <li>They are fairly easy to put it and removal can be tricky but you just have to work at it.</li>
            <li>Even so, they were incredibly easy to use, and they seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, stays in place, and holds my hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put in, take out and store.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>my hair must be too fine ...</li>
            <li>my super fine hair, I thought for sure</li>
            <li>They went in my hair fine...</li>
            <li>They did not come out fine.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair maybe these work or if you don&#x27;t have fine hair?</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I have fine, slippery hair.  </li>
            <li>I also have fine, sparse hair with thinning areas around the crown.</li>
            <li>And smooth curls?</li>
            <li>When my hair is damp, I find it doesn&#x27;t come out as smooth</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
            <li>I have relatively short hair (reaching just below my chin) and these work great.</li>
            <li>These rollers are fantastic.</li>
            <li>fantastic and save your hair from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just a great set of various size rollers.  </li>
            <li>The curls look shiny and smooth, and feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is no longer available in our area so purchased for a friend.  </li>
            <li>We are retired now and my husband is willing to wait for me to set and dry my hair, these work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love them, They travel well, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li>The hair must be absolutely dry when you remove them, or you&#x27;ll pull out all the beautiful curl you just waited for.  </li>
            <li>I love these rollers, although I could have done with 2 sets for a few more of some of the rollers--I picked up another pack of some of the medium size at Sally&#x27;s but they won&#x27;t store as nicely as this!</li>
            <li>and it was super easy.</li>
            <li>So quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I bought a second set since I loved them so much and wanted more of the biggest roller!</li>
            <li>my super fine hair</li>
            <li>Pretty sure once I figure out how to correctly roll my hair I will like these.</li>
            <li>As long as you know how to use these type of rollers, you will be happy with them.</li>
            <li>If you have curly or frizzy hair, it&#x27;s better to straighten the hair first.  </li>
            <li>I thought since there were so many good reviews that maybe those people just had not put them in carefully.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of rollers I was originally looking for &amp; up &amp; bought the other kind..</li>
            <li>I think the combing (with roller; it helps re-straighten the hair)  and the pulling (keeps the hair stay straight) are very important.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great solution for me as someone who frequently showers at night and wants a quick style in the morning.</li>
            <li>I suppose if I had more time, they may have worked better because my hair would have been more dry.</li>
            <li>I tried again with just the large ones on the ends, and more tangles and no curls.</li>
            <li>, I decided I&#x27;d try out hair rollers for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I bought these rollers to add volume and try to make my hair look more full without using too much heat/wear/tear.</li>
            <li>that are much wider, and therefore hold much more hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set because they were reasonably priced but probably a better quality than the dollar-store version I had used before.</li>
            <li>Also has a nice variety of sizes and enough of the big ones to work great with my hair.</li>
            <li>Love my new rollers !</li>
            <li>The curls did not stay and came out super frizzy.</li>
            <li>you need order more than one pack if you need more than 5 rollers of the same size....</li>
            <li>I use the whole pack on my head, minus the largest curlers, and I get great volume and a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>They are great for damp hair, or to hold your hair after you use a round brush and blow dryer, or curling iron (put hair on the Conair Self-Grip Rollers until hair is cool, and spray with your favourite hairspray).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get a TON of tangles and was really concerned while it was setting, but to my surprise they came out easily with no tangles or snags.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get a TON of tangles and was really concerned while it was setting, but to my surprise they came out easily with no tangles or snags.  </li>
            <li>I use large bobby pins and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the different look I get and the easy use!</li>
            <li>I can see how these curlers would be great for people with some curl already whose hair is a little bit course.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>Its worth it to pay the extra money for a nice set like this.  </li>
            <li>I figured I would have more luck as an adult.  </li>
            <li>Also I would definitely use hair pins with these which kind of defeats the purpose of them being Velcro.</li>
            <li>I purchased these rollers hoping to give my naturally curly hair a more refined wavy look.  </li>
            <li>I have very thin, fine hair and these work great for me!  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s enough for a normal person&#x27;s head either to be honest) and weren&#x27;t easy to keep in.</li>
            <li>I used a Youtube tutorial that recommended having dry hair, then running each strand through a straightener first to warm and smooth the strand and to achieve volume but not curl.</li>
            <li>I used them right after received the package this afternoon.</li>
            <li>LOVE these, work super well (especially on damp hair) and leave longlasting curls even without hairspray.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these out since they looked like they would be gentle on the hair since they weren&#x27;t hot rollers.</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY soft and fine</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to use immediately after curling my hair to make it last longer and become tighter...that way when I flip my hair and scrunch my curls with my hand and do one comb over, my curls are super bouncy and the curls die to nice waves over a few hours depending on the size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s often difficult to find an assortment of sizes--these are great, and the cost is very reasonable for so many curlers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are more than enough curlers in this kit.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love these, but they&#x27;re just too short.  </li>
            <li>It never occurred to me that I should check both the width and the diameter, but evidently I should have.  </li>
            <li>Even if I&#x27;d known that, the item description doesn&#x27;t include the width (forgive me if I missed it, but I just looked again and still don&#x27;t see it - so just be aware).  </li>
            <li>Also, in my opinion, they include too many tiny rollers - who uses those anymore???  </li>
            <li>First, these are a snap to put in.</li>
            <li>I made sure my hair as well brushed with no tangles to avoid this problem</li>
            <li>The smaller curlers add much more curl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;m quite enjoying having these and finally having a practical non-heat routine!</li>
            <li>My hair definitely has more volume.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Can i use whit a hot dryer?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the exact look</li>
            <li>Went many years without using these and back to using them again.  </li>
            <li>Seem to have lost so many different sizes and now need those sizes.  </li>
            <li>so maybe this would be better and girls with short hair.</li>
            <li>They are my first rollers</li>
            <li>they were exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>I use these regularly and like using them better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I just wish they had more of the bigger and medium sizes in the case.</li>
            <li>I also used my hair dryer on HOT for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>With some practice, I can see this giving me exactly the results I&#x27;m after without a lot of fuss or cost.</li>
            <li>These rollers really do grip without bobby pins or clips!  </li>
            <li>They hold securely without clips and make it easy to do a fast curl and blow dry.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, brand new unopened set, and</li>
            <li>A little styling spray put them in put a quick hair dryer over your head and voila!!!</li>
            <li>On the positive side, my hair does stick to them well.  </li>
            <li>Wrapping the hair was easy enough, but removing the hair was beastly - tangly and hurty.  </li>
            <li>The big con, these are not hard to get stuck in your hair, I have literally ripped them out way more than comman sense allow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with the zippered case they came in as this will be helpful travelling to a wedding this summer -- which is why I am breaking down and styling my old hippie hair to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine asian hair, shoulder length, and median volume.</li>
            <li>The large pink rollers create looser fuller curls, so I use those on the top 1/3 of my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go for all-out body since it was my first try, but my hair has a really nice shape that I couldn&#x27;t get unless I worked with a blow-dryer and round brush for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Lots of sizes from tiny to very large; reasonably priced; work as described although a clip does add a bit of stability while blow drying your hair; and quick delivery with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>much like you&#x27;d imagine putting velcro in your hair would be.</li>
            <li>straight so looking for something that makes it fuller and wavy, not curly.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy another set to get more pink.</li>
            <li>They slip out of your hair when your ready and your done and have body/curls.</li>
            <li>So I put in a load of laundry in and checked my email, and then was ready to unroll.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>make sure you have bobby pins around, sometimes its harder for them to stay put.</li>
            <li>These rollers really do stay in your hair</li>
            <li>To put these in, I rolled a piece of hair up, then pressed it gently into the roller to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>When pulling them out, put your fingers through the middle of the roller and lightly pull as it unwinds.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier if I use the clips than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping  </li>
            <li>They got so tangled up in her hair that I really thought I was going to have to cut her hair to get them out.  </li>
            <li>, I feel like the rollers give me too much volume at the roots, which often leads to halo frizzies and a somewhat frazzled looking 80s pop star.</li>
            <li>I have fine long highlighted blonde hair that breaks easily</li>
            <li>These rollers are so gentle on my hair but they also grip really well.  </li>
            <li>Plus they nest really well and are compact.</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s stick straight).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Will buy the whole package again.  </li>
            <li>and they are reasonably durable feeling, even though they aren&#x27;t lined with metal.</li>
            <li>They also save my hair from the heat of a straight iron.</li>
            <li>on the days I don&#x27;t, after I shower I roll my hair while I am getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have sleek, straight hair I could see how these might work.</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY WORK AND STAY IN.  </li>
            <li>like this video for a velcro roller how to as I had never used them prior to this purchase (warm up the hair strands with a curling iron prior to rolling):&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>These are pretty cool, especially if you travel.  </li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and heathy and I made sure not to let the hair cross from one roller to the other</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any major snagging or pulling issues, though the smaller rollers do need to be taken out a bit more</li>
            <li>Worked ok first few times, but over time, and I use them every day..</li>
            <li>I use all the different sizes and it gives me a clean uniform curl.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a few more of the biggest and second biggest sizes, but that&#x27;s kind of just personal preference of the size</li>
            <li>Then use the hair dryer on a cool setting after the Conair rollers are in place to get a lasting set of curly hair.  </li>
            <li>In both cases there was not a curl that looked ok, the velcro really didn&#x27;t hold the curlers in place but made a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li>think the key to put the rollers on properly is to make sure your hair is straight when you put them on and make sure to wrap the hair around the roller tightly.  </li>
            <li>hair is 95% dry, blow-dry with head upright to smooth out any fly-aways</li>
            <li>Make sure you are starting with the last roller you put in and working backwards.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing is, I wish they had more of the bigger sizes.  </li>
            <li>I am hair-challenged (I&#x27;m not very good at styling my own hair).</li>
            <li>Easy to work with even for a 4 and 7 year old on a mannequin head with long hear.  </li>
            <li>I shower, put in the rollers up high on my head (with no product) and sleep in them.</li>
            <li>I am just very discouraged because not enough hair can be rolled on each roller, and so I need to use even more rollers for my thick hair, and my bonnet doesn&#x27;t fit over them</li>
            <li>used one hand to unroll the roller off the hair gently while used the other to secure the root of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair - have to be careful rolling hair up to avoid snags removing them</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, it used to be very thick, but know it has thin bed a bit, but it still looks full with a great cut.</li>
            <li>If you properly use these and don&#x27;t take too wide of a section, they are very easy to remove with no pain.</li>
            <li>There really are not enough in the pack to cover my whole head and did not have the time or patience to spend the whole day waiting for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Tried a couple of variations to see if I would work something</li>
            <li>So far, they really stay in.</li>
            <li>Second, the hair drys pretty fast with these.</li>
            <li>I could have achieved a better result with a blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li>They have a good variety of sizes, but what I really need (with medium length hair) are the two big sizes, with my hair being thick</li>
            <li>They are lightweight, and don&#x27;t weigh down your head like hot rollers will when you have a head full of them.  </li>
            <li>it can get tAngeles easily and get messy and loose the curl very quickly bc of this</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and am able to do my whole head with only one pack.</li>
            <li>They easily stay in with one or two bobby pins to hold down in place.</li>
            <li>For some reason in CT where I live I can&#x27;t find them in any</li>
            <li>have fine hair and an average amount of it.</li>
            <li>you could easily do an hour or less.</li>
            <li>I left them in my freshly warm, blow dried hair for 2 hours- ZERO curl.</li>
            <li>They come nicely packaged, but it&#x27;s not convenient to use them this way, because it is difficult to separate them, so you either have to pick out the ones you want before you get started, or just keep them more loosely packed somewhere else in order to grab as you go.</li>
            <li>Stick them in your hair, they stay by themselves, use both hands with your blow drier, and the open mesh of the rollers let you dry your hair pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, and I had no trouble with these falling out with normal activity.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning to use the bigger curlers to give more body than curls, you&#x27;ll likely need two packs as there are only 6 of the largest rollers.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than the dollar store or beauty supply rollers I bought in the past.  </li>
            <li>id probably buy hot rollers next time.</li>
            <li>You are better off using pins with them :-/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair most of the way (finger dry)</li>
            <li>They are okay but got tangled in my hair very easily and were painful to remove.</li>
            <li>I also tried using damp hair and a blow dryer, which also worked, mainly because these curlers have an above average breathing quality that allows air to pass through them easily.</li>
            <li>I took a good amount of time and used every curler in the package on my long &amp;#34;nearly dry&amp;#34; hair and left them in for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>These are not very hard to use if you have used velcro curlers before.</li>
            <li>and I really want something I can put in and let my hair dry on them while I get ready in the morning...</li>
            <li>I finally got some curls that were okay, but they didn&#x27;t last very long, and again, gave me some frizz</li>
            <li>If I wear these at my crown overnight, I&#x27;m guaranteed a full head of hair that never goes flat the next day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the two large sizes</li>
            <li>I combed each section first, then placed the roller near the hair root, then slowly pulled it toward the end of the hair as if I was combing my hair with the roller, and then kept gently pulling my hair to make sure it stayed straight while I wrapped  it tightly round the roller.  </li>
            <li>If I still had the long hair, I&#x27;d opt for hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t rolled my hair since Nixon was President, but these are not the brush rollers of old.</li>
            <li>My hair is just past my shoulder&#x27;s and pretty thin, so they went in great.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>But lately it was mostly frizzy and I couldn&#x27;t get it to look like anything but a hippie chick.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t wild about.  </li>
            <li>the smaller ones aren&#x27;t really usable.  </li>
            <li>and I had enough curlers to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>and maybe I took them out to early</li>
            <li>I could already see some soft curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a natural...</li>
            <li>frequent use is going to cause noticeable damage.  </li>
            <li>The green and yellow rollers provide more bounce.</li>
            <li>These curlers did help with volume, and after some more pruducts, I could possibly pull off that &#x27;messy, I meant my hair to look this way&#x27; style.</li>
            <li>Tried to partially dry hair first and then put them in to finish drying.</li>
            <li>Of course, the blow dry isn&#x27;t exactly non heat, but I feel likelow heat, high air, and a shorter dry time is a decent compromise on busy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I pulled out two single strands of hair during the process, but I think that&#x27;s pretty normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For 6$ it works fine, not worth sending back.</li>
            <li>I have a decent amount of hair, but due to having such fine strands, it can make my hair look flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>Part of it might be that I wrapped them loosely for the first try.  </li>
            <li>Part of it might be that I wrapped them loosely for the first try.  </li>
            <li>These are nice not too soft or too hard, very colorful hot pink, lime green, yellow, purple, and blue and a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>I apply a little spritz for body and in thirty minutes, I have full body in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is not really long, but I did buy a second set to get a few more of the sizes I like.</li>
            <li>personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving these over night because of the discomfort and the high chance of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really stay in place, and I have long hair.  </li>
            <li>These rollers are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is naturally curly, but lately I&#x27;ve wanted to wear it</li>
            <li>small sections, starting at the top of your head in the back, and lift each section at the root.  </li>
            <li>With thick coily hair- putting them in was nice and easy; with the help of Bobby pins, taking them down was a complete failure.</li>
            <li>I have long but fine hair, and I think these rollers worked a little TOO well</li>
            <li>Probably no faster than with other rollers that allow air to flow through, but I was surprised I could get dressed, makeup and have breakfast, and be just another 15-20 minutes away from ready to unroll.</li>
            <li>if you have naturally curly hair or tangle prone hair, I would try one area before committing, particularly if you&#x27;re considering wet to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VOLUME</li>
            <li>You do have to remove them carefully as not to pull hair.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put too much hair in each one, or take out partially wet, as they can get tangled and have to be pulled out.  </li>
            <li>These self gripping rollers hold a curl after using the curling iron (just long enough for the curl to set) and it doesn&#x27;t destroy the hair as much as hot rollers which can be heavy on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Last time I got the brush ones and they were fine except that they sometimes left my hair in a big mess.  </li>
            <li>I have very long straight hair that is somewhere in the middle thickness.</li>
            <li>I like to get ready and do other stuff in the morning while I have these on, so</li>
            <li>I have thick courser Asian hair, and I put these in after I dry my hair most of the way, leave them in the rest of the night and the take them out before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>Be careful by slow removing these rollers from your hair and you will be quite pleased with the curls and body.</li>
            <li>Perhaps experimentation and experience will fix this.&lt;br /&gt;However, the second day volume is generally calmer and practically perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pick your look - large rollers for natural bouncy waves or small rollers for tighter curls.</li>
            <li>If you have too soft and straight hair dont use small ones.</li>
            <li>I can put them in dry, just-washed hair and in less than 10 minutes they&#x27;ve given me smoother hair with more volume than I could hope for by styling with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for less than $7 and considering how much it would be to buy these individually</li>
            <li>These only take me about 3/4 hours until a complete dry.</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair was not long enough but after wearing these all day there was nothing different about it when I took them out.  </li>

            <li> Container keeps everything nice and tidy</li>
            <li> Surprisingly the rolled hair tolerates being slept on much better than when I let it curl on</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have yet to try these</li>
            <li> with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use duck clips to hold these in place though they probably would hold on their own, depending on your hair length &amp; texture.  </li>
            <li> They rolled up nicely and stayed with the help of a bobby pin.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to buy them and Rey them on my own.</li>
            <li> They are loving them.</li>
            <li> I have some experience with cosmetology, but I had never put curlers in my own hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order this kind..</li>
            <li> It is a nice assortment of sizes to share with someone.</li>
            <li> I was torn between a 3 or 4 star review and am being nice with 4.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for creating volume and giving your &#x27;do a nice, polished look with some OOMPH!</li>
            <li> Good strong Velcro, rollers stay in place without bobby pins.</li>
            <li> These are great for quick setting and drying.  </li>
            <li> Trying to grow out my hair and these rollers gave my hair body and were very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to pull off.</li>
            <li> Unroll and voila amazing volume :)</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how fast and easy they are to use, and the beautiful wave it gives your hair!</li>
            <li> Easy to put in my hair, they stay put and gives me a lot of body!</li>
            <li> I purchased separate duck bill hair clips since my hair is very fine and the self-grip rollers needed additional support.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used these velcro rollers and they have worked really great.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Helps my fine hair gain volume that stays!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice on your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These nice velcro rollers are easy to put in and take out.  </li>
            <li> These are kind of a nightmare for those of us with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Most of them stuck in her hair and it was a disaster getting them out.  </li>
            <li> And I am extremely pleased with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Make sure you unroll, and not pull them out?</li>
            <li> Love these rollers.</li>
            <li> Love that there are so many varied sizes to use on all lengths of hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had issues with holding styles for more than a couple hours</li>
            <li> The rollers gave me a smoother wavy look that I love.</li>
            <li> My hair likes this much better</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use them on my clients :)</li>
            <li> Ok grip.</li>
            <li> It could have a better grip.</li>
            <li> with body enhancing shampoo/conditioner (whichever is your favorite) - comb through conditioned hair while it sits&lt;br /&gt;-Once</li>
            <li> , I thought for sure</li>
            <li> Pick another option :)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m confident I will be nappy.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> l love these rollers.</li>
            <li> so I have purchased 2 more boxes.</li>
            <li> you use the biggest curler, I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than the gentlest of curl-ins at the ends.</li>
            <li> It looks like more of a blow out.</li>
            <li> They did grip to the hair for the most part</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were inexpensive and self gripping.</li>
            <li> I roll the top layer of my hair, heat them with a blow dryer, spray with hairspray, and then take them out after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Today I tried it one more time---dried my hair with a hair dryer to damp, put them in</li>
            <li> Stays in much better too.</li>
            <li> Result is volumized hair and a cute curl/slight wave at the end.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the Velcro would be able to hold all my hair</li>
            <li> Love not needing to use pins to hold the curler in the hair.  </li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love these rollers.</li>
            <li> Love them....</li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes my hair is smoother and has more body</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this rollers</li>
            <li> Would love to have 12 large-med and an appropriate size container for them.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, and they stay in even over night.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try these rollers out because they are self gripping.</li>
            <li> You can get a better price at Walmart</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because they work ok, but do not hold my hair like i was hoping.</li>
            <li> Love these curlers.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the fullness and bounce.</li>
            <li> Stay perfectly in place even with my super fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to gently unroll a smooth, beautiful curl</li>
            <li> grip is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I find the best results are when your hair is damp and for me I leave them in for 2 hours because my hair is so long, but</li>
            <li> They are easy to put in, stay without pinning, hair dries quickly, and they come in a nice variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> They did not stay in the hair well, and the curl was minimal at best.</li>
            <li> I am excited to use them more</li>
            <li> Full, lifted and shiny!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Convenient packaging - easy to pack up and store or keep</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get these things out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li> Adheres to hair easily, and pulls out just as easily.  </li>
            <li> Not so easy to take out</li>
            <li> The ones that I could get out without a lot of fuss didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair and my hair is easy to curl.</li>
            <li> They are fairly easy to put it and removal can be tricky but you just have to work at it.</li>
            <li> Even so, they were incredibly easy to use, and they seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, stays in place, and holds my hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put in, take out and store.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> my hair must be too fine ...</li>
            <li> my super fine hair, I thought for sure</li>
            <li> They went in my hair fine...</li>
            <li> They did not come out fine.</li>
            <li> If you have shorter hair maybe these work or if you don&#x27;t have fine hair?</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have fine, slippery hair.  </li>
            <li> I also have fine, sparse hair with thinning areas around the crown.</li>
            <li> And smooth curls?</li>
            <li> When my hair is damp, I find it doesn&#x27;t come out as smooth</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
            <li> I have relatively short hair (reaching just below my chin) and these work great.</li>
            <li> These rollers are fantastic.</li>
            <li> fantastic and save your hair from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just a great set of various size rollers.  </li>
            <li> The curls look shiny and smooth, and feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is no longer available in our area so purchased for a friend.  </li>
            <li> We are retired now and my husband is willing to wait for me to set and dry my hair, these work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I love them, They travel well, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li> The hair must be absolutely dry when you remove them, or you&#x27;ll pull out all the beautiful curl you just waited for.  </li>
            <li> I love these rollers, although I could have done with 2 sets for a few more of some of the rollers--I picked up another pack of some of the medium size at Sally&#x27;s but they won&#x27;t store as nicely as this!</li>
            <li> and it was super easy.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I bought a second set since I loved them so much and wanted more of the biggest roller!</li>
            <li> my super fine hair</li>
            <li> Pretty sure once I figure out how to correctly roll my hair I will like these.</li>
            <li> As long as you know how to use these type of rollers, you will be happy with them.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or frizzy hair, it&#x27;s better to straighten the hair first.  </li>
            <li> I thought since there were so many good reviews that maybe those people just had not put them in carefully.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of rollers I was originally looking for &amp; up &amp; bought the other kind..</li>
            <li> I think the combing (with roller; it helps re-straighten the hair)  and the pulling (keeps the hair stay straight) are very important.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great solution for me as someone who frequently showers at night and wants a quick style in the morning.</li>
            <li> I suppose if I had more time, they may have worked better because my hair would have been more dry.</li>
            <li> I tried again with just the large ones on the ends, and more tangles and no curls.</li>
            <li> , I decided I&#x27;d try out hair rollers for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers to add volume and try to make my hair look more full without using too much heat/wear/tear.</li>
            <li> that are much wider, and therefore hold much more hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set because they were reasonably priced but probably a better quality than the dollar-store version I had used before.</li>
            <li> Also has a nice variety of sizes and enough of the big ones to work great with my hair.</li>
            <li> Love my new rollers !</li>
            <li> The curls did not stay and came out super frizzy.</li>
            <li> you need order more than one pack if you need more than 5 rollers of the same size....</li>
            <li> I use the whole pack on my head, minus the largest curlers, and I get great volume and a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> They are great for damp hair, or to hold your hair after you use a round brush and blow dryer, or curling iron (put hair on the Conair Self-Grip Rollers until hair is cool, and spray with your favourite hairspray).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a TON of tangles and was really concerned while it was setting, but to my surprise they came out easily with no tangles or snags.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a TON of tangles and was really concerned while it was setting, but to my surprise they came out easily with no tangles or snags.  </li>
            <li> I use large bobby pins and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the different look I get and the easy use!</li>
            <li> I can see how these curlers would be great for people with some curl already whose hair is a little bit course.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> Its worth it to pay the extra money for a nice set like this.  </li>
            <li> I figured I would have more luck as an adult.  </li>
            <li> Also I would definitely use hair pins with these which kind of defeats the purpose of them being Velcro.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers hoping to give my naturally curly hair a more refined wavy look.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and these work great for me!  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s enough for a normal person&#x27;s head either to be honest) and weren&#x27;t easy to keep in.</li>
            <li> I used a Youtube tutorial that recommended having dry hair, then running each strand through a straightener first to warm and smooth the strand and to achieve volume but not curl.</li>
            <li> I used them right after received the package this afternoon.</li>
            <li> LOVE these, work super well (especially on damp hair) and leave longlasting curls even without hairspray.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these out since they looked like they would be gentle on the hair since they weren&#x27;t hot rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY soft and fine</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to use immediately after curling my hair to make it last longer and become tighter...that way when I flip my hair and scrunch my curls with my hand and do one comb over, my curls are super bouncy and the curls die to nice waves over a few hours depending on the size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often difficult to find an assortment of sizes--these are great, and the cost is very reasonable for so many curlers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are more than enough curlers in this kit.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these, but they&#x27;re just too short.  </li>
            <li> It never occurred to me that I should check both the width and the diameter, but evidently I should have.  </li>
            <li> Even if I&#x27;d known that, the item description doesn&#x27;t include the width (forgive me if I missed it, but I just looked again and still don&#x27;t see it - so just be aware).  </li>
            <li> Also, in my opinion, they include too many tiny rollers - who uses those anymore???  </li>
            <li> First, these are a snap to put in.</li>
            <li> I made sure my hair as well brushed with no tangles to avoid this problem</li>
            <li> The smaller curlers add much more curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;m quite enjoying having these and finally having a practical non-heat routine!</li>
            <li> My hair definitely has more volume.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Can i use whit a hot dryer?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the exact look</li>
            <li> Went many years without using these and back to using them again.  </li>
            <li> Seem to have lost so many different sizes and now need those sizes.  </li>
            <li> so maybe this would be better and girls with short hair.</li>
            <li> They are my first rollers</li>
            <li> they were exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> I use these regularly and like using them better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had more of the bigger and medium sizes in the case.</li>
            <li> I also used my hair dryer on HOT for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> With some practice, I can see this giving me exactly the results I&#x27;m after without a lot of fuss or cost.</li>
            <li> These rollers really do grip without bobby pins or clips!  </li>
            <li> They hold securely without clips and make it easy to do a fast curl and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, brand new unopened set, and</li>
            <li> A little styling spray put them in put a quick hair dryer over your head and voila!!!</li>
            <li> On the positive side, my hair does stick to them well.  </li>
            <li> Wrapping the hair was easy enough, but removing the hair was beastly - tangly and hurty.  </li>
            <li> The big con, these are not hard to get stuck in your hair, I have literally ripped them out way more than comman sense allow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with the zippered case they came in as this will be helpful travelling to a wedding this summer -- which is why I am breaking down and styling my old hippie hair to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I have straight fine asian hair, shoulder length, and median volume.</li>
            <li> The large pink rollers create looser fuller curls, so I use those on the top 1/3 of my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go for all-out body since it was my first try, but my hair has a really nice shape that I couldn&#x27;t get unless I worked with a blow-dryer and round brush for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Lots of sizes from tiny to very large; reasonably priced; work as described although a clip does add a bit of stability while blow drying your hair; and quick delivery with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> much like you&#x27;d imagine putting velcro in your hair would be.</li>
            <li> straight so looking for something that makes it fuller and wavy, not curly.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy another set to get more pink.</li>
            <li> They slip out of your hair when your ready and your done and have body/curls.</li>
            <li> So I put in a load of laundry in and checked my email, and then was ready to unroll.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> make sure you have bobby pins around, sometimes its harder for them to stay put.</li>
            <li> These rollers really do stay in your hair</li>
            <li> To put these in, I rolled a piece of hair up, then pressed it gently into the roller to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> When pulling them out, put your fingers through the middle of the roller and lightly pull as it unwinds.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier if I use the clips than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  </li>
            <li> They got so tangled up in her hair that I really thought I was going to have to cut her hair to get them out.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like the rollers give me too much volume at the roots, which often leads to halo frizzies and a somewhat frazzled looking 80s pop star.</li>
            <li> I have fine long highlighted blonde hair that breaks easily</li>
            <li> These rollers are so gentle on my hair but they also grip really well.  </li>
            <li> Plus they nest really well and are compact.</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s stick straight).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Will buy the whole package again.  </li>
            <li> and they are reasonably durable feeling, even though they aren&#x27;t lined with metal.</li>
            <li> They also save my hair from the heat of a straight iron.</li>
            <li> on the days I don&#x27;t, after I shower I roll my hair while I am getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have sleek, straight hair I could see how these might work.</li>
            <li> THEY REALLY WORK AND STAY IN.  </li>
            <li> like this video for a velcro roller how to as I had never used them prior to this purchase (warm up the hair strands with a curling iron prior to rolling):&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool, especially if you travel.  </li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and heathy and I made sure not to let the hair cross from one roller to the other</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any major snagging or pulling issues, though the smaller rollers do need to be taken out a bit more</li>
            <li> Worked ok first few times, but over time, and I use them every day..</li>
            <li> I use all the different sizes and it gives me a clean uniform curl.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a few more of the biggest and second biggest sizes, but that&#x27;s kind of just personal preference of the size</li>
            <li> Then use the hair dryer on a cool setting after the Conair rollers are in place to get a lasting set of curly hair.  </li>
            <li> In both cases there was not a curl that looked ok, the velcro really didn&#x27;t hold the curlers in place but made a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> think the key to put the rollers on properly is to make sure your hair is straight when you put them on and make sure to wrap the hair around the roller tightly.  </li>
            <li> hair is 95% dry, blow-dry with head upright to smooth out any fly-aways</li>
            <li> Make sure you are starting with the last roller you put in and working backwards.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing is, I wish they had more of the bigger sizes.  </li>
            <li> I am hair-challenged (I&#x27;m not very good at styling my own hair).</li>
            <li> Easy to work with even for a 4 and 7 year old on a mannequin head with long hear.  </li>
            <li> I shower, put in the rollers up high on my head (with no product) and sleep in them.</li>
            <li> I am just very discouraged because not enough hair can be rolled on each roller, and so I need to use even more rollers for my thick hair, and my bonnet doesn&#x27;t fit over them</li>
            <li> used one hand to unroll the roller off the hair gently while used the other to secure the root of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair - have to be careful rolling hair up to avoid snags removing them</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, it used to be very thick, but know it has thin bed a bit, but it still looks full with a great cut.</li>
            <li> If you properly use these and don&#x27;t take too wide of a section, they are very easy to remove with no pain.</li>
            <li> There really are not enough in the pack to cover my whole head and did not have the time or patience to spend the whole day waiting for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Tried a couple of variations to see if I would work something</li>
            <li> So far, they really stay in.</li>
            <li> Second, the hair drys pretty fast with these.</li>
            <li> I could have achieved a better result with a blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> They have a good variety of sizes, but what I really need (with medium length hair) are the two big sizes, with my hair being thick</li>
            <li> They are lightweight, and don&#x27;t weigh down your head like hot rollers will when you have a head full of them.  </li>
            <li> it can get tAngeles easily and get messy and loose the curl very quickly bc of this</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and am able to do my whole head with only one pack.</li>
            <li> They easily stay in with one or two bobby pins to hold down in place.</li>
            <li> For some reason in CT where I live I can&#x27;t find them in any</li>
            <li> have fine hair and an average amount of it.</li>
            <li> you could easily do an hour or less.</li>
            <li> I left them in my freshly warm, blow dried hair for 2 hours- ZERO curl.</li>
            <li> They come nicely packaged, but it&#x27;s not convenient to use them this way, because it is difficult to separate them, so you either have to pick out the ones you want before you get started, or just keep them more loosely packed somewhere else in order to grab as you go.</li>
            <li> Stick them in your hair, they stay by themselves, use both hands with your blow drier, and the open mesh of the rollers let you dry your hair pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, and I had no trouble with these falling out with normal activity.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning to use the bigger curlers to give more body than curls, you&#x27;ll likely need two packs as there are only 6 of the largest rollers.  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than the dollar store or beauty supply rollers I bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> id probably buy hot rollers next time.</li>
            <li> You are better off using pins with them :-/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair most of the way (finger dry)</li>
            <li> They are okay but got tangled in my hair very easily and were painful to remove.</li>
            <li> I also tried using damp hair and a blow dryer, which also worked, mainly because these curlers have an above average breathing quality that allows air to pass through them easily.</li>
            <li> I took a good amount of time and used every curler in the package on my long &amp;#34;nearly dry&amp;#34; hair and left them in for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> These are not very hard to use if you have used velcro curlers before.</li>
            <li> and I really want something I can put in and let my hair dry on them while I get ready in the morning...</li>
            <li> I finally got some curls that were okay, but they didn&#x27;t last very long, and again, gave me some frizz</li>
            <li> If I wear these at my crown overnight, I&#x27;m guaranteed a full head of hair that never goes flat the next day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the two large sizes</li>
            <li> I combed each section first, then placed the roller near the hair root, then slowly pulled it toward the end of the hair as if I was combing my hair with the roller, and then kept gently pulling my hair to make sure it stayed straight while I wrapped  it tightly round the roller.  </li>
            <li> If I still had the long hair, I&#x27;d opt for hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t rolled my hair since Nixon was President, but these are not the brush rollers of old.</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulder&#x27;s and pretty thin, so they went in great.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> But lately it was mostly frizzy and I couldn&#x27;t get it to look like anything but a hippie chick.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t wild about.  </li>
            <li> the smaller ones aren&#x27;t really usable.  </li>
            <li> and I had enough curlers to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> and maybe I took them out to early</li>
            <li> I could already see some soft curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a natural...</li>
            <li> frequent use is going to cause noticeable damage.  </li>
            <li> The green and yellow rollers provide more bounce.</li>
            <li> These curlers did help with volume, and after some more pruducts, I could possibly pull off that &#x27;messy, I meant my hair to look this way&#x27; style.</li>
            <li> Tried to partially dry hair first and then put them in to finish drying.</li>
            <li> Of course, the blow dry isn&#x27;t exactly non heat, but I feel likelow heat, high air, and a shorter dry time is a decent compromise on busy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I pulled out two single strands of hair during the process, but I think that&#x27;s pretty normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For 6$ it works fine, not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> I have a decent amount of hair, but due to having such fine strands, it can make my hair look flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> Part of it might be that I wrapped them loosely for the first try.  </li>
            <li> Part of it might be that I wrapped them loosely for the first try.  </li>
            <li> These are nice not too soft or too hard, very colorful hot pink, lime green, yellow, purple, and blue and a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I apply a little spritz for body and in thirty minutes, I have full body in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is not really long, but I did buy a second set to get a few more of the sizes I like.</li>
            <li> personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving these over night because of the discomfort and the high chance of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really stay in place, and I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> These rollers are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is naturally curly, but lately I&#x27;ve wanted to wear it</li>
            <li> small sections, starting at the top of your head in the back, and lift each section at the root.  </li>
            <li> With thick coily hair- putting them in was nice and easy; with the help of Bobby pins, taking them down was a complete failure.</li>
            <li> I have long but fine hair, and I think these rollers worked a little TOO well</li>
            <li> Probably no faster than with other rollers that allow air to flow through, but I was surprised I could get dressed, makeup and have breakfast, and be just another 15-20 minutes away from ready to unroll.</li>
            <li> if you have naturally curly hair or tangle prone hair, I would try one area before committing, particularly if you&#x27;re considering wet to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VOLUME</li>
            <li> You do have to remove them carefully as not to pull hair.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put too much hair in each one, or take out partially wet, as they can get tangled and have to be pulled out.  </li>
            <li> These self gripping rollers hold a curl after using the curling iron (just long enough for the curl to set) and it doesn&#x27;t destroy the hair as much as hot rollers which can be heavy on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Last time I got the brush ones and they were fine except that they sometimes left my hair in a big mess.  </li>
            <li> I have very long straight hair that is somewhere in the middle thickness.</li>
            <li> I like to get ready and do other stuff in the morning while I have these on, so</li>
            <li> I have thick courser Asian hair, and I put these in after I dry my hair most of the way, leave them in the rest of the night and the take them out before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Be careful by slow removing these rollers from your hair and you will be quite pleased with the curls and body.</li>
            <li> Perhaps experimentation and experience will fix this.&lt;br /&gt;However, the second day volume is generally calmer and practically perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pick your look - large rollers for natural bouncy waves or small rollers for tighter curls.</li>
            <li> If you have too soft and straight hair dont use small ones.</li>
            <li> I can put them in dry, just-washed hair and in less than 10 minutes they&#x27;ve given me smoother hair with more volume than I could hope for by styling with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for less than $7 and considering how much it would be to buy these individually</li>
            <li> These only take me about 3/4 hours until a complete dry.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair was not long enough but after wearing these all day there was nothing different about it when I took them out.  </li>
            <li> I used them this morning, and it barely took any time, and my hair has the nicest shape it&#x27;s had in a long time!  </li>
            <li> It took me nearly 45 minutes to get them out as they grabbed other hair and tangled up.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to give my hair a little volume and a sexy wave with little effort and little to no heat.</li>
            <li> I put them in my slightly damp hair, spritz some volume spray on top, and then blow dry while alternative hot and cold until dry.  </li>
            <li> They add a noticeable volume to my otherwise flat hair.</li>
            <li> I used this time to flat iron the lowest layer of my hair, which I didn&#x27;t roll up.  </li>
            <li> As I have long hair, I use the biggest, and will buy another set to have enough to cover my head.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just above shoulder length in a long bob.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is very long, so I had to section it into smaller parts, and secured it with bobby pins.</li>
            <li> The only thing is your hair has to be dry before you put them in</li>
            <li> My hair was dry,  I used Folicure thickening mousse before put on the rollers, and took them off after only 5 mins.  </li>
            <li> The plastic case this came in is NOT large enough to store the roller&#x27;s and use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I find the single set is enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> Currently, the price for 2 packs is more expensive than for one so not currently worth it, but keep an eye out.  </li>
            <li> I just got these last week, and I&#x27;ve already used them several times, both as dry and as wet to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair for about 5 minutes and while it is still a bit damp, spray it with blo-dry spray (currently like Suave brand) and then set with these rollers and blow dry again.  </li>
            <li> You will spend too long trying to get them out</li>
            <li> I also think the smaller ones are harder to roll out of my hair</li>
            <li> The storage case is sturdy and should stand up to long term storage.</li>
            <li> If you value your long hair you might want to rethink this item.</li>
            <li> They did show a lady with long hair on the front of the packaging after all.</li>
            <li> These are a NIGHTMARE for long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it wont stay in place unless I use clips.</li>
            <li> I bought these not long before I cut my long hair and only had the occasion to use a few times.  </li>
            <li> Spray with a little bit of hairspray at the root and run a round brush through it while holding it straight up from your head to line the strands upright.  </li>
            <li> I love the assortment but confess that the little bitty rollers are pretty worthless for my type of hair style (longish loose curls with body curls).  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair too</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, blow it fairly dry and then put in the rollers.</li>
            <li> I prefer having dry hair when I use them.</li>
            <li> They stay on my head as I walk around and they also stay as I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> apply when my hair is damp, hold with a Bobby pin, and depending on the time I have, either air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li> If my hair is too dry, it gets snarled in the velcro.  </li>
            <li> The morning&#x27;s I wash, I dry my hair</li>
            <li> (my hair is now 98% dry).  </li>
            <li> When I took them out in the morning, there wasn&#x27;t a single curl or wave.</li>
            <li> Hot rollers at times, but my hair usually loses the fullness after half a day.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the loose strands get tangled and it&#x27;s a pain to get the roller out and causes a lot of hair</li>
            <li> Blow-dry for a moment to heat hair, then starting at the ends, loosely wrap your hair around the roller and roll down to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-Leave</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too wet, it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> Also the set does not include big rolles - only medium and small</li>
            <li> Works on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Fourth, I&#x27;ve always had to wash my hair every day because it would be a mess after sleeping.</li>
            <li> Holy Moses, I thought I would have to cut it out, it was such a snarled mess.  </li>
            <li> My coarse, Asian hair has a hard time keeping a hold.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t sell the individual sizes separately, but the price of this product was reasonable</li>
            <li> It definitely requires some delicate techniques and patience to use them properly (watching youtube tutorial helps a lot).  </li>
            <li> I would put them in wet hair and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;sometimes</li>
            <li> They worked as expected and had no quality issues.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected</li>
            <li> Not much you can say about Velcro Rollers...</li>
            <li> I was SO careful putting them in too.</li>
            <li> Even as careful as we were trying to get these out of my hair they still damaged it.</li>
            <li> However, they are exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a big fluffy afro which was not what I was going for.  </li>
            <li> Took half as long to roll up my hair as I expected.</li>
            <li> hair is moderately dry, take out towel, and blow-dry upside down.  </li>
            <li> These do hold well in my straight, grey hair that has a few unruly bits, but I&#x27;ve never experienced any breakage from these (or any velcro) rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were a mess to get in and a mess to get out and didn&#x27;t make a very big difference.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not fighting a dry flyaway mess.</li>
            <li> with the medium rollers, though (green and yellow in my case), I&#x27;ve found that the curls tend to fall out in about half an hour — about the time it takes for the crown volume to reduce to acceptable levels.&lt;br /&gt;Again this could be just my hair and texture.</li>
            <li> I use the larger Pink ones and the neon green only (the rest are a little small).</li>
            <li> The next day it looks like I blow dried my hair!  </li>
            <li> i use the small ones to make curls and the big ones to make waves i like it alot like that i don&#x27;t have to use heat</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li> Catagorized as Velcro rollers - Not described as such on the package, not sure they are, look like brush rollers.</li>
            <li> Not exactly rocket science, these rollers work as you would expect.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours tried to blow dry -This</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and put a few of these on the crown of my head with no clips or pins needed.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not for people with thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that the curl wasn&#x27;t even that good</li>
            <li> out of the shower, comb hair with head upside down, add volumizing mousse, and wrap in a towel.  </li>
            <li> they get stuck in your hair, and when you finally get them out, instead of soft pretty curls as promised, you have frizzy hair that looks horrible.</li>
            <li> Then I let them sit for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half to set.</li>
            <li> This uses a lot less heat and is way less labor intensive.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> personally don&#x27;t mind the curls falling out though, as it gives the hair less subtle blow-out style waves at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER&lt;</li>
            <li> The easiest and less damaging way to style your hair.</li>
            <li> Also after several uses they start to take a terrible toll on fine hair which is rough and frizzy on about the bottom 3 inches.</li>
            <li> But my hair was left both frizzy and stringy, which is not a good combination</li>
            <li> I got a frizzy mess instead.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick and never ever tangles.</li>
            <li> You have to put the rollers really tight on your head for them to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I think this is due to my method of placement (very tightly rolled under) and the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly I think double damage was done to my hair since I had to dry and iron to try and correct the mess it made of my hair.</li>
            <li> use a brush to separate sections, spray a little Kenra Styling spray and roll it up.</li>
            <li> On a weekend day, I&#x27;m going to try to wrap them a little tighter to get a bit of curl and see how it goes.ng backwards.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> On a weekend day, I&#x27;m going to try to wrap them a little tighter to get a bit of curl and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> no joy after several hours still damp and not curled.  </li>
            <li> (I think they are green).  </li>
            <li> but alas it ended up a total disaster.</li>
            <li> , did some things around the house, dried it again with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> -- they gripped my hair so firmly that I practically had to tear them out, since they would not unroll.</li>
            <li> Missing two of the Green rollers, some of rollers were unraveling.</li>
            <li> I just air dried my hair and took them off after 1.5 hours</li>
            <li> I got glamorous soft curls like those of Victoria&#x27;s Secret runaway models!  </li>
            <li> Using hair mask before and after using the rollers can also protect the hair from harsh styling material and reduce the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Just leave them in overnight (or for a few hours)</li>
            <li> cause I now feel like I just wasted my money and time....</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my daughter&#x27;s waist-length hair to help tame it a little bit and help with tangling.  </li>
            <li> My hair goes a bit down past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It does not need clips to stay put however you&#x27;ll need to roll up small sections of hair; otherwise roll will come undone slightly from the roots.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be frustrated if you mess up the first a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, it&#x27;ll be very difficult to sleep at night with these rollers on your head, as they are pretty hard and the velcro will poke your scalp when you lie down.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thicker (stronger) or coarser, they might work, but on my delicate hair, the results were not worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> She wanted all small ones but this was not available.  </li>
            <li> but they gave it very little volume.</li>
            <li> I am a lazy person when it comes to styling hair.</li>
            <li> After putting in my usual post shower products (oil, leave in conditioner AND a frizz serum)</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the product or just user error.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try them again simply because they were uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these a few ways and have received tons of compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> Sometimes this is a pain, but usually I make do.</li>
            <li> , I have used them in the past..</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because I threw out a dozen rollers (the small ones I&#x27;ll never use).</li>
            <li> ones because I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> I thought these would work because every other method of curling and volumizing my hair usually don&#x27;t work, alas</li>
            <li> I have four rollers that someone gave me (brand not marked on them unfortunately)</li>
            <li> They get stuck in long hair and are difficult to get out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have curly hair to begin with but its frizzy and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I popped these in my hair hoping to give it at least some volume and a bit of organized curl.</li>
            <li> One day I made the mistake of using a couple sections that were too thick and when your hair starts going over the edges of the roller you will run into problems removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not work, maybe because my hair is too thick?</li>
            <li> and I had such bad results.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience.</li>
            <li> Also these curlers were SO hard to get out!</li>
            <li> Also, I was using the biggest size, because I&#x27;m frankly just a little bit scared of how badly the small ones would snarl in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very, very thick and long-ish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m admittedly not dexterous, but the process and result was not great.  </li>
            <li> Arrived with a broken zipper.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thin</li>
            <li> saw they used velcro rollers on Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion show models all the time.  </li>
            <li> The last two curlers took the longest to remove and I contemplated just cutting it out as the tangling was so bad.  </li>
            <li> The negative review about these being painful should be considered with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> so t will look like a fake blowout</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t used them, I&#x27;ve been warned that the smallest curlers may cause snarling and tanglings, so if that&#x27;s a worry, I&#x27;d be wary of them.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I am lame with a hair dryer</li>
            <li> Unable to sleep with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to use these but horrible for my long hair.</li>
            <li> but they still stuck like crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Removal was nearly impossible.  </li>
            <li> They pull out my hair when I unroll them which is painful.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a painful, and my hair didn&#x27;t fall.</li>
            <li> They were painful because they got tangled up with my hair and instead of curls</li>
            <li> all:-(</li>
            <li> I thought I should cut my hair coz one of were so stuck it was not coming out :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS PRODUCT IT PULLS MY HAIR OUT AND DON&#x27;T CURL NOTHING ZIP, NADA.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, your hair is probably going to get tangled and stuck on the roller, and it will be very painful when take it</li>
            <li> -they tangled terrible!!</li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> Worst mistake ever!</li>
            <li> this product was absolutely HORRIBLE.</li>

            <li> Gets tangled in the hair and ends up pulling it out rather than leaving nice curls</li>
            <li> These suck. I left them in my freshly warm, blow dried hair for 2 hours- ZERO curl.</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly! Trying to grow out my hair and these rollers gave my hair body and were very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice quality but they don&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> My wife bought these to curl her hair.  She followed the instructions on how to use them and they didn&#x27;t work.  Most of them stuck in her hair and it was a disaster getting them out.  The end result was not curly hair, it was frizzy and knotted from some of the curlers getting stuck.</li>
            <li> I bought these not long before I cut my long hair and only had the occasion to use a few times.  After my blow-out shop used these in my hair, I loved the look and decided to try it out.  I&#x27;m admittedly not dexterous, but the process and result was not great.  Wrapping the hair was easy enough, but removing the hair was beastly - tangly and hurty.  The hair must be absolutely dry when you remove them, or you&#x27;ll pull out all the beautiful curl you just waited for.  If I still had the long hair, I&#x27;d opt for hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t figure out how to use these things, especially taking them out. They just end up caught in my hair much like you&#x27;d imagine putting velcro in your hair would be. I&#x27;ll probably give them to someone who has thinner hair and who can figure out how to use them properly.</li>
            <li> A modified bob cut is perfect for me, but it does require some upkeep. I prefer my hair to have a lot if body. I have fine hair, it used to be very thick, but know it has thin bed a bit, but it still looks full with a great cut. I have the perfect stylist who spends a great deal of time with each cut, and this particular situ,e fits me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to provide the fullness I like, I use rollers. Hot rollers at times, but my hair usually loses the fullness after half a day. I have found that self grip rollers are perfect. This kit requires no pins or clips. There are 31 rollers in a zip pack. The large pink rollers create looser fuller curls, so I use those on the top 1/3 of my hair. The green and yellow rollers provide more bounce. I use them on the second 1/3 of my hair, and then use the yellow rollers on the bottom row. There are more than enough curlers in this kit. I wash my hair, blow it fairly dry and then put in the rollers. I apply a little spritz for body and in thirty minutes, I have full body in my hair. This lasts all day. And I am extremely pleased with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 12-18-14</li>
            <li> Nice gift for hairdressor</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes, great quality, right price, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Not for people with thick coarse hair.  You will spend too long trying to get them out</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need the bigger ones. Wish I could get the two smaller ones in a package.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Stays in hair well.</li>
            <li> I am a lazy person when it comes to styling hair. I have fine hair that is naturally curly, but lately I&#x27;ve wanted to wear it straight so looking for something that makes it fuller and wavy, not curly. These are amazingly cheap, but the best velcro (self roller non heated) I&#x27;ve ever used. I dry my hair most of the way (finger dry) use a brush to separate sections, spray a little Kenra Styling spray and roll it up. I then use my blow dryer for about two minutes over all of the rollers and let it set for a couple of minutes before I take out. I have gotten compliments on my hair every day I use these. I use the larger Pink ones and the neon green only (the rest are a little small). I am going to buy another set to get more pink. I also think the smaller ones are harder to roll out of my hair (you never want to PULL).&lt;br /&gt;One thing I just realized. I guess the colors can vary per package.</li>
            <li> These hurt when you pull them out, and leave my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> These curlers are great - they stick in your hair and don&#x27;t get stuck.  I wash my hair, pop them in and let my hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;Take them out and brush my hair and I am good to go.  For some reason in CT where I live I can&#x27;t find them in any&lt;br /&gt;of the stores.  I am so glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived with a broken zipper.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and stay in place.  Pick your look - large rollers for natural bouncy waves or small rollers for tighter curls.</li>
            <li> Worked ok first few times, but over time, and I use them every day.. my hair became a frizz ball.  I would put them in wet hair and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;sometimes I would use the hair dryer bonnet, but frizzzzzzyyy!</li>
            <li> fantastic price, excellent product, very easy to use</li>
            <li> I love these rollers, although I could have done with 2 sets for a few more of some of the rollers--I picked up another pack of some of the medium size at Sally&#x27;s but they won&#x27;t store as nicely as this! These do hold well in my straight, grey hair that has a few unruly bits, but I&#x27;ve never experienced any breakage from these (or any velcro) rollers. Make sure you unroll, and not pull them out? They are great for damp hair, or to hold your hair after you use a round brush and blow dryer, or curling iron (put hair on the Conair Self-Grip Rollers until hair is cool, and spray with your favourite hairspray). There are many good videos on YouTube about velcro rollers, so you&#x27;ll know why I recommend this easy-to-store set.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers. Easy to put in my hair, they stay put and gives me a lot of body! I bought a second set since I loved them so much and wanted more of the biggest roller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to use these but horrible for my long hair. There really are not enough in the pack to cover my whole head and did not have the time or patience to spend the whole day waiting for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Tried a couple of variations to see if I would work something out- 1. After a few hours tried to blow dry -This did worked only on the root area but the rest was damp and tangled from the velco.  2. Tried to partially dry hair first and then put them in to finish drying. -Again no joy after several hours still damp and not curled.  In both cases there was not a curl that looked ok, the velcro really didn&#x27;t hold the curlers in place but made a frizzy mess.  Sadly I think double damage was done to my hair since I had to dry and iron to try and correct the mess it made of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they&#x27;d be a great alternative to heat styling. I have curly hair to begin with but its frizzy and hard to manage. After putting in my usual post shower products (oil, leave in conditioner AND a frizz serum) I popped these in my hair hoping to give it at least some volume and a bit of organized curl. Now my hair is very long, so I had to section it into smaller parts, and secured it with bobby pins. I STILL had problems getting these things out of my hair. And smooth curls? HA! Try frizzy, sort of wavy hair. These curlers did help with volume, and after some more pruducts, I could possibly pull off that &#x27;messy, I meant my hair to look this way&#x27; style. All in all, just not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I love these! I use all the different sizes and it gives me a clean uniform curl. Very easy to use</li>
            <li> OMG, I love these! I haven&#x27;t rolled my hair since Nixon was President, but these are not the brush rollers of old. They are easy to put in, stay without pinning, hair dries quickly, and they come in a nice variety of sizes. My hair is not really long, but I did buy a second set to get a few more of the sizes I like. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t sell the individual sizes separately, but the price of this product was reasonable so I didn&#x27;t mind buying another set. I am amazed at how fast and easy they are to use, and the beautiful wave it gives your hair!</li>
            <li> These self gripping rollers hold a curl after using the curling iron (just long enough for the curl to set) and it doesn&#x27;t destroy the hair as much as hot rollers which can be heavy on the hair.  Then use the hair dryer on a cool setting after the Conair rollers are in place to get a lasting set of curly hair.  Love that there are so many varied sizes to use on all lengths of hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the product or just user error. My hair is just past my shoulder&#x27;s and pretty thin, so they went in great. However I had to have my husband help me take them out -they tangled terrible!! I tried again with just the large ones on the ends, and more tangles and no curls. I will be giving these away.</li>
            <li> Love these things!  Stick them in your hair, they stay by themselves, use both hands with your blow drier, and the open mesh of the rollers let you dry your hair pretty quickly.  They slip out of your hair when your ready and your done and have body/curls.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these, but they&#x27;re just too short.  I have four rollers that someone gave me (brand not marked on them unfortunately) that are much wider, and therefore hold much more hair.  It never occurred to me that I should check both the width and the diameter, but evidently I should have.  Even if I&#x27;d known that, the item description doesn&#x27;t include the width (forgive me if I missed it, but I just looked again and still don&#x27;t see it - so just be aware).  Also, in my opinion, they include too many tiny rollers - who uses those anymore???  On the positive side, my hair does stick to them well.  I am just very discouraged because not enough hair can be rolled on each roller, and so I need to use even more rollers for my thick hair, and my bonnet doesn&#x27;t fit over them all:-(</li>
            <li> Lots of sizes from tiny to very large; reasonably priced; work as described although a clip does add a bit of stability while blow drying your hair; and quick delivery with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> You have to put the rollers really tight on your head for them to stay in place. I would never recommend thing product to anyone.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Good strong Velcro, rollers stay in place without bobby pins. Container keeps everything nice and tidy</li>
            <li> Adds volume and big curls. Easy to use.  I prefer having dry hair when I use them. When my hair is damp, I find it doesn&#x27;t come out as smooth</li>
            <li> They hold securely without clips and make it easy to do a fast curl and blow dry.  The storage case is sturdy and should stand up to long term storage.</li>
            <li> The negative review about these being painful should be considered with a grain of salt. If you properly use these and don&#x27;t take too wide of a section, they are very easy to remove with no pain. One day I made the mistake of using a couple sections that were too thick and when your hair starts going over the edges of the roller you will run into problems removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great solution for me as someone who frequently showers at night and wants a quick style in the morning. I shower, put in the rollers up high on my head (with no product) and sleep in them. I wake up, take them out and have volume all day. My hair is really thin and I&#x27;ve had issues with holding styles for more than a couple hours so this is really impressive to me.</li>
            <li> Wow. I haven&#x27;t curled my hair for years, but wanted a style I could only do with rollers, so after messing around for weeks, I decided I&#x27;d try out hair rollers for a special occasion. First, these are a snap to put in. Nothing like the rollers and stick pins from years ago. Took half as long to roll up my hair as I expected. Second, the hair drys pretty fast with these. Probably no faster than with other rollers that allow air to flow through, but I was surprised I could get dressed, makeup and have breakfast, and be just another 15-20 minutes away from ready to unroll. So I put in a load of laundry in and checked my email, and then was ready to unroll. Third, I have curly hair and have always worn it curly. But lately it was mostly frizzy and I couldn&#x27;t get it to look like anything but a hippie chick. The rollers gave me a smoother wavy look that I love. Fourth, I&#x27;ve always had to wash my hair every day because it would be a mess after sleeping. Now, I am curling twice a week, and washing my hair just twice a week. Surprisingly the rolled hair tolerates being slept on much better than when I let it curl on it&#x27;s own. I comb it out and I&#x27;m ready to go. My hair likes this much better and I&#x27;m not fighting a dry flyaway mess.</li>
            <li> Convenient packaging - easy to pack up and store or keep contained for travel.</li>
            <li> LOVE these, work super well (especially on damp hair) and leave longlasting curls even without hairspray. Would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;One note: make sure you have bobby pins around, sometimes its harder for them to stay put.</li>
            <li> my hair must be too fine ... they get stuck and then the curls don&#x27;t stay in since i have to yank them out of my hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers really do stay in your hair (mine is quite short) without clips. They are easy to handle and the best ones I have used. I am really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great but they can pull your hair out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar rollers before. They stay put and you don&#x27;t need any hair pins to hold them on to your hair.</li>
            <li> I like these. They&#x27;re soft and easy to use. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they don&#x27;t come with pins to hold them in place. I use large bobby pins and it seems to work just fine. That&#x27;s my only complaint. Otherwise they are great.</li>
            <li> They are okay but got tangled in my hair very easily and were painful to remove. I suppose if I had more time, they may have worked better because my hair would have been more dry. I prefer the sponge rollers.</li>
            <li> These are nice not too soft or too hard, very colorful hot pink, lime green, yellow, purple, and blue and a variety of sizes. Just as described. Picture doesn&#x27;t do product justice.</li>
            <li> could be user error but I couldn&#x27;t get these things out of my hair easily. so my curls turned out to be frizzy and tangled.</li>
            <li> Love my new rollers ! They hold great and make you hair voluminous. I am excited to use them more</li>
            <li> This is a lot of rollers for $9, so that&#x27;s great.  They are all different sizes and are color coded according to size.  I purchased these for the jumbo size, but have been using the next smaller one (I think they are green).  My hair is shoulder length, and I had no trouble with these falling out with normal activity.  My kids tried them as well, and they stayed in their hair.  Their hair was not pulled when they removed the rollers, but mine was.  To put these in, I rolled a piece of hair up, then pressed it gently into the roller to keep it in place.  But when I went to remove it, my hair hangs in the rollers and they pull a my hairs out (about four hairs per roller), subsequently removing any curl that might have been there.  They are lightweight, and don&#x27;t weigh down your head like hot rollers will when you have a head full of them.  I returned them because they just didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Stay perfectly in place even with my super fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> I used these curlers for a wedding. They worked as expected and had no quality issues. They add a noticeable volume to my otherwise flat hair.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected</li>
            <li> excellent product for those of us who still use rollers; very good price; would recommended to all gals with long hair</li>
            <li> So happy I found these, I love using them to set blow outs. Quick shipping, brand new unopened set, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them on my clients :)</li>
            <li> Not much you can say about Velcro Rollers... These are affordable and work just as they are supposed to.  Adheres to hair easily, and pulls out just as easily.  I put them in my slightly damp hair, spritz some volume spray on top, and then blow dry while alternative hot and cold until dry.  Then I let them sit for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half to set. Helps my fine hair gain volume that stays!</li>
            <li> My coarse, Asian hair has a hard time keeping a hold.  If I wear these at my crown overnight, I&#x27;m guaranteed a full head of hair that never goes flat the next day.  Definitely worth it for the price.  I bought it for less than $7 and considering how much it would be to buy these individually, this is a great price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Ok grip. It could have a better grip. Not so easy to take out it can get tAngeles easily and get messy and loose the curl very quickly bc of this</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY soft and fine (the texture of the silk on shucked corn if I don&#x27;t put any product in it).  I have a decent amount of hair, but due to having such fine strands, it can make my hair look flat and lifeless.  I decided to give these a try, thinking what the heck, they&#x27;re so cheap it&#x27;s worth a shot.  I used them this morning, and it barely took any time, and my hair has the nicest shape it&#x27;s had in a long time!  I didn&#x27;t go for all-out body since it was my first try, but my hair has a really nice shape that I couldn&#x27;t get unless I worked with a blow-dryer and round brush for a decent amount of time.  This uses a lot less heat and is way less labor intensive.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the process I used to get some bounce in my hair:&lt;br /&gt;-Wash with body enhancing shampoo/conditioner (whichever is your favorite) - comb through conditioned hair while it sits&lt;br /&gt;-Once out of the shower, comb hair with head upside down, add volumizing mousse, and wrap in a towel.  Let this sit for about 15 minutes while you put on makeup, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-When hair is moderately dry, take out towel, and blow-dry upside down.  I use a round brush to keep the strands straight, otherwise I can get a lot of fly-aways.&lt;br /&gt;-Once hair is 95% dry, blow-dry with head upright to smooth out any fly-aways&lt;br /&gt;-Take small sections, starting at the top of your head in the back, and lift each section at the root.  Spray with a little bit of hairspray at the root and run a round brush through it while holding it straight up from your head to line the strands upright.  Blow-dry for a moment to heat hair, then starting at the ends, loosely wrap your hair around the roller and roll down to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-Leave in for about 10 minutes while hair sets.  I used this time to flat iron the lowest layer of my hair, which I didn&#x27;t roll up.  When pulling them out, put your fingers through the middle of the roller and lightly pull as it unwinds.  Make sure you are starting with the last roller you put in and working backwards.&lt;br /&gt;With my super fine hair, I thought for sure I&#x27;d get a TON of tangles and was really concerned while it was setting, but to my surprise they came out easily with no tangles or snags.  Part of it might be that I wrapped them loosely for the first try.  On a weekend day, I&#x27;m going to try to wrap them a little tighter to get a bit of curl and see how it goes.ng backwards.&lt;br /&gt;With my super fine hair, I thought for sure I&#x27;d get a TON of tangles and was really concerned while it was setting, but to my surprise they came out easily with no tangles or snags.

            <li> These are terrible. I got them to use the biggest to straighten out my curly hair, which they did do.. But my hair was left both frizzy and stringy, which is not a good combination (I put them in damp hair). I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try them again simply because they were uncomfortable and I had such bad results.</li>
            <li> Amazon itself was wonderful with customer service and shipping etc, but these rollers are terrible! They went in my hair fine...They did not come out fine. There was a point when I thought I may need a very short haircut! I had to pull these out of my hair. It was awful. Even if you just did one roller at a time you would end up with this result. Do not waste your money! Pick another option :)</li>
            <li> I love these rollers! They easily stay in with one or two bobby pins to hold down in place. It&#x27;s also nice to use immediately after curling my hair to make it last longer and become tighter...that way when I flip my hair and scrunch my curls with my hand and do one comb over, my curls are super bouncy and the curls die to nice waves over a few hours depending on the size. I do it intentionally so t will look like a fake blowout</li>
            <li> My hair goes a bit down past my shoulders.  Maybe my hair was not long enough but after wearing these all day there was nothing different about it when I took them out.  Also these curlers were SO hard to get out! It hurt! I made sure my hair as well brushed with no tangles to avoid this problem but alas it ended up a total disaster.</li>
            <li> If you value your long hair you might want to rethink this item. I read the reviews before purchasing and saw where people were saying these things get stuck in your hair. I thought since there were so many good reviews that maybe those people just had not put them in carefully. They did show a lady with long hair on the front of the packaging after all. I was excited to try these out since they looked like they would be gentle on the hair since they weren&#x27;t hot rollers. My husband had to help extricate me from them when I went to take them out later on. I was SO careful putting them in too. My hair was smooth and heathy and I made sure not to let the hair cross from one roller to the other but they still stuck like crazy. If you have shorter hair maybe these work or if you don&#x27;t have fine hair? The ones that I could get out without a lot of fuss didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair and my hair is easy to curl. They just grip too well, I guess. I suggest that if you get them to try putting just one in to try it out before committing to all of it. Even as careful as we were trying to get these out of my hair they still damaged it.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have yet to try these but my hair dresser uses the same brand and used them on me so I&#x27;m confident I will be nappy.</li>
            <li> I have relatively short hair (reaching just below my chin) and these work great. I use the whole pack on my head, minus the largest curlers, and I get great volume and a smooth finish. These are not very hard to use if you have used velcro curlers before. I suggest securing them with a bobby pin if you&#x27;re going to wear them for a while.</li>
            <li> Currently, the price for 2 packs is more expensive than for one so not currently worth it, but keep an eye out.  If you&#x27;re planning to use the bigger curlers to give more body than curls, you&#x27;ll likely need two packs as there are only 6 of the largest rollers.  I&#x27;ve just ordered my 2nd pack.  You can create volume or curls (or both!) with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use duck clips to hold these in place though they probably would hold on their own, depending on your hair length &amp; texture.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any major snagging or pulling issues, though the smaller rollers do need to be taken out a bit more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this video for a velcro roller how to as I had never used them prior to this purchase (warm up the hair strands with a curling iron prior to rolling):&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> So this is my second time buying rollers.  Last time I got the brush ones and they were fine except that they sometimes left my hair in a big mess.  So I decided to try the velcro rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is pretty good.  You do not have to use the pins to keep them in place.  However, if you tend to move around like I do, then you should use pins or clips.  I like to get ready and do other stuff in the morning while I have these on, so it&#x27;s much easier if I use the clips than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the same sized rollers all over my head so packing is actually not a problem with me.  I tend to use the biggest ones in the front and the two smaller sizes on the sides and the back. It works out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you want best results, you should thoroughly brush out each section of hair before you roll it up. It would make it a lot easier for you to take the rollers out. Otherwise the loose strands get tangled and it&#x27;s a pain to get the roller out and causes a lot of hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for the price. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair - have to be careful rolling hair up to avoid snags removing them but results are great.</li>
            <li> They work well for me.</li>
            <li> Good deal good seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often difficult to find an assortment of sizes--these are great, and the cost is very reasonable for so many curlers.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them to replace another set I had, because after a while, they become entangled with hair, and don&#x27;t hold as efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> They did not stay in the hair well, and the curl was minimal at best. Buyer beware. I would not buy again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  a basic in hair care</li>
            <li> These rollers are fantastic. Love them. I have super thick hair and am able to do my whole head with only one pack. I wish there were a few more of the biggest and second biggest sizes, but that&#x27;s kind of just personal preference of the size curl I like.</li>
            <li> I like that they have different sizes.  They stay on my head as I walk around and they also stay as I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> l love these rollers. They stay put and do not fall out. You do have to remove them carefully as not to pull hair. I found there was not enough of some of the sized curlers in the box for my hair so I have purchased 2 more boxes.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t stay in my hair.  going to donate them</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my daughter&#x27;s waist-length hair to help tame it a little bit and help with tangling.  Worst mistake ever! They rolled up nicely and stayed with the help of a bobby pin.  Trying to get them out was a completely different story!  They got so tangled up in her hair that I really thought I was going to have to cut her hair to get them out.  I will NEVER use these again!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used these in my hair so I decided to buy them and Rey them on my own. I enjoy the different look I get and the easy use!</li>
            <li> I purchased these really only wanting the largest two sizes but it was a great deal so I couldn&#x27;t pass this up.&lt;br /&gt;Works great! I have curly hair and I do not have issues with these tangling or tearing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I apply when my hair is damp, hold with a Bobby pin, and depending on the time I have, either air dry or blow dry. Unroll and voila amazing volume :)</li>
            <li> These are wonderful... never knew a roller would hold without a clip and do it effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I just got these last week, and I&#x27;ve already used them several times, both as dry and as wet to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IF IT GETS STUCK?&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and an average amount of it. These rollers have not gotten anything close to stuck in my hair! If anything, I&#x27;ve had to help them stay in with a strategic bobby pin, especially over night.&lt;br /&gt;But if you have naturally curly hair or tangle prone hair, I would try one area before committing, particularly if you&#x27;re considering wet to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VOLUME&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I feel like the rollers give me too much volume at the roots, which often leads to halo frizzies and a somewhat frazzled looking 80s pop star. I think this is due to my method of placement (very tightly rolled under) and the texture of my hair. Perhaps experimentation and experience will fix this.&lt;br /&gt;However, the second day volume is generally calmer and practically perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CURLS&lt;br /&gt;If you use the biggest curler, I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than the gentlest of curl-ins at the ends. It looks like more of a blow out. The smaller curlers add much more curl. Though I haven&#x27;t used them, I&#x27;ve been warned that the smallest curlers may cause snarling and tanglings, so if that&#x27;s a worry, I&#x27;d be wary of them.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the medium rollers, though (green and yellow in my case), I&#x27;ve found that the curls tend to fall out in about half an hour — about the time it takes for the crown volume to reduce to acceptable levels.&lt;br /&gt;Again this could be just my hair and texture. I have fine hair and I don&#x27;t use hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t mind the curls falling out though, as it gives the hair less subtle blow-out style waves at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER&lt;br /&gt;My routine, so far, consists of putting rollers in semi wet hair — 50% or so — and either blow drying the whole thing, or doing work around the house for a few hours. These only take me about 3/4 hours until a complete dry. Of course, the blow dry isn&#x27;t exactly non heat, but I feel likelow heat, high air, and a shorter dry time is a decent compromise on busy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, though, suggest treating your ends with moisture and protein if you&#x27;re going to incorporate these rollers into your daily/weekly routine. They tend to get crispy with the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving these over night because of the discomfort and the high chance of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;m quite enjoying having these and finally having a practical non-heat routine!</li>
            <li> They get stuck in long hair and are difficult to get out.&lt;br /&gt;They were a mess to get in and a mess to get out and didn&#x27;t make a very big difference.</li>
            <li> If you have too soft and straight hair dont use small ones. I almost cried over this product. I thought I should cut my hair coz one of were so stuck it was not coming out :(</li>
            <li> Easy to work with even for a 4 and 7 year old on a mannequin head with long hear.  They are loving them.</li>
            <li> The plastic case this came in is NOT large enough to store the roller&#x27;s and use on a daily basis.  However, they are exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I have fine long highlighted blonde hair that breaks easily and I have been looking for post wash velcro rollers to add some volume. These rollers are so gentle on my hair but they also grip really well.  Its worth it to pay the extra money for a nice set like this.  Plus they nest really well and are compact. I definitely recommend them</li>
            <li> I thought these would work because every other method of curling and volumizing my hair usually don&#x27;t work, alas it did not either. Not only did they not curl my hair but they gave it very little volume. They pull out my hair when I unroll them which is painful. Not a good experience. They did grip to the hair for the most part but I regret this purchase emensly.</li>
            <li> Works as planned!  I purchased separate duck bill hair clips since my hair is very fine and the self-grip rollers needed additional support.</li>
            <li> I just bought these at a local store tonight. My hair is long and thick and never ever tangles. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking winding up a ball of Velcro in my hair. I was hoping to gently unroll a smooth, beautiful curl *as advertised,* but instead, I had to wrench a roll of Velcro out of my hair which tangled into a frizzy fluffball. I came to check the reviews here, hoping it was just user error, but no. Do not buy this. Hunting for the receipt...</li>
            <li> I am in no way proficient at using rollers in my hair. I bought these because they were inexpensive and self gripping. I wasn&#x27;t trying to achieve bouncy spiral curls, I was just going for added volume. These do the trick. I roll the top layer of my hair, heat them with a blow dryer, spray with hairspray, and then take them out after about 10 minutes. My hair definitely has more volume. They are fairly easy to put it and removal can be tricky but you just have to work at it. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have fine, slippery hair.  I thought these would be great, as my hair always slips out of most rollers.  My daughter was with me when we bought them, and she pulled them out and immediately put one in her hair.  Holy Moses, I thought I would have to cut it out, it was such a snarled mess.  She&#x27;s 6 and was in tears. I figured I would have more luck as an adult.  Not so much.  If my hair is too dry, it gets snarled in the velcro.  If it&#x27;s too wet, it takes forever to dry.  When I tried drying it with a hairdryer, I got frizzy ends (and my hair is never frizzy--it&#x27;s stick straight).  Today I tried it one more time---dried my hair with a hair dryer to damp, put them in, did some things around the house, dried it again with the hair dryer.  I finally got some curls that were okay, but they didn&#x27;t last very long, and again, gave me some frizz I wasn&#x27;t wild about.  Also, I was using the biggest size, because I&#x27;m frankly just a little bit scared of how badly the small ones would snarl in my hair.  I can see how these curlers would be great for people with some curl already whose hair is a little bit course.  These are kind of a nightmare for those of us with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Did not work, maybe because my hair is too thick? The curls did not stay and came out super frizzy.</li>
            <li> These are a NIGHTMARE for long hair.  I took a good amount of time and used every curler in the package on my long &amp;#34;nearly dry&amp;#34; hair and left them in for a few hours.  Removal was nearly impossible.  It took me nearly 45 minutes to get them out as they grabbed other hair and tangled up.  The last two curlers took the longest to remove and I contemplated just cutting it out as the tangling was so bad.  The worst part is that the curl wasn&#x27;t even that good and I had to redo it with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Great!  Works so much better than the dollar store or beauty supply rollers I bought in the past.  Stays in much better too.</li>
            <li> Can i use whit a hot dryer?</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice on your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look fantastic and save your hair from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure once I figure out how to correctly roll my hair I will like these. The only thing is your hair has to be dry before you put them in and I really want something I can put in and let my hair dry on them while I get ready in the morning... Guess I will keep looking, but doesn&#x27;t hurt to try for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used these velcro rollers and they have worked really great.  I have thick courser Asian hair, and I put these in after I dry my hair most of the way, leave them in the rest of the night and the take them out before I go to sleep. The next day it looks like I blow dried my hair!  It&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, I wish they had more of the bigger sizes.  They have a good variety of sizes, but what I really need (with medium length hair) are the two big sizes, with my hair being thick the smaller ones aren&#x27;t really usable.  But I&#x27;m still pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different self-grip curlers before, and decided to give them one last chance. I bought this set because they were reasonably priced but probably a better quality than the dollar-store version I had used before. Unfortunately, I am disappointed with the results. I have long but fine hair, and I think these rollers worked a little TOO well -- they gripped my hair so firmly that I practically had to tear them out, since they would not unroll. Because I had to abuse my hair to get the rollers out, any resulting curl or volume was lost. I could have achieved a better result with a blow dryer and round brush. If your hair is thicker (stronger) or coarser, they might work, but on my delicate hair, the results were not worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> These curlers are just what the doctor ordered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can make tiny curls or just to puff up your already existing texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They actually stay in place, too!</li>
            <li> Love these! I got the exact look I was trying to get and it was super easy. I have very long straight hair that is somewhere in the middle thickness. I was looking for a way to give my hair a little volume and a sexy wave with little effort and little to no heat. I&#x27;ve tried these a few ways and have received tons of compliments on my hair! I find the best results are when your hair is damp and for me I leave them in for 2 hours because my hair is so long, but I think of you had shoulder length or shorter hair you could easily do an hour or less. Result is volumized hair and a cute curl/slight wave at the end. I find the single set is enough for my hair. I&#x27;ve only used the two large sizes and I had enough curlers to do my whole head. And they stuck too! I wasn&#x27;t sure the Velcro would be able to hold all my hair but it does. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> These rollers are exactly what I expected. I find velcro rollers are great when I&#x27;m in a hurry and am looking for body instead of curls, and these deliver. They don&#x27;t necessarily stay rolled up snugly, which I have found with all velcro rollers. Sometimes this is a pain, but usually I make do. They come nicely packaged, but it&#x27;s not convenient to use them this way, because it is difficult to separate them, so you either have to pick out the ones you want before you get started, or just keep them more loosely packed somewhere else in order to grab as you go.</li>
            <li> Missing two of the Green rollers, some of rollers were unraveling. For 6$ it works fine, not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> you need order more than one pack if you need more than 5 rollers of the same size....Also the set does not include big rolles - only medium and small</li>
            <li> i use the small ones to make curls and the big ones to make waves i like it alot like that i don&#x27;t have to use heat</li>
            <li> The easiest and less damaging way to style your hair. A little styling spray put them in put a quick hair dryer over your head and voila!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and these work great for me!  I blow dry my hair for about 5 minutes and while it is still a bit damp, spray it with blo-dry spray (currently like Suave brand) and then set with these rollers and blow dry again.  Then I leave them in for about 10 minutes and voila!  Full, lifted and shiny!</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck very easily in these curlers!</li>
            <li> Works well for an outdoor woman!  Went many years without using these and back to using them again.  Seem to have lost so many different sizes and now need those sizes.  Will buy the whole package again.  These are great for quick setting and drying.  We are retired now and my husband is willing to wait for me to set and dry my hair, these work perfectly.  Be careful by slow removing these rollers from your hair and you will be quite pleased with the curls and body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these rollers.  There are five sizes and they are reasonably durable feeling, even though they aren&#x27;t lined with metal. I can put them in dry, just-washed hair and in less than 10 minutes they&#x27;ve given me smoother hair with more volume than I could hope for by styling with a round brush.  I have short hair that tends to get frizzy in humidity so these are great to use more than once a day if I need to.  They also save my hair from the heat of a straight iron. I haven&#x27;t had any tangling issues.  Very easy to pull off.</li>
            <li> These rollers are easy to use, and a very good assortment of sizes.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.  The morning&#x27;s I wash, I dry my hair 85% then roll my hair on these...on the days I don&#x27;t, after I shower I roll my hair while I am getting ready for work.  These help to lift and shape.  They are truly self-grip. I also like the fact that I can keep them neat in the case.</li>
            <li> Great value and size selection.</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very thick and long-ish. This definitely does not come with enough rollers for my head (I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s enough for a normal person&#x27;s head either to be honest) and weren&#x27;t easy to keep in. I had to use Bobby pins just to keep them on my head. I purchased these because I dont like using heating tools on my hair. I might have to change that...</li>
            <li> Catagorized as Velcro rollers - Not described as such on the package, not sure they are, look like brush rollers.</li>
            <li> Good selection of sizes and handy storage case. As long as you know how to use these type of rollers, you will be happy with them.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand that works! I love the assortment but confess that the little bitty rollers are pretty worthless for my type of hair style (longish loose curls with body curls).  I am lame with a hair dryer so I went back to curlers (am in my 60&#x27;s) when the style required some body curl and can whip these in and out of my hair in minutes. I love them, They travel well, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan. Tried using them once and maybe I took them out to early but there was no curl. I have very long hair too so maybe this would be better and girls with short hair. I will try again and keep them in longer. Also I would definitely use hair pins with these which kind of defeats the purpose of them being Velcro. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> Be warned...if your hair has a tendency to tangle, as mine does, getting these rollers out of it is about the same as trying to get burrs out of your hair. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Just a great set of various size rollers.  Love not needing to use pins to hold the curler in the hair.  Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. I have some experience with cosmetology, but I had never put curlers in my own hair. Even so, they were incredibly easy to use, and they seemed to do the trick. I used a Youtube tutorial that recommended having dry hair, then running each strand through a straightener first to warm and smooth the strand and to achieve volume but not curl. It worked. I also tried using damp hair and a blow dryer, which also worked, mainly because these curlers have an above average breathing quality that allows air to pass through them easily.</li>
            <li> Unable to sleep with them.</li>
            <li> These were so easy!!!  Love them!</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool, especially if you travel.  They really stay in place, and I have long hair.  Just don&#x27;t put too much hair in each one, or take out partially wet, as they can get tangled and have to be pulled out.  As I have long hair, I use the biggest, and will buy another set to have enough to cover my head.  Great as there are so many sizes.</li>
            <li> I have straight fine asian hair, shoulder length, and median volume. These rollers work well.  They are my first rollers so I watched tons of youtube tutorial videos before buying.  I used them right after received the package this afternoon. My hair was dry,  I used Folicure thickening mousse before put on the rollers, and took them off after only 5 mins.  I could already see some soft curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s the night, and I just took a shower.  I put them on again to see how they would work on my damped hair.  They worked well too.  There are 5 sizes.  If the largest is size 1 and smallest is size 5, I used three size 1, five size 2, and two size 3.  I just air dried my hair and took them off after 1.5 hours (my hair is now 98% dry).  And I was amazed by the result!! I got glamorous soft curls like those of Victoria&#x27;s Secret runaway models!  I love it!  I used hair mask in the shower to protect my hair from being damaged by the rollers.  The curls look shiny and smooth, and feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key to put the rollers on properly is to make sure your hair is straight when you put them on and make sure to wrap the hair around the roller tightly.  I combed each section first, then placed the roller near the hair root, then slowly pulled it toward the end of the hair as if I was combing my hair with the roller, and then kept gently pulling my hair to make sure it stayed straight while I wrapped  it tightly round the roller.  I think the combing (with roller; it helps re-straighten the hair)  and the pulling (keeps the hair stay straight) are very important.  My hair is naturally straight so it&#x27;s easier for me.  If you have curly or frizzy hair, it&#x27;s better to straighten the hair first.  Otherwise, your hair is probably going to get tangled and stuck on the roller, and it will be very painful when take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one hand to unroll the roller off the hair gently while used the other to secure the root of the hair.  It worked well. It wasn&#x27;t a painful, and my hair didn&#x27;t fall. Maybe I pulled out two single strands of hair during the process, but I think that&#x27;s pretty normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw they used velcro rollers on Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion show models all the time.  That&#x27;s why I bought them.  Although I don&#x27;t know how much damage these rollers will do to my hair cuticles if I use them everyday, I&#x27;m not too worried since I will only use them occasionally.  Using hair mask before and after using the rollers can also protect the hair from harsh styling material and reduce the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all  I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the price is reasonable.  It definitely requires some delicate techniques and patience to use them properly (watching youtube tutorial helps a lot).  So don&#x27;t be frustrated if you mess up the first a couple of times.  You&#x27;ll get there with some practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it&#x27;ll be very difficult to sleep at night with these rollers on your head, as they are pretty hard and the velcro will poke your scalp when you lie down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been close to 50 years since I last used curlers and I&#x27;m very glad the technology has improved.  These nice velcro rollers are easy to put in and take out.  They stay where you put them.  I&#x27;m delighted with the zippered case they came in as this will be helpful travelling to a wedding this summer -- which is why I am breaking down and styling my old hippie hair to begin with.  So, if you need a set of curlers, these are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This item does give my hair some volume. It does not need clips to stay put however you&#x27;ll need to roll up small sections of hair; otherwise roll will come undone slightly from the roots. Because it has a texture like velcro, when unraveling the roll, it does leave your hair a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, stays in place, and holds my hair.  Also has a nice variety of sizes and enough of the big ones to work great with my hair.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers. they were exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Love them.... they were delivered promptly and all is well.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and put a few of these on the crown of my head with no clips or pins needed.  After about 15 minutes my hair is smoother and has more body</li>
            <li> I use these all the time! Just leave them in overnight (or for a few hours) and you&#x27;re good to go. If used correctly, this can replace your curling iron, which is great because it&#x27;s not damaging to your hair at all!</li>
            <li> I use these regularly and like using them better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> They work great, if you have hair clips. I have long hair and it wont stay in place unless I use clips.</li>
            <li> Great assortment of &amp;#34;Velcro&amp;#34; rollers for a nice price. These are fantastic for creating volume and giving your &#x27;do a nice, polished look with some OOMPH!</li>
            <li> These are a great idea, but they hurt.  they get stuck in your hair, and when you finally get them out, instead of soft pretty curls as promised, you have frizzy hair that looks horrible.</li>
            <li> These are great for smoothing out hair while curling. Love them.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of rollers I was originally looking for &amp; up &amp; bought the other kind..I LOVE this rollers, I have used them in the past..I will continue to order this kind..</li>
            <li> This item is no longer available in our area so purchased for a friend.  She wanted all small ones but this was not available.  It is a nice assortment of sizes to share with someone.</li>
            <li> Not exactly rocket science, these rollers work as you would expect.  I gave 4 stars because I threw out a dozen rollers (the small ones I&#x27;ll never use). Would love to have 12 large-med and an appropriate size container for them.</li>
            <li> They are great and have been a boon to my hair locks. I love the colors, and they stay in even over night.</li>
            <li> Curly hair girls beware - these rollers will make your hair frizzer.  I purchased these rollers hoping to give my naturally curly hair a more refined wavy look.  I got a frizzy mess instead.  However, if you have sleek, straight hair I could see how these might work.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try these rollers out because they are self gripping. Being a natural... With thick coily hair- putting them in was nice and easy; with the help of Bobby pins, taking them down was a complete failure. They were painful because they got tangled up with my hair and instead of curls I ended up with a big fluffy afro which was not what I was going for.  I&#x27;m sad cause I now feel like I just wasted my money and time....</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li> Easy to put in, take out and store. And they do the job without pulling any hair.</li>
            <li> I use these with my bonnet dryer. They give me whatever size curls I want, and since they&#x27;re totally vented, my hair dries faster.</li>
            <li> I was torn between a 3 or 4 star review and am being nice with 4. The curlers work great, o good selections of sizes.  You can get a better price at Walmart I saw them there tonight. The big con, these are not hard to get stuck in your hair, I have literally ripped them out way more than comman sense allow. They get stuck even when rolled onto roller correctly.  Also after several uses they start to take a terrible toll on fine hair which is rough and frizzy on about the bottom 3 inches. I still use them because I like the ease and look created but it&#x27;s at a risk every time, and frequent use is going to cause noticeable damage.  Knowing then what I know now id probably buy hot rollers next time.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because they work ok, but do not hold my hair like i was hoping. You are better off using pins with them :-/</li>
            <li> Great product looks just as in the pic n works really good</li>
            <li> Great product and use it often. I just wish they had more of the bigger and medium sizes in the case.</li>
            <li> Love these curlers.  Gives me the lift I need.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great not to have to use pins to hold these in.  So far, they really stay in.</li>
            <li> I am hair-challenged (I&#x27;m not very good at styling my own hair). I also have fine, sparse hair with thinning areas around the crown. My hair is just above shoulder length in a long bob. I bought these rollers to add volume and try to make my hair look more full without using too much heat/wear/tear. I received these rollers on 08/23/15 and used them on 08/24/15. I applied mousse to my damp hair and rolled up sections using about 10 of the rollers (the larger sizes). I left the rollers in for about 30 minutes while I completed my morning routine (ate breakfast, applied makeup, fed the cat, ironed my outfit, dressed). I also used my hair dryer on HOT for about 2 minutes. I am pleased with the fullness and bounce. With some practice, I can see this giving me exactly the results I&#x27;m after without a lot of fuss or cost.</li>
            <li> These did not curl my hair at all. I used styling spray (making my hair damp) and then rolled them and secured them with a clip. I even slept on them over night. When I took them out in the morning, there wasn&#x27;t a single curl or wave. I&#x27;ll go back to my hot rollers.</li>
            <li> THEY REALLY WORK AND STAY IN.  I bought some rollers from a tv buy channel. Name brand and did not work.  THESE WORK.&lt;br /&gt;Safe buy.... Go figure.</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS PRODUCT IT PULLS MY HAIR OUT AND DON&#x27;T CURL NOTHING ZIP, NADA.</li>
            <li> These rollers really do grip without bobby pins or clips!  Works on wet or dry hair. So quick and easy.  I love them!</li>
            <li> this product was absolutely HORRIBLE. I bought the &amp;#34;self grip&amp;#34; ones because I&#x27;m lazy and I thought it would be easier to not have to clip them up. big mistake. they all got stuck in my hair and it took me about an hour to try to get them all out without ripping every last strand of hair out of my head. I would not recommend them and if i were the manufacturer I would discontinue them all together</li>
