            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Worked flawlessly!</li>
            <li>This is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great gadget.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept because we all use products in bottles.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the dispensing mechanism, the amount of remaining product you can squeeze or pump out varies greatly.  </li>
            <li>great make-up streching tool.  </li>
            <li>These are the best way to get your money&#x27;s worth with your beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Received very good service from the seller, fast, price, etc.</li>
            <li>Great buy, well worth it.</li>
            <li>The width prevent me from reaching the bottom of the large bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product &amp; look forward to using it more!</li>
            <li>I bought this item months ago and welcomed being able to use every drop of moisturizer, foundation, or handcream.  </li>
            <li>It needs more of a shelf or something to get out more product around the bends of the bottles.</li>
            <li>It does help, but I thought it would get more than it does.</li>
            <li>I was able to get at some orphaned lotion.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>A couple of these I have on Subscribe and Save, and these spoons get out so much more product that I had to go in and lengthen the time between deliveries.</li>
            <li>and when I pulled it out there was a huge amount, more than I could use for one days application.  </li>
            <li>They wash up easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>One edge on the side on each soon is raised, so you can easily scrape product from the walls of bottles.    </li>
            <li>The beauty spoon allows me to scoop it out of the original container without any hassle.  </li>
            <li>They were so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Great little tool for scraping the rest of the lotion out of a bottle</li>
            <li>I used a facial cleansing cloth, which did an effective job, reaching into the inaccessible curves of the handle.  </li>
            <li>So far I am on day 10 and I am able to still get the right amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>Good as new, except there are these tiny circular indentations I could not get to unless I used a toothpick.</li>
            <li>This product is great because it helps me get the last little bit of stuff from bottles and jars of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li>It did get out more than without it in my serum and the larger one helped with the ketchup bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the larger handles.</li>
            <li>The girls were puzzled at first until they figured out what they were.  </li>
            <li>the silicone spoon is very flexible and it went right into the bottle</li>
            <li>Too large.  </li>
            <li>The smallest &#x27;spoon&#x27; is way to big to fit into makeup bottle - Revlon and others.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much makeup I was throwing away.  </li>
            <li>The BeautySpoons have worked out very well.</li>
            <li>The scraper is a great way to get that last bit of product out of the container (especially liquid foundation containers that can be cut open).  </li>
            <li>They might be okay for lotion bottles or some bigger sized bottles only.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to clean out the makeup in old bottles but the tips are too big for the makeup bottles I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews, complaining about how even with the smallest spoon could not fit into foundation openings.  </li>
            <li>The ends are really flexible yet sturdy so you can get all of the left over product.</li>
            <li>It worked equally as well if the product came in a tube or small bottle, and I usually was able to scrape three week&#x27;s worth of a product before replacing.  </li>
            <li>Works very well when trying to empty out my makeup bottles.</li>
            <li>It did seem to large but a little pressure and</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been kind of shocked at how much material remains in these bottles -- all with pumps that are in a fixed location so they obviously fail to pump after they&#x27;ve sucked up everything in the vicinity.  </li>

            <li> Very happy with my  purchase. Works very well when trying to empty out my makeup bottles.</li>
            <li> I was tired of throwing away containers with product still in there that I could not get to, like lotion bottles.  I started cutting the bottle off so I could get to the lotion at the bottom of the bottle but that was a lot of trouble and there was no way to keep the lotion covered up.  The beauty spoon allows me to scoop it out of the original container without any hassle.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this item months ago and welcomed being able to use every drop of moisturizer, foundation, or handcream.  It worked equally as well if the product came in a tube or small bottle, and I usually was able to scrape three week&#x27;s worth of a product before replacing.  I knew the value of this item and gave it as Christmas gifts to my sister and nieces.  They were so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> The smallest &#x27;spoon&#x27; is way to big to fit into makeup bottle - Revlon and others.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your $$$</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from a friend.  I use Revlon Color Stay and never get the stuff on the bottom to come out so I end up throwing it out.  I threw my last bottle out until I remembered my gift.  Pulled the Makeup out of the garbage and dipped the spoon in.  It did seem to large but a little pressure and the silicone spoon is very flexible and it went right into the bottle and when I pulled it out there was a huge amount, more than I could use for one days application.  Worked flawlessly! So far I am on day 10 and I am able to still get the right amount of makeup. When I normally wasted, I now have and extra 15-20 days of makeup.  I can&#x27;t believe how much makeup I was throwing away.  This little tool will pay for itself in less thank 6 months.</li>
            <li> Great gadget. No longer waste lotion shampoo or other products in tall containers. They wash up easily. One if those &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I think of that. &amp;#34; items.</li>
            <li> Hate it when you just can&#x27;t get to the bottom of your makeup bottle/jar after spending all that money?  This is the solution...no more wasting!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  The ends are really flexible yet sturdy so you can get all of the left over product.</li>
            <li> This product is great because it helps me get the last little bit of stuff from bottles and jars of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> Too large.  Even the small one doesn&#x27;t fit in a small chanel makeup jar.  Buy the Spatty instead. It&#x27;s smaller.</li>
            <li> Great little tool for scraping the rest of the lotion out of a bottle so you don&#x27;t throw it all away.  Used it on my last lotion bottle and got almost a cup of lotion stuck to the sides that would have went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping to use them to get the last drops of my expensive cosmetic foundation and moisturizers. They are very big! The spatula does not fit in the small openings of makeup bottles. It was even too big for my body lotion bottles. Not sure what \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products these are intended for. When I did manage to jam it into one bottle, I was disappointed to find the product stuck in the squiggle design of the handle, which seems just as wasteful as leaving it in the bottle. I&#x27;m looking for something else - these did not work for me. $10 wasted.</li>
            <li> It needs more of a shelf or something to get out more product around the bends of the bottles. It did get out more than without it in my serum and the larger one helped with the ketchup bottle.  It does help, but I thought it would get more than it does.</li>
            <li> I love the larger handles. Easy to use I actually swapped the smaller spoon onto the larger handle for a lotion bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I could get the last bit of make up or serum from my bottles since they are expensive but the tool does not fit inside my small bottles, they are much, much bigger than I expected.  They might be okay for lotion bottles or some bigger sized bottles only.  Wasted my money...on the search for something with a smaller spatula.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept because we all use products in bottles.  Depending on the dispensing mechanism, the amount of remaining product you can squeeze or pump out varies greatly.  You can recoup the the cost of these spoons by maximizing the amount of product and uses.  These silicone spoons are designed to reach bottles of varying sizes, except enormous containers and those with small openings.  I&#x27;ve read many reviews, complaining about how even with the smallest spoon could not fit into foundation openings.  The spoon part are flexible enough that with a little pressure, it can conform to fit a small opening, like my foundation bottle.  One edge on the side on each soon is raised, so you can easily scrape product from the walls of bottles.    My one complaint is the zig zag design of the handle closest to the spoon part can be difficult to clean.  Foundation formulation is impossible to rinse off because it adheres like nothing else to the surface.  I used a facial cleansing cloth, which did an effective job, reaching into the inaccessible curves of the handle.  Finally, I rinsed the spoon in water.  Good as new, except there are these tiny circular indentations I could not get to unless I used a toothpick.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to clean out the makeup in old bottles but the tips are too big for the makeup bottles I have.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these 2-packs for Christmas gifts.  The girls were puzzled at first until they figured out what they were.  One of my girls is going to keep one in the kitchen for bottles in there, not only for makeup.  Received very good service from the seller, fast, price, etc.</li>
            <li> The BeautySpoons have worked out very well. I was able to get at some orphaned lotion. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars is that the holding end of the long spoon is a bit wide. The width prevent me from reaching the bottom of the large bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product &amp; look forward to using it more!</li>
            <li> These are the best way to get your money&#x27;s worth with your beauty products.  The scraper is a great way to get that last bit of product out of the container (especially liquid foundation containers that can be cut open).  Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> great make-up streching tool.  ordered for myself and for 2 friends.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. Fits in every bottle, and gets all excess out. I  use Revlon Color Stay Foundation, that costs me $13.00 a bottle. Great buy, well worth it. A must have</li>
            <li> I never write a review of a product until I&#x27;ve used it for at least six months or multiple times.  However, I think I could have made an exception for these Beauty Spoons.  I was so tired of trying to coax the lotions and serums out of bottles that were intentionally designed to waste product so you&#x27;d have to buy it sooner.  Well, these beauty spoons have solved that problem.  I like the flexibly spoon part as I can get the small one into even the tiny eye serum bottle.  I&#x27;ve been kind of shocked at how much material remains in these bottles -- all with pumps that are in a fixed location so they obviously fail to pump after they&#x27;ve sucked up everything in the vicinity.  Depending on the size of the bottles, I would estimate that these spoons provide between 5-25 additional uses and that ends up saving me dollars.  A couple of these I have on Subscribe and Save, and these spoons get out so much more product that I had to go in and lengthen the time between deliveries.</li>
