            <li>You&#x27;re So Fine Liquid Eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>

            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner by a mile.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>, it stays on all day and I love the glitter in the product.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the staying power of this liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>If you do that, you&#x27;ll fall in love with this eyeliner too.</li>
            <li>I try my best to shake it before use, but what I&#x27;ve found is that as you start using it up, the glitter kind of falls to the bottom of the bottle and gunks up the brush, making it the product harder to apply as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a master with liquid eyeliner, but this one is very easy to apply highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>On weekends I love to use it to do the fun cat eye look that is so on trend</li>
            <li>As a Canadian citizen, it costs quite a bit more to have it delivered to me, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it as a lash liner and it adds a bit of glitter and makes my lashes look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Elizabeth Mott is a great store to do business with, will be back.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed</li>
            <li>Best applicator brush, and amazing lasting eyeliner - seriously, if I don&#x27;t take off my make up the night before, it still looks amazing in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Liked the first so much that I had to buy a replacement!</li>
            <li>The application is smooth and consistent and it stays on all day, which is important when you&#x27;ve got statement eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Perfect, no smudging and stays on from 7 til 10 at least.</li>
            <li>and the glitter is not chunky or super sparkly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>You might just find your new favorite eyeliner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite aspect of this makeup is that it lasts all day (which is saying a lot because my eyes tend to water for no reason) but it is extremely easy to remove with a regular towelette.</li>
            <li>The glitter is subtle but a lot of fun and looks great in unique lighting situations.</li>
            <li>nice rich black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>When it dry is kind of ruber.</li>
            <li>Very dry texture after set, kind of comes off in flakes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be my last purchase of</li>
            <li>first received this eyeliner as part of a monthly make-up bag subscription (ipsy).</li>
            <li>I received it as a sample and fell in love instantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues with eyeliner creasing but this stays in place-even if you sweat or in hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li>or you don&#x27;t, so there isn&#x27;t consistent application of &amp;#34;glitteryness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll likely keep buying this fantastic product, but would feel more comfortable if it was at a lower price (or free shipping) point for the reason that it&#x27;s hard to use it all up.</li>
            <li>Instead, it large flakes of glitter that you either get on the wand</li>
            <li>So you have this HUGE wand for applying and a tiny reservoir of product.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really see any glitter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different liquid eyeliners from all price points and this by far is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and once you do, it stays in place all day long.</li>
            <li>It goes on so easy and it lasts all day long!  </li>
            <li>which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>brush is very easy to use, even for someone who usually uses a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>like.. super long.</li>
            <li>Since I live in Canada, I couldn&#x27;t find the Elizabeth Mott eyeliner to replace.</li>
            <li>Loving the subtle sparkles...</li>
            <li>Since I do love the ease of application and staying power, I&#x27;ll just get black next time.  </li>
            <li>When I came out of the water the people I was with was like WOW</li>
            <li>My one issue would be with the product near the end of its life cycle, which is why its getting 4, not 5, stars.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much, but it does last a while.</li>
            <li>and the you can remove it easy with out getting a black and blue eye..</li>
            <li>It easily glides on, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, lost lasting without primer, I have oily skin and it lasts all day on my eyes, I have the glitterati black one</li>
            <li>Also, the glitter is not overwhelming, it is just right!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it last the full day without smudging.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve spent almost 3 times as much money just to purchase this specific brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my second purchase of the product and the first lasted for quite a few months.  </li>

            <li> first tube I tried lasted about 5 months, without any negative impact on the product.</li>
            <li> Has lasting power and won&#x27;t budge all day long.</li>
            <li> glitter is not too excessive, just adds a little fun on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I say definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received this eyeliner in my Ipsy bag a long time ago and I just ran out of it.</li>
            <li> fairly long wearing (still there at the end of the day if i havent rubbed my eyes),</li>
            <li> Handle is long.</li>
            <li> If u make a mistake just let it dry for a couple off seconds</li>
            <li> I received the basic black from my Ipsy bag.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers a not lying when they say it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the package design.</li>
            <li> I never have to mess with it again.</li>
            <li> Went to the beach this past week and waded into the water to be knocked down.</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use the Lorac Front of the line Pro, which is..</li>
            <li> It then becomes very difficult to get the brush back in the liquid end without causing the fibers to push apart, leading to a messy application.</li>
            <li> so this little guy had a tough</li>
            <li> The glitter is very subtle and just adds a little shimmer to the eyeliner without looking trashy or teenie-bopper.</li>
            <li> The glitter is subtle.</li>
            <li> I do a cat eye line, but the skin underneath my eyebrow covers my eye lid, so it&#x27;s tough to find products that won&#x27;t smudge by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this line ever hints that it will get off the market, I will be extremely sad.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different liquid eyeliners from all price points and this by far is my favorite.  It goes on effortlessly so I don&#x27;t have to take a lot of time with it.  I use it everyday and it last the full day without smudging.

            <li> Best applicator brush, and amazing lasting eyeliner - seriously, if I don&#x27;t take off my make up the night before, it still looks amazing in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first received this eyeliner as part of a monthly make-up bag subscription (ipsy). I LOVED it! I do a cat eye line, but the skin underneath my eyebrow covers my eye lid, so it&#x27;s tough to find products that won&#x27;t smudge by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner is absolutely perfect! The applicator brush is the best I have used, and I&#x27;ve tried most eyeliners at Sephora and MAC. Since I live in Canada, I couldn&#x27;t find the Elizabeth Mott eyeliner to replace. I bought 2 others in the meantime. A Deta v T. from Sephora and the best liquid eyeliner from MAC. It just wasn&#x27;t the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I finally found this eyeliner on Amazon.com. As a Canadian citizen, it costs quite a bit more to have it delivered to me, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this line ever hints that it will get off the market, I will be extremely sad.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I received it as a sample and fell in love instantly.  I use it as a lash liner and it adds a bit of glitter and makes my lashes look fantastic.  I was so very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! I love it. Stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge and easy to apply. Went to the beach this past week and waded into the water to be knocked down. When I came out of the water the people I was with was like WOW your eyeliner is still perfect! Will for sure purchase again!</li>

            <li> Best eyeliner ever!!! So easy to apply, and stays on so well!!! Never smudges or runs! I am in love!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I received this eyeliner in my Ipsy bag a long time ago and I just ran out of it. I ran to Amazon to buy another and I&#x27;m not disappointed, it stays on all day and I love the glitter in the product. I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with the staying power of this liquid eyeliner. Other reviewers a not lying when they say it lasts all day. My one issue would be with the product near the end of its life cycle, which is why its getting 4, not 5, stars. If you do not regularly shake up the eyeliner, all of the glitter will sink causing the last bit of the eyeliner to be unusable. It then becomes very difficult to get the brush back in the liquid end without causing the fibers to push apart, leading to a messy application. So my one piece of advice would be SHAKE IT AND SHAKE IT OFTEN. If you do that, you&#x27;ll fall in love with this eyeliner too. The glitter is subtle but a lot of fun and looks great in unique lighting situations.</li>

            <li> I really like this eyeliner. In fact, I&#x27;ve spent almost 3 times as much money just to purchase this specific brand. Here&#x27;s why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very easy to use, even for someone who usually uses a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;The first tube I tried lasted about 5 months, without any negative impact on the product. I wore it probably 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite aspect of this makeup is that it lasts all day (which is saying a lot because my eyes tend to water for no reason) but it is extremely easy to remove with a regular towelette. I&#x27;ve even used coconut oil to remove it with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;The glitter is not too excessive, just adds a little fun on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I say definitely give it a try. You might just find your new favorite eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Mott, will you make different colors of this? If so, sign me up!</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner it literally glides on so smoothly!!</li>
            <li> I never do reviews on product...put for this product I feel that I need to. This eyeliner is the best. If u make a mistake just let it dry for a couple off seconds and the you can remove it easy with out getting a black and blue eye.. When it dry is kind of ruber. It last me the entire day. I just order a back up. 👍</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING. Super pigmented, lost lasting without primer, I have oily skin and it lasts all day on my eyes, I have the glitterati black one and the glitter is not chunky or super sparkly. I honesty can&#x27;t even notice the glitter. It also has a matte finish after it sets and I love the wand used to apply!! I&#x27;m not a master with liquid eyeliner, but this one is very easy to apply highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner! It easily glides on, and a little goes a long way. Loving the subtle sparkles... I got the product in my ipsy bag and now it&#x27;s a staple. I wear it every day!</li>
            <li> I received the basic black from my Ipsy bag. This listing shows for Glitterati, but the pictures dont allude to any glitter, so i&#x27;ll give ya what ive got! I usually use the Lorac Front of the line Pro, which is.. my holy grail eyeliner so this little guy had a tough competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cute packaging! fairly long wearing (still there at the end of the day if i havent rubbed my eyes), nice rich black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not waterproof. Very dry texture after set, kind of comes off in flakes. Brush applicator doesnt give a very fine line. Handle is long. like.. super long. Its a little hard to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dupe: NYC liquid liner</li>
            <li> This is the second tube of Glitterati eyeliner I&#x27;ve gotten. Liked the first so much that I had to buy a replacement! The glitter is very subtle and just adds a little shimmer to the eyeliner without looking trashy or teenie-bopper. Has lasting power and won&#x27;t budge all day long. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took a star away is that there are some things that could be improved regarding the packaging. Since the product has a glitter component, it would be helpful if there was an easier way to shake it up (like a weighted ball inside or something like that). I try my best to shake it before use, but what I&#x27;ve found is that as you start using it up, the glitter kind of falls to the bottom of the bottle and gunks up the brush, making it the product harder to apply as time goes on. I&#x27;ll likely keep buying this fantastic product, but would feel more comfortable if it was at a lower price (or free shipping) point for the reason that it&#x27;s hard to use it all up.</li>
            <li> A liner that finally has staying power for me. My eyelids tend to be oily and I squint a lot, so I&#x27;ve tried all formats of liner but they either flake off or end up underneath my eyes!. I really like this one.  My only complaint is the package design. The lid/brush is 3/4 of the bottle!  So you have this HUGE wand for applying and a tiny reservoir of product. So, don&#x27;t be deceived by the view of this product. You don&#x27;t get much, but it does last a while. I got Glitterati hoping for a hint of glitter. Instead, it large flakes of glitter that you either get on the wand or you don&#x27;t, so there isn&#x27;t consistent application of &amp;#34;glitteryness&amp;#34;.  Since I do love the ease of application and staying power, I&#x27;ll just get black next time.  And, there WILL be a next time now that I know what I&#x27;m getting myself into. Hope this helps you!</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Mott is a great store to do business with, will be back.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s easy to apply and once you do, it stays in place all day long. I never have to mess with it again. The glitter is subtle. Seller delivered promptly without issues. Will definitely reorder again!</li>
            <li> I bought the glitterati but I can&#x27;t really see any glitter. Tried to shake it up and that just messed up the brush.  It does stay on though which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many eyeliners and they all failed...this one was amazing! It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smear or run!</li>
