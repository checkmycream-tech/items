            <li>If you&#x27;re a Nioxin user, this is a good choice for control and added body.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a good option to get started.  </li>
            <li>This right there was just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Call to be sure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled that my search on Amazon located it</li>
            <li>Does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch.</li>
            <li>The product it self might be good, the shipment was quick</li>
            <li>While I used a lot of other products and this one is not the best one out of them, it&#x27;s still pretty good and brings good results, and I had been using it for a couple years.</li>
            <li>This product is one of my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for many years, along with all Nioxin products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>butI haven&#x27;t is okay</li>
            <li>This one gives a lot more for your money and the effect seems to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>so I assumed that I would be able to notice a difference after one usage.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for someone like me who has very thin, fine hair - I cannot fix my hair without it - it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I use the Finishing Creme to fight fly aways and frizz from the humidity since I live on the Gulf Coast.  </li>
            <li>It feels and looks lovely, and is easily styled.</li>
            <li>I have had good luck using this outlet as a way in getting products and am very thankful.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I have thinning fine hair and have used this product for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>Works well and makes styling easier for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Up until this year, this has not been a problem as my hair was fine</li>
            <li>went right through my hair without pulling at all on my very fine hair &amp; it made it look thicker.  </li>
            <li>It was discolored with a light beige/brown tint.</li>
            <li>Have used it for years and excited I can get it this way.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product and I am pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>This order was for our daughter who has very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair bouncy, soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>Sure hope this does not mean that the company is discontinuing this product!</li>
            <li>it arrived quick</li>
            <li>This is a fairly new product for me... and I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a bit &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought that it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has no alcohol (which to me, is a HUGE concern as it makes hair dry and full of static),</li>
            <li>All of the women in my family have fine hair, which gets sparse in their older age.  </li>
            <li>While blow drying I noticed right away that my comb or brush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is right.</li>
            <li>This product actually does exactly what the company claims -- adds volume while leaving hair feeling really nice.  </li>
            <li>After my hair was completely dry from the blow drying my hair layed so nicely.  </li>
            <li>I will then take my curling iron to touch-up and smooth my cowlicks and curl the ends inward to frame my face and to finish off my style I will take a pea sized dollup of the Nioxin Finishing Creme and rub it between both hands and then smooth through my hair, starting at the ends and back first then over the front and top (this way I don&#x27;t get that greasy look).  </li>
            <li>And, since I do have to use a good bit, it gets a little sticky.</li>
            <li>I use it after using the Nioxin System 4 products and the Nioxin Follicle Therapy, I will use this and the Root Lifter before blow drying and the volume I get is fabulous...comparable to the Big Sexy Hair and TIGI products I used before diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  </li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;rabbit fur&amp;#34;, stick straight hair keeps its shape for a WEEK  and stays shiny!  </li>
            <li>and it is very STICKY!</li>
            <li>It was becoming more and more difficult to find it in beauty shops and stores.</li>
            <li>The two bottles I purchased from this offer must have been exposed to too much heat here in the our Hot Arizona climate.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and love it.  </li>
            <li>It certainly keeps my hair from blowing around and keeps it straight-ish</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m here to tell you that this product truly makes your hair very shiney.</li>
            <li>I ordered this bottle because the picture shows the Nioxin I bought, and really like, at a store in Miami.</li>
            <li>She really likes it and says it gives a lot of body and volume to her hair.</li>
            <li>My beautician  isn&#x27;t keeping much of anything in stock anymore</li>
            <li>This spray helps add volume to my thin hair and is a great addition to my hair care routine.  </li>
            <li>But, it did absolutely nothing to thicken my hair.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very medicated smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on Amazon after finding that it was no longer available in local stores.</li>
            <li>it stayed straight and coated my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>As such, I expected this to be a good product.</li>
            <li>I constantly need a hair-thickening product for my fine hair to look decent.</li>
            <li>The phone numbers and manufacturer are different from my original bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find where I live, so when I found it at Amazon, I was delighted to order and not have to search in nearby towns for it.</li>
            <li>When I went back to the store to stock up, they&#x27;d stopped carrying it, so I tried Big Sexy foam spray, which I&#x27;d rate a 4-star.  </li>
            <li>I would have returned it, but since the purchase price was only about $7, it wasn&#x27;t worth the return shipping cost to do that.</li>
            <li>Will not dry hair, and gives hair a real fullness that is very manageable.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old female with fine brown hair that is colored blond, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I love the thickening spray and when paired up with some of the other products I definitely get the look I want.</li>
            <li>I actually thought it would work a little better but it works alright.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and it was Crystal Clear.  </li>
            <li>It was not crystal clear when I unpacked it.</li>
            <li>should be clear like water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It adds real body to my baby-fine curly hair and I will definitely keep it in my repertoire.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my 50 year old thinning hair.</li>
            <li>THERE IS NO STICKY RESIDUE WHICH KEEPS MY STYLE SOFT .</li>
            <li>It seems as though I have to use a good bit to get any thickening since my hair is starting to thin.  </li>
            <li>Its much better than bargain brand hairspray which left my hair stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li>The packaging was the same but the product was yellow and has a different smell and consistancy than the genuine product.it also does not perform the same.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it would have done is give my hair a little stiffness (people with fine hair will understand this)so when I used a curling iron on it</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for hairspray.  </li>
            <li>maybe the directions need to be more clear, maybe I used it wrong?  </li>

            <li> Kind of expensive for hairspray.  </li>
            <li> maybe the directions need to be more clear, maybe I used it wrong?  </li>
            <li> The product was not exactly what I was looking for but came in a close 2nd place.  </li>
            <li> needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, earlier this year, I noticed that my hair started falling out - turned out that it was due to undiagnosed Hypothyroidism.  </li>
            <li> no oil, so for someone like me who washes her hair about 3 times a week, having a product that I can re-spray on my dry hair in the morning to re-style it with the blow-dryer is a MUST.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel dry and sticky</li>
            <li> The only reason why I knew that it wasn&#x27;t water is because it has a slight chemical smell to it (which goes away when it&#x27;s dry).  </li>
            <li> It also fails to plump my fine, blond hair as well as the old formula: perhaps I imagine it, but it seems that the dirty yellow tone is left in my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t say that it was a product that built up on your hair (like some thickeners need to do over a few weeks using it daily)</li>
            <li> I started using this after I had been using other Nioxin products for a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in it and other volumizers.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I&#x27;m not happy with the way the product is bottled, it didn&#x27;t spray as a normal hair spray</li>
            <li> After washing my hair I sprayed this product on my towel dried hair &amp; blew it dry.  </li>
            <li> To my disappointment, the new Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives was not the same as the old Volumizing Reflectives: the ingredients list has changed, and the new liquid has a dirty, yellowish tone.</li>
            <li> I particularly like it for the hair around my face that has gotten very thin.</li>
            <li> But it came in a different bottle with a very hard to read label.</li>
            <li> Gives volume without weighing hair down!</li>
            <li> This product was not genuine nioxin thickening spray.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a boost without being heavy.  </li>
            <li> Have been buying this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Either way, my purchase was a waste of money: I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> (usually it&#x27;s curly and tends to frizz.).</li>
            <li> only used this once as it was useless.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the other reviews I thought I was going to become addicted to this product</li>
            <li> Instead was a very pale brown.  </li>
            <li> The contents of this one are sticky and it made my hair hard, although it could be shaped.</li>
            <li> The entire Nioxin line, although very expensive, has made a noticeable difference in the thickness and appearance of my naturally-curly hair.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> No happy at all with that.</li>
            <li> i have thin hair thickens</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to people with thin hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very thin in the front and temple section.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s unpleasant and</li>
            <li> and I get very bad drandruff with it.</li>
            <li> but it is awful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Excellent product!!  Adds a lot of volume to my hair.  I use it along with the cleanser and scalp conditioner and it makes my hair seem a lot thicker.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin products for three years because of hair loss after surgery. I had not tried the thickening spray but since trying it , it will be part of my daily hair care. thanks</li>
            <li> My baby-fine hair now stands up for itself.  Vigor and volume in  hot/humid Alabama.  I&#x27;ve never had \\&quot;real\\&quot; hair until my hairdresser handed me a bottle of Nioxin and said \\&quot;Try this.\\&quot;  He was right--it holds up until the next shampoo.      At this sale price,$8.39,  you can&#x27;t go on with hair in your eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorite.  Makes my hair fuller with no stick residue.  I have used it for many years, along with all Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it after using the Nioxin System 4 products and the Nioxin Follicle Therapy, I will use this and the Root Lifter before blow drying and the volume I get is fabulous...comparable to the Big Sexy Hair and TIGI products I used before diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  I will then take my curling iron to touch-up and smooth my cowlicks and curl the ends inward to frame my face and to finish off my style I will take a pea sized dollup of the Nioxin Finishing Creme and rub it between both hands and then smooth through my hair, starting at the ends and back first then over the front and top (this way I don&#x27;t get that greasy look).  I use the Finishing Creme to fight fly aways and frizz from the humidity since I live on the Gulf Coast.  I love the thickening spray and when paired up with some of the other products I definitely get the look I want.</li>
            <li> I constantly need a hair-thickening product for my fine hair to look decent. While I used a lot of other products and this one is not the best one out of them, it&#x27;s still pretty good and brings good results, and I had been using it for a couple years.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair I sprayed this product on my towel dried hair &amp; blew it dry.  I could not believe what it did.  While blow drying I noticed right away that my comb or brush I was using at the time went right through my hair without pulling at all on my very fine hair &amp; it made it look thicker.  This right there was just wonderful.  After my hair was completely dry from the blow drying my hair layed so nicely.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff.  The only thing I wish it would have done is give my hair a little stiffness (people with fine hair will understand this)so when I used a curling iron on it the curl would stay.  But I&#x27;m here to tell you that this product truly makes your hair very shiney.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT a 5-star poster, but this product beats all.  My &amp;#34;rabbit fur&amp;#34;, stick straight hair keeps its shape for a WEEK  and stays shiny!  When I went back to the store to stock up, they&#x27;d stopped carrying it, so I tried Big Sexy foam spray, which I&#x27;d rate a 4-star.  I was thrilled that my search on Amazon located it so I can stock up.</li>
            <li> This product was not genuine nioxin thickening spray. The packaging was the same but the product was yellow and has a different smell and consistancy than the genuine product.it also does not perform the same.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle because the picture shows the Nioxin I bought, and really like, at a store in Miami. But it came in a different bottle with a very hard to read label. The phone numbers and manufacturer are different from my original bottle. The contents of this one are sticky and it made my hair hard, although it could be shaped. It certainly keeps my hair from blowing around and keeps it straight-ish (usually it&#x27;s curly and tends to frizz.). But it&#x27;s unpleasant and I know I will toss out all 3 bottles I bought. What a waste.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have used it for years and excited I can get it this way.  It was becoming more and more difficult to find it in beauty shops and stores.</li>
            <li> I have thinning fine hair and have used this product for a couple of years. This order was for our daughter who has very fine straight hair. She really likes it and says it gives a lot of body and volume to her hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly new product for me... and I am extremely pleased.  Works well and makes styling easier for my fine hair.  I have found you do not have to use it on a daily basis for it to work.  I use it about every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it was Crystal Clear.  The two bottles I purchased from this offer must have been exposed to too much heat here in the our Hot Arizona climate. It was not crystal clear when I unpacked it. It was discolored with a light beige/brown tint. I&#x27;m debating  weather to send it back or not.</li>
            <li> When I saw the other reviews I thought I was going to become addicted to this product butI haven&#x27;t is okay and I get very bad drandruff with it. It does thinkicking and give you voulume but you have to wash your hair the next day .</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel stiff. Was not happy with the product. I wish I had not purchased it now.</li>
            <li> I started using this after I had been using other Nioxin products for a while.  It gives my hair a boost without being heavy.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in it and other volumizers.  It&#x27;s hard to find where I live, so when I found it at Amazon, I was delighted to order and not have to search in nearby towns for it.</li>
            <li> The product was not exactly what I was looking for but came in a close 2nd place.  Its much better than bargain brand hairspray which left my hair stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> I actually thought it would work a little better but it works alright.  It seems as though I have to use a good bit to get any thickening since my hair is starting to thin.  And, since I do have to use a good bit, it gets a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Been losing hair, hair is thinning, thought this would be helpful. Dissapointing. No improvement noticed. My hairdressers husband had been using it for months and it hadnt worked for him either,</li>
            <li> And the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;It adds real body to my baby-fine curly hair and I will definitely keep it in my repertoire.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sticky and my curling iron gets stuck in my hair.  Does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! WARNING!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product and I am pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and love it.  I like alot of Nioxin products and hope they don&#x27;t discontinue them.  My beautician  isn&#x27;t keeping much of anything in stock anymore so I have to find my products anywhere I can.  I have had good luck using this outlet as a way in getting products and am very thankful.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but this one is the best. Although it is a bit &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This spray helps add volume to my thin hair and is a great addition to my hair care routine.  I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  But I can no longer find it in my local beauty supply stores!  So I bought it here.  Sure hope this does not mean that the company is discontinuing this product!</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product for a few years now. Will not dry hair, and gives hair a real fullness that is very manageable.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for someone like me who has very thin, fine hair - I cannot fix my hair without it - it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The product it self might be good, the shipment was quick but unfortunately I&#x27;m not happy with the way the product is bottled, it didn&#x27;t spray as a normal hair spray it came out a big stream. No happy at all with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nioxin product &amp;#34;Diamax&amp;#34;. This one gives a lot more for your money and the effect seems to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;This spray holds without being sticky or dulling. If you&#x27;re a Nioxin user, this is a good choice for control and added body.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It leaves your hair bouncy, soft and smelling nice.  It has no alcohol (which to me, is a HUGE concern as it makes hair dry and full of static), no oil, so for someone like me who washes her hair about 3 times a week, having a product that I can re-spray on my dry hair in the morning to re-style it with the blow-dryer is a MUST.  No build-up, no stickiness, no oily feeling.  As a bonus: it&#x27;s affordable and comes in a decent-sized bottle!  A winner in my book! And so are the hairspray and mousse.  Great line of products!</li>
            <li> Just a soon as I sprayed this on, my hair felt thicker. I particularly like it for the hair around my face that has gotten very thin.</li>
            <li> This product really thickens your hair - to the point that I can only use it every few days.  The entire Nioxin line, although very expensive, has made a noticeable difference in the thickness and appearance of my naturally-curly hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order this, you will get something completely different - as this product is no longer made.  Call to be sure!</li>
            <li> This product actually does exactly what the company claims -- adds volume while leaving hair feeling really nice.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have thin hair thickens it arrived quick i would recommend this product to people with thin hair it does the job</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my 50 year old thinning hair. It feels and looks lovely, and is easily styled.</li>
            <li> SINCE DISCOVERING THIS PRODUCT I HAVE FOUND THAT USING ON A REGULAR BASIS HAS MADE MY HAIR EASIER TO MANAGE. THERE IS NO STICKY RESIDUE WHICH KEEPS MY STYLE SOFT .</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female with fine brown hair that is colored blond, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  All of the women in my family have fine hair, which gets sparse in their older age.  Up until this year, this has not been a problem as my hair was fine but it wasn&#x27;t falling out so I could just use volumizing products to give it the volume that I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, earlier this year, I noticed that my hair started falling out - turned out that it was due to undiagnosed Hypothyroidism.  The doctor put me on meds which leveled out my thryoid, and my hair stopped falling out, which was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I noticed that my hair never grew back from when it fell out initially and it&#x27;s very thin in the front and temple section.  I am trying to decide how to address this - Rogaine?  I bought the Nioxin starter kit for my style of hair but haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  So, I thought, Thickening spray?  Sounds like a good option to get started.  I read the reviews and thought that it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used this once as it was useless.  Basically, it looks like water - it has the color and texture of water.  The only reason why I knew that it wasn&#x27;t water is because it has a slight chemical smell to it (which goes away when it&#x27;s dry).  But, it did absolutely nothing to thicken my hair.  It was like I sprayed water on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t say that it was a product that built up on your hair (like some thickeners need to do over a few weeks using it daily) so I assumed that I would be able to notice a difference after one usage.  I don&#x27;t know - maybe the directions need to be more clear, maybe I used it wrong?  For me, I might as well have sprayed water on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I will not be ordering this product again.  I would have returned it, but since the purchase price was only about $7, it wasn&#x27;t worth the return shipping cost to do that.</li>
            <li> I give this three stars because I can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference and it is very STICKY! It also has a very medicated smell.</li>
            <li> Product colour was off... should be clear like water.  Instead was a very pale brown.  I don&#x27;t believe this is right.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! Gives volume without weighing hair down! I highly recommend it! Excellent price at this site!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Amazon after finding that it was no longer available in local stores. To my disappointment, the new Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives was not the same as the old Volumizing Reflectives: the ingredients list has changed, and the new liquid has a dirty, yellowish tone. It also fails to plump my fine, blond hair as well as the old formula: perhaps I imagine it, but it seems that the dirty yellow tone is left in my hair. Either way, my purchase was a waste of money: I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for hairspray.  bought it to stay withing the product line.  Will not purchase again.  Will take me a while to use it up though.</li>
            <li> I use Nioxin shampoo and conditioner every day. As such, I expected this to be a good product. but it is awful. After putting it on my hair, it feels like I soaked my hair in hair spray.  It made my hair feel dry and sticky and I couldn&#x27;t style it - it stayed straight and coated my curling iron.  I contacted the seller to return the unused bottles and the seller never responded.</li>
