            <li>I love Malibu products...</li>
            <li>Head and shoulders worked better.</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my scalp and have struggled with it for many years.</li>
            <li>so I decided to give it a try, I order it off Amazon and glad I did because I see no dandruff on my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Shampoo smells great and scalp treatment REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>love the shampoo, keeps my hair shining.  </li>
            <li>The Healthy Scalp Kit from Malibu C lowered the amount of dandruff in my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>And if you are looking for hair growth then this shampoo is for you because it has Niacin which increases circulation to the scalp to help promote healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li>In Mist Conditioner also from Malibu C for even more shiny hair, and volume.</li>
            <li>In Mist Conditioner also from Malibu C for even more shiny hair, and volume.</li>
            <li>and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for dry scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair looked great, but if you have a sensitive scalp, I recommend that you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Smells great and shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times and I can tell that that there is a huge reduction in dandruff and frizz because of this.</li>
            <li>No no, the kind of greatness you get from using a product that really refreshes your hair from product build up and the chemicals in water.</li>
            <li>I wanted a shampoo that was sodium sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I like that this product smells great and has lasted me a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be even better if she scrubbed better and left the product on longer, but she&#x27;s 12</li>
            <li>I originally bought this set from my salon, as my hairdresser recommended it for my problematic scalp.  </li>
            <li>ive used a lot of different salon products, but this by far has made my hair and scalp feel the best.</li>
            <li>All my lifetime, I have not known that the water you shower with can have a huge effect on your hair and scalp, and as it turns out, there are harmful minerals that can be very damaging to your scalp and hair, and this Miracle Repair helps by rejuvenating the scalp and cleansing it to make it healthy.</li>

            <li>The Malibu Scalp Wellness kit worked so great the first time I used it, that I have ordered multiple kits and plan on using it forever.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo, when I tried it was not very heavy on my hair which I liked.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the stubborn scalps that don&#x27;t seem to work with any other products.  </li>
            <li>It did keep my hair frizz free for the entire day which I liked</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the Healthy Scalp Kit from Malibu C, and after I have used each of the product I have applied the Leave</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the Healthy Scalp Kit from Malibu C, and after I have used each of the product I have applied the Leave</li>
            <li>I found plaque skin plates reduced in size in some areas, but that is normal after most psoriasis shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot at first, but after two weeks of use I think that I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to it.</li>
            <li>As for the Miracle Repair, the packets were all filled up really good compared to other brands that do not fill their packets well with the product!</li>
            <li>As for the Miracle Repair, the packets were all filled up really good compared to other brands that do not fill their packets well with the product!</li>
            <li>well it&#x27;s probably worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>After I have rinsed out the shampoo, I applied the Scalp Wellness Conditioner that comes along with it and that too smelled like fresh mints.</li>
            <li>Odd to use at first but very effective.</li>
            <li>My scalp was becoming extremely sensitive to hair dye</li>
            <li>Upon the first time using this shampoo my hair and scalp</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner that has stopped my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>Skin flakes did not disappear, also normal with most natural online products used by me.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped us both!</li>
            <li>so the first doctor had me taking 1200mg of calcium a day and never checked my calcium, if I hadn&#x27;t changed doctor</li>
            <li>The nicest thing about the product is that the packaging is pretty.  </li>
            <li>My personal favorite out of the 4 products is the Scalp Therapy Wellness Remedy.</li>
            <li>I found that this product helped soothe my scalp and is gentle enough to use more than once a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but since it&#x27;s effective and cleans</li>
            <li>I even went to the extremes of shaving all my hair off in an attempt to treat the psoraisis straight on.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>This is gentle for my seven year month and for my scalp as well.</li>
            <li>I had so much dandruff, my scalp was just like a bag of corn meal, one day I parted my hair to the scalp and dandruff were like a cake of corn bread</li>
            <li>Yes, my dermatologist wants me to keep using it, instead of steroid shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will not spend so much money on this again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The shampoo that is in the kit has a very refreshing scent and so does the conditioner that comes along with it, very long lasting fragrance too, almost like minty perfume for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin to begin with, and my scalp is prone to dandruff and light psoriasis in the back of the scalp.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt like new and was very manigable, and my scalp felt smooth and didnt have all the dry skin from psoraisis.</li>
            <li>but I try an stay away from high calcium food.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from scalp allergies.</li>
            <li>so right now I&#x27;m only using the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I have spent $$$$ on medicated shampoos, scalp treatments, steroid treatments,  laser light treatments,  and every conceivable name-brand shampoo/conditioner/treatments on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as being natural, the shampoo is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I am now on antibiotics to try to heal them up, and using Free and Clear Shampoo and conditioner that I bought at Walgreens and read about on other sites.  </li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and dry because of the minerals, and this has helped my hair feel very soft and smooth with now frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and dry because of the minerals, and this has helped my hair feel very soft and smooth with now frizz.</li>
            <li>My scalp just must be too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at their customer service.</li>
            <li>I like the soft minty fragrance that is not overpowering</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never suffered from any permanent skin condition until I started coloring my hair.  </li>
            <li>No one can really understand what it feels like to have your scalp constantly itch until you go through it yourself.  </li>
            <li>I got this product because my scalp had been more dry then normal because of the harsh winter.</li>
            <li>sub. dermatitis and this is just not the right thing for my long, blonde locks!  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because once these scalp treatments ran out I really didn&#x27;t notice any lasting change in my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li>It looks a little weird when you first use it and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the shampoo</li>
            <li>It would take at least 3 more tries (but I have only 2 left thanks to defective packing) to find out if after 4 shampoos there are fewer flakes.</li>
            <li>I live in Glendale,CA but still no luck with dry scalp.</li>
            <li>And regardless of whether that&#x27;s true or false or still the case or not, I would have to say my scalp ultimately got worse as a result of using this product rather than better.</li>

            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never suffered from any permanent skin condition until I started coloring my hair.  </li>
            <li> No one can really understand what it feels like to have your scalp constantly itch until you go through it yourself.  </li>
            <li> I got this product because my scalp had been more dry then normal because of the harsh winter.</li>
            <li> sub. dermatitis and this is just not the right thing for my long, blonde locks!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because once these scalp treatments ran out I really didn&#x27;t notice any lasting change in my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> It looks a little weird when you first use it and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the shampoo</li>
            <li> It would take at least 3 more tries (but I have only 2 left thanks to defective packing) to find out if after 4 shampoos there are fewer flakes.</li>
            <li> I live in Glendale,CA but still no luck with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> And regardless of whether that&#x27;s true or false or still the case or not, I would have to say my scalp ultimately got worse as a result of using this product rather than better.</li>

            <li> However, I&#x27;m not optimistic about the product producing any long term benefit.    </li>
            <li> a long letter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural haired, black girl (4b/4c) who was dealing with an extremely itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp where aching is a problem</li>
            <li> It did help me alot with my dry scalp and dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I said that to say I do believe deep down in my heart that dandruff is build up calcium.</li>
            <li> The strength was not the same as previous products bought elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Before buying Malibu I tried different stuff with Tea Tree Oil in Oliver Oil to oil my scalp because black people has to keep their scalp oiled.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have bleached blonde hair, so it kinda feels a little dry after showering.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp with sores like psoriasis on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Extreme itching, very dry scalp, and bumps.</li>
            <li> 8/15/15--I feel a need to warn people about using this product in lieu of what a dermatologist might recommend or some other product.</li>
            <li> I have used all of the T-Gel /T-Sal products, Head and shoulders, and any other OTC product you can buy.</li>
            <li> Malibu has kept me out of the doctor&#x27;s office and by the way I only used three packs of the conditioner in the small gray pack</li>
            <li> not sure if this effected my scalp with the heater machine they use at the salon, but now my itchy flaky scalp is back.</li>
            <li> The bottles are extremely small for the big price.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is helping the psoriasis as I also started using the water softener at the same time.</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived, I tried it and the the treatment in the little dry package.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a water softener for our Florida home due to very hard water.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner does not leave any heavy residue on my hair after rinsing.</li>
            <li> and I have a small amount of flakes, and after a few uses of this conditioner, I can see that they are now reduced, and I am not scratching my scalp all day.</li>
            <li> Sorry but despite the other reviews 2 of my children used this with high hopes but one got scales even worse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also getting away from products containing sulfates which are very harsh and drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Along with the antibiotics, my scalp is slowly healing.  </li>
            <li> I would encourage anyone who suffers from dry, itchy scalp to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It is time consuming and expensive to return products and Amazon needs to provide a way for customers to ask merchants to send missing parts in cases like this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I wasted $20 and now can&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li> My scalp itched worse after using this.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately this did not work.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible scalp psoriasis and initially when I started using this, I found it to help a lot, then after I got my hair colored...</li>
            <li> Sorry Malibu Wellness people!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was especially disappointed considering the cost...</li>
            <li> My daughter has horrible dandruff and has about 70% reduction with this product.  </li>
            <li> Just feels horrible and does nothing to my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Upon the first time using this shampoo my hair and scalp felt healthier and moisturized! Love it, will order more!</li>
            <li> I got this product because my scalp had been more dry then normal because of the harsh winter. This also had a lot of good reviews from others with a multitude of scalp issues.  I like that this product smells great and has lasted me a long time (a little goes a long way even though it doesn&#x27;t lather up much).  The scalp treatments packets are the best part. It looks a little weird when you first use it and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the shampoo but once you rinse it out there is no scent leftover. Your scalp feels refreshed and your hair feels softer.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because once these scalp treatments ran out I really didn&#x27;t notice any lasting change in my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> Ok so this product is god in a bottle. Ive struggled with psoraisis for years and have tried everything under the sun. I even went to the extremes of shaving all my hair off in an attempt to treat the psoraisis straight on. After one use of this product in the shower and my scalp and hair fell awsome!!! And trust me ive used a lot of different salon products, but this by far has made my hair and scalp feel the best. To put it into even more perspective for you i have bleached blonde hair, so it kinda feels a little dry after showering. Not with this product however, it really makes it feel great. And not that \\&quot;overly moisturized great\\&quot;. No no, the kind of greatness you get from using a product that really refreshes your hair from product build up and the chemicals in water. My hair felt like new and was very manigable, and my scalp felt smooth and didnt have all the dry skin from psoraisis.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to relieve an itchy scalp and it provided relief. I&#x27;m also getting away from products containing sulfates which are very harsh and drying to the skin. It&#x27;s a little pricey but since it&#x27;s effective and cleans well it&#x27;s probably worth it. I also appreciate that it&#x27;s a Vegan product but it smells like mint toothpaste. I&#x27;d prefer a more traditional fragrance but can understand the use of a natural fragrance over an artificial one. The crystal packets that come with the set are mean&#x27;t to be used once a week. Odd to use at first but very effective. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all for my psoriasis.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry scalp. Worked miracles for me.  Have purchased multiple times</li>
            <li> I love Malibu products...but unfortunately this did not work.  My scalp itched worse after using this.  My scalp just must be too sensitive.  I was especially disappointed considering the cost...Head and shoulders worked better.</li>
            <li> Smells good and minty, not like medicine.  Works pretty well.  My daughter has horrible dandruff and has about 70% reduction with this product.  I&#x27;m sure it would be even better if she scrubbed better and left the product on longer, but she&#x27;s 12 so.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner that has stopped my scalp itch. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> The strength was not the same as previous products bought elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This kit was to come with 4 packets of massagecrystals so it could be tested as to effectiveness for 4 weeks.  My kit arrived with only 3 packets, thus defective!  It is time consuming and expensive to return products and Amazon needs to provide a way for customers to ask merchants to send missing parts in cases like this one.  I have kept this and tried it out for one shampoo. I found plaque skin plates reduced in size in some areas, but that is normal after most psoriasis shampoos I have used. Skin flakes did not disappear, also normal with most natural online products used by me.  It would take at least 3 more tries (but I have only 2 left thanks to defective packing) to find out if after 4 shampoos there are fewer flakes. The conditioner makes the hair fell silky and good. However, I&#x27;m not optimistic about the product producing any long term benefit.    8/15/15--I feel a need to warn people about using this product in lieu of what a dermatologist might recommend or some other product. The reason is that I saw online somewhere that this has been or is being removed from production. And regardless of whether that&#x27;s true or false or still the case or not, I would have to say my scalp ultimately got worse as a result of using this product rather than better.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I have used all of the T-Gel /T-Sal products, Head and shoulders, and any other OTC product you can buy. I have eczema on my scalp and have struggled with it for many years. I also have well water.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp does not itch or flake with use of this product..&lt;br /&gt;Worth the Money!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been having itchy scalp, so I thought this would be a good option. As soon as it arrived, I tried it and the the treatment in the little dry package.  My scalp became severely inflamed and the next day it broke out with several sores.  I am now on antibiotics to try to heal them up, and using Free and Clear Shampoo and conditioner that I bought at Walgreens and read about on other sites.  Along with the antibiotics, my scalp is slowly healing.  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted $20 and now can&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo for my daughters scalp eczema and my psoriasis. I wanted a shampoo that was sodium sulfate free. This is gentle for my seven year month and for my scalp as well. The smell is very pleasant. This cleanses my scalp without irritation. It seems as if our psoriasis and eczema are gone! But I also use essential oils( almond, coconut, and shea butter, and jojoba oil.) so that may help too. This has really helped us both!</li>
            <li> I had so much dandruff, my scalp was just like a bag of corn meal, one day I parted my hair to the scalp and dandruff were like a cake of corn bread so I got so scared until I thought to just run to my doctor, instead of going to my doctor I did some online research and came across Malibu, I read so many good feedbacks about Malibu so I decided to give it a try, I order it off Amazon and glad I did because I see no dandruff on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like to point out is that the doctor I WAS going to had me taking 1200mg of calcium a day and wnen I changed doctor doing my yearly exam he sent me my report and my calcium level were 10.3 so the first doctor had me taking 1200mg of calcium a day and never checked my calcium, if I hadn&#x27;t changed doctor I wouldn&#x27;t know my calcium were up, so you know the rest, I sent the doctor and the clinic a long letter.&lt;br /&gt;So I said that to say I do believe deep down in my heart that dandruff is build up calcium. Before buying Malibu I tried different stuff with Tea Tree Oil in Oliver Oil to oil my scalp because black people has to keep their scalp oiled.&lt;br /&gt;I used Malibu once a week, I used about 5 drops of Tea Tree Oil in Oliver Oil twice a week and I watch my calcium intake,&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know yet what my calcium is until my next exam but I try an stay away from high calcium food. Malibu has kept me out of the doctor&#x27;s office and by the way I only used three packs of the conditioner in the small gray pack so right now I&#x27;m only using the shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;m so happy I can touch the sky.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I bought it from a salon and ran out. Purchased on Amazon with the conditioner. The shampoo is excellent but the conditioner is horrible. It does not smell like the one purchased in store. Just feels horrible and does nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot at first, but after two weeks of use I think that I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to it. Extreme itching, very dry scalp, and bumps. My hair looked great, but if you have a sensitive scalp, I recommend that you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Shampoo smells great and scalp treatment REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s just a shampoo and a conditioner, you shouldn&#x27;t expect any miracle. That being said, this product works as advertised and gets you enough for what you paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at their customer service. The product was delivered with some defection, but the shop promptly addressed the problem.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Smells great and shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Sorry but despite the other reviews 2 of my children used this with high hopes but one got scales even worse! So after showing the dermatologist these products he said go to Neutrogena T-SAL (not gel) and so far so good! Sorry Malibu Wellness people!</li>
            <li> love the shampoo, keeps my hair shining.  The conditioner does not leave any heavy residue on my hair after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I have terrible scalp psoriasis and initially when I started using this, I found it to help a lot, then after I got my hair colored... not sure if this effected my scalp with the heater machine they use at the salon, but now my itchy flaky scalp is back. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it until I run out and see if it starts to work again. Otherwise i&#x27;ll try another product.</li>
            <li> This product is great! worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the stubborn scalps that don&#x27;t seem to work with any other products.  Better than Head and Shoulders and Tea Tree Oil!</li>
            <li> My scalp was becoming extremely sensitive to hair dye &amp; I would develop blisters after having it dyed.  I found that this product helped soothe my scalp and is gentle enough to use more than once a week. I like the soft minty fragrance that is not overpowering and my had also feels great!</li>
            <li> This was bought for me by my mom this Christmas because Nioxin Scalp Recovery was all sold out.  The Malibu C product is not working.  I&#x27;m itchy and flaky and it doesn&#x27;t have good de-tangling properties.  The bottles are extremely small for the big price.  The nicest thing about the product is that the packaging is pretty.  I have psoriasis and sub. dermatitis and this is just not the right thing for my long, blonde locks!  Buyer beware!  Go buy Nioxin Scalp Recovery!</li>
            <li> I recently bought a water softener for our Florida home due to very hard water.  The Culligan man mentioned that his wife is a hairdresser and always uses a Malibu Treatment on her clients before she will color their hair.  I have a very dry scalp with sores like psoriasis on my scalp.  This shampoo seems to help keep the build up off my scalp.  You only need a little bit.  I like the smell.  I am not sure if it is helping the psoriasis as I also started using the water softener at the same time.</li>
            <li> Yes, my dermatologist wants me to keep using it, instead of steroid shampoo.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I live in Glendale,CA but still no luck with dry scalp. I will not spend so much money on this again.</li>
            <li> This is a bit pricey for shampoo, but it is a very good shampoo and conditioner.  The salts that come with it are also good for the scalp.  I originally bought this set from my salon, as my hairdresser recommended it for my problematic scalp.  I have very sensitive skin to begin with, and my scalp is prone to dandruff and light psoriasis in the back of the scalp.  This shampoo and conditioner does not aggravate either condition, and it even has a pleasant fragrance.  It is also totally vegan - no animal fats or products are used in it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner/treatment for scalp psoriasis - period.  I have spent $$$$ on medicated shampoos, scalp treatments, steroid treatments,  laser light treatments,  and every conceivable name-brand shampoo/conditioner/treatments on the market. Nothing comes close to the RELIEF I feel after using the Malibu Scalp Wellness kit.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never suffered from any permanent skin condition until I started coloring my hair.  No one can really understand what it feels like to have your scalp constantly itch until you go through it yourself.  It&#x27;s horrible to say the least.  The Malibu Scalp Wellness kit worked so great the first time I used it, that I have ordered multiple kits and plan on using it forever.  It smells great and leave my hair looking great as well.  I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from scalp allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural haired, black girl (4b/4c) who was dealing with an extremely itchy scalp.  The minute I used this product, I felt relief.  I would encourage anyone who suffers from dry, itchy scalp to give it a try.  I even convinced my mother to use it and she likes it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as being natural, the shampoo is very drying.  However, I use the shampoo and then immediately use the conditioner afterwards. (If necessary, I use another brand to deep condition after I use the Malibu C conditioner-Giovanni or Eden Bodyworks).</li>
            <li> The Healthy Scalp Kit from Malibu C lowered the amount of dandruff in my scalp and hair. The shampoo that is in the kit has a very refreshing scent and so does the conditioner that comes along with it, very long lasting fragrance too, almost like minty perfume for your hair. Nothing too over powering though, don&#x27;t worry! The shampoo, when I tried it was not very heavy on my hair which I liked. It was the good kind where it is liquidy which is very cooling to the scalp, and spreads very easily. I liked the glossy shine that it gave throughout my hair. This has Rosemary which prevents flaking and itching on the scalp. And if you are looking for hair growth then this shampoo is for you because it has Niacin which increases circulation to the scalp to help promote healthy hair growth. I also liked how this can help with the damaging minerals that come from the water you shower with that end up on your hair and scalp. After I have rinsed out the shampoo, I applied the Scalp Wellness Conditioner that comes along with it and that too smelled like fresh mints. I applied the conditioner to the ends of my roots where it gave a shine, and later on, reduced my frizz. I have a dry scalp where aching is a problem and I have a small amount of flakes, and after a few uses of this conditioner, I can see that they are now reduced, and I am not scratching my scalp all day. Also my ends of my hair do look fuller which is good and that does help with hair growth. My personal favorite out of the 4 products is the Scalp Therapy Wellness Remedy. I liked this because of the application and the effects. It did help me alot with my dry scalp and dandruff problem. I have used it 3 times and I can tell that that there is a huge reduction in dandruff and frizz because of this. It did keep my hair frizz free for the entire day which I liked and I suggest anyone with scalp issues to buy it and use it once a week for relief. I love that this is just basically ascorbic acid or nourishing Vitamin C! I loved the easy application with the crystals and you apply water and create the gel like cream however you want. As for the Miracle Repair, the packets were all filled up really good compared to other brands that do not fill their packets well with the product! The product itself smoothed on very easily on my scalp. All my lifetime, I have not known that the water you shower with can have a huge effect on your hair and scalp, and as it turns out, there are harmful minerals that can be very damaging to your scalp and hair, and this Miracle Repair helps by rejuvenating the scalp and cleansing it to make it healthy. My hair is coarse and dry because of the minerals, and this has helped my hair feel very soft and smooth with now frizz. Overall, I love the Healthy Scalp Kit from Malibu C, and after I have used each of the product I have applied the Leave In Mist Conditioner also from Malibu C for even more shiny hair, and volume.I loved the easy application with the crystals and you apply water and create the gel like cream however you want.
