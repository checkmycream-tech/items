    <ol>
            <li>I purchased this for travel to Beijing and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I was riding in a car where someone was smoking, I put the mask on, adjusted the nose area, and it worked perfectly to keep the smoke out.  </li>
            <li>They are THE best choice out there.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>This mask fits perfectly and works well for what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li>no sneezing, no itchy ears, nose and throat and, best of all, NO ANTIBIOTICS/STEROIDS.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine trying to walk around town or cycle, as is advertised, and I am in excellent shape</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality or the breathability of the mask.</li>
            <li>This is a fashionable way to avoid catching my co-workers colds!!</li>
            <li>She does have difficulty with it fogging glasses while wearing them no matter how she adjusts the mask but is happy to have it.</li>
            <li>Great for the garden, park, concerts and even on the plane when I travel.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this mask fits her perfectly.</li>
            <li>fits good.</li>
            <li>but I can look good doing it.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved it</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautifully made, comfortable and attractive.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how attractive they are, and how well they work.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it fits great, keeps warm, and does not bother the ears.  </li>
            <li>I guess i will keep it until i find another mask with more quality!</li>
            <li>and i love the colors too!</li>
            <li>It kept me warm and warmed my breathing.</li>
            <li>that it holds nicely on the nose</li>
            <li>so I catch colds very easy.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable around the ears.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, breath fairly well, and keep the fine dust out of your mouth and nose.</li>
            <li>I bought one to test, and ended up buying two more.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and design of this mask.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this mask!&lt;br /&gt;Although, I would prefer to go maskless-&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>is the next best way !!!</li>
            <li>Cute color,&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>So, most years I can&#x27;t even go outdoors during the spring without having severe allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>The best part is I will use this again for several years.</li>
            <li>I love my vogmasks.</li>
            <li>My patients love this mask also all my co-workers I would reccomend this to everyone although i think it shouldve come 2 in a pack for the price.</li>
            <li>I looked for a more effective, comfortable and permanent mask and found the Vogmask.</li>
            <li>have two and will be buying more of them.</li>
            <li>This mask is wonderful to use while I dust and vacuum.</li>
            <li>Thanks Vogmask, I&#x27;ll gladly spread the word!!</li>
            <li>so I could dust and clean and still breathe!</li>
            <li>All except that it goes in and out, as you breath, so that looks kind of funny!</li>
            <li>vogmask with filter is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, soft to my sensitive skin, color is perfect and most of all washable.</li>
            <li>This style, however, is light, comfortable, and I can easily tuck the &#x27;chin&#x27; piece under, so</li>
            <li>This mask is comfortable and does help when people are smoking.</li>
            <li>It is a considerate habit which those of us in the US could well emulate and with a comfortable inexpensive mask like this is doable.</li>
            <li>I wore this mask to protect against the dust storms of BRC and it fit the bill.</li>
            <li>None of those work for me, I end up gasping and ripping it off in a fit of claustrophobia.</li>
            <li>And it is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>tighter weave filtered better than the organic cotton which I was first attracted to.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for cleaning the litterbox and would say it is a nice, easy-on reusable mask for that brief purpose.</li>
            <li>I am severely, really severely allergic to exhaust fumes, perfumes, dust and more.</li>
            <li>I have been able to breathe the whole time without smelling anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cant say enough good things.</li>
            <li>My brave husband wore this very mask when he was brave enough to go to our mountain cabin that had lost power to empty the refrigerator &amp; sweep needles from the roof.</li>
            <li>Many people bought more regulation masks but were too claustrophobia like me to actually use them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll walk more slowly on polluted days in order to wear it and spare my lungs the junk.&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature: the way it fits adjustably to the nose and cheeks keeps it from fogging my glasses most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Of coarse nothing keeps all smells out, but pretty good.</li>
            <li>My allergies are calm when wearing this mask.</li>
            <li>And they look pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>The temperature was not cold</li>
            <li>Do lots of woodworking and burn through a box of paper masks pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the fun and pretty patterns of the microfiber</li>
            <li>My daughter has to wear this to avoid germs it helps with that and exposure to the cold keeping her asthma at bay wonderfully,  thank you for creating a fantastic product that is fashionably acceptable</li>
            <li>I love this new product and new company Vogmask.</li>
            <li>I really like the mask!</li>
            <li>I first ordered a purple flowered Vogmask because of an allergy cough I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Long story short, they worked great.</li>
            <li>First, I went to the Dixie Stampede and the mask worked well for keeping out the dust.</li>
            <li>We had the ability to test out the mask the other day in a high dust environment and found this mask to work much, much better than even one of those fine particulate cloth masks.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable (a little warm on a hot day), has kept my lungs and sinuses clear.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the size would be too large for her since those paper and cloth face masks certainly are.</li>
            <li>This is only good for short bursts of activity, like cleaning the litterbox or quickly spraying plants/ants outside.</li>
            <li>He especially liked that he could instantly wash it out &amp; put it on wet making breathing easier in our very dry air.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My wife and I bought a pair of these for Burning Man and found them to work very well in a variety of conditions.</li>
            <li>work very well.</li>
            <li>And it really does help keep the coughing away.</li>
            <li>They were comfortable enough that it wasn&#x27;t a pain to wear them</li>
            <li>even then if it is really humid they are going to anyway</li>
            <li>I normally keep a towel in my car to quickly put up to my mouth when a toxic vehicle comes near me.</li>
            <li>Then I saw the other colors and decided to get a couple more</li>
            <li>so I could more or less match the mask with my outfits.</li>
            <li>When I got mine last week I put it on and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was to wear, even for hours at a time.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the part that goes under the chin.</li>
            <li>The main defect was from a support wire which would poke through the end of the fabric and then scratch my face.  </li>
            <li>so I figure that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>There are several different types from Vogmask, but mind was a microfiber mask that was very soft and vibrant on the outside, but it had a backing on the inside that did some serious filtering and fit on my face just great.</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfy don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on get lots of compliments from patients</li>
            <li>Best thing to have in Beijing for cold and smog!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long that little piece of metal inside will last, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>my mouth is clear.</li>
            <li>It does really well at filtering smoke unless a person is standing next to you smoking.</li>
            <li>Second very flimsy, one of the straps snapped.</li>
            <li>One Saturday, working on an art project, I wore a paper mask all day and discovered I had FAR fewer problems that night sleeping.</li>
            <li>I wear this whenever I am in a situation where allergens are present and it has helped SO much.  </li>
            <li>Pretty mask, but the usage is very limited.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li>This could most likely be prevented by placing a small rubber tip on the end of the wire prior to being sewed up.</li>
            <li>It had the exact same effect to me, as a simple white mask a dentist might use.</li>
            <li>It was clear, after use, that this was working as the outside of the mask was caked in dust, yet there was no dust on the inside of the mask.</li>

            <li> Breathing was never and issue and it was FAR easier than the other method that I brought (over the head construction filter masks) because you can snap them onto your ears and over the mouth in seconds without messing up a costume/wig.</li>
            <li> I mean that my allergy doctor had to create a higher dilution for me to start at because I reacted to almost everything they tested with an 11 or 13.</li>
            <li> I have COPD and am very sensitive to heavy particulates in the air.</li>
            <li> cloth is soft to the skin and not to tight.</li>
            <li> Bought a blue one for myself, and a pink one for my wife as she often works with me in the shop.</li>
            <li> The quality of this item was not up to what I expected it to be, especially for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> It does get a little harder to breathe when walking or running because the air flow is limited... but put a fan near you or turn the air vent on above you on the plane and there are no issues.</li>
            <li> For $20 it definitely was not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> ... trip down and back.</li>
            <li> If you start having to breath heavy or keep it on too long you will get short on air and start to feel lightheaded.</li>
            <li> Item as expected.</li>
            <li> so I can be in class the whole two hours without the feeling of being nauseated.</li>
            <li> and you will find it harder to breathe in the mask during thise</li>
            <li> I have COPD and love to gamble but the other mask are so ugly.  </li>
            <li> I feel claustrophobic with most masks, and can&#x27;t stand to wear them.</li>
            <li> First of all, its difficult to breath with this thing on.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews about it working for people that have severe allergies to perfumes,</li>
            <li> This being the case, I cannot imagine it keeping germs or other harmful stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I am still somewhat short of breath, the tightness in my chest is gone, no more coughing at night, no problems breathing.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first due to my disbelief of particle masks feeling okay on your face but Vogmask has proven me wrong and changed the game of how to deal with allergies.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to race go-karts, go the Dixie Stampede, and just walk down the street where there is heavy traffic and car pollution.</li>
            <li> I can understand a little of its horror.</li>
            <li> I found this mask to be very helpful on cold windy days.  </li>
            <li> A few days before I got it</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s so heavy</li>
            <li> breathe!i was having trouble cleaning</li>
            <li> But it also makes it hard to breathe if I&#x27;m doing anything other than walking sedately.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it fogs up glasses pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Too small, not comfortable</li>
            <li> All of the other colors are sold by an off-brand and looks like it leaves serious gaps.</li>
            <li> This is just a little to thick.</li>
            <li> This is really small.  </li>
            <li> Even with cat dander which is microns small.  </li>
            <li> Every year I would end up spending the whole spring sick and on antibiotics &amp; steroids.</li>
            <li> and I could see no reason other than the material must be too thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when these fake masks were added, but look up the pictures from this brand on other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s breathable and washable-very convenient for use in an area with poor air quality.</li>
            <li> or, worse, up stairs?</li>
            <li> All the go-kart fumes came though the mask like it was thin paper.</li>
            <li> It is slightly hard to breathe with the mask on, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad for me, that is sort of the trade off with a mask that should block all these elements out.</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive for a glorified dust mask.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter has to wear this to avoid germs it helps with that and exposure to the cold keeping her asthma at bay wonderfully,  thank you for creating a fantastic product that is fashionably acceptable so my daughter doesn&#x27;t feel so embarrassed to wear her mask in public!  She does have difficulty with it fogging glasses while wearing them no matter how she adjusts the mask but is happy to have it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for travel to Beijing and was very happy with it.  It&#x27;s breathable and washable-very convenient for use in an area with poor air quality.</li>
            <li> vogmask with filter is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Item as expected. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this, it fits great, keeps warm, and does not bother the ears.  I recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> When I ordered my vogmasks online, they arrived in 2 days. I was pleased with how attractive they are, and how well they work.  I was riding in a car where someone was smoking, I put the mask on, adjusted the nose area, and it worked perfectly to keep the smoke out.  When I go downtown, with lots of car exhaust and smoke, I feel I don&#x27;t smell the pollution. They&#x27;re beautifully made, comfortable and attractive.</li>
            <li> I love this new product and new company Vogmask. When I got mine last week I put it on and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was to wear, even for hours at a time. I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first due to my disbelief of particle masks feeling okay on your face but Vogmask has proven me wrong and changed the game of how to deal with allergies. They are THE best choice out there. Believe me, I&#x27;ve looked all over since I&#x27;ve been dealing with allergies for years. Great for the garden, park, concerts and even on the plane when I travel. Thanks Vogmask, I&#x27;ll gladly spread the word!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. I was concerned that the size would be too large for her since those paper and cloth face masks certainly are. Fortunately, this mask fits her perfectly. I particularly like the part that goes under the chin. We had the ability to test out the mask the other day in a high dust environment and found this mask to work much, much better than even one of those fine particulate cloth masks. It was clear, after use, that this was working as the outside of the mask was caked in dust, yet there was no dust on the inside of the mask.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought a pair of these for Burning Man and found them to work very well in a variety of conditions. They are comfortable, breath fairly well, and keep the fine dust out of your mouth and nose. And they look pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> I really like the mask! It definitely keeps pollution out. A few days before I got it I started developing a cough, but as soon as I started wearing it the cough went away. Sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s so heavy I can&#x27;t breath, but it&#x27;s a mask so I figure that&#x27;s normal. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet so I don&#x27;t know if the color will stick.</li>
            <li> I have COPD and am very sensitive to heavy particulates in the air. I feel claustrophobic with most masks, and can&#x27;t stand to wear them. This style, however, is light, comfortable, and I can easily tuck the &#x27;chin&#x27; piece under, so my mouth is clear. It&#x27;s not in the way of the oxygen cannula. I bought one to test, and ended up buying two more.  I like the fun and pretty patterns of the microfiber fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work very well.</li>
            <li> I have COPD and love to gamble but the other mask are so ugly.  This mask is comfortable and does help when people are smoking.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed. I like the color. fits good. works well.  All except that it goes in and out, as you breath, so that looks kind of funny!</li>
            <li> Do lots of woodworking and burn through a box of paper masks pretty quickly. Bought a blue one for myself, and a pink one for my wife as she often works with me in the shop.</li>
            <li> This is really small.  It&#x27;s about the size of my fist. It does not look like the picture. It i about the size of a mans g-string and it looks like that. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfy don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on get lots of compliments from patients and I&#x27;m helping the environment by not using disposable</li>
            <li> I first ordered a purple flowered Vogmask because of an allergy cough I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. Then I saw the other colors and decided to get a couple more so I could more or less match the mask with my outfits. I really like it! And it really does help keep the coughing away.</li>
            <li> I love the color and design of this mask.  Working on not fogging up my glasses. Very comfortable around the ears.</li>
            <li> I love it. Comfortable, soft to my sensitive skin, color is perfect and most of all washable. My allergies are calm when wearing this mask.</li>
            <li> Too small, not comfortable</li>
            <li> Allergies and other particles are making breathing Very Difficult!!! I love this mask!&lt;br /&gt;Although, I would prefer to go maskless-&lt;br /&gt;This is the next best way !!! Cute color,&lt;br /&gt;Nice fabric..</li>
            <li> This mask fits perfectly and works well for what it&#x27;s intended for. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> In Northern California, we have been living in smoke from forest fires for over a month. Many people bought more regulation masks but were too claustrophobia like me to actually use them. In researching, I found that the microfiber masks tighter weave filtered better than the organic cotton which I was first attracted to. My brave husband wore this very mask when he was brave enough to go to our mountain cabin that had lost power to empty the refrigerator &amp; sweep needles from the roof. He especially liked that he could instantly wash it out &amp; put it on wet making breathing easier in our very dry air. We will also use our masks like we saw people in S. Korea doing to prevent the spread of germs. It is a considerate habit which those of us in the US could well emulate and with a comfortable inexpensive mask like this is doable.</li>
            <li> It does really well at filtering smoke unless a person is standing next to you smoking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a spleen so I catch colds very easy.  This is a fashionable way to avoid catching my co-workers colds!!</li>
            <li> Got this because I have HORRIBLE allergies - and by horrible I mean that my allergy doctor had to create a higher dilution for me to start at because I reacted to almost everything they tested with an 11 or 13. HORRIBLE. So, most years I can&#x27;t even go outdoors during the spring without having severe allergic reactions. I&#x27;m talking within minutes of stepping out the door having my eyes swell and itch, ears, nose and throat itch, coughing, sneezing (non-stop), etc. Every year I would end up spending the whole spring sick and on antibiotics &amp; steroids. So, last year I bought this mask. I wore it every time I went outside and...guess what...no sneezing, no itchy ears, nose and throat and, best of all, NO ANTIBIOTICS/STEROIDS.</li>
            <li> The quality of this item was not up to what I expected it to be, especially for the price I paid.  The main defect was from a support wire which would poke through the end of the fabric and then scratch my face.  This could most likely be prevented by placing a small rubber tip on the end of the wire prior to being sewed up.</li>
            <li> This is only good for short bursts of activity, like cleaning the litterbox or quickly spraying plants/ants outside. If you start having to breath heavy or keep it on too long you will get short on air and start to feel lightheaded. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to walk around town or cycle, as is advertised, and I am in excellent shape so it&#x27;s not like my cardiovascular strength is lacking. Pretty mask, but the usage is very limited. If you&#x27;re thinking about wearing this all day or even for longer than 5 minutes forget it. Not to mention it fogs up glasses pretty badly. I use it mostly for cleaning the litterbox and would say it is a nice, easy-on reusable mask for that brief purpose.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the sellers vary per item. The ONLY mask I would recommend is the VOGMASK. The 1st option. All of the other colors are sold by an off-brand and looks like it leaves serious gaps. I think you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you order the cheaper masks. I&#x27;m not sure when these fake masks were added, but look up the pictures from this brand on other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: Easier option. I wore this mask to protect against the dust storms of BRC and it fit the bill. There are several different types from Vogmask, but mind was a microfiber mask that was very soft and vibrant on the outside, but it had a backing on the inside that did some serious filtering and fit on my face just great. Breathing was never and issue and it was FAR easier than the other method that I brought (over the head construction filter masks) because you can snap them onto your ears and over the mouth in seconds without messing up a costume/wig. My bf has the all-cotton one and loves it, although it has faded from the sun and washings. The best part is I will use this again for several years. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Without any way to actually measure the pollution going into my lungs I just have to trust that this is working. I seems to be. But it also makes it hard to breathe if I&#x27;m doing anything other than walking sedately. Going uphill or, worse, up stairs? Walking briskly while holding a conversation? None of those work for me, I end up gasping and ripping it off in a fit of claustrophobia. I have never had asthma, but if it feels like this mask does when I&#x27;m arriving at my 4th floor apartment I can understand a little of its horror. That said, this mask IS removable, so it&#x27;s not too horrible. I&#x27;ll walk more slowly on polluted days in order to wear it and spare my lungs the junk.&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature: the way it fits adjustably to the nose and cheeks keeps it from fogging my glasses most of the time.  (If I&#x27;m talking or moving my face a lot I end up adjusting it every minute or two.)  I don&#x27;t know how long that little piece of metal inside will last, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Cheaper to buy on amazon then the vogmask website. I love my vogmasks. I bought all of mine off of amazon. No complaints. Not not only can I protect myself in style but I can look good doing it.</li>
            <li> Fits well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive for a glorified dust mask. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality or the breathability of the mask. Used it one or twice and don&#x27;t plan on using again.</li>
            <li> Of coarse nothing keeps all smells out, but pretty good. I got this for my cadaver class and it kept the smell out so I can be in class the whole two hours without the feeling of being nauseated.</li>
            <li> I found this mask to be very helpful on cold windy days.  It kept me warm and warmed my breathing.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these for my wife and me to protect us from the dust at Burning Man. Long story short, they worked great. They were comfortable enough that it wasn&#x27;t a pain to wear them so we always had them on.</li>
            <li> First of all, its difficult to breath with this thing on. Second very flimsy, one of the straps snapped. I guess i will keep it until i find another mask with more quality!</li>
            <li> Best thing to have in Beijing for cold and smog! Everyone loved it and I used it for 2 weeks strait</li>
            <li> My patients love this mask also all my co-workers I would reccomend this to everyone although i think it shouldve come 2 in a pack for the price.</li>
            <li> This is just a little to thick. It steams up my glassed.  I do like the that it holds nicely on the nose</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask for close to $20 and for me it didn&#x27;t work. I read the other reviews about it working for people that have severe allergies to perfumes, etc. So, I was hoping this mask would work for me. I rarely give a negative review, but this is going to be one. I was going on vacation to Branson, MO and I wanted to race go-karts, go the Dixie Stampede, and just walk down the street where there is heavy traffic and car pollution. I am severely, really severely allergic to exhaust fumes, perfumes, dust and more. I really hate having to miss out on activities because of this illness. I was hoping this mask would be what I needed. First, I went to the Dixie Stampede and the mask worked well for keeping out the dust. It is slightly hard to breathe with the mask on, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad for me, that is sort of the trade off with a mask that should block all these elements out. Next, the exhaust fumes, it did not work at all for me for exhaust fumes from vehicles. All the go-kart fumes came though the mask like it was thin paper. Even riding around my hometown I wanted to give it a few more tries. It still doesn&#x27;t work. I normally keep a towel in my car to quickly put up to my mouth when a toxic vehicle comes near me. I find myself still having to put the towel up to cover my mouth and nose even with this mask on. For $20 it definitely was not worth it to me. It had the exact same effect to me, as a simple white mask a dentist might use. For me, it didn’t work. If I was only trying to keep dust out, I would have gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> i bought this so I could dust and clean and still breathe! i need to use symbicort in the morning so I can breathe!i was having trouble cleaning so Bought this mask which is definitely tge way to go!</li>
            <li> cloth is soft to the skin and not to tight. Very comfortable to wear and i love the colors too!</li>
            <li> This mask is a lovely colour, but the reason for wearing one makes this difficult to use. It stinks. Also, when I tried to wear it my breath fogged up my glasses! The temperature was not cold and I could see no reason other than the material must be too thin. This being the case, I cannot imagine it keeping germs or other harmful stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the low mark but this mask is unwearable.</li>
            <li> I have asthma resulting from pollen and animal dander allergies. I&#x27;ve been in hades for the last year, prescribed meds I&#x27;d rather not take and which are very expensive (still taking them, though). One Saturday, working on an art project, I wore a paper mask all day and discovered I had FAR fewer problems that night sleeping. I looked for a more effective, comfortable and permanent mask and found the Vogmask. It works. It is comfortable (a little warm on a hot day), has kept my lungs and sinuses clear. I wear it at home and outside all the time except at night as I&#x27;ve essentially allergy-proofed my bedroom. While I am still somewhat short of breath, the tightness in my chest is gone, no more coughing at night, no problems breathing. I wonder why our doctors give us steroids and DON&#x27;T recommend face masks!</li>
            <li> This mask is wonderful to use while I dust and vacuum. I have allergies and this mask allows me to do my housework without having an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Have severe asthma and allergies to just about all smells- ciggaret smoke, purfume, cleaning products, etc.... I have used the product at work, home, and have even traveled from DC to Texas wearing it all the way through the airport... trip down and back. I have been able to breathe the whole time without smelling anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does get a little harder to breathe when walking or running because the air flow is limited... but put a fan near you or turn the air vent on above you on the plane and there are no issues. If you wear glasses you do need to be prepared to work with the nose piece to ensure yoir glasses don&#x27;t fog... even then if it is really humid they are going to anyway and you will find it harder to breathe in the mask during thise times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two and will be buying more of them. Cant say enough good things.</li>
            <li> I wear this whenever I am in a situation where allergens are present and it has helped SO much.  Even with cat dander which is microns small.  And it is comfortable.  Sometimes I forget I am wearing it.</li>
