            <li>I did end up getting it from another seller and it is an amazing product</li>
            <li>What I loved about liquid hair was that it somehow penetrated the hair shaft and made if feel more substantial -</li>
            <li>:) love it!</li>
            <li>I originally was very excited to get this product, I have heard great things about it.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST stuff I have ever used, it leaves your hair managable, soft and NOT at all oily.  </li>
            <li>by far the best product I have ever used on my hair.</li>

            <li>But, I LOVE the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than &#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love this product</li>
            <li>I love this because it adds nutrition to your hair, plus makes it sparkle just as it says.</li>
            <li>It works okay on damp/wet hair, but again, it&#x27;s still frizz</li>
            <li>BUT with this product, I&#x27;ve been able to go 4 days without needing to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mostly because of the price and the smell.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to shake bottle before using.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>(but be sure to shake up or you&#x27;ll be adding plain water to your hair...not good for relaxed hair) but this product is PERFECT for my hair..</li>
            <li>While Fructis is not exactly quite as amazing as liquid hair, it is the best replacement I&#x27;ve found that even comes close.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;shiny silky more easily to straighten</li>
            <li>It works great  on my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I like this because it leaves my hair silky and soft with a great smell.</li>

            <li>Fructis triple nutrition spray makes your hair shiny, full and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li>this being the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, a complete stranger came up to me to tell me how beautiful my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>Great use after showering when hair is almost dry.</li>
            <li>amazing product ,,,its my second purchase and i will buy it again for sure</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look awesome as far as shine, but I&#x27;ll likely have to keep a bottle in my purse and re-spray it throughout the day to maintain the look.</li>
            <li>His exact words were \\&quot;mother nature has clearly been good to you\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This is has been just the right amount of moisture for me...not too light but not greasy either.  </li>
            <li>one with almond is what I purchased and works better then just a water spray bottle, use this instead of water.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, shiny and not dull !</li>
            <li>It amazingly does not weigh fine hair down like all too many leave in conditioners do.  </li>
            <li>It DOES NOT add extra grease or shine to your hair and if you are looking for a product to help lock in your curls or put onto dry hair for rolling its PERFECT!</li>
            <li>It smells good and really helps my hair to be shiny, healthy and less</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>It is light and makes your hair look shiny (not greasy), but it is so light that my hair looks somewhat dry within a couple of hours (unlike most pure oils).  </li>
            <li>Helps my hair feel healthy and strong and helps dry hair recover.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that is pretty flat for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I also spray prior to a deep condition  A great product that is affordable.  </li>
            <li>product and Fructis sleek and shine serum are my favorite hair products and the only ones I use anymore.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair overly greasy like other nutrient sprays, but just makes it look healthy and brings out highlights!  </li>
            <li>I spritz a bit on my damp hair before styling &amp; my hair is soft, bouncy, smooth &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>,i have a highlight hair that needs special care to be soft</li>
            <li>I use it on my damp hair and then dry it, I really love this spray.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll look great but only for the first few minutes.</li>
            <li>It seems to activate them and leaves them so soft, fresh, bouncy and manageable.</li>
            <li>After about twenty, the damage really starts to show up.</li>
            <li>Surely sucks, I would have loved to recieve it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it when i was only straightening my hair a couple months ago.</li>
            <li>Also, stop telling us how something works based on professional stylists use of your products who use professional tools to get super fab results.</li>
            <li>most of the time just weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>I highly recommend...</li>
            <li>I saw this product on the shelf and had high hopes by the look and description of the product.</li>
            <li>This helps tame my hair and make it look healthy and</li>
            <li>Once i spray this, my curls come alive, literally!</li>
            <li>I have long hair and if I spray this on it, it becomes tangle-free right away.</li>
            <li>I have used Optimum, KeraCare, Pantene Relaxed &amp; natural, ORS, and African pride lotion type moisturizers, but it always seemed like they would coat my hair weighing it down, but it still felt dry.  </li>
            <li>Ok, let me just say i am an african american woman with long hair..</li>
            <li>I put it on my dry hair at night &amp; by morning it is absorbed &amp; my hair is soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, once thick, now much thinner.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know if this is what its supposed to do, but noticed my color doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly since I started using this), and seems to help hair from reverting due to moisture/humidity.</li>
            <li>This product consists of olive, avocado, and shea oil however its not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>works well on natural or pressed/relaxed hair (this is not a thermal protectant use after you&#x27;ve straightened your hair).</li>
            <li>have never loved my hair more than when I was using this spray.</li>
            <li>and it no longer looks dry in the desert climate I live in!</li>
            <li>That stuff was amazing but sadly got discontinued years ago.  </li>
            <li>Greasy, heavy, badly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Spray in your hair after you towel dry and your hair is so soft when it dries!!</li>
            <li>I have really dry hair, and this product always helps me calm it down</li>

            <li> I have really dry hair, and this product always helps me calm it down</li>
            <li> it made my hair much softer and didn&#x27;t weigh it down like other products will.</li>
            <li> , I have expensive, medium priced and cheap stuff...</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that sometimes gets frizzy.</li>
            <li> I sleep on my side, so the back portion of my hair never really needs to be refreshed, so I just use this.</li>
            <li> think this will be in my collection for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I hate \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; my hair products, I just want my hair to feel natural, only better.  </li>
            <li> But about a month ago, I decided to wear my hair natural (3b curly hair) and cut out the excessive use of the deadly flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair anytime it feels dry and wait 20 min before shampooing my hair  </li>
            <li> So it was smoothed but all these little frizzies sticking up, especially around the crown.</li>
            <li> However, after using it several times on my curly 3b/3c hair and my little girls&#x27; 3a/3b hair, I noticed that it actually made our hair seem dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, porous, hair that tends to get dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of rinse conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I usually have to rinse/blow dry  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less falling &amp; breakage as well.  </li>
            <li> It gives the hair a lot of shine without weighing it down or making it limp.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to stretch my relaxer by a few weeks using flexi-rods.</li>
            <li> I  use this everyday.</li>
            <li> what with few sprays i have it all</li>
            <li> Why would Garnier create a product to tame hair, yet the product induces frizz?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all is in this, but it is a mixture that has to be shaken every time you use it because the contents settle after the bottle sits for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the Garnier Fructis Miracle Dry oil &amp; it was awful.</li>
            <li> Well, the same effect with Garnier, and just as bad too.</li>
            <li> Product label specifically says &amp;#34;tame frizz,&amp;#34; but it makes it worse instead.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so weird!</li>
            <li> It has been impossible to find in stores..</li>
            <li> disappointed that it is no longer in stores</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product and makes my hair look so much healthier...I have very long hair and it no longer looks dry in the desert climate I live in!</li>
            <li> As you can tell from my title I used to use Wella Liquid Hair restructurizing treatment spray.  That stuff was amazing but sadly got discontinued years ago.  I have been on the hunt for something that could compare and for years found nothing even close.  I&#x27;m happy to say that Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Spray is now in the running to be my replacement!  I have fine straight hair that is pretty flat for the most part.  Conditioners and styling products most of the time just weigh my hair down so I don&#x27;t even bother using them.  What I loved about liquid hair was that it somehow penetrated the hair shaft and made if feel more substantial - it gave it body, bounce and incredible shine without feeling like there was anything on it.  I hate \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; my hair products, I just want my hair to feel natural, only better.  The cult followers of Wella Liquid hair- those of you out there buying the remaining bottles on Ebay for $50 a pop - will appreciate the arrival of this product.  Fructis triple nutrition spray makes your hair shiny, full and healthy feeling.  It amazingly does not weigh fine hair down like all too many leave in conditioners do.  The first time I used it, a complete stranger came up to me to tell me how beautiful my hair looked.  His exact words were \\&quot;mother nature has clearly been good to you\\&quot;.  I am not making this up.  While Fructis is not exactly quite as amazing as liquid hair, it is the best replacement I&#x27;ve found that even comes close.  For the price this is a really great product.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and have been using this as my daily moisturizer for the last 2 weeks &amp; I love it! I have used Optimum, KeraCare, Pantene Relaxed &amp; natural, ORS, and African pride lotion type moisturizers, but it always seemed like they would coat my hair weighing it down, but it still felt dry.  This is has been just the right amount of moisture for me...not too light but not greasy either.  I use it after washing, in the morning before styling (with a heat spray for protection), and before wrapping my hair at night.  I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less falling &amp; breakage as well.  Hopefully it will continue to work for me.  Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re a product junkie like me:)</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair, and this product always helps me calm it down so it isn&#x27;t as frizzy and stays put during the day.</li>
            <li> Ok, let me just say i am an african american woman with long hair..so I wanted to stretch my relaxer by a few weeks using flexi-rods. I bought this product from walmart and i LOVED IT! It DOES NOT add extra grease or shine to your hair and if you are looking for a product to help lock in your curls or put onto dry hair for rolling its PERFECT! (but be sure to shake up or you&#x27;ll be adding plain water to your hair...not good for relaxed hair) but this product is PERFECT for my hair..btw, between me and my sister I&#x27;ve gone through it in like 2 weeks..will definetly be a MUST re-purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used this for maybe 6 years now. I LOVE this stuff. I have long wavy hair that sometimes gets frizzy. This helps tame my hair and make it look healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;This product and Fructis sleek and shine serum are my favorite hair products and the only ones I use anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for getting soft smooth hair! It smells delicious!! Spray in your hair after you towel dry and your hair is so soft when it dries!! I love this product and I only wish it came in a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 months and now I can&#x27;t go out without this. It feels so different every time I forget to pray on my hair. Great use after showering when hair is almost dry.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair anytime it feels dry and wait 20 min before shampooing my hair  I also spray prior to a deep condition  A great product that is affordable.  A must try!</li>
            <li> It smells *SO* good and it makes your hair look so healthy and shiny!  It has been impossible to find in stores.. I&#x27;m not sure why.  But, I LOVE the stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair overly greasy like other nutrient sprays, but just makes it look healthy and brings out highlights!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This product consists of olive, avocado, and shea oil however its not heavy or greasy. It gives the hair a lot of shine without weighing it down or making it limp. It also smells great, helps hair retain color (I don&#x27;t know if this is what its supposed to do, but noticed my color doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly since I started using this), and seems to help hair from reverting due to moisture/humidity. I highly recommend... works well on natural or pressed/relaxed hair (this is not a thermal protectant use after you&#x27;ve straightened your hair).</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  Couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore so I searched on-line.  I have long hair and if I spray this on it, it becomes tangle-free right away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I originally bought it when i was only straightening my hair a couple months ago. I like the way it felt, but don&#x27;t think that I felt a big difference. But about a month ago, I decided to wear my hair natural (3b curly hair) and cut out the excessive use of the deadly flat iron. On my curly hair, I apply this on my 2nd and 3rd day hair. I sleep on my side, so the back portion of my hair never really needs to be refreshed, so I just use this. Once i spray this, my curls come alive, literally! It seems to activate them and leaves them so soft, fresh, bouncy and manageable. Plus the smell is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should use this product, especially if you have curly hair. This has and will become a regular staple in my routine.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff I have ever used, it leaves your hair managable, soft and NOT at all oily.  I wish it were not always out of stock, but understand why!</li>
            <li> Helps my hair feel healthy and strong and helps dry hair recover.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, once thick, now much thinner. Gave up trying for faux volume &amp; decided to just take care of it. Tried this on a whim &amp; was blown away. I put it on my dry hair at night &amp; by morning it is absorbed &amp; my hair is soft &amp; shiny. I spritz a bit on my damp hair before styling &amp; my hair is soft, bouncy, smooth &amp; shiny. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. Much better than &#x27;It&#x27;s A 10!&#x27;  Plus much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the Garnier Fructis Miracle Dry oil &amp; it was awful. Greasy, heavy, badly absorbed. Sticking with this!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Thx</li>
            <li> I loved this spray! it makes my hair so easy to manage and shiny. I use it to seal in the moisture i have in my hair. It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the shelf and had high hopes by the look and description of the product. It looks like a liquid and oil in one bottle - you have to shake it to combine the two. However, after using it several times on my curly 3b/3c hair and my little girls&#x27; 3a/3b hair, I noticed that it actually made our hair seem dry and dull. I ended up spraying the product onto my hand to feel the texture and noticed that the product left a powdery white residue on my skin. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It works great  on my natural curly hair. I  use this everyday. I bought it through Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> amazing product ,,,its my second purchase and i will buy it again for sure&lt;br /&gt;i love this product,i have a highlight hair that needs special care to be soft&lt;br /&gt;guess what with few sprays i have it all&lt;br /&gt;shiny silky more easily to straighten&lt;br /&gt;thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I love this because it adds nutrition to your hair, plus makes it sparkle just as it says.</li>
            <li> by far the best product I have ever used on my hair. I ordered 15 of these just so that I have them in stock. they stopped selling them at the drug store/ grocery store so I resorted to stocking up on my online purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone. have never loved my hair more than when I was using this spray. it made my hair much softer and didn&#x27;t weigh it down like other products will. disappointed that it is no longer in stores but I hope the online store will continue to have infinite ammounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY GRAIL OF HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of rinse conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I wish they weren&#x27;t discontinuing the product in stores</li>
            <li> This smoothed and softened my hair, but it made it frizzy at the same time. I had the same experience when I used Tresemme&#x27;s anti frizz spray. My ends just fluffed up, as did hair along my hair strands. So it was smoothed but all these little frizzies sticking up, especially around the crown. Well, the same effect with Garnier, and just as bad too. I have long, wavy, porous, hair that tends to get dry and dull. If you&#x27;re like me, stay away from this stuff. You&#x27;ll look great but only for the first few minutes. After about twenty, the damage really starts to show up. It works okay on damp/wet hair, but again, it&#x27;s still frizz inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so weird! Why would Garnier create a product to tame hair, yet the product induces frizz? Same with Tresemme. Product label specifically says &amp;#34;tame frizz,&amp;#34; but it makes it worse instead. This is why I think companies should label who the target for their hair products are, or rather, the type of hair. Also, stop telling us how something works based on professional stylists use of your products who use professional tools to get super fab results. All this is is a dressed up lie to consumers.</li>
            <li> Pros:  inexpensive, smells great, light, works well&lt;br /&gt;Cons: does not hold moisture in hair longer than a couple of hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have AA relaxed hair and I purchased this product based on reviews.  I used this before blow drying my hair and after styling my hair.  It is light and makes your hair look shiny (not greasy), but it is so light that my hair looks somewhat dry within a couple of hours (unlike most pure oils).  I&#x27;m not sure what all is in this, but it is a mixture that has to be shaken every time you use it because the contents settle after the bottle sits for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this to wrap my hair a night (spraying it on the roots and the ends) and it worked great.  I usually have to rinse/blow dry  my hair mid-week to keep it from getting too oily BUT with this product, I&#x27;ve been able to go 4 days without needing to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this will be in my collection for a long time.  Mostly because of the price and the smell.  It makes my hair look awesome as far as shine, but I&#x27;ll likely have to keep a bottle in my purse and re-spray it throughout the day to maintain the look.</li>
            <li> I like this because it leaves my hair silky and soft with a great smell. I should have tried this product years ago.</li>
            <li> Great for sun damamged hair.  Be sure to shake bottle before using.</li>
            <li> I love this, I have expensive, medium priced and cheap stuff...this being the cheap stuff. It smells good and really helps my hair to be shiny, healthy and less frizzes. I use it on my damp hair and then dry it, I really love this spray.</li>
            <li> One bottle says, olive, avocado and almond. A very similar bottle says, olive, avocado and Shea.&lt;br /&gt;The one with almond is what I purchased and works better then just a water spray bottle, use this instead of water.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, shiny and not dull !</li>
            <li> I originally was very excited to get this product, I have heard great things about it.  So I went to this sellers website to purchase and was anything but happy about the outcome. Surely sucks, I would have loved to recieve it. I did end up getting it from another seller and it is an amazing product :) love it!</li>
