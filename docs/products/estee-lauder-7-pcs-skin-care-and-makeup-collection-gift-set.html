            <li>Whether she liked it or not was not mentioned.</li>
            <li>the colors are nice and summery.</li>
            <li>what more could you want.</li>
            <li>This is better than having to spend $50.00 in order to get these products.</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>I just love Estee Lauder make up products and was glad I found it for the price I paid for it</li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder makeup--but this &amp;#34;gift set&amp;#34; is just basically a &amp;#34;gift with purchase&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li>but I through it was going to have more things</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Gift for my daughter-in-law, love the products.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>Should be a better value with more products.</li>
            <li>the colors and stuff are so cute</li>
            <li>Get your own gift which is exactly like the one pictured here except you get one, not two jars of moisturizer</li>
            <li>And the fine print will tell you this.  </li>
            <li>, i try the lifting serum (purple) and its so good, let my face very soft.</li>
            <li>These gift bags are such a good value.</li>
            <li>the colors very pretty and cool.  </li>
            <li>Just exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Estee Lauder free gift offers.</li>
            <li>it shows more in the picture than you really get it is much smaller looking</li>
            <li>Products are also good, but they are included in the spread of the packaging, the packaging is not like I have to buy a similar product, but if you can not select the products of the project (such as day cream, night cream and the like), do not stick so much picture.</li>
            <li>Resilience lift has always moisturized really well.</li>
            <li>estee lauder is a very knowledge mark</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>the price was very competitive.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Reality - so, so decent product.</li>
            <li>the makeup was not suitable for my skintone, much darker than pictured but love the mascara/concealer duo</li>
            <li>Everything was sealed and new.</li>
            <li>In case of this product picture is very misleading, and you actually need to read product description.  </li>
            <li>Guarantee, at any given time, one of the department stores near you will be running this promo.</li>
            <li>I have so many that I take out only what I will definitely use and donate the remaining unopened items to the local women&#x27;s&#x27; domestic violence shelter</li>
            <li>good buy, however products such as whey are very small, and there are three different types of cream or serum that comes in the picture</li>
            <li>Hi, my apologies loess ask, well not really review the information about the product before buying, and check if you are right.</li>
            <li>so the women can have a little something to help themselves feel pretty during their time of crisis instead of stockpiling these freebies and turning around and selling them on Amazon for $25!</li>
            <li>Regardin to the product I was waiting like for something bigger including the 2 chooises and Iget a little disconfort that were no too much</li>

            <li> the bag is kind of grannyish but the products inside were a great value for the price.. gave it to my sons teacher for a teacher appreciation present and she was very happy  :)</li>
            <li> Picture can say thousand words.  In case of this product picture is very misleading, and you actually need to read product description.  Picture &#x3D; real good value.  Reality - so, so decent product.</li>
            <li> estee lauder what more could you want. it&#x27;s all good. got at a great price. wish i never ran out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It a good option for try the estee lauder products, i try the lifting serum (purple) and its so good, let my face very soft. Was a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> the lotions are great. the makeup was not suitable for my skintone, much darker than pictured but love the mascara/concealer duo</li>
            <li> Hi, my apologies loess ask, well not really review the information about the product before buying, and check if you are right. All is well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Resilience lift has always moisturized really well. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologist and used their recommended moisturizers and they never worked as well as this especially with the topical acne treatments they gave me that dried my skin out a lot.</li>
            <li> This product was perfect. It was just as described. I got this to give away for a gift. She loved it, and finds it to be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the Estee Lauder 7 pcs Skin Care and Makeup Collection Gift set that you can get from Estee Lauder for FREE with a small (typically $35) purchase. Guarantee, at any given time, one of the department stores near you will be running this promo. Just do a computer search for Estee Lauder Gift with Purchase. Get your own gift which is exactly like the one pictured here except you get one, not two jars of moisturizer (you select combo skin or dry skin) which sounds like what this Seller delivers anyway. And see for yourself that on every single item it will be stamped &amp;#34;not for sale&amp;#34;. These gifts are a dime a dozen. I have so many that I take out only what I will definitely use and donate the remaining unopened items to the local women&#x27;s&#x27; domestic violence shelter so the women can have a little something to help themselves feel pretty during their time of crisis instead of stockpiling these freebies and turning around and selling them on Amazon for $25!</li>
            <li> Great set!  Gives you the opportunity to try some products you might not get the opportunity to try elsewhere...like it!</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I ordered. This is better than having to spend $50.00 in order to get these products. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> estee lauder is a very knowledge mark but this collection was very expensive for the products, its ok but I won&#x27;t buy something like this again, I prefer the local store</li>
            <li> I just love Estee Lauder make up products and was glad I found it for the price I paid for it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I know I would have paid three times the price for what I purchased if I would have bought it somewhere&lt;br /&gt;else.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your great service.</li>
            <li> It came promptly, it was what it said it was and it was a gift for someone who sent a generic thank you note.  Whether she liked it or not was not mentioned.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I received everything pictured, but it&#x27;s 11 pieces not 7.  My only complaint would be that 3 days ago I paid $34.50 now the price has been dropped and the shipping/handling has been raised...but in my opinion, it is worth every dime.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Make-up did not go on even and came in just a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder makeup--but this &amp;#34;gift set&amp;#34; is just basically a &amp;#34;gift with purchase&amp;#34;..... sorry, but not worth the money!</li>
            <li> It was good but I through it was going to have more things but it&#x27;s ok I like it .</li>
            <li> This product was as described. Everything was sealed and new. Shipping was fast and efficient. I am very pleased and would return as a customer.</li>
            <li> Products are also good, but they are included in the spread of the packaging, the packaging is not like I have to buy a similar product, but if you can not select the products of the project (such as day cream, night cream and the like), do not stick so much picture. Prices are too expensive.</li>
            <li> These products are fine for when I travel but not appropriate for everyday use. In addition, while I know there were two color pallets I was not happy with the one I received.</li>
            <li> Incredible, my wife it&#x27;s was very pleased with all the products and the price was very competitive. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> The bag was great....... the colors very pretty and cool.  My granddaughter loved this as a gift.  I love Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li> Regardin to the product I was waiting like for something bigger including the 2 chooises and Iget a little disconfort that were no too much</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.  You are only getting 1/3 of the items pictured in the photo.  And the fine print will tell you this.  If you are purchasing this as a gift, the bag is almost empty and I wish I had gotten something else.  Please don&#x27;t dupe buyers with your photo.</li>
            <li> Just planned to rank 5 star, but the bag is different from that of the introduction, so rank 4 star</li>
            <li> good except shipped seperately</li>
            <li> A collection of really great products.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter-in-law, love the products.</li>
            <li> The mascara was dried up.  Serum must have been dated as well because it irritated&lt;br /&gt;my skin.  Eyeshadow was dated.  Should have read the reviews.</li>
            <li> These gift bags are such a good value. You get lots of smaller size products that actually last longer than advertised. Great combination of items!</li>
            <li> I love these products. My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the items received for the price. I should have just waited for the department stores  Estee Lauder free gift offers. I will never do this again.</li>
            <li> good buy, however products such as whey are very small, and there are three different types of cream or serum that comes in the picture</li>
            <li> it shows more in the picture than you really get it is much smaller looking the bag is small for 40 dollars each bag i bought as gifts</li>
            <li> deceptive you get one or the other but you don&#x27;t get to choose and you end up with the worst of the bunch not awesome</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
            <li> So you get what you expect,the product as listed from the manufacturer you respect.For price/value this is a winner as Estee Lauder is a product know for its quality.</li>
            <li> Should be a better value with more products.</li>
            <li> the colors and stuff are so cute and i could tell it isn&#x27;t fake. the colors are nice and summery.</li>
