            <li>I know different colognes react differently to one chemistry, but it works for me the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent long lasting product.</li>
            <li>awesome purchase ,fragrance lasts long though i dont smell it around until i actually smell the spot i sprayed</li>
            <li>If you enjoy going to places that are crowded (nightclubs, bars, concerts, sporting events, etc) and want to stand out in a positive way, JOOP is for you.  </li>
            <li>Price was right and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to get it at a great price because it is so expensive in the Uk</li>
            <li>This is a classic mens cologne that I have been wearing for years, it does not have a strong perfume scent to it.  </li>
            <li>The joop that I purchased is great and the price was unbelievable.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh, clean, powdery, not overly strong, but just enough to smell a trail of it as they walk ahead of you.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is simply magical and has an almost mesmerizing effect on women that cross my path.  </li>
            <li>This Joop was cheaper and bigger than the bottles you can buy most places.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite for daily use.</li>
            <li>I buy this every birthday and Christmas for my favorite Man as this is the only scent he uses.  </li>
            <li>We have been married for 9 years.  </li>
            <li>Great long lasting Cologne.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and it came really fast!</li>
            <li>I love this scent, but only certain people can pull it off.  </li>
            <li>this was a good buy and will return when the present supply gets low</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product was exactly as described</li>
            <li>A long time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments from women in general on my &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; in general from wearing JOOP!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>really like this cologne (so do the ladies I should add)......</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Most girls will respond positively to this, and after a few hours, the scent will remain strong but the sweetness will tone down and bond to your skin&#x27;s chemistry for a more individual scent.  </li>
            <li>When my husband wears this,  ooooohhhhh we are lucky he can run fast enough out the door before I get him.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After I got married and had kids, I bought this again for me, and all I can say is I don&#x27;t have it anymore because my husband and my sons constantly wear it.  </li>
            <li>I keep purchasing joop so to be always available to me as it is also last a long time&lt;br /&gt;Mandy Habashy</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s an old guy thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent since I was 19 years old and have NEVER changed.  </li>
            <li>Meets the expectations so far.</li>
            <li>It last all day and you don&#x27;t need to apply that much.</li>
            <li>A man pasted by me and the fragrance was just I had to have...asked the young man what it was....</li>
            <li>Any other joop I have bought from the stores is like the real deal...</li>

            <li> Great size for the price and great fast delivery compare to others this is the best value for your budget.</li>
            <li> Husband loves not only cent but also price.</li>
            <li> Love this scent for my man!  Shipping was super fast.  Good price too.  What else could you want?</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who couldn&#x27;t find it anymore locally.  He was very happy!</li>
            <li> awesome purchase ,fragrance lasts long though i dont smell it around until i actually smell the spot i sprayed so i guess its olfactory fatigue like they call it.ur nose adjusting to a scent.</li>
            <li> It may be a fake..you can only smell it for like 30 mins...not what I am used to buying..Any other joop I have bought from the stores is like the real deal...scent lasts all day long and a lot stronger smelling</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li> As crazy as this may sound, I am a female and I use to wear this Years ago.  I would always get compliments from men.  After I got married and had kids, I bought this again for me, and all I can say is I don&#x27;t have it anymore because my husband and my sons constantly wear it.  I decided to wear it to work one day and I had a lot of females tell me they loved my perfume.  I just laughed.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> excellent scent, that brings back fond memories , the seller was very quick, and the price could not have been better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent since I was 19 years old and have NEVER changed.  I get more compliments from women in general on my &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; in general from wearing JOOP! than ANY other cologne I&#x27;ve EVER tried.  Bottom line: This stuff is simply magical and has an almost mesmerizing effect on women that cross my path.  It&#x27;s been around now for over 20 years, which is a testament to it&#x27;s amazing elegance as a body scent.  I&#x27;ll never wear anything else for the rest of my life.  AAA+++!!!  THE BEST, BEST, BEST!!!</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING, but it&#x27;s really more for a guy that is super into himself. It works though. Totally would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Nice scent has gotten compliments where others have not. My favorite for daily use. Pleasant aroma and lasts all day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Price was right and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Not my number one scent but very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but only certain people can pull it off.  I just happen to be one of them, according to what people say.  Most women that comment on it really like the scent and some of them had even said its their favorite fragrance on the RIGHT guy.  Its a very strong scent so you dont need a lot of it either so it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is always on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> i love this fragance!</li>
            <li> When my husband wears this,  ooooohhhhh we are lucky he can run fast enough out the door before I get him.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remember it :)</li>
            <li> The joop that I purchased is great and the price was unbelievable.  I would purchase this item from the seller again.  Speedy shipping and a great price!</li>
            <li> Meets the expectations so far. Lasts longer than regular perfume.</li>
            <li> I buy this every birthday and Christmas for my favorite Man as this is the only scent he uses.  Very nice, but not overpowering</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so. My opinion its based on previus use of this cologne.  Next time i will prefer shopping in fisical stores.</li>

            <li> Been using this stuff for years- love it, great price on here too.  Will get you noticed by the babes fo sho. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using JOOP for past 15-18 years. I love the fresh clean spicy scent. I get tons of compliments on a daily bases. I know different colognes react differently to one chemistry, but it works for me the best.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend made me buy him this for Xmas smells really good I will def be buying this again and got such a good deal on it as well</li>
            <li> Husband favorite cologne,  will order from here again :-)</li>
            <li> Literally the worst cologne i ever smelled. Received as gift sprayed it on and instantly regretted and what&#x27;s worst even after u wash it remains as horrible reminder.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb and bought this because I heard it lasts very long.  It will stay on your clothes until you wash them.</li>
            <li> I have my husband &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; on Joop.  We have been married for 9 years.  My deceased husband used Joop too.  My daughter asked him to try it years and years ago.  So when my husband wears it, others comment about how good it smells.  He was almost out so I ordered another bottle for his birthday.</li>
            <li> A very sweet and STRONG scent suitable for nights out.  If you enjoy going to places that are crowded (nightclubs, bars, concerts, sporting events, etc) and want to stand out in a positive way, JOOP is for you.  This not your going to church, office job type of cologne.  JOOP is the scent version of &amp;#34;peacocking,&amp;#34; and will get you noticed.  Most girls will respond positively to this, and after a few hours, the scent will remain strong but the sweetness will tone down and bond to your skin&#x27;s chemistry for a more individual scent.  Don&#x27;t use more than 2 sprays, nor spray on your neck.</li>
            <li> I like and tha women like!!</li>
            <li> Great long lasting Cologne. Had several people ask what cologne I was using . Use when every I go out. My spouse says its her favorite.</li>
            <li> My son loves this so I was thrilled to get it at a great price because it is so expensive in the Uk</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last like it used to. It used to stay with me all day but now I only notice it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Been using JOOP for years....really like this cologne (so do the ladies I should add)......this was a good buy and will return when the present supply gets low</li>
            <li> diluted only last about an hour.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this scent!  Received it in 2 days!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and it came really fast! I absolutely love this cologne. It has a spicy smell to it but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My husband wore this for YEARS! I recentlyu started to purchase this for him on special occasions, like Valentines Day, or Birthdays, and he just loves to get it now. Smells fresh, clean, powdery, not overly strong, but just enough to smell a trail of it as they walk ahead of you. Wonder price, very happy with this purchase! Thanks again :)</li>
            <li> este perfume es original, el envi√≥ me lo hicieron bastante r√°pido, no tengo quejas.</li>
            <li> the cologne was more for my wife than for me but if she likes it then i love it. but i have digressed. i was pleased at the delivery of the product and my satisfaction with the product is through the roof!</li>
            <li> This is a classic mens cologne that I have been wearing for years, it does not have a strong perfume scent to it.  Have had many compliments when wearing Joop, and will continue to wear this cologne.</li>
            <li> A man pasted by me and the fragrance was just I had to have...asked the young man what it was....the ladies like it</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Joop.  This was bought for a friends upcoming birthday.  I&#x27;ll 5 star it &#x27;cause I love the scent !!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I keep purchasing joop so to be always available to me as it is also last a long time&lt;br /&gt;Mandy Habashy</li>
            <li> I like joop because  its fragance is very good and  it last all day . I recommend to everybody. it is the best</li>
            <li> Awesome! This is the real stuff. I have used this for over twenty years and never tire of it. My absolute favorite!</li>
