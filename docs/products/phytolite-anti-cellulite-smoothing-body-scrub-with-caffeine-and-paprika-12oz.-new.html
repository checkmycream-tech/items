            <li>Amazing product, really feels great on skin, and makes skin super soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have a need to apply moisturizer or anti cellulite cream after,even though I feel it works better when used in conjunction with Sweetsation Anti Cellulite Treatment.</li>
            <li>I even went so far as to visit the Sweetsation site and really liked what I saw.  </li>
            <li>I combined it with a super charge cellulite fighting cream that was recommended by a buyer in the reviews.</li>
            <li>I mentioned the previous great reviews they have and they said that people don&#x27;t write reviews nobody care,</li>
            <li>but i can tell you it cant be worth it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this body scrub is when I feel my skin and have to take a double take at my arms or legs because my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin tingles a little after the scrubbing but it fels so good.</li>
            <li>First reaction some people have: &amp;</li>
            <li>First time trying a scrub like this.</li>
            <li>First what hits you is awakening scent, something minty citrus.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I just ordered a few more so that I am never without it.  </li>
            <li>First time I saw this product, I thought, hey why not?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product,and seller--they always include couple samples with my order!</li>
            <li>It really is smoothing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too abrasive but scrubby enough to get my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and I have no cellulite thanks to sweetsation product I give it a 10 for texture, smell, and efficient.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend &#x27;Sweetsation&#x27; on a whole.</li>
            <li>This is a glorious scrub and it really work wonder, I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
            <li>It leave the skin very soft</li>
            <li>I really feel the kick of the ingredients when is use this along with the cellulite cream of the same brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They told me its a new product only 6 months old and that I&#x27;m the only one to have questions.</li>
            <li>I watched a youtube video on how to do it nicely without mess, this works wonders (for me)&lt;br /&gt;I will try a more natural and less expensive scrub: ground coffee in a container, put some olive oil, or avocado oil, and make a nice thick paste with those; what it does is it will boost the circulation to the areas that we (women and some dudes too) get less circulation going...</li>
            <li>I tried another cellulite smoothing body scrub in the past and tried to give this one a try because I love the other product.  </li>
            <li>care!!!they are defiantly not interested in gaining new customers.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Sorry for such a long description,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with dry skin and cellulite, and only after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> but it actually got rid of some dry patches of skin i had on my legs</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long</li>
            <li> Messy, oily, super hard and dry and scrub.</li>
            <li> so i now have to remove the product from shower when im done and have to keepit dry to avoid the drips..</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fab products.</li>
            <li> Told seller to contact me because of the questions I had about why it&#x27;s so rough like gravel and whoso greasy</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical I would see any real results, but I was happily surprised!</li>
            <li> , i.e. little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub every other day(sometimes at evening, sometimes in morning) on targeted areas (belly and thighs),and</li>
            <li> the liquid that seperated from the product leaks, even after you close it tight,..</li>
            <li> #34;this is messy and it falls everywhere and</li>
            <li> My skin felt firm.  </li>
            <li> It did not have scabs/bumps or the build up of everyday happenings.</li>
            <li> I could feel a bit of tingling and tightening even after I towel dried myself from the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but  got to say I see the difference.</li>
            <li> I like this scrub for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
            <li> Told me to send it back.i paid about $30 for this greasy gravel mess!</li>
            <li> Only drawback is its a tad expensive for everyday use.</li>

            <li> I use this scrub every other day(sometimes at evening, sometimes in morning) on targeted areas (belly and thighs),and it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer as well. I really don&#x27;t have a need to apply moisturizer or anti cellulite cream after,even though I feel it works better when used in conjunction with Sweetsation Anti Cellulite Treatment. It also smells wonderful,that&#x27;s a bonus you get with usage of this product beside a smooth skin:) I highly recommend this product,and seller--they always include couple samples with my order! Thank you.</li>
            <li> i dont know if it works yet but i can tell you it cant be worth it.  it stained my tub.  the liquid that seperated from the product leaks, even after you close it tight,.. its so oily (maybe a got a defective product, idk).. if you dont wipe up and splatter or drips immediately youll have orange, permanent, stains.. so i now have to remove the product from shower when im done and have to keepit dry to avoid the drips..</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product. It smells very nice and leaves the skin soft.  A pleasure feeling after bath. Thank you.</li>
            <li> First reaction some people have: &amp;#34;this is messy and it falls everywhere and blah blah blah snore&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is MEANT to be that way. If you have trouble applying it yourself, find someone experienced to work their magical hands with the scrub. I watched a youtube video on how to do it nicely without mess, this works wonders (for me)&lt;br /&gt;I will try a more natural and less expensive scrub: ground coffee in a container, put some olive oil, or avocado oil, and make a nice thick paste with those; what it does is it will boost the circulation to the areas that we (women and some dudes too) get less circulation going...&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for such a long description, but I hope you enjoy it!</li>
            <li> When they say its&#x27; smoothing. It really is smoothing.  I didn&#x27;t even need lotion after I used it. I love it. I have to get more.</li>
            <li> First time trying a scrub like this. Was very skeptical I would see any real results, but I was happily surprised! I&#x27;ve always struggled with dry skin and cellulite, and only after 2 weeks I&#x27;ve seen noticeable results! Feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: have also used a skin firming lotion along with scrub</li>
            <li> Ok,  not only did this body scrub smell great and leave my skin looking and feeling smooth and silky but it actually got rid of some dry patches of skin i had on my legs, Ive had these patches for a few years and sometimes they would get  really chalky and gross looking, well, they are gone!  I have smooth skin again like I did years ago. I am extremely happy with my new scrub!</li>
            <li> After using this product, I saw/felt a significant difference in my skin.  My skin felt firm.  It did not have scabs/bumps or the build up of everyday happenings. And I can feel the ingredients working when I rub the product on my skin. My favorite part of this body scrub is when I feel my skin and have to take a double take at my arms or legs because my skin is so smooth. Fellow Body Scrub Seekers, Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love to use it during my morning shower. First what hits you is awakening scent, something minty citrus. But once you are awake, just scrub your body and it will leave this tingling fresh sensation as well as superb smooth silky skin. If you are in a hurry, you can even skip your lotion. This scrub is oily enough to keep your skin moisturized enough. Oh, and did I mention how great it smells? Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use the Svelte Pro Supercharged Organic Anti-Cellulite Treamtent with L&#x27;Carnitine &amp; CoQ10.  I tried another cellulite smoothing body scrub in the past and tried to give this one a try because I love the other product.  I keep it in my shower and use each morning followed by the Svelte Pro Supercharged Organic Anti-Cellulite Treamtent with L&#x27;Carnitine &amp; CoQ10.  I can feel the ingredients of the scrub instantly doing something.  My skin feels energized, softer and smoother.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, really feels great on skin, and makes skin super soft and vibrant. I will order this again for sure!!!</li>
            <li> Phyto*Lite Anti Cellulite Smoothing Body Scrub is my new very favorite scrub.  I love it so much that I just ordered a few more so that I am never without it.  I have tried many other scrubs.  What great about this one is the fact that I don&#x27;t feel like it goes to waist, i.e. little goes a long way. It makes your skin feel invigorating. I could feel a bit of tingling and tightening even after I towel dried myself from the shower.  And the scent is delicious and so light.  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> is an excellent product!!! i really love it; my skin is much better after use it; and smell so good!!and excellent delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long and I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but  got to say I see the difference. I combined it with a super charge cellulite fighting cream that was recommended by a buyer in the reviews. I am going to continue using this product.</li>

            <li> I am a repeat customer of &#x27;Sweetsation&#x27; products. I have them all pretty much - I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub smells heavenly and does a fantastic job of exfoliating as well as &#x27;pepping&#x27; up sluggish legs and bum. I really feel the kick of the ingredients when is use this along with the cellulite cream of the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying this over and over - it really is the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for customer service - this company excels in this department. They are very kind to their loyal customers and I&#x27;ve had the best experience with them. Absolutely no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fab products. Fab company. I wish more manufacturers were so customer orientated. I highly recommend &#x27;Sweetsation&#x27; on a whole.</li>
            <li> Messy, oily, super hard and dry and scrub. Might as well have been rocks. Told seller to contact me because of the questions I had about why it&#x27;s so rough like gravel and whoso greasy and y doesn&#x27;t it come in a bigger bottle so it isn&#x27;t so messy. They told me its a new product only 6 months old and that I&#x27;m the only one to have questions. I mentioned the previous great reviews they have and they said that people don&#x27;t write reviews nobody care, well I do care!!!they are defiantly not interested in gaining new customers. Told me to send it back.i paid about $30 for this greasy gravel mess!</li>
            <li> I was in search of a good scrub and found this line by accident on amazon.  This scrub smells amazing and helps with my problem areas (hips, thighs,butt) I follow it up with their Svelte Supercharged cream after my shower. I have noticed some firming and smoothness. Only drawback is its a tad expensive for everyday use. I wish they would start sending free samples again in their shipments.</li>
