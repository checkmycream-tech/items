    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This size is a great bargain!</li>
            <li>It smells WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even say how happy I am with this.</li>
            <li>The person I spoke with at Amazon was very courteous, and a replacement was sent.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the best of childhood :)</li>
            <li>My son loved it</li>
            <li>(I bought it for myself/female) and that makes it a good man&#x27;s cologne considering how picky my son is.</li>
            <li>good by manly man......</li>
            <li>I, honestly, would not mind it on a man, either.</li>
            <li>Really nice</li>
            <li>Alomst like Jasmin...but still nice...</li>
            <li>It sometimes makes me sneeze, but I am not used to perfumes of any kind because my husband is allergic to all of them it seems.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of smell that makes somebody say, &amp;#34;mmm</li>
            <li>I have bought many Demeter fragrances and have liked all of them,</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s perfect for anyone who&#x27;s easily irritated by normal perfumes.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe how accurate this perfume is!</li>
            <li>Has a nice light cent.  </li>
            <li>I have a honeysuckle vine in my yard &amp; I love the smell of it when it is blooming</li>
            <li>I love Demeter scents.</li>
            <li>I might pay $7, but more than that</li>
            <li>Honeysuckle is my favorite smell</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>And I can smell it on my favorite scarf when I put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay though.</li>
            <li>But I love the smell and this was the most important aspect of the purchase for me.</li>
            <li>The first spray is pretty strong, with very sweet bright notes, and it mellows out over time to a more demure (yet enticing) flower-y smell.</li>
            <li>It is light (not too strong, lasts maybe 2-3 hours), but I prefer light fragrances.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic scent for women.  </li>
            <li>This is the truest capture of the essence of honeysuckle that is available on the market.</li>
            <li>No where in the description does it state that there are no returns available for this product.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like honeysuckle in the mid-morning, fresh, fragrant, slightly sweet, and warm.</li>
            <li>That was my favorite floral scent of all time and smelled just like real honeysuckle.)  </li>
            <li>True to form - as all Demeter products are.</li>
            <li>Good looks and packaging and overall</li>
            <li>scent is fresh anf has light floral sweet sent to it</li>
            <li>I cannot agree with other reviewers that this smells EXACTLY like honeysuckle, but it does have a very pleasant fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>As pricey as this seems, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Demeter should check into the leaking top on the bottle and go back to their original formula.</li>
            <li>nice, refreshing scent, but not long lasting....</li>
            <li>Great for a rooms spray or even a body mist, but as an alternative to Bath and Body works Body spray, not necessarily a better buy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice but not particularly for a body cologne / perfume.  </li>
            <li>Everyone reacts differently to scent, so some may appreciate this product more than I.  </li>
            <li>This product has a chemical aspect to its smell that becomes more obvious after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>love it but must respray several times during day.</li>
            <li>It smells EXACTLY like putting your nose in these flowers on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>It smells divine--like the most pure, fresh, green, and sweet honeysuckle bush you could find.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol at all to me, just pure honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>the scent is very floral.</li>
            <li>really does smell like honeysuckle though</li>
            <li>Not the real thing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a long lasting lingering kind of scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly right, but it still brings back memories of hot summer days and the warm sugary smell of honeysuckle growing on the fence.</li>
            <li>i am purchasing this product for the first time but was surprised why it said for MEN AND WOMEN...</li>
            <li>(Unfortunate that Estee Lauder discontinued their wonderful Honeysuckle scent several years ago.  </li>
            <li>5 stars because I was looking for a true honeysuckle scent, a little research shows that lots of Demeter scents fade quickly.</li>
            <li>The real ones growing wild on a vine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a perfume that only hints at fresh honeysuckle, then this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>like most people, i found the smell or fragrance does not last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Basically the only thing this perfume has going for it now is that it looks pretty on my shelf.</li>
            <li>It comes in a large bottle, bigger than I thought when buying it.</li>
            <li>It has too much of alcohol smell initially.</li>
            <li>It really brought me back to my childhood.  </li>
            <li>So naturally, I went on Amazon and tried to find something that smelled just like it.</li>
            <li>Sean Bagdonas thinks this scent is truly natural.</li>
            <li>So the scent doesn&#x27;t disappear, but it is not the kind of smell you leave behind in a elevator.</li>
            <li>The product just came today and, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t really smell like much of anything, other than alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a real honeysuckle fragrance for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was inspired to buy this fragrance (the first new fragrance I&#x27;ve purchased in a few years) after walking by a blooming honeysuckle bush near my home.</li>
            <li>It is quite light, and if you want it to last throughout the day, you&#x27;ll have to reapply a few times.  </li>
            <li>The scent is similar to honeysuckle, but no where near the old-fashioned honeysuckle that grows in my yard.</li>
            <li>Also, because of its pure nature smell, it doesn&#x27;t transition well into other seasons or even indoor events.</li>
            <li>Goes on strong, fades within 10-15 minutes to being faint enough to smell only when your nose is right next to your skin, fades entirely within an hour.</li>
            <li>I found other fragrances with \\&quot;lively notes of honeysuckle\\&quot; that didn&#x27;t smell anything like honeysuckle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Several bees, perhaps a bit dazed from their winter&#x27;s rest, also seemed to think that the scent is a fine reproduction.    </li>
            <li> The fragrance also doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> The smell last 2-3 hrs, which is not unusual for colognes.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers stated this bottle arrived leaking - same situation here.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to bathe in this scent, but simply spritzing myself with it a few times keeps me smelling like big bushels of honeysuckle all day.  </li>
            <li> This scent is totally far from the usual and well-recognized Honeysuckle scent.</li>
            <li> After a second, I can smell a slight whiff of honeysuckle, then it disappears.  </li>
            <li> Same problem, spray cap was not on tightly.</li>
            <li> Since only a little had leaked this time, I decided not to pursue it, but I will never order this by mail again.</li>
            <li> Lost about 1/2 inch of the cologne and the packaging was wet.  </li>
            <li> Even on fabric it doesn&#x27;t last, but a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Total waste of $20.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if I just get used to the smell, or if it really only lasts for a few hours, so you might have to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> this particular one just smells really off and has an almost spoiled scent to it, like its gone bad or something.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the fragrance is just too faint to overpower the smell of alcohol (the first ingredient of this product).</li>
            <li> Demeter, on the other hand, has nailed it.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers - Demeter has changed the formula for this Honeysuckle Cologne.  </li>
            <li> But I think this is because it lacks the cloying strength of other perfumes, which is a plus for  me.</li>
            <li> the other side of the coin is how uncanny, spot on accurracy of the smell.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find products with natural honeysucle smell.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a hard edge similar to wax melts version of honeysuckle.  </li>
            <li> This scent triggers every memory I have of honeysuckle, and, were I blindfolded, I would be unable to tell the difference between this bottle and the real plant.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not worth even the sale price.</li>
            <li> I ordered Demeter Honeysuckle as a gift and it arrived with half the cologne leaked out.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the problem was that the spray cap was not fastened on tightly.</li>
            <li> They are know for their dead on accuracy in their scents.</li>
            <li> I lived in the country as a kid and was really missing the smell of honeysuckle one day.</li>
            <li> I might get a small spray bottle to fill for taking around with me.</li>
            <li> -the stains are hard to be removed...</li>
            <li> If an item is not able to be returned that should be stated in your description!  </li>
            <li> There is a faint, somewhat honeysuckle-ish fragrance under the alcohol odor.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer on my clothes than on skin (goes faint within 30 or so minutes</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got really disappointed and ended up giving them away.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of those awful musk scents used in the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This smells horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes, this smells just like honeysuckle in heat.    Demeter is notorious for hitting scents spot-on.  How do they do it?  This is not a manifesto on the meaning of life, only a product review, my friend.    As pricey as this seems, it is well worth it.  I would prefer to bathe in this scent, but simply spritzing myself with it a few times keeps me smelling like big bushels of honeysuckle all day.  I also like to dab a bit on the tip of my nose for my personal enjoyment.  I often catch myself sniffing the bottle.    This scent triggers every memory I have of honeysuckle, and, were I blindfolded, I would be unable to tell the difference between this bottle and the real plant.  Several bees, perhaps a bit dazed from their winter&#x27;s rest, also seemed to think that the scent is a fine reproduction.    This is a fantastic scent for women.  I, honestly, would not mind it on a man, either.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Well packaged.  Has a nice light cent.  I use it a lot.  Really nice</li>
            <li> The cologne smells just like honeysucle. The smell last 2-3 hrs, which is not unusual for colognes. Only thing needs to be improved for women is the amount of alcohol. It has too much of alcohol smell initially. My son loved it (I bought it for myself/female) and that makes it a good man&#x27;s cologne considering how picky my son is. But I love the smell and this was the most important aspect of the purchase for me.It is very hard to find products with natural honeysucle smell.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a real honeysuckle fragrance for a long time.  After reading the reviews on this one, I thought I had struck gold.  The product just came today and, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t really smell like much of anything, other than alcohol.  There is a faint, somewhat honeysuckle-ish fragrance under the alcohol odor. I have a honeysuckle vine in my yard &amp; I love the smell of it when it is blooming and that&#x27;s the fragrance I was expecting.  This just misses the mark.  Maybe the fragrance is just too faint to overpower the smell of alcohol (the first ingredient of this product). The fragrance also doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.  A couple of hours and it&#x27;s gone.  I&#x27;d send it back but between the postage both ways &amp; the restocking fee it&#x27;s just not worth it.  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love Demeter scents. They are know for their dead on accuracy in their scents. The Demeter Honeysuckle does not disappoint. Honeysuckle reminds me of my childhood growing up in the country. This takes me back there.</li>
            <li> I was inspired to buy this fragrance (the first new fragrance I&#x27;ve purchased in a few years) after walking by a blooming honeysuckle bush near my home. I found other fragrances with \\&quot;lively notes of honeysuckle\\&quot; that didn&#x27;t smell anything like honeysuckle. Demeter, on the other hand, has nailed it. It smells exactly like honeysuckle in the mid-morning, fresh, fragrant, slightly sweet, and warm. The first spray is pretty strong, with very sweet bright notes, and it mellows out over time to a more demure (yet enticing) flower-y smell. It is light (not too strong, lasts maybe 2-3 hours), but I prefer light fragrances.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers - Demeter has changed the formula for this Honeysuckle Cologne.  Rather than smelling alcohol, I was taken aback by the musky odor.  Reminds me of those awful musk scents used in the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  The scent is similar to honeysuckle, but no where near the old-fashioned honeysuckle that grows in my yard. (Unfortunate that Estee Lauder discontinued their wonderful Honeysuckle scent several years ago.  That was my favorite floral scent of all time and smelled just like real honeysuckle.)  Everyone reacts differently to scent, so some may appreciate this product more than I.  Other reviewers stated this bottle arrived leaking - same situation here.  Lost about 1/2 inch of the cologne and the packaging was wet.  Demeter should check into the leaking top on the bottle and go back to their original formula.</li>
            <li> Sprayed it on to my dress shirt OMG -the stains are hard to be removed...the scent is very floral. Alomst like Jasmin...but still nice...</li>
            <li> They changed their formula without saying so, this product is alcohol based and basically just an inferior product. Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I known they switched.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but not particularly for a body cologne / perfume.  The alcohol is overbearing and doesn&#x27;t let the honeysuckle shine.  Great for a rooms spray or even a body mist, but as an alternative to Bath and Body works Body spray, not necessarily a better buy.  A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I grew up with honeysuckle bushes in my backyard and this scent is SPOT ON!  It really brought me back to my childhood.  If you&#x27;re looking for a perfume that only hints at fresh honeysuckle, then this may not be for you.  But if you want to smell like an actual honeysuckle bush, then look no further!</li>
            <li> If your looking to replace the Avon Honeysuckle, this isn&#x27;t it.  It doesn&#x27;t have the softness to it.  There&#x27;s a hard edge similar to wax melts version of honeysuckle.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t smell like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled on a man it wasn&#x27;t something I would recommend for any man</li>
            <li> It smells divine--like the most pure, fresh, green, and sweet honeysuckle bush you could find. However, the smell&#x27;s staying power is next to nothing. Even on fabric it doesn&#x27;t last, but a few minutes. Also, because of its pure nature smell, it doesn&#x27;t transition well into other seasons or even indoor events. Basically the only thing this perfume has going for it now is that it looks pretty on my shelf. But it&#x27;s not worth even the sale price. For such a week perfume, it belongs next to body mists in Target. I might pay $7, but more than that and this product is a scam.</li>
            <li> This product has a chemical aspect to its smell that becomes more obvious after the first couple uses. It also doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like honeysuckle. Goes on strong, fades within 10-15 minutes to being faint enough to smell only when your nose is right next to your skin, fades entirely within an hour. Lasts longer on my clothes than on skin (goes faint within 30 or so minutes but you can smell it up close for like 4 hours) .  5 stars because I was looking for a true honeysuckle scent, a little research shows that lots of Demeter scents fade quickly.</li>
            <li> nice, refreshing scent, but not long lasting....really does smell like honeysuckle though</li>
            <li> I lived in the country as a kid and was really missing the smell of honeysuckle one day. So naturally, I went on Amazon and tried to find something that smelled just like it. This is as close as I have ever gotten. It&#x27;s not exactly right, but it still brings back memories of hot summer days and the warm sugary smell of honeysuckle growing on the fence. A+</li>
            <li> I cannot agree with other reviewers that this smells EXACTLY like honeysuckle, but it does have a very pleasant fresh scent.  It is quite light, and if you want it to last throughout the day, you&#x27;ll have to reapply a few times.  It sometimes makes me sneeze, but I am not used to perfumes of any kind because my husband is allergic to all of them it seems.  He tolerates this one unless I tell him that I sprayed myself with it.  That&#x27;s a bonus!</li>
            <li> Did not smell like honeysuckle should. Scent didn&#x27;t last.Only used once . Dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Has a chemical smell.  After a second, I can smell a slight whiff of honeysuckle, then it disappears.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the truest capture of the essence of honeysuckle that is available on the market. One of my essential fragrances.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the best of childhood :)</li>
            <li> This scent is totally far from the usual and well-recognized Honeysuckle scent. I got really disappointed and ended up giving them away.</li>
            <li> Sean Bagdonas thinks this scent is truly natural. This size is a great bargain!</li>
            <li> love it but must respray several times during day. scent is fresh anf has light floral sweet sent to it</li>
            <li> This smells horrible! I went to return it and Amazon says its not a returnable product.  No where in the description does it state that there are no returns available for this product.  I have bought many Demeter fragrances and have liked all of them, this particular one just smells really off and has an almost spoiled scent to it, like its gone bad or something.  Shame on you Amazon for not taking back an inferior product by labeling it as &amp;#34;non-returnable&amp;#34;. If an item is not able to be returned that should be stated in your description!  Total waste of $20.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how accurate this perfume is! It smells EXACTLY like putting your nose in these flowers on a hot summer day. It doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol at all to me, just pure honeysuckle. I can&#x27;t tell if I just get used to the smell, or if it really only lasts for a few hours, so you might have to reapply during the day. It comes in a large bottle, bigger than I thought when buying it. I might get a small spray bottle to fill for taking around with me. Honeysuckle is my favorite smell and I can&#x27;t even say how happy I am with this. It blows the Bath and Body Works Honeysuckle spray out of the water.</li>
            <li> i am purchasing this product for the first time but was surprised why it said for MEN AND WOMEN...i know they have unisex fragrances but HONEYSUCKLE!!!  good by manly man......hello???????</li>
            <li> This smells JUST LIKE honeysuckles. The real ones growing wild on a vine. Not honeysuckle scented things. Mmmmm. Love. It doesn&#x27;t have a long lasting lingering kind of scent. But I think this is because it lacks the cloying strength of other perfumes, which is a plus for  me. I can still smell it throughout the day on myself, but people in the next room can&#x27;t smell me. And I can smell it on my favorite scarf when I put it on. So the scent doesn&#x27;t disappear, but it is not the kind of smell you leave behind in a elevator. It&#x27;s the kind of smell that makes somebody say, &amp;#34;mmm you smell good&amp;#34; when they lean into you (which is my preference).</li>
            <li> Poured it out. Would never buy again. Smells  yucky !</li>
            <li> Not the real thing. The fragrance of honeysuckle vine in the spring makes me oooh with pleasure. Not this. It&#x27;s okay though.</li>
            <li> True to form - as all Demeter products are. It smells WONDERFUL. And it&#x27;s perfect for anyone who&#x27;s easily irritated by normal perfumes.</li>
            <li> like most people, i found the smell or fragrance does not last a long time.  thats the draw back.  the other side of the coin is how uncanny, spot on accurracy of the smell.  We got honeysuckle and cant keep the bees away when wearing it!!  Good looks and packaging and overall it hits the mark</li>
            <li> I ordered Demeter Honeysuckle as a gift and it arrived with half the cologne leaked out. I discovered that the problem was that the spray cap was not fastened on tightly. The person I spoke with at Amazon was very courteous, and a replacement was sent. Same problem, spray cap was not on tightly. Since only a little had leaked this time, I decided not to pursue it, but I will never order this by mail again. The problem is not Amazon, it is at the place where the cologne is bottled.</li>
