            <li>A bit floral with a touch of spice but the best way to describe this perfume is...a hint of Ireland.  </li>

            <li>It feels warm and lovely just like Ireland.</li>
            <li>Having tried both, the Eau de Parfum is more worth the money than the Eau de Toilette, even though both are great.</li>

            <li>I have always bought the Innis Free which I love</li>
            <li>AND I DIDN&#x27;T FIND IT AT ONE OF THOSE FINE DEPARTMENT STORES.</li>
            <li>It may not cost as much as some of the department store celebrity fragrances, but it sure competes with them!</li>
            <li>ANY PERFUME AVAILABLE IN FANCY  DEPARTMENT STORES -  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Naturally, I would recommend this for a friend, or just to enjoy the woodsy, floral scent for yourself.</li>
            <li>This is a light floral scent that lasts well.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on how sweet and fresh I smell</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and it has become a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Connemara has been my only fragrance for many years; I love its playful but elegant essence.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE EVER SINCE I FIRST VISITED IRELAND IN 1996 AND BOUGHT IT THERE.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle in Ireland and was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT OVER POWERING, JUST SUDTLE AND CLEAN SMELLING.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something special for Christmas for my mom</li>

            <li>The scent is really classic, and is appropriate for all seasons.</li>
            <li>Its a lovely clean fresh soap smell never heavy or cloying</li>
            <li>I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S LIGHT, SOFT, AND EASILY WORN DAY OR NITE.</li>
            <li>One of her favorite fragrances, and easy to find on Amazon without having to drive to 15 different stores to get this!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, was moderately priced, and arrived sooner than I had expected.</li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>The smell is so fresh - not soapy fresh, rather springtime fresh.  </li>
            <li>Its very light and different, and</li>
            <li>Would rather have gone to Ireland to get it as that is where I first found it.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS IRISH SCENT  </li>
            <li>Wish TEN stars was available to rate you!</li>
            <li>I first bought Connemara when I was in Ireland.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase more Fragrances of Ireland products, and will definitely buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li>It is sort of like White Linen, but not as strong.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend as a unique aroma that will make you feel alive and ready to handle the world or whatever problems occur.</li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments on this perfume than any other.  </li>
            <li>I discovered it in Doolin about 15 years ago, and then was lucky enough to find it online.</li>
            <li>My dad had given me this perfume while I was in high school</li>
            <li>It reminds me a little of &#x27;Windsong\\&quot; but not as strong.</li>
            <li>Not only did I find it, but it was reasonably priced, arrived on time and was just what she wanted.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 37 year old daughter for Christmas</li>
            <li>If you love this fragrance, pay the little extra and order it from a proper source.</li>

            <li> My favorite fragrance for years. Not overpowering and lasts all day. I have received many compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FRAGRANCE AT \\&quot;DIXIE STAMPEDE\\&quot; OF ALL PLACES. I WAS JUST SAMPLING AND WHEN I SPRAYED THIS, I WAS HOOKED. AS SOON AS IT DRIED, MY HUSBAND JOINED ME AND ASK, \\&quot;WHAT ARE U WEARING\\&quot;. IT&#x27;S LIGHT, SOFT, AND EASILY WORN DAY OR NITE. I PLAN TO WEAR IT AT MY DAUGHTERS WEDDING. ALSO, THE FRAGRANCE LAST A LONG TIME. I CAN&#x27;T SMELL IT AFTER A WHILE, BUT OTHERS DO. IT&#x27;S NOT OVER POWERING, JUST SUDTLE AND CLEAN SMELLING. THIS HAS BECOME MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE AND I DIDN&#x27;T FIND IT AT ONE OF THOSE FINE DEPARTMENT STORES. BY THE WAY, IT&#x27;S AN IRISH SCENT.. BUY IT,YOU WILL LOVE IT AND BE HOOKED.</li>
            <li> A bit floral with a touch of spice but the best way to describe this perfume is...a hint of Ireland.  I bought it on a whim when I was in Ireland and loved the scent.  I have gotten more compliments on this perfume than any other.  This is my 4th purchase of Connemara.  It won&#x27;t be my last either!</li>
            <li> I must say, I almost never order scents that I myself have not smelled. I found this item as an Amazon recommendation, and I do not regret buying it at all! It smells wonderful, was moderately priced, and arrived sooner than I had expected. I will certainly purchase more Fragrances of Ireland products, and will definitely buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Would rather have gone to Ireland to get it as that is where I first found it.</li>
            <li> Its a lovely clean fresh soap smell never heavy or cloying I get many compliments on how sweet and fresh I smell</li>
            <li> You might try other perfumes, but, you will always go back to Connemara. I discovered it in Doolin about 15 years ago, and then was lucky enough to find it online. Others will always ask you what perfume you are wearing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something special for Christmas for my mom and I found it!  My mom first bought this in Ireland, and living in a small rural community I never thought I&#x27;d find it, but isn&#x27;t Amazon great- Not only did I find it, but it was reasonably priced, arrived on time and was just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Connemara is truly a fresh and clean wonderful fragrance I get tons of complements everytime I wear parfume.  You can&#x27;t go wrong in selecting this scent.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it! One of her favorite fragrances, and easy to find on Amazon without having to drive to 15 different stores to get this!</li>
            <li> Cannot stand this fragrance. Can&#x27;t return it. Wish I didn&#x27;t read the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Was pleased with everything</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations!! Did not care for the fragrance! Will not order this parfum one again!</li>
            <li> Having tried both, the Eau de Parfum is more worth the money than the Eau de Toilette, even though both are great. The Eau de Parfum lasts longer. The scent is really classic, and is appropriate for all seasons. It may not cost as much as some of the department store celebrity fragrances, but it sure competes with them!</li>
            <li> REALLY WONDERFUL SCENT.</li>
            <li> Great smelling stuff!</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES THIS IRISH MIST  I LOVE THIS IRISH SCENT  WHEN I KISS HER NECK  AND MY MIND TAKES ME TO   THE EMERALD ISLE -  UNBELIEVABLY BETTER THAN  ANY PERFUME AVAILABLE IN FANCY  DEPARTMENT STORES -  WORTH THE PRICE OF BUYING   EVERY 2-3 MONTHS TO KEEP   PEACE AND LOVE IN THE FAMILY.  THE IRISH HAVE DONE IT AGAIN -  WELL THIS HAS BEEN AROUND A   LONG TIME BUT - STILL UNDISCOVERED.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED   AND NEITHER WILL SHE -          . . . . . A HEAVENLY FRAGRANCE !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance of all time.  I have used it for many years now.  I always recieve compliments and my granddaughter told me once, after smelling it, that &amp;#34;it smells like Grandma&amp;#34;,, awesome, unique perfume</li>
            <li> THIS FRAGRANCE USED TO BE 15.00. BOUGHT IT IN NEWPORT R.I. YEARS AGO, AND IT IS MY FAVORITE, BUT DO NOT TELL ANYONE.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product and it was here in two days-free shipping! I would highly recommend this vendor-the item was packed beautifully and arrived in perfect shape.  This is my mother&#x27;s favorite Christmas gift each year as it reminds her of our trip to Ireland years ago.</li>
            <li> I have many of the &amp;#34;Fragrances of Ireland&amp;#34; scents and love them all.  I got the scent &amp;#34;Connemara&amp;#34; for a friend and she just loves it.  She visited Ireland several years ago and says that Connemara reminds her of the time she spent there.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I would recommend this for a friend, or just to enjoy the woodsy, floral scent for yourself.</li>
            <li> Wonderful way to get this perfume</li>
            <li> Never tried this perfume before, I was looking for carnation scent and this is a flowery scent but the carnation note is not apparent to me.</li>
            <li> Connemara has been my only fragrance for many years; I love its playful but elegant essence.  One spray and I&#x27;m set all day. I placed my order and within 2 hours received an e-mail that it had been sent!  I received the order, packed with loving care in two days!  Talk about service!  Thank you Biddy Murphy for being a solid, trustworthy place of business (and charm, from the looks of your web site).  Can hardly wait to visit your store in person! Wish TEN stars was available to rate you!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE EVER SINCE I FIRST VISITED IRELAND IN 1996 AND BOUGHT IT THERE.  I ALWAYS GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WALK PAST SOME WHEN WEARING THIS PERFUME.  I HAVE HAD STRANGERS COME UP TO ME AND ASK ME WHAT I AM WEARING; ONE MAN WAS A PERFUMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE LINGERING SCENT IN MY CLOSET WHEN I HAVE SPRAYED IT ON AN ITEM OF CLOTHING.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 37 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!!  Glad I could find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have always bought the Innis Free which I love but I thought I would try something different.  I absolutely love it and it has become a new favorite.  It feels warm and lovely just like Ireland.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I can smell it all day.  My dad had given me this perfume while I was in high school &amp; I loved it back then and never forgot it.  I was in an Irish specialty shop &amp; found it!  I was so happy!  To make a long story short, I had a bad experience at this shop &amp; so I searched for this perfume &amp; I found it on Amazon and saved approximately $7.  Yea!!</li>
            <li> This is a light floral scent that lasts well. It reminds me a little of &#x27;Windsong\\&quot; but not as strong. I bought my first bottle in Ireland and was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Connemara for 12 years. I ordered what was pictured and got something else in the same packaging. I thought that it may have been a &amp;#34;bottle update&amp;#34;. Boy this new bottle is crap compared to what I was supposed to get. I won&#x27;t order it through Amazon and get it where I used to from Ireland. If you love this fragrance, pay the little extra and order it from a proper source. It&#x27;s so bad I tossed it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe for someone what this smells like.  All I know is that I like it and get many compliments from it.</li>
            <li> Connemara is a perfume I purchased in Ireland in 1980 and have been using&lt;br /&gt;it ever since - always asked &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;  had some woman follow me around the Library checking it out!</li>
            <li> I first bought Connemara when I was in Ireland.  The smell is so fresh - not soapy fresh, rather springtime fresh.  I get so many compliments when I&#x27;m wearing Connemara about how refreshing the aroma is.  And, the essence remains for hours during a long business day.  And, Amazon has a great price!  Highly recommend as a unique aroma that will make you feel alive and ready to handle the world or whatever problems occur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Connemara since I discovered it in Ireland several years ago.  Its very light and different, and I get a lot of complements on it.  And, of course, it always reminds me of Connemara!</li>
            <li> LOVE this parfum.  It is sort of like White Linen, but not as strong.  It is long lasting, and concentrated.  I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the greatest smelling perfume I have ever bought. I get many compliments  when I wear it. Please don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
