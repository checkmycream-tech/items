            <li>I LOVE THIS SLEEP MASK!!!  </li>
            <li>Very erotic and sensual.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had the mask for about two weeks and the dainty straps are already fraying.</li>
            <li>A good buy !</li>
            <li>It has worked great at night or during the day.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>For the price, its a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great for plane sleeping.</li>
            <li>This eye mask looks great, but it just doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>The two elastic bands are great.</li>
            <li>this is great for darkness.</li>
            <li>The padding is great, and sometimes I forget that I have it on.</li>
            <li>Great price and shipping .</li>
            <li>Was I ever so happy now, taking my naps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value at a great price.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>This one is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For my money nothing can match the design or the lovely feel of them on your face and huging the nose so that you get a perfect night</li>
            <li>Excellent, it blocks out all the light!</li>
            <li>I think, in order to make it a really good product, I will have to sew on heavier straps.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a good product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the way the mask blocks out light.</li>
            <li>Amazon S&amp;M is not my thing and it would interfere with my getting a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Definitely good for the price though.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This fits perfectly and keeps light out.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>This eye mask is a good item, but</li>
            <li>I found great results for sleep but after about 2 weeks of use, the top strap broke..</li>
            <li>A great fit.</li>
            <li>This is a great sleep mask for blocking out ALL the light.  </li>
            <li>bought 3 sleep masks around Dec. 2009 for my own use.</li>
            <li>Very happy with not only the speed in which the eye mask came, but how light weight it is..and the price is great!</li>
            <li>The material is some kind of plastic feeling material.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job blocking out the light.</li>
            <li>It blocks light fairly well.</li>
            <li>This is the best one  I have bought so far.</li>
            <li>this has been by far one of the best things I could&#x27;ve EVER</li>
            <li>This mask does a good job of blocking out light so that I can fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The material is light (normally a good thing), but somehow still abrasive to my skin.</li>
            <li>Silky feeling, light-weight, great even for the hot summer months.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and does its job.</li>
            <li>Very cheap material...</li>
            <li>Its cheap and not that great, id spend money on a better more comfortable one, just my two cents on it.</li>
            <li>A cheap item at a cheap price !!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m glad I bought two.</li>
            <li>I work midnights and sleep so much better during the day using this.</li>
            <li>and it arrived like three days later in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>These masks the way they perform better than any others that I have bought in stores and at a better price.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>I should be able to figure out how to keep the rubber bands that keep them in place from stretching out, perhaps hand washing in woolite would keep them like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T FIND A BETTER SLEEP MASK</li>
            <li>ANYWHERE FOR SLEEPING ON TRAIN OR AIRPLANE OR IN YOUR OWN BED TO KEEP ALL THE LIGHT OUT</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s REALLY cheap!  </li>
            <li>This was nice so you can adjust it more precisely.</li>
            <li>I love this item and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>If you want something better try the Daydream Sleep Masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought the material felt more like plastic than a cloth material.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing ONE mask for one year and it still holds up, I&#x27;m buying some more</li>
            <li>I used it for a recent overseas trip to fly comfortably and it worked like a dream,haha!I recommend ,price is great</li>
            <li>Save your money there are better products.</li>
            <li>Works for naps!:)</li>
            <li>I love these masks.  </li>
            <li>And I trully wanted this for the ear plugs more than the mask itself...</li>
            <li>I cant say Im fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love what can be done with these.</li>
            <li>really love it</li>
            <li>able to sleep in day.</li>
            <li>I supposed for $5 its okay, but I believe it could have been made better.</li>
            <li>I plan to order some more for gifts for my daughters.</li>
            <li>Nice to have but seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the mask</li>
            <li>a bit more snug</li>
            <li>Perfect for sleeping because it shuts out all light which also makes it good for other &amp;#34;activities&amp;#34; you might want this for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced the postitive reviews on Amazon are written by the seller because no one in their right mind would write a good review.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend them to anyone looking for a product which works at a great price.</li>
            <li>but it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>The bands havnt lost elasticity in a month either so its pretty good.</li>
            <li>You can easily buy something better.</li>
            <li>was a great fit really help block out the light</li>
            <li>It blocks out most of the light.</li>
            <li>It blocks most of the light out.</li>
            <li>elastic band stretches out of shape easily  </li>
            <li>slips off face easily  </li>
            <li>As far as the foam earplugs are concerned, I am sure they are perfectly good earplugs.</li>
            <li>So in summation, if you really feel that you need a sleep mask, this one is pretty good because it blocks out most light and is very light weight.</li>
            <li>but it is comfortable and keeps the light out, which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li>All in all a good mask, soft and blocks most of the light.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is an easy and comfortable way to block out the light .</li>
            <li>Use it anytime for sleep or for play, block out the sun, easy &amp; fun to use, I would get more</li>
            <li>They are indeed cheap and worked fine</li>
            <li>The description \\&quot;silky\\&quot; is fairly accurate -</li>
            <li>Given how cheap the mask was, I had some reservations about quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly light sleeper</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>so they are comfortable and cheap.</li>
            <li>Its a mask, it keeps the light out, it helps you sleep while your chick has the light on.</li>
            <li>I saw a review that said they could see day light because the sunlight came in around the nose area.  </li>
            <li>, IF YOU ARE LIGHT SLEEPER PERHAPS SOME EAR PLUGS MIGHT BE NEEDED IN TRAVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, because there are two straps, they secure the mask to your head without feeling like a vice.  </li>
            <li>Smooth material/</li>
            <li>comfortable  </li>
            <li>Some light gets in from the bottom as the lip doesn&#x27;t exactly fit the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li>It does the job a sleep mask is designed to do which is be comfortable while keeping the light out.     </li>
            <li>The fit and size were both o.k.</li>
            <li>I can sleep at anytime of the day , and not be disturbed by any light source .</li>
            <li>The mask is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t touch the eye&#x27;s at all .  </li>
            <li>are your time paying for this really cheap product.</li>
            <li>Besides not blocking light around the perimeter, the mask stuck to my face.</li>
            <li>I am a light sleeper, and I cannot stand light when I sleep.</li>
            <li>Blocks 75% ~ 85% of light  Light, doesn&#x27;t irate skin or head  </li>
            <li>Comfortable    </li>
            <li>My face would get sweaty but I could still see light through the mask-</li>
            <li>Being made of silk on both sides allows light to pass through the holes.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t fit on your head anymore after that</li>
            <li>This eye mask is comfortable and blocks out almost all light.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes some light sneaks in through the bottom.</li>
            <li>Any light whatsoever and my ADHD riddled mind gets distracted.</li>
            <li>charges his phone on the nightstand, and there is a light shining from the screen.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably.</li>
            <li>The mask its comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to wear all night.</li>
            <li>Two straps instead of one help it stay securely in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two straps give a comfortable fit and aren&#x27;t too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I work night shift and need something to block out light to help me sleep.  </li>
            <li>This mask is cheap, comfortable, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>The mask works it keeps the light out of your eyes when it is lighted out and allows you to go to sleep.</li>
            <li>does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...keep the light out.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>if you get a lot of light in your bedroom</li>
            <li>The material feels cheap and there was no discernible padding.</li>
            <li>I use this eye mask when I meditate, just to keep all light from coming through my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>This mask is also extremely light.  </li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>Hubby can block out the noise but the light drives him nuts.  </li>
            <li>Nice case, item as described, fast shipment</li>
            <li>just wish around the nose fit</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really fit well on my face.</li>
            <li>Two straps are better than one for getting a mask to fit right.</li>
            <li>Its not the most comfortable thing ever, but its not really uncomfortable either.</li>
            <li>I personally like the foam ones more than the fabric ones, but this one is OK to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect -- not as hot as other masks, in fact, it&#x27;s quite cool.</li>
            <li>Good value comfortable unlike many of the more elaborate (sand expensive) sleep masks.  </li>
            <li>I like the one I purchased at Wal-Mart a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover that it was kind of a plastic or vinyl fabric, since the ad said it is \\&quot;silky soft.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re flimsy, made of cheap material, in no way resembly the description on Amazon and are worth nothing.</li>
            <li>But if you thought it would be a cool idea, I&#x27;d pass.</li>
            <li>Simple did the job and was good for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other sleep masks before, usually relatively cheap ones, but this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>so I need a comfortable mask that blocks out light very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>This eye mask is adequate and it is silky in a plastic way</li>
            <li>It seems cheap, and didn&#x27;t fit my face very well without sliding.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>At [...] a pop with shipping, you&#x27;d be much better off buying a mask of better quality that will last longer.</li>
            <li>Some brands fall apart quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I use this, the light coming from the hallway is no longer an issue, I can sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li>I found this great for blocking blaring sun when you need dark to sleep.  </li>
            <li>This sleep mask is great - cuts down on the grumbling.</li>
            <li>These masks are very small, don&#x27;t smell very good, and when I put it on the light came right through.</li>
            <li>The unique design is perfect for the dark room sleep even in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>It fits well, the two straps are not tight, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Placing a wash rag over my eyes would be more effective than this flimsy little mask.</li>
            <li>Like most people looking for a great night sleep during the day (namely us late shifters), I have become very particular in the sleep masks I like.</li>
            <li>Yes, this mask is cheap, but I found that it really doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I have found that you really need the two straps for it to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>This was very itchy and did not block all the light</li>
            <li>For me, it is worth customizing the straps to use it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable and completely block the morning light.</li>
            <li>They are probably better suited to a child than an adult.</li>
            <li>Cons:  If it is super bright, light will leak through  Small crack where the nose is  Mask touches the eye.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>Quality and price were just right.</li>
            <li>The bright blue light that shines from the pc tower brings to mind scenes from \\&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\&quot; (1977).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would reccomend spending a little more just to get a better product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this expecting a total blackout for sleeping, but instead it turned out to be a cheaply made item that does not filter out all light rays.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery....</li>
            <li>I bought a black one and a purple one, but neither one was good at completely blocking the light.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely block out all the light</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li>* interested</li>
            <li>It also blocks the sunlight pretty well, about 75% ~ 85% of all lights.</li>
            <li>Light weight and soft.</li>
            <li>have tried many different styles of masks.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed it was that it definately does not come with a pair of ear plugs..</li>
            <li>These work pretty darn good at keeping out any extra light when you&#x27;re trying to sleep and they even came with a free pair of ear plugs which my girlfriend uses faithfully the only problem is that the ear plugs started ripping shortly after she started using them.</li>
            <li>I thought that the double strap would work better but they still gather around my ears and annoy me.  </li>
            <li>so I tossed all of the masks and am using some different, more costly brands now.</li>
            <li>It is soft, does what I want it to do and is comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting much more solid sleep through the night.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I was looking for complete darkness and comfort in material, as well as fit.</li>
            <li>If you just need a little bit more light blocked, this should do the trick for you.</li>
            <li>It is the little things that help make our days and nights more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>might* be worth it, but frankly the free masks I&#x27;ve been given on international flights have been higher quality than this.</li>
            <li>Also they wash easily and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly not lined with silk or satin, but the material is comfortable and blocks out a sufficient amount of light.</li>
            <li>It makes everything nice and dark and I can&#x27;t see anything once I put them on which is what I need when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other products that were much more expensive, but this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The straps aren&#x27;t quite strong enough to keep the mask in place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He has no problem downloading large files to the desktop computer in our room while we sleep.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want something on my face loaded with toxins like that</li>
            <li>I have tried using different things for blindfolds in the past and found that they all allowed my partner to see more than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Light slips in from all sides (not just around the nose which is typical of cheap masks).</li>
            <li>if the room you are sleeping in gets a little warm, then this mask may make you a bit sweaty.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice little mask.</li>
            <li>I can finally sleep witha light on in the house and It makes it so much easier to sleep in Alaska in the summer</li>
            <li>There should not be much to write about here.</li>
            <li>and I felt too much pressure on my eyeballs when I wore it and</li>
            <li>And it was NOT opaque at all, you could see the light coming through the material itself, which defeated the purpose totally.    </li>
            <li>This product works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li>Just as you expect, this is a cheap, basic eye mask.</li>
            <li>Light goes through from the middle/doesn&#x27;t cover your nose properly.</li>
            <li>This blindfold actually works and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a door for my room, and the hallway light is left on a lot.</li>
            <li>Thanks yo</li>
            <li>What isn&#x27;t shown on the picture is a extra piece of fabric that goes around the nose and is intended to help fold the mask around your face as well as block the light that would come from underneath.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this for me and much to my surprise..</li>
            <li>It blocks out the sun really well.</li>
            <li>she really loves it one two</li>
            <li>Allows for much easier college dorm sleeping.</li>
            <li>The two-strap system really helps keep the mask on your face throughout the night, which has always been a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap mask, and it performs as such.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m just to much of a thrasher in bed?</li>
            <li>This may not be the most expensive luxurious mask you will ever own</li>
            <li>It blocks the light better than other larger, heavier ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my face, not too tight but not too loose.</li>
            <li>What really surprised me however, is that in a dark room at night with just a TV on, I could see the light from the TV right through the front of the mask!</li>
            <li>It does keep out light, so I didn&#x27;t give it 1 star, but it is not soft or silky.</li>
            <li>It is not soft or smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a piece of fabric that fits nicely over your nose and is thick enough to block out light.</li>
            <li>The bands are not to tight and a nice soft nose piece.</li>
            <li>That proves that once you have these little marvels on your face you won&#x27;t see any light until you get up and push it up over your forhead to go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It really sets a new mood for &amp;#34;bedtime&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Lets some light in but not enough to bother (I have quite sensitive eyes).    </li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive masks with more of a cupped design</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and completely dark!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Paying a little more would give you something with higher quality, but if you just want to sleep in or adjust to the night shift a few days a week, I think this mask is just fine.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is pretty good for a sleep mask, it blocks those minor lights (such as outside hall and the glow from my digital clock).</li>
            <li>so I could start getting on a normal sleep schedule, but it ended up being somewhat of a nuisance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much at the point where any clothing bothers me when I sleep, so I just go naked.    </li>
            <li>My dear sweet husband&#x27;s idea of complete darkness is NOT the same as mine.</li>
            <li>Does the job but the elastic degrades fairly rapidly but for the price I can&#x27;t complain to much.&lt;br /&gt;Looses 1 star for poor elastic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>Looking at the mask right now it is tearing along the outside of the mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I ordered 3 more of these little marvels, the rubber bands after using them for 6 months it began not to huge the face as tightly as I wanted</li>
            <li>They are way more comfortable than the more expensive ones I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered the Dream Zone Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask and the Silk Sleep Mask (Color: Blue) by Spa Sister, and the first one was padded</li>
            <li>I have now had my shipment of the masks for several months, and the first one that I started to use is still on the job.  </li>
            <li>These are long lasting, and still comfortable.</li>
            <li>I also bought a more expensive one thinking it could improve on this, but that wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>The head bands are comfortable and don&#x27;t mess up my hair.</li>
            <li>It blocks out all light yet does not feel too tight.</li>
            <li>The material is also a little \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; sounding, but it&#x27;s still comfortable and that hasn&#x27;t affected my sleep.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be spending a little more on the next one.</li>
            <li>This is described as far nicer than the reality.  </li>
            <li>No problems thus far and dont expect any.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not \\&quot;silky\\&quot; nor \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; and to describe it that way is a misrepresentation of the product completely.</li>
            <li>but I did not find it to be soft.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Masks directly from Dream Essentials.  </li>
            <li>I need complete darkness to sleep.</li>
            <li>if you work the night shift and want complete darkness when you are trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>This mask offers none of these.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is thin yet effective meant that I could wear it while using my sleep apnea mask.</li>
            <li>The bands are nice and thin.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very thin, made of cheap fabric that lets a lot of light through yet doesn&#x27;t breath well.</li>
            <li>Fits well - snug but not tight.</li>
            <li>Use it to go to sleep or have fun in other ways.</li>
            <li>They are the exact length to make the mask stay on, while also being comfortably loose.</li>
            <li>One of the head straps broke within the first week of using it, and that was with minimal stretching of the elastic.</li>
            <li>As long as you can trust your playmate, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>However, it does not completely block 100% of all light (also a little crack in the nose</li>
            <li>This is a funny story that happen to me, I put my eye drops in and put the mask on and lay down and forgot to turn the little bedside flash light on all night, needless to say the batteries aren&#x27;t able to run all night without going out.  </li>
            <li>Totally unacceptable for wearing anywhere near your eyes</li>
            <li>As far as use, I learned about the idea of sleeping with a mask through Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple and the Primal Blueprint.  </li>
            <li>it is more like a thin plastic.</li>
            <li>This little mask does the job, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Other than that I have no other complaints and the item is VERY durable.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes a little more tight than I&#x27;d like,</li>
            <li>It definitely blocks all the light, although sometimes I have to adjust it a little to block out a tiny sliver from the bottom around my nose (but I have a big nose, so that might be why).  </li>
            <li>I sometimes wake up wondering why is it so dark yet there are birds chirping, so it does work very well.    </li>
            <li>I think i have three of them now, but what sets this one apart is the little extra piece of material right above your nose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the manufacturer shortened the length of the two elastic bands to save costs but all 4 masks are MUCH too tight to wear.  </li>
            <li>Sorry honey, either you have a very huge nose</li>
            <li>This will loose tension in the back and the product will not provide complete blackout around the nose area.</li>
            <li>Very light on the face, rarely ever comes off while sleeping, blocks out all the annoying morning sunlight.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A good buy !</li>

            <li> Great for plane sleeping.</li>

            <li> lol</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> This one is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For my money nothing can match the design or the lovely feel of them on your face and huging the nose so that you get a perfect night</li>
            <li> Excellent, it blocks out all the light!</li>
            <li> I think, in order to make it a really good product, I will have to sew on heavier straps.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a good product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with the way the mask blocks out light.</li>
            <li> Amazon S&amp;M is not my thing and it would interfere with my getting a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Definitely good for the price though.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly and keeps light out.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is a good item, but</li>
            <li> I found great results for sleep but after about 2 weeks of use, the top strap broke..</li>
            <li> A great fit.</li>
            <li> This is a great sleep mask for blocking out ALL the light.  </li>
            <li> bought 3 sleep masks around Dec. 2009 for my own use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with not only the speed in which the eye mask came, but how light weight it is..and the price is great!</li>
            <li> The material is some kind of plastic feeling material.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job blocking out the light.</li>
            <li> It blocks light fairly well.</li>
            <li> This is the best one  I have bought so far.</li>
            <li> this has been by far one of the best things I could&#x27;ve EVER</li>
            <li> This mask does a good job of blocking out light so that I can fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material is light (normally a good thing), but somehow still abrasive to my skin.</li>
            <li> Silky feeling, light-weight, great even for the hot summer months.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and does its job.</li>
            <li> Very cheap material...</li>
            <li> Its cheap and not that great, id spend money on a better more comfortable one, just my two cents on it.</li>
            <li> A cheap item at a cheap price !!</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m glad I bought two.</li>
            <li> I work midnights and sleep so much better during the day using this.</li>
            <li> and it arrived like three days later in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> These masks the way they perform better than any others that I have bought in stores and at a better price.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> I should be able to figure out how to keep the rubber bands that keep them in place from stretching out, perhaps hand washing in woolite would keep them like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T FIND A BETTER SLEEP MASK</li>
            <li> ANYWHERE FOR SLEEPING ON TRAIN OR AIRPLANE OR IN YOUR OWN BED TO KEEP ALL THE LIGHT OUT</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s REALLY cheap!  </li>
            <li> This was nice so you can adjust it more precisely.</li>
            <li> I love this item and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> If you want something better try the Daydream Sleep Masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the material felt more like plastic than a cloth material.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing ONE mask for one year and it still holds up, I&#x27;m buying some more</li>
            <li> I used it for a recent overseas trip to fly comfortably and it worked like a dream,haha!I recommend ,price is great</li>
            <li> Save your money there are better products.</li>
            <li> Works for naps!:)</li>
            <li> I love these masks.  </li>
            <li> And I trully wanted this for the ear plugs more than the mask itself...</li>
            <li> I cant say Im fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love what can be done with these.</li>
            <li> really love it</li>
            <li> able to sleep in day.</li>
            <li> I supposed for $5 its okay, but I believe it could have been made better.</li>
            <li> I plan to order some more for gifts for my daughters.</li>
            <li> Nice to have but seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the mask</li>
            <li> a bit more snug</li>
            <li> Perfect for sleeping because it shuts out all light which also makes it good for other &amp;#34;activities&amp;#34; you might want this for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced the postitive reviews on Amazon are written by the seller because no one in their right mind would write a good review.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend them to anyone looking for a product which works at a great price.</li>
            <li> but it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> The bands havnt lost elasticity in a month either so its pretty good.</li>
            <li> You can easily buy something better.</li>
            <li> was a great fit really help block out the light</li>
            <li> It blocks out most of the light.</li>
            <li> It blocks most of the light out.</li>
            <li> elastic band stretches out of shape easily  </li>
            <li> slips off face easily  </li>
            <li> As far as the foam earplugs are concerned, I am sure they are perfectly good earplugs.</li>
            <li> So in summation, if you really feel that you need a sleep mask, this one is pretty good because it blocks out most light and is very light weight.</li>
            <li> but it is comfortable and keeps the light out, which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> All in all a good mask, soft and blocks most of the light.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is an easy and comfortable way to block out the light .</li>
            <li> Use it anytime for sleep or for play, block out the sun, easy &amp; fun to use, I would get more</li>
            <li> They are indeed cheap and worked fine</li>
            <li> The description \\&quot;silky\\&quot; is fairly accurate -</li>
            <li> Given how cheap the mask was, I had some reservations about quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly light sleeper</li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> so they are comfortable and cheap.</li>
            <li> Its a mask, it keeps the light out, it helps you sleep while your chick has the light on.</li>
            <li> I saw a review that said they could see day light because the sunlight came in around the nose area.  </li>
            <li> , IF YOU ARE LIGHT SLEEPER PERHAPS SOME EAR PLUGS MIGHT BE NEEDED IN TRAVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, because there are two straps, they secure the mask to your head without feeling like a vice.  </li>
            <li> Smooth material/</li>
            <li> comfortable  </li>
            <li> Some light gets in from the bottom as the lip doesn&#x27;t exactly fit the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li> It does the job a sleep mask is designed to do which is be comfortable while keeping the light out.     </li>
            <li> The fit and size were both o.k.</li>
            <li> I can sleep at anytime of the day , and not be disturbed by any light source .</li>
            <li> The mask is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t touch the eye&#x27;s at all .  </li>
            <li> are your time paying for this really cheap product.</li>
            <li> Besides not blocking light around the perimeter, the mask stuck to my face.</li>
            <li> I am a light sleeper, and I cannot stand light when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Blocks 75% ~ 85% of light  Light, doesn&#x27;t irate skin or head  </li>
            <li> Comfortable    </li>
            <li> My face would get sweaty but I could still see light through the mask-</li>
            <li> Being made of silk on both sides allows light to pass through the holes.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t fit on your head anymore after that</li>
            <li> This eye mask is comfortable and blocks out almost all light.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes some light sneaks in through the bottom.</li>
            <li> Any light whatsoever and my ADHD riddled mind gets distracted.</li>
            <li> charges his phone on the nightstand, and there is a light shining from the screen.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably.</li>
            <li> The mask its comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to wear all night.</li>
            <li> Two straps instead of one help it stay securely in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two straps give a comfortable fit and aren&#x27;t too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work night shift and need something to block out light to help me sleep.  </li>
            <li> This mask is cheap, comfortable, and does the job.  </li>
            <li> The mask works it keeps the light out of your eyes when it is lighted out and allows you to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...keep the light out.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> if you get a lot of light in your bedroom</li>
            <li> The material feels cheap and there was no discernible padding.</li>
            <li> I use this eye mask when I meditate, just to keep all light from coming through my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> This mask is also extremely light.  </li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> Hubby can block out the noise but the light drives him nuts.  </li>
            <li> Nice case, item as described, fast shipment</li>
            <li> just wish around the nose fit</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really fit well on my face.</li>
            <li> Two straps are better than one for getting a mask to fit right.</li>
            <li> Its not the most comfortable thing ever, but its not really uncomfortable either.</li>
            <li> I personally like the foam ones more than the fabric ones, but this one is OK to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect -- not as hot as other masks, in fact, it&#x27;s quite cool.</li>
            <li> Good value comfortable unlike many of the more elaborate (sand expensive) sleep masks.  </li>
            <li> I like the one I purchased at Wal-Mart a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover that it was kind of a plastic or vinyl fabric, since the ad said it is \\&quot;silky soft.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re flimsy, made of cheap material, in no way resembly the description on Amazon and are worth nothing.</li>
            <li> But if you thought it would be a cool idea, I&#x27;d pass.</li>
            <li> Simple did the job and was good for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other sleep masks before, usually relatively cheap ones, but this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> so I need a comfortable mask that blocks out light very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is adequate and it is silky in a plastic way</li>
            <li> It seems cheap, and didn&#x27;t fit my face very well without sliding.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> At [...] a pop with shipping, you&#x27;d be much better off buying a mask of better quality that will last longer.</li>
            <li> Some brands fall apart quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I use this, the light coming from the hallway is no longer an issue, I can sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li> I found this great for blocking blaring sun when you need dark to sleep.  </li>
            <li> This sleep mask is great - cuts down on the grumbling.</li>
            <li> These masks are very small, don&#x27;t smell very good, and when I put it on the light came right through.</li>
            <li> The unique design is perfect for the dark room sleep even in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> It fits well, the two straps are not tight, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Placing a wash rag over my eyes would be more effective than this flimsy little mask.</li>
            <li> Like most people looking for a great night sleep during the day (namely us late shifters), I have become very particular in the sleep masks I like.</li>
            <li> Yes, this mask is cheap, but I found that it really doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have found that you really need the two straps for it to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> This was very itchy and did not block all the light</li>
            <li> For me, it is worth customizing the straps to use it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re comfortable and completely block the morning light.</li>
            <li> They are probably better suited to a child than an adult.</li>
            <li> Cons:  If it is super bright, light will leak through  Small crack where the nose is  Mask touches the eye.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> Quality and price were just right.</li>
            <li> The bright blue light that shines from the pc tower brings to mind scenes from \\&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\&quot; (1977).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would reccomend spending a little more just to get a better product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting a total blackout for sleeping, but instead it turned out to be a cheaply made item that does not filter out all light rays.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery....</li>
            <li> I bought a black one and a purple one, but neither one was good at completely blocking the light.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely block out all the light</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> * interested</li>
            <li> It also blocks the sunlight pretty well, about 75% ~ 85% of all lights.</li>
            <li> Light weight and soft.</li>
            <li> have tried many different styles of masks.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed it was that it definately does not come with a pair of ear plugs..</li>
            <li> These work pretty darn good at keeping out any extra light when you&#x27;re trying to sleep and they even came with a free pair of ear plugs which my girlfriend uses faithfully the only problem is that the ear plugs started ripping shortly after she started using them.</li>
            <li> I thought that the double strap would work better but they still gather around my ears and annoy me.  </li>
            <li> so I tossed all of the masks and am using some different, more costly brands now.</li>
            <li> It is soft, does what I want it to do and is comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting much more solid sleep through the night.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I was looking for complete darkness and comfort in material, as well as fit.</li>
            <li> If you just need a little bit more light blocked, this should do the trick for you.</li>
            <li> It is the little things that help make our days and nights more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> might* be worth it, but frankly the free masks I&#x27;ve been given on international flights have been higher quality than this.</li>
            <li> Also they wash easily and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly not lined with silk or satin, but the material is comfortable and blocks out a sufficient amount of light.</li>
            <li> It makes everything nice and dark and I can&#x27;t see anything once I put them on which is what I need when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other products that were much more expensive, but this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li> The straps aren&#x27;t quite strong enough to keep the mask in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has no problem downloading large files to the desktop computer in our room while we sleep.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t want something on my face loaded with toxins like that</li>
            <li> I have tried using different things for blindfolds in the past and found that they all allowed my partner to see more than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> Light slips in from all sides (not just around the nose which is typical of cheap masks).</li>
            <li> if the room you are sleeping in gets a little warm, then this mask may make you a bit sweaty.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice little mask.</li>
            <li> I can finally sleep witha light on in the house and It makes it so much easier to sleep in Alaska in the summer</li>
            <li> There should not be much to write about here.</li>
            <li> and I felt too much pressure on my eyeballs when I wore it and</li>
            <li> And it was NOT opaque at all, you could see the light coming through the material itself, which defeated the purpose totally.    </li>
            <li> This product works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li> Just as you expect, this is a cheap, basic eye mask.</li>
            <li> Light goes through from the middle/doesn&#x27;t cover your nose properly.</li>
            <li> This blindfold actually works and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a door for my room, and the hallway light is left on a lot.</li>
            <li> Thanks yo</li>
            <li> What isn&#x27;t shown on the picture is a extra piece of fabric that goes around the nose and is intended to help fold the mask around your face as well as block the light that would come from underneath.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and much to my surprise..</li>
            <li> It blocks out the sun really well.</li>
            <li> she really loves it one two</li>
            <li> Allows for much easier college dorm sleeping.</li>
            <li> The two-strap system really helps keep the mask on your face throughout the night, which has always been a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a cheap mask, and it performs as such.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just to much of a thrasher in bed?</li>
            <li> This may not be the most expensive luxurious mask you will ever own</li>
            <li> It blocks the light better than other larger, heavier ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face, not too tight but not too loose.</li>
            <li> What really surprised me however, is that in a dark room at night with just a TV on, I could see the light from the TV right through the front of the mask!</li>
            <li> It does keep out light, so I didn&#x27;t give it 1 star, but it is not soft or silky.</li>
            <li> It is not soft or smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a piece of fabric that fits nicely over your nose and is thick enough to block out light.</li>
            <li> The bands are not to tight and a nice soft nose piece.</li>
            <li> That proves that once you have these little marvels on your face you won&#x27;t see any light until you get up and push it up over your forhead to go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It really sets a new mood for &amp;#34;bedtime&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Lets some light in but not enough to bother (I have quite sensitive eyes).    </li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive masks with more of a cupped design</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and completely dark!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Paying a little more would give you something with higher quality, but if you just want to sleep in or adjust to the night shift a few days a week, I think this mask is just fine.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is pretty good for a sleep mask, it blocks those minor lights (such as outside hall and the glow from my digital clock).</li>
            <li> so I could start getting on a normal sleep schedule, but it ended up being somewhat of a nuisance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much at the point where any clothing bothers me when I sleep, so I just go naked.    </li>
            <li> My dear sweet husband&#x27;s idea of complete darkness is NOT the same as mine.</li>
            <li> Does the job but the elastic degrades fairly rapidly but for the price I can&#x27;t complain to much.&lt;br /&gt;Looses 1 star for poor elastic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> Looking at the mask right now it is tearing along the outside of the mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I ordered 3 more of these little marvels, the rubber bands after using them for 6 months it began not to huge the face as tightly as I wanted</li>
            <li> They are way more comfortable than the more expensive ones I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the Dream Zone Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask and the Silk Sleep Mask (Color: Blue) by Spa Sister, and the first one was padded</li>
            <li> I have now had my shipment of the masks for several months, and the first one that I started to use is still on the job.  </li>
            <li> These are long lasting, and still comfortable.</li>
            <li> I also bought a more expensive one thinking it could improve on this, but that wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> The head bands are comfortable and don&#x27;t mess up my hair.</li>
            <li> It blocks out all light yet does not feel too tight.</li>
            <li> The material is also a little \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; sounding, but it&#x27;s still comfortable and that hasn&#x27;t affected my sleep.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be spending a little more on the next one.</li>
            <li> This is described as far nicer than the reality.  </li>
            <li> No problems thus far and dont expect any.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not \\&quot;silky\\&quot; nor \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; and to describe it that way is a misrepresentation of the product completely.</li>
            <li> but I did not find it to be soft.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Masks directly from Dream Essentials.  </li>
            <li> I need complete darkness to sleep.</li>
            <li> if you work the night shift and want complete darkness when you are trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> This mask offers none of these.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is thin yet effective meant that I could wear it while using my sleep apnea mask.</li>
            <li> The bands are nice and thin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very thin, made of cheap fabric that lets a lot of light through yet doesn&#x27;t breath well.</li>
            <li> Fits well - snug but not tight.</li>
            <li> Use it to go to sleep or have fun in other ways.</li>
            <li> They are the exact length to make the mask stay on, while also being comfortably loose.</li>
            <li> One of the head straps broke within the first week of using it, and that was with minimal stretching of the elastic.</li>
            <li> As long as you can trust your playmate, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> However, it does not completely block 100% of all light (also a little crack in the nose</li>
            <li> This is a funny story that happen to me, I put my eye drops in and put the mask on and lay down and forgot to turn the little bedside flash light on all night, needless to say the batteries aren&#x27;t able to run all night without going out.  </li>
            <li> Totally unacceptable for wearing anywhere near your eyes</li>
            <li> As far as use, I learned about the idea of sleeping with a mask through Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple and the Primal Blueprint.  </li>
            <li> it is more like a thin plastic.</li>
            <li> This little mask does the job, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no other complaints and the item is VERY durable.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a little more tight than I&#x27;d like,</li>
            <li> It definitely blocks all the light, although sometimes I have to adjust it a little to block out a tiny sliver from the bottom around my nose (but I have a big nose, so that might be why).  </li>
            <li> I sometimes wake up wondering why is it so dark yet there are birds chirping, so it does work very well.    </li>
            <li> I think i have three of them now, but what sets this one apart is the little extra piece of material right above your nose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the manufacturer shortened the length of the two elastic bands to save costs but all 4 masks are MUCH too tight to wear.  </li>
            <li> Sorry honey, either you have a very huge nose</li>
            <li> This will loose tension in the back and the product will not provide complete blackout around the nose area.</li>
            <li> Very light on the face, rarely ever comes off while sleeping, blocks out all the annoying morning sunlight.</li>
            <li> It lays flat on your face.  </li>
            <li> The elastic is also very thin and flimsy, so the mask slips out of position easily, and I doubt if it would hold up well to multiple washings.</li>
            <li> B000RFQVZ6 Dream Essentials Snooz Silky Soft Eye Mask - Black]]</li>
            <li> Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Mask - Black]]  </li>
            <li> This mask was a solid buy since it even has an additional portion by the bridge of the nose, which makes it difficult for light to seep through the bottom.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying them for a one time use like a long flight they *</li>
            <li> Also one night I used one of them in a hotel with white pillowcases and when i woke up the mask had left black imprints all over the pillowcases.</li>
            <li> The material is very thin and I can still see light when wearing it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who am I to judge what other consenting adults do in private is not my concern.</li>
            <li> This satin mask was very cheaply made and very uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, even for its price, especially in the summer it can really disturb you.</li>
            <li> My big complaint is that it isn&#x27;t soft on the underside of the mask</li>
            <li> Smell never leaves this item even after washing several times, couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed.</li>
            <li> It feels like someone tied a noose around our head over our eyes and is pulling the noose back really tightly.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s only a little bit.</li>
            <li> My product came way before it&#x27;s expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> The nose extension partially blocks air passage too.</li>
            <li> What I did like about it was the double narrow straps.</li>
            <li> so when your eyes get wet while to yawn your eyes water when you sleep</li>
            <li> I bought this mask to help keep my eyes closed</li>
            <li> Works as expected and seems durable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a good sleep mask, I am disappointed in the reviews because I only ordered it because of the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I can not wear this for very long because the \\&quot;plastic feel\\&quot; makes it hot and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is just that I am a side sleeper and have never liked earplugs in general.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other masks to compare, but</li>
            <li> Other than that I guess it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> Even if the outside hall is lit up, I find it hard to sleep.     </li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> back I&#x27;d say it lasts at least six months of every day use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not really worth it if you can&#x27;t sleep with things on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> but the elastic head band becomes very stretchy and useless after about 2-3 nights.</li>
            <li> I never used it in harsh conditions, but the strap is not very durable</li>
            <li> Other ones I wore felt a little \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; which may have contributed to me removing them during sleep.  </li>
            <li> I am a person who needs a black room to sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a black plastic bag over my face.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion, buy two or three if you can because she loses it every few days.</li>
            <li> The mask, however, is the only thing that allows me to sleep with my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am serious.</li>
            <li> I wore the mask with slightly damp hair and the black dye bled onto my sheets and stained them.</li>
            <li> it is so tight that the eye flaps flip up.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel like they are being squeezed tightly</li>
            <li> Someone else said the straps were too tight; I prefer tight straps to start because they stretch after use.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it&#x27;s incredibly tight on my head, and I woke up in pain from it.</li>
            <li> The strap is tight.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a mask that had a little padding but this had none.</li>
            <li> but it opens a little in the sides of the nose and can be a bit of a problem.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to wear at all.</li>
            <li> so I figured I would order a few for her</li>
            <li> After having it for a few weeks, I stopped after a couple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> over time (a few months) the bands that go around the head losen up</li>
            <li> In truth, it&#x27;s a plain piece of plastic with some elastic attached.  </li>
            <li> I generally find those uncomfortable and would not have purchased if that flap was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just a small issue.</li>
            <li> The form fitting construction doesn&#x27;t allow blinking and it&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
            <li> makes my face sweat a bit under mask, but hey small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Dream Essentials know what &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; are meant to convey, because I didn&#x27;t find this product to be either.</li>
            <li> Destroyed my expensive white sheets with the bleeding dye.</li>
            <li> Since I wrote this review a couple months ago , the 2 elastic straps on the mask have over stretched and are useless .</li>
            <li> The one I received had a secondary flap to cover the nose area that&#x27;s not pictured in product images.</li>
            <li> These are thin, but no light gets through.</li>
            <li> and I have a very small head.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks for me to get used to having the mask on while I slept, but now I seriously doubt I could sleep through the night without it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can seriously say this mask has saved my marriage.</li>
            <li> the one by Spa Sister was WAY TOO TIGHT!!!  </li>
            <li> I received it very fast but was very disappointed with it..</li>
            <li> I gave this piece of crap merchandise one star only because there was no option to give them negative stars.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a thin plastic bag that&#x27;s labeled \\&quot;Made in China.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> (I sleep on my side) and the straps that led behind your ears scratches the side of your head.</li>
            <li> nose material uncomfortable  </li>
            <li> so it was useless to wear.</li>
            <li> and I find them uncomfortable since I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> I have tried masks that had thicker straps that felt lumpy and were uncomfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> I found it uncomfortable and distracting.</li>
            <li> This mask fails in every category.</li>
            <li> As an owner of 6 or 7 different types of masks over the years, this is without question the worst I have had.</li>
            <li> it is very thin, no cushion to it at all.only ruff plastic.</li>
            <li> The bad part is, when worn is very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing in quality.</li>
            <li> This blocks out the annoying tv lights.</li>
            <li> the worst of both worlds.</li>
            <li> They still aren&#x27;t the worst product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Nasty - all the chemicals/ink/whatever leeching off of it.</li>
            <li> Terrible eye mask.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very comfortable and does its job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely block out all the light but it does a pretty good job. Stays in place well.</li>
            <li> My product came way before it&#x27;s expected arrival date. Although it&#x27;s comfortable to wear I was not really happy with this mask. The material is very thin and I can still see light when wearing it. I like the one I purchased at Wal-Mart a whole lot better. I would not purchase it again. I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> One of the straps detached after a week. I think, in order to make it a really good product, I will have to sew on heavier straps.  Otherwise it is a good product. The fact that it is thin yet effective meant that I could wear it while using my sleep apnea mask. For me, it is worth customizing the straps to use it.</li>
            <li> Bought for kids, worked well.</li>
            <li> Given how cheap the mask was, I had some reservations about quality. I&#x27;m a fairly light sleeper so I need a comfortable mask that blocks out light very thoroughly. This accomplishes both quite well. I highly recommend it. In fact, I&#x27;m glad I bought two.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast but was very disappointed with it..it is very thin, no cushion to it at all.only ruff plastic.</li>
            <li> Being blindfolded heightens every nerve ending in my body. Very erotic and sensual. As long as you can trust your playmate, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The price was right and I&#x27;m very happy with the way the mask blocks out light. It has a piece of fabric that fits nicely over your nose and is thick enough to block out light. I work midnights and sleep so much better during the day using this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting a total blackout for sleeping, but instead it turned out to be a cheaply made item that does not filter out all light rays. It&#x27;s also a bit tight-fitting and makes my face feel smothered. The nose extension partially blocks air passage too. Not comfortable to wear at all. Placing a wash rag over my eyes would be more effective than this flimsy little mask.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve bought. I wanted one for travel. These are thin, but no light gets through. Light weight so they are comfortable and cheap. I also bought a more expensive one thinking it could improve on this, but that wasn&#x27;t true. I&#x27;ll be using these.</li>
            <li> It has worked great at night or during the day. Sometimes a little more tight than I&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s just a small issue.</li>
            <li> This may not be the most expensive luxurious mask you will ever own but it is comfortable and keeps the light out, which is the most important thing. Recommend to those who just need to sleep in the day, not for those who need the most expensive luxurious masks.</li>
            <li> There should not be much to write about here. Its a mask, it keeps the light out, it helps you sleep while your chick has the light on. The bands havnt lost elasticity in a month either so its pretty good. Buy it again? Yes. Like the shipping. No. Wanna sleep? Then buy it.</li>
            <li> just needed something to help block the sun while I sleep and this works perfectly. Fits snuggly around the face.  Seller shipped the day I ordered it and it arrived like three days later in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This review is of a sleep mask bought through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 sleep masks around Dec. 2009 for my own use. I am a person who needs a black room to sleep. These masks the way they perform better than any others that I have bought in stores and at a better price.  The unique design is perfect for the dark room sleep even in the middle of the day. There is a added piece that hugs the nose and keep sunlight out. I saw a review that said they could see day light because the sunlight came in around the nose area.  Sorry honey, either you have a very huge nose are you are wearing them in correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my money nothing can match the design or the lovely feel of them on your face and huging the nose so that you get a perfect night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I ordered 3 more of these little marvels, the rubber bands after using them for 6 months it began not to huge the face as tightly as I wanted so I ordered 3 more. I should be able to figure out how to keep the rubber bands that keep them in place from stretching out, perhaps hand washing in woolite would keep them like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN&#x27;T FIND A BETTER SLEEP MASK ANYWHERE FOR SLEEPING ON TRAIN OR AIRPLANE OR IN YOUR OWN BED TO KEEP ALL THE LIGHT OUT, IF YOU ARE LIGHT SLEEPER PERHAPS SOME EAR PLUGS MIGHT BE NEEDED IN TRAVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a funny story that happen to me, I put my eye drops in and put the mask on and lay down and forgot to turn the little bedside flash light on all night, needless to say the batteries aren&#x27;t able to run all night without going out.  That proves that once you have these little marvels on your face you won&#x27;t see any light until you get up and push it up over your forhead to go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This mask does its job but the material used makes you sweat, in short feels lake I&#x27;m using a black plastic bag over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the Dream Zone Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask and the Silk Sleep Mask (Color: Blue) by Spa Sister, and the first one was padded and I felt too much pressure on my eyeballs when I wore it and the one by Spa Sister was WAY TOO TIGHT!!!  I felt like my eyeballs were getting squished!  And it was NOT opaque at all, you could see the light coming through the material itself, which defeated the purpose totally.    This one is AMAZING!  It fits well, the two straps are not tight, and very comfortable.  Plus, because there are two straps, they secure the mask to your head without feeling like a vice.  It definitely blocks all the light, although sometimes I have to adjust it a little to block out a tiny sliver from the bottom around my nose (but I have a big nose, so that might be why).  The material is also a little \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; sounding, but it&#x27;s still comfortable and that hasn&#x27;t affected my sleep.    I LOVE THIS SLEEP MASK!!!  and it&#x27;s REALLY cheap!  I definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> product inexpensive.  Lightweight  Smooth material/comfortable  Flimsy construction  nose material uncomfortable  elastic band stretches out of shape easily  slips off face easily  would not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> This product works very well for the price.  I found that over time, the bands loosened, but not enough so that I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;m ordering another one, just in case they stop manufacturing them.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these masks when I bought the EarthTherapeutics sleep mask. I was surprised to discover that it was kind of a plastic or vinyl fabric, since the ad said it is \\&quot;silky soft.\\&quot; Also, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job blocking out the light. I bought a black one and a purple one, but neither one was good at completely blocking the light. What I did like about it was the double narrow straps. This was nice so you can adjust it more precisely.</li>
            <li> Just as you expect, this is a cheap, basic eye mask. This will loose tension in the back and the product will not provide complete blackout around the nose area. If you just need a little bit more light blocked, this should do the trick for you.</li>
            <li> I gave this piece of crap merchandise one star only because there was no option to give them negative stars.  They&#x27;re flimsy, made of cheap material, in no way resembly the description on Amazon and are worth nothing. The people peddling these things should be ashamed of themselves.  I&#x27;m convinced the postitive reviews on Amazon are written by the seller because no one in their right mind would write a good review.</li>
            <li> Very happy with not only the speed in which the eye mask came, but how light weight it is..and the price is great!</li>
            <li> the material is not silk. it is more like a thin plastic. if the room you are sleeping in gets a little warm, then this mask may make you a bit sweaty. overall, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Light goes through from the middle/doesn&#x27;t cover your nose properly. Poor quality, even for its price, especially in the summer it can really disturb you. Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a $6 item, you get what you pay for.  Some light gets in from the bottom as the lip doesn&#x27;t exactly fit the bridge of my nose.  Other than that I have no other complaints and the item is VERY durable.  I carry it around in my pocket and it gets all folded up and crinkled, however, shows no sign of damage or ware.</li>
            <li> This is described as far nicer than the reality.  In truth, it&#x27;s a plain piece of plastic with some elastic attached.  It does keep out light, so I didn&#x27;t give it 1 star, but it is not soft or silky.</li>
            <li> For this price how can anyone expect miracles? It does the job a sleep mask is designed to do which is be comfortable while keeping the light out.     It arrived from Dream Essentials in 3 days.     No problems thus far and dont expect any.</li>
            <li> Yes, this mask is cheap, but I found that it really doesn&#x27;t work for me. The form fitting construction doesn&#x27;t allow blinking and it&#x27;s very annoying. Also, I&#x27;ve had the mask for about two weeks and the dainty straps are already fraying. I&#x27;ll be spending a little more on the next one.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks for me to get used to having the mask on while I slept, but now I seriously doubt I could sleep through the night without it. Very light on the face, rarely ever comes off while sleeping, blocks out all the annoying morning sunlight. I love this item and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> My mom asked for a mask to wear at night when she sleeps for Christmas so I figured I would order a few for her stocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good sleep mask, I am disappointed in the reviews because I only ordered it because of the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in an envelope, no box. It is wrapped in a plastic labeled made in China.It is not soft or smooth. it is so tight that the eye flaps flip up. My eyes feel like they are being squeezed tightly and I have a very small head. If you want something better try the Daydream Sleep Masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JP</li>
            <li> Bought this because a roommate refused to shut the lights off at night. Perfect for sleeping because it shuts out all light which also makes it good for other &amp;#34;activities&amp;#34; you might want this for.</li>
            <li> Served its purpose for cataract operation..</li>
            <li> I have tried using different things for blindfolds in the past and found that they all allowed my partner to see more than I would have liked.  This blindfold actually works and is comfortable.  And it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> All in all a good mask, soft and blocks most of the light. Now all she has to do is find the thing again in the headboard/pillow abyss.</li>
            <li> I thought the material felt more like plastic than a cloth material.  The fit and size were both o.k. for me.  I can not wear this for very long because the \\&quot;plastic feel\\&quot; makes it hot and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Actual product is not how the website portrays it AT ALL. It&#x27;s made of cheap material, is paper thin &amp; smells like plastic. Very disappointing in quality. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;silky\\&quot; nor \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; and to describe it that way is a misrepresentation of the product completely. It did not have 2 straps so I wonder if the picture used on Amazon is even the actual product itself. It comes in a thin plastic bag that&#x27;s labeled \\&quot;Made in China.\\&quot; Oh, and while I was writing this review I tried it again and the STRAP JUST BROKE OFF. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a door for my room, and the hallway light is left on a lot. When I use this, the light coming from the hallway is no longer an issue, I can sleep peacefully. Its not the most comfortable thing ever, but its not really uncomfortable either. For the price, its a great deal. It blocks light fairly well.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is adequate and it is silky in a plastic way but I did not find it to be soft. The material is some kind of plastic feeling material. Mine only had one strap where the picture showed two. I have found that you really need the two straps for it to be comfortable. I was hoping for a mask that had a little padding but this had none. Someone else said the straps were too tight; I prefer tight straps to start because they stretch after use.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sleep masks I&#x27;ve ever used. It blocks out all light yet does not feel too tight. I bought mine a while back I&#x27;d say it lasts at least six months of every day use. I&#x27;m buing another one soon.</li>
            <li> It worked, but unfortunately I only used it maybe 3 weeks total and the straps broke off. It seems cheap, and didn&#x27;t fit my face very well without sliding. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect -- not as hot as other masks, in fact, it&#x27;s quite cool. Lets some light in but not enough to bother (I have quite sensitive eyes).    I have been wearing ONE mask for one year and it still holds up, I&#x27;m buying some more so I can save them in case the product is no longer produced. I&#x27;m hoping to wear this mask for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I would say that this is an easy and comfortable way to block out the light . I can sleep at anytime of the day , and not be disturbed by any light source . The mask is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t touch the eye&#x27;s at all .  A good buy ! Since I wrote this review a couple months ago , the 2 elastic straps on the mask have over stretched and are useless . A cheap item at a cheap price !!</li>
            <li> Great for plane sleeping.</li>
            <li> This eye mask looks great, but it just doesn&#x27;t hold up. One of the head straps broke within the first week of using it, and that was with minimal stretching of the elastic.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and completely dark!</li>
            <li> this product is not up to the part dont waist your money are your time paying for this really cheap product.</li>
            <li> Besides not blocking light around the perimeter, the mask stuck to my face. I am always sweating and this mask is not for me.</li>
            <li> Does the job but the elastic degrades fairly rapidly but for the price I can&#x27;t complain to much.&lt;br /&gt;Looses 1 star for poor elastic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: After purchasing this product Amazon now seems to think I am in to S&amp;M and started recommending S&amp;M related items that I definitely am *NOT!* interested in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Amazon S&amp;M is not my thing and it would interfere with my getting a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who am I to judge what other consenting adults do in private is not my concern.</li>
            <li> And I get to play Xbox 360!  I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It stays in place and she flips it up in the morning when she comes back to life. My only suggestion, buy two or three if you can because she loses it every few days.</li>
            <li> I used it for a recent overseas trip to fly comfortably and it worked like a dream,haha!I recommend ,price is great and it&#x27;s a nice little mask.</li>
            <li> This satin mask was very cheaply made and very uncomfortable to wear. This was very itchy and did not block all the light so it was useless to wear. Time to look for a different one.</li>
            <li> Eye masks smelled like diesel fuel. One whiff and into the trash they went. Totally unacceptable for wearing anywhere near your eyes</li>
            <li> This is the best one  I have bought so far. I think i have three of them now, but what sets this one apart is the little extra piece of material right above your nose. It makes everything nice and dark and I can&#x27;t see anything once I put them on which is what I need when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well packaged. They&#x27;re comfortable and completely block the morning light. Also they wash easily and dry quickly. What a wonderful three pack of sleep masks. Highly reccomend them to anyone looking for a product which works at a great price.</li>
            <li> I am a light sleeper, and I cannot stand light when I sleep. Even if the outside hall is lit up, I find it hard to sleep.     This sleep mask is pretty good for a sleep mask, it blocks those minor lights (such as outside hall and the glow from my digital clock). It also blocks the sunlight pretty well, about 75% ~ 85% of all lights. I sometimes wake up wondering why is it so dark yet there are birds chirping, so it does work very well.    However, it does not completely block 100% of all light (also a little crack in the nose part also glows out). Also the mask does touch your eyes so when your eyes get wet while to yawn your eyes water when you sleep you will feel dampness around your eyes.     Overall,it gets the job done well.    Pros:  Blocks 75% ~ 85% of light  Light, doesn&#x27;t irate skin or head  Comfortable    Cons:  If it is super bright, light will leak through  Small crack where the nose is  Mask touches the eye.</li>
            <li> awesome mask to go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;it covers the entire eye sight.&lt;br /&gt;in addition, eye patching is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone looking for and eye mask</li>
            <li> Smell never leaves this item even after washing several times, couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed. Save your money there are better products.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these in different colors because I work night shift, and don&#x27;t like to wear the same sleep mask night after night, as that can cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t very effective. They&#x27;re very thin, made of cheap fabric that lets a lot of light through yet doesn&#x27;t breath well. My face would get sweaty but I could still see light through the mask- the worst of both worlds. The elastic is also very thin and flimsy, so the mask slips out of position easily, and I doubt if it would hold up well to multiple washings. If you&#x27;re buying them for a one time use like a long flight they *might* be worth it, but frankly the free masks I&#x27;ve been given on international flights have been higher quality than this. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> The strap broke on mine after 2 weeks the band snapped but it was good while it lasted. Thanks yo</li>
            <li> Our second order.  Good value comfortable unlike many of the more elaborate (sand expensive) sleep masks.  We keep one in our travel kits second homes etc. so we always have on hand</li>
            <li> Fits snugger than others.  If you have eye make-up on, do not use.  Works for naps!:) I purchased for my husband, but I am the one that uses it.  It blocks out most of the light.</li>
            <li> Excellent, it blocks out all the light!</li>
            <li> I found this great for blocking blaring sun when you need dark to sleep.  The bands are not to tight and a nice soft nose piece.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is alright. It blocks most of the light out. Being made of silk on both sides allows light to pass through the holes. But it&#x27;s only a little bit. What isn&#x27;t shown on the picture is a extra piece of fabric that goes around the nose and is intended to help fold the mask around your face as well as block the light that would come from underneath. It&#x27;s not the best at its job, though. The two elastic bands are great. They are the exact length to make the mask stay on, while also being comfortably loose. I bought this mask to help keep my eyes closed so I could start getting on a normal sleep schedule, but it ended up being somewhat of a nuisance. I sleep on my stomach with my head turned sideways and so the mask slides along my face and the elastic stretches on the side that I&#x27;m lying on. After having it for a few weeks, I stopped after a couple. It&#x27;s just not really worth it if you can&#x27;t sleep with things on your face. I&#x27;m pretty much at the point where any clothing bothers me when I sleep, so I just go naked.    So in summation, if you really feel that you need a sleep mask, this one is pretty good because it blocks out most light and is very light weight. But if you thought it would be a cool idea, I&#x27;d pass. It&#x27;s not worth the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> While inexpensive, keep in mind that you are getting what you pay for with this product.  My big complaint is that it isn&#x27;t soft on the underside of the mask so it makes you sweat underneath it.  It&#x27;s not comfortable.  I would reccomend spending a little more just to get a better product.</li>
            <li> I love these masks.  They are way more comfortable than the more expensive ones I have purchased in the past.  The simple design is what makes this work.  It lays flat on your face.  I have tried more expensive masks with more of a cupped design and I find them uncomfortable since I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and much to my surprise..it&#x27;s great! Light weight and soft. The head bands are comfortable and don&#x27;t mess up my hair. It blocks the light better than other larger, heavier ones I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> They are indeed cheap and worked fine but the elastic head band becomes very stretchy and useless after about 2-3 nights. Won&#x27;t fit on your head anymore after that (and I have a pretty small head). At [...] a pop with shipping, you&#x27;d be much better off buying a mask of better quality that will last longer.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moPWUANE195F50]][[ASIN:B000RFQVZ6 Dream Essentials Snooz Silky Soft Eye Mask - Black]]</li>
            <li> This eye mask is comfortable and blocks out almost all light.  Works as expected and seems durable.  Haven&#x27;t tried any other masks to compare, but doubt I will need to.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.... I work overnights this has been by far one of the best things I could&#x27;ve EVER purchase I&#x27;m sleeping like a baby</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000RFQVZ6 Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Mask - Black]]  I bought 4 Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Masks directly from Dream Essentials.  I don&#x27;t know if the manufacturer shortened the length of the two elastic bands to save costs but all 4 masks are MUCH too tight to wear.  Neither my wife nor I can use this sleep mask.  It feels like someone tied a noose around our head over our eyes and is pulling the noose back really tightly.  We don&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes some light sneaks in through the bottom. Other than that I guess it&#x27;s alright. Definitely good for the price though.</li>
            <li> Everything in the description matched the product. It arrived on time. Fits well - snug but not tight. Good product.</li>
            <li> I tried another eye mask and could still see.  This fits perfectly and keeps light out. The double bands help to keep it in place.  A great fit.</li>
            <li> As far as the foam earplugs are concerned, I am sure they are perfectly good earplugs. It is just that I am a side sleeper and have never liked earplugs in general. The mask, however, is the only thing that allows me to sleep with my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am serious. I cannot sleep with my husband without it. I need complete darkness to sleep. Any light whatsoever and my ADHD riddled mind gets distracted. My dear sweet husband&#x27;s idea of complete darkness is NOT the same as mine. (What did you think I meant?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He charges his phone on the nightstand, and there is a light shining from the screen. I might as well be a sleeping next to a landing strip at JFK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes his alarm clock to have big lit up numbers so he can see what time it is if he wakes up in the middle of the night. There are lights on the strip of Vegas that wish they could shine that bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has no problem downloading large files to the desktop computer in our room while we sleep. The bright blue light that shines from the pc tower brings to mind scenes from \\&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\&quot; (1977).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different styles of masks. This is one of my favorites. It fits comfortably. The bands are nice and thin. I have tried masks that had thicker straps that felt lumpy and were uncomfortable to sleep on. This mask does a good job of blocking out light so that I can fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can seriously say this mask has saved my marriage.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed it was that it definately does not come with a pair of ear plugs.. And I trully wanted this for the ear plugs more than the mask itself... The mask its comfortable but it opens a little in the sides of the nose and can be a bit of a problem. I cant say Im fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> Husband watches tv in the bedroom and the flashing lights kept me awake.  This blocks out the annoying tv lights.</li>
            <li> Good buy. I paid just under $5 for this sleep eye mask. It blocks out the sun really well. It&#x27;s comfortable to wear all night. Two straps instead of one help it stay securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I found it uncomfortable and distracting. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could get to sleep wearing one of these things.</li>
            <li> I love what can be done with these. It really sets a new mood for &amp;#34;bedtime&amp;#34;. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I can finally sleep witha light on in the house and It makes it so much easier to sleep in Alaska in the summer</li>
            <li> These work pretty darn good at keeping out any extra light when you&#x27;re trying to sleep and they even came with a free pair of ear plugs which my girlfriend uses faithfully the only problem is that the ear plugs started ripping shortly after she started using them.</li>
            <li> Very cheap material... They say silky but is not silk !!! It falls off every time. I don&#x27;t recommend. You can easily buy something better.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it!!!! really love it yesyesyes she really loves it one two three four five six seven eight and</li>
            <li> Use it anytime for sleep or for play, block out the sun, easy &amp; fun to use, I would get more</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter needed.  It is the little things that help make our days and nights more comfortable.  Quality and price were just right.</li>
            <li> this is great for darkness. able to sleep in day. makes my face sweat a bit under mask, but hey small price to pay.</li>
            <li> This little mask does the job, and the price is right. The description \\&quot;silky\\&quot; is fairly accurate - it&#x27;s certainly not lined with silk or satin, but the material is comfortable and blocks out a sufficient amount of light. The two straps give a comfortable fit and aren&#x27;t too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paying a little more would give you something with higher quality, but if you just want to sleep in or adjust to the night shift a few days a week, I think this mask is just fine.</li>
            <li> I work night shift and need something to block out light to help me sleep.  This mask is cheap, comfortable, and does the job.  Two straps are better than one for getting a mask to fit right. // Edited to add:  I have now had my shipment of the masks for several months, and the first one that I started to use is still on the job.  Some brands fall apart quickly.  These are long lasting, and still comfortable.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face, not too tight but not too loose. The padding is great, and sometimes I forget that I have it on. Allows for much easier college dorm sleeping.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  I thought that the double strap would work better but they still gather around my ears and annoy me.  The actual mask feels like it&#x27;s pushing in on my eyes.  They still aren&#x27;t the worst product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The mask works it keeps the light out of your eyes when it is lighted out and allows you to go to sleep. The bad part is, when worn is very uncomfortable I&#x27;m a side sleeper (I sleep on my side) and the straps that led behind your ears scratches the side of your head. I also feel the material made could have been thicker. Looking at the mask right now it is tearing along the outside of the mask. I supposed for $5 its okay, but I believe it could have been made better.</li>
            <li> This mask was a solid buy since it even has an additional portion by the bridge of the nose, which makes it difficult for light to seep through the bottom. Also, the mask does it&#x27;s purpose by not allowing the individual wearing it to see anything in front of him/her.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best mask ever. If you have sensitive skin, be careful as it will break you out around your eye area. This is not the seller&#x27;s fault. It arrived on time and had no issues, just not the sleep mask for me.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...keep the light out.&lt;br /&gt;Good if you get a lot of light in your bedroom&lt;br /&gt;or if you work the night shift and want complete darkness when you are trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> My prior sleep masks kept having the elastic bands stretch out too much after a few months, so I figured to be eficient I would \\&quot;bulk-order\\&quot; like 6 of these to save me time. Bad idea. All of them smelled like chemicals/oil and the smell did not go away. I had to rinse them with water to try to get rid of the odor but no dice. Also one night I used one of them in a hotel with white pillowcases and when i woke up the mask had left black imprints all over the pillowcases. Nasty - all the chemicals/ink/whatever leeching off of it. I certainly don&#x27;t want something on my face loaded with toxins like that so I tossed all of the masks and am using some different, more costly brands now.</li>
            <li> Simple did the job and was good for the price. Use it to go to sleep or have fun in other ways. Great price and shipping .</li>
            <li> I have always taken a nap in the afternoon, and I found I was covering my face to keep the sunlight out of my eyes. I had seen movies where movie stars used the eye masks, so , knowing Amazon has everything I have ever searched for, I looked up eye masks and I found the Dream Essentials Snooz Silky Sost Eye Mask. Was I ever so happy now, taking my naps. The moment I put them on I have such eye ease and comfort. The Silky mask is wonderful. I plan to order some more for gifts for my daughters. You will never regret the wonderful feeling and restfulness you get once you put the mask on.  Iola Moore</li>
            <li> This eye mask is a good item, but over time (a few months) the bands that go around the head losen up and it makes it unusefull!  I personally like the foam ones more than the fabric ones, but this one is OK to use!</li>
            <li> Nice to have but seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These masks are very small, don&#x27;t smell very good, and when I put it on the light came right through. They are probably better suited to a child than an adult. The fabric has a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I found great results for sleep but after about 2 weeks of use, the top strap broke.. I never used it in harsh conditions, but the strap is not very durable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Dream Essentials know what &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; are meant to convey, because I didn&#x27;t find this product to be either. The material feels cheap and there was no discernible padding. The one I received had a secondary flap to cover the nose area that&#x27;s not pictured in product images. I generally find those uncomfortable and would not have purchased if that flap was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I use this eye mask when I meditate, just to keep all light from coming through my eyelids.  It is soft, does what I want it to do and is comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best sleep mask i&#x27;ve tried to date! It&#x27;s a great value at a great price. I recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other sleep masks before, usually relatively cheap ones, but this one is the best so far.  The two-strap system really helps keep the mask on your face throughout the night, which has always been a problem for me.  I often find that by morning time I will have removed the mask accidentally or unconsciously with the single-strap variety.  This mask is also extremely light.  Other ones I wore felt a little \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; which may have contributed to me removing them during sleep.  As far as use, I learned about the idea of sleeping with a mask through Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple and the Primal Blueprint.  I love it and I&#x27;m getting much more solid sleep through the night.  Finally, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;ve seen other products that were much more expensive, but this one is perfect.  If I lose it, leave it in a hotel, or something, I won&#x27;t be upset about replacing it.  Also, at the price, I had no problem deciding to buy a couple of these and just leaving them where I use them (one at home, one in my suitcase/carry-on for travel, etc.).  Great product overall.</li>
            <li> Its cheap and not that great, id spend money on a better more comfortable one, just my two cents on it.</li>
            <li> was a great fit really help block out the light</li>
            <li> This is a great sleep mask for blocking out ALL the light.  Silky feeling, light-weight, great even for the hot summer months.  I sometimes like to watch 15-30 minutes of television before going to sleep.  Hubby can block out the noise but the light drives him nuts.  This sleep mask is great - cuts down on the grumbling. ;)</li>
            <li> Like most people looking for a great night sleep during the day (namely us late shifters), I have become very particular in the sleep masks I like. This mask fails in every category. Light slips in from all sides (not just around the nose which is typical of cheap masks). What really surprised me however, is that in a dark room at night with just a TV on, I could see the light from the TV right through the front of the mask! As others have stated, it&#x27;s incredibly tight on my head, and I woke up in pain from it. The material is light (normally a good thing), but somehow still abrasive to my skin. This is a cheap mask, and it performs as such. As an owner of 6 or 7 different types of masks over the years, this is without question the worst I have had. I was looking for complete darkness and comfort in material, as well as fit. This mask offers none of these.</li>
            <li> The strap is tight. I wore the mask with slightly damp hair and the black dye bled onto my sheets and stained them. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice case, item as described, fast shipment</li>
            <li> I love the mask just wish around the nose fit a bit more snug but, I have to say it did what I needed it to do...lol</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really fit well on my face. The straps aren&#x27;t quite strong enough to keep the mask in place. Perhaps I&#x27;m just to much of a thrasher in bed?</li>
            <li> Terrible eye mask. The ink bleeds out and gets all over your sheets and pillow case. Destroyed my expensive white sheets with the bleeding dye. I can&#x27;t even imagine what it did to my face! Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
