            <li>Nice colors.  </li>
            <li>The blush colors are nice but don&#x27;t have the staying power I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It really highlighted the areas perfectly.  </li>
            <li>it was delivered in good condition, and i find it very useful on days where i want to contour and highlight!</li>

            <li>The three blushes are all beautiful colors and really well pigmented!!</li>
            <li>love it, still learning on how to contour and highlight, but i am very pleased with this product, i do recomend it.</li>

            <li>The two blush colors aren&#x27;t my favorite colors I own</li>
            <li>Not my favorite makeup piece I own</li>

            <li>I have not been able to find many contour products that don&#x27;t have some shimmer to them.</li>
            <li>Search on google/yahoo/whatever for Coastal Scents for their website where you will find more rave reviews.</li>

            <li>This is a great product and I really recommend it to anyone from a beginner to someone that has been doing makeup for years.</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>Ok, so now about the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for ten years now, &amp; I must say, this product is one of the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most highlighters on the market are sparkly or glittery and for a 35 y/o</li>
            <li>I prefer the sophisticated look that the matte highlighter gives me.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I did</li>
            <li>blush is just lovely</li>
            <li>I love this pallet.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The bronzer is what I use the most, a dab with do ya.</li>
            <li>but I do use them because it&#x27;s just more convenient.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this palette.  </li>
            <li>Like really really love.</li>
            <li>maybe someone with darker skin would look better with this :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the texture and the matte finish of these blushes/pressed powders.</li>
            <li>and I have been satisfied with the quality of the product for the price.</li>
            <li>It is more of a powder texture, rather than a creamy texture.</li>

            <li>you can always add more.</li>
            <li>I was able to return a pricey mac highlight/contour kit.</li>
            <li>This makes it even more valuable to me because I was really only planning on using the darkest and lightest shades and one of the blushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value!</li>
            <li>Enjoy, I know I will!</li>
            <li>I love the size of it</li>
            <li>I love Coastal Scents and have faith in their products, hence</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product all around!</li>
            <li>It appears chalky even if you decide to apply it on top of foundation or BEFORE applying foundation.</li>
            <li>i love the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love this product......</li>
            <li>the colors are the same as in the picture and this is a great buy for those women out there trying to find a good product to contour there face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>My face looked thinner &amp; more of an oval shape.  </li>
            <li>but the shipping is more pricey.</li>
            <li>Very amazing and high quality!</li>
            <li>The customer service was great (the first time my product arrived, it was completely shattered but Amazon happily replaced it), and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a contour palette.</li>
            <li>As always Amazon and their great customer service team pulls through and hopefully I will receive my new palette unbroken!  </li>
            <li>It is a lot of powder for the money and goes on very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is great because it&#x27;s colors are versatile (depending on how much you apply) and the staying power is very good (especially for work).</li>
            <li>i just think it&#x27;s a pretty good price considering the size of the palette.</li>
            <li>it works pretty good</li>
            <li>This is a great product, lasts a long time, and for the price that i paid im super happy.</li>
            <li>I was able to achieve this easily , building the layers up until I got where I wanted it.</li>
            <li>This Coastal Scents palette could replace pounds of powders (stuffed in my bathroom, each in its plastic container), and be used much more often because it&#x27;s so easy and versatile.</li>
            <li>so i was just checking it out with no real intention to buy, however, its one of the best accidents i ever made because i LOVE this pallet.</li>
            <li>The colors are awesome..  amateur mua, mua or even if u just love doing ur own make up...</li>
            <li>This is a good sized palette (6\\&quot;x9\\&quot;) with large pressed powders.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product is very nice.</li>
            <li>The palettes are huge and I can&#x27;t imagine I will have to be ordering more anytime soon.</li>
            <li>If you like light makeup coverage, you can use this for most of your needs.</li>
            <li>contour color, two awesome universal blushes, a great highlighting color, and warm and cool toned powders which i&#x27;m not clear as to how I&#x27;m supposed to use them...</li>
            <li>With blending skills, the brown has great pigmentation and will look totally natural.</li>
            <li>It was a nice surprise and worth the money.</li>
            <li>used it last night and got really good results!</li>
            <li>, make sure you are getting an original,</li>
            <li>It is def a great deal price wise since the product is pretty big</li>
            <li>So, unlike other reviewer, my product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend and contour</li>
            <li>and it was fairly easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to practice on contouring my face and this product is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>the blush &amp; contour shade are easy to place-</li>
            <li>The colors are well pigmented, but they don&#x27;t blend as easily as hoped for.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Love, I dont like to wear foundation, so this combination powder set makes my skin look natural and bright</li>
            <li>It is easily repaired though with alcohol (there are some instructional videos floating around youtube).</li>
            <li>The colors go on well and are easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>Easy to mix shades.</li>
            <li>The blushes are really strong</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results of this palette,  I highly recommend this and will be purchasing more coastal products!  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with as long as you have good brushes...lasted all day for the most part!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person to buy eye shadows first then</li>
            <li>Of course because they are so inexpensive they aren&#x27;t as good as the top name brands such as MAC or Sephora, but I have used their eye shadows and contour pallets for years and been satisfied.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if i should order this product since it was so cheap!</li>
            <li>As for the comments about it being too light or too dark, I think the pigmentation is actually perfect.</li>
            <li>Really bold colors, which I like!</li>
            <li>Very pretty at the top of the cheekbones.   </li>
            <li>My very first BH Cosmetics purchase, and I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li>Huge pots of beautiful smooth powder(the yellow is my favorite) with just the right amount of color to do the job.  </li>
            <li>They feel very chalky, I have light to medium skin tone and the colors just don&#x27;t look nice on me</li>
            <li>This is huge.  </li>
            <li>Huge pigments.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how huge each pot is.</li>
            <li>This make-up is cheap quality.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS</li>
            <li>(I did not need the 50 dollars worth of items that would have qualified me for free shipping, as much as I would have liked to have had more stuff)</li>
            <li>Really great qulity, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>, I confirmed that it was.</li>
            <li>so it just takes a light touch.  </li>
            <li>Be light handed</li>
            <li>i really enjoy this palette.</li>
            <li>Great basic for contouring.</li>
            <li>It is really big and has a great mix of colors for contour and blush.  </li>
            <li>Looked cheap.  </li>
            <li>The blushes pigmented so light dusting would be recommended if trying this product.</li>
            <li>the blushes are fabulous</li>
            <li>I have had my eye on this for a while, and was ecstatic that I could get free shipping through amazon prime.</li>
            <li>I am fairly light and was looking for a product that would allow me to do conturing using a powder consistency  instead of foundation.</li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great palette, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a contour palette that had no shimmer, this seemed to be the best choice out of the few ones</li>
            <li>available.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the shipping was great, not only I received it at my US address  </li>
            <li>Great colors to match my yellow undertones!</li>
            <li>I use this lightly, after applying my foundation and powder.  </li>
            <li>it was so cheap</li>
            <li>great palet the only ting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so so happy with this, and will be using it daily.</li>
            <li>so i always use it sparingly and apply with using a light dusting motion rather than buffering it into my skin like i do the blush.</li>
            <li>i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li>Great value for such an in-demand product!</li>
            <li>Apply with a light hand.</li>
            <li>set fit the bill!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>It is about twice the price, but totally worth it since it has better ingredients.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about is the size of them:)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, looks like it does in the photo, thinking about exchanging for another one, was really excited about this.</li>
            <li>Best contours out there if you&#x27;re incredibly pale like I</li>
            <li>The price here is right, and FREE SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll give them one more chance to make it right.</li>
            <li>highly pigmented, applies well, and matte (which I love!).  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful contour palette for the price.</li>
            <li>but it works well if you use it lightly and make sure to shake the brush off first.</li>
            <li>It highlights my skin so beautifully and the peachy blush shade looks phenomenal on my pale skin.</li>
            <li>If you want to brighten up your complexion, this is fast and easy, and you couldn&#x27;t ask for better colors.      </li>
            <li>I bought this product with low expectations because its price but boy what an amazing surprise!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of fun!</li>
            <li>I was quite excited about this product</li>
            <li>Fades significantly almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Previously I was working with bronzers but most of them have a warm undertone and the effect is not as nice as with the Coastal Scents.&lt;br /&gt;Surely a product to try, well priced and quickly delivered.</li>
            <li>This product is great and the price is great compared to other similar products.  </li>
            <li>I had a Lauren Hutton face disk with smaller tins of powders and creams that I liked but did not use many of the shades, and quit using it at all a while ago.</li>
            <li>Brown is pretty dark for contour in my opinion but works great to fill in brows!</li>
            <li>get it and enjoy it as much as i&#x27;m doing :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use all of the shades so far to achieve a more contoured look.</li>
            <li>The cheek colors are probably the only ones I use, sometimes, they are ok and the colors look nice for going out at night.  </li>
            <li>great universal colors, blendable, highly pigmented- more for makeup artists who know what they are doing...</li>
            <li>But the Blushes are very pigmented and the light and dark contours make the perfect shade.</li>
            <li>Very chalky and powdery, was not happy or impressed with it, I think this pallet is best used for teens starting out with make-up or want to play around with make-up styles and practice techniques.</li>
            <li>but also not a bad product at all specially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Because that dark tone wouldn&#x27;t be to much use.&lt;br /&gt;I am brown/dark-skinned so it fits me perfectly..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this compact/palette</li>
            <li>Lets just say I have to swipe my brush a good 3-4 time to get enough product to apply and show where I want it.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t get much better for under $20.</li>
            <li>Overall though, for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>Plus more thanks</li>
            <li>I loved the product the second I tried it.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>the bluses are really good and last all day.</li>
            <li>, how deep I don&#x27;t know.....delievered on time and the product looks good.</li>
            <li>ready to order more Coastal Scents products.....</li>
            <li>i most say that i really like the colors.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Then I used a hint of the medium blush color (bottom right) just on the ball of my cheek and used another face brush to blend and smooth all the areas</li>
            <li>every single colour is nice, and can be used for many things</li>
            <li>Shipping was really quick.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, its actually bigger in person that the pictures love the colors.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I noticed the blushes wear off on my skin quite quickly, as well as the contour.</li>
            <li>I gave it a week and tried it again, just to make sure this palette was the cause, and sure enough</li>
            <li>Super pigmented and matte--perfect for me.</li>
            <li>seller was quick, but I did not like the makeup.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and item was received as pictured.</li>
            <li>But this palette is extraordinarily versatile because you can mix the shades.  </li>
            <li>The pans are huge, and the colors highly pigmented but easy to wear and layer.</li>
            <li>For instance,the blush in the upper right hand corner is way to bright for me.  </li>
            <li>The blush tones are great: one is pinkish and one is reddish, but both are bold, dark colors.</li>
            <li>This is huge- didn&#x27;t expect it to be so much!</li>
            <li>The white color is so perfect for highlighting under the eyes to make them appear much brighter, and make you look young and rested.</li>
            <li>Even the dark contour color works great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and cannot recommend it enough.      </li>
            <li>Shipped very fast and was not damaged!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big lasts a long time and good product and good shipping.</li>
            <li>Pallette is nice for special occasions when you want to look extra polished.</li>
            <li>I previously ordered their 32 piece brush set from Costal Scents and had a great expirence with the company so when all my make up was stolen</li>
            <li>and I love it so far!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li>The colors were vivid and the product blended ok on cream foundation.</li>
            <li>I cant live without this palette, I use it everyday its amazing....!!!</li>
            <li>I love how natural this looks and the white makes a gorgeous high light.</li>
            <li>The powder isn&#x27;t anything special but works to tone down color that is too bright.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented  Must use with a light hand.  </li>
            <li>The pigments are so intense and bright, definitely a must have!</li>
            <li>and I could see all the bright pink color of one of the blush from inside the palette all over the box.</li>
            <li>color payoff, great texture (not a cheap, chalky texture...</li>
            <li>and it is fun to experiment with the colors to see the affect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Useful to do the highlight or just for blush too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth buying even with that.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be ordering directly from the costal scents website instead; hopefully, they&#x27;ll treat it better.</li>
            <li>If you havent signed up for prime you should because it&#x27;s def worth it</li>
            <li>but it was worth the price I paid and serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>This is why this palette is so useful, any color skin could use it just by mixing colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will still use this LIGHTLY around my face, mostly the white as a highlighter</li>
            <li>This palette is nice and big</li>
            <li>I really only use the two pinkish blushes so it seems kind of wasteful.</li>
            <li>its worth ever penny</li>
            <li>I felt the need to reapply throughout the day, however, it did not blend as well without a fresh coat of primer or foundation.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer is fantastic, looks good on me and I am extremely pale (NC15 Mac).</li>
            <li>Great product to give dimension to my pale skin.</li>
            <li>After not receiving it the first time.. they quickly resolved my issue and sent me another one</li>
            <li>only is it a huge palette, but the colours are universally flattering (less for fair skin, more for darker).&lt;br /&gt;The brown contours and blends very nicely, and the light peach and white colours are my highlighters.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Every skin tone will be able to blend the perfect match, then use the light colors for highlighting, the bright pink (highly pigmented) for the apple of the cheek, the darker pink (less pigmented) for more of a blush/bronze effect, and the brown for mixing shades and for contouring like hiding upper eyelid bags or slimming the nose.</li>
            <li>Colors are true to the photo; white, light beige/tan, bright (slightly warm) pink, light peach, brown, and medium/dark cool pink.</li>
            <li>Other than that the colors are gorgeous .</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Matched with the right brushes you can have a face that&#x27;s on point.</li>
            <li>I guess I ordered at the right time.</li>
            <li>(my preference is the bottom right).  </li>
            <li>Arrived right on time....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect as such BIG box as what I got.&lt;br /&gt;this works beautifully in your face</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not only help full for contouring but for eye shadows as well :)</li>
            <li>For the people that commented that they loved it and couldn&#x27;t see how they went without it, I assume they are use to cheap products because for light skinned people this stuff sucks!  </li>
            <li>If you know how to high light &amp; contour for the shape of your face</li>
            <li>but they are all very pigmented with great color pay off, the skin tone above the contour shade is nearly identical to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Bright enough to look like a natural flush.</li>
            <li>and a super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The actual shades were bright and loud.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented-so much that I think it would even be great for extremely dark skin.</li>
            <li>I could only give this product 4 stars because of the fact that i have used it for a prolonged amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion point of this review: If you want a lot of great quality product for a small price, this is for you :)</li>
            <li>and i relieved it very fast</li>
            <li>The same feeling with the very light color as well.  </li>
            <li>I am acne prone (cystic, no less), but I have it under control and it isn&#x27;t too easily irritated.  </li>
            <li>The product does get a little powdery when you start to pick it up on your brush, but nothing a shake-off and a good blend wouldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I do wish that it has two white powders as it seems thats the one I go through the most to build highlights.</li>
            <li>I saw the Coastal Scents palates first on You Tube watching makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li>This along with another Coastal Scents Palette were the first from that brand for me</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always HOT and HUMID.</li>
            <li>The white highlight color actually gives a nice light shimmer to cheek bones</li>
            <li>and I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I read reviews first, but don&#x27;t see the problems I read about.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Recommend this Palette to people trying contouring for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than three months now, and it looks exactly the same as when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I bought this when I first started playing around with makeup years ago and didn&#x27;t even know it was still in existence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise people who are interested in this product to review the ingredients before buying.</li>
            <li>The Blush is very big and lovely colors</li>
            <li>first time contouring and</li>
            <li>the colors are exact.</li>
            <li>I MAYBE wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it if I read the ingredients first.</li>
            <li>I found that this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I like the blushes and light contour but their somewhat chalky,  the dark contour seems even more chalky and doesn&#x27;t brush on well..</li>
            <li>it also isn&#x27;t consistent..</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine getting a better blush/contour palette than this one for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this basic makeup!</li>
            <li>it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Basically the lightest color is white and the contrast between the 2 med shades is greater than it appears in the photo.  </li>
            <li>daughet took the first box</li>
            <li>It does have a fishy smell when you first put it on, but it does fade throughout the day</li>
            <li>on time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;i really like it !</li>
            <li>i loved this the few times i used this...beautiful blush contour and highlight.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is frail, you need a gentle hand because the pans are so big that any impact cracks them easily!  </li>
            <li>I applied it using the flat top bronzer brush found on the Coastal Scents website.</li>
            <li>When I open the package, mind you how excited I have been since I ordererd this!.</li>
            <li>Colors are great and it was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>its decent pigmentation, they seem kinda like dry or chalky, its nothing amazing, but i like the matte highlighters</li>
            <li>Not a big deal since what is left (which is a good amount)</li>
            <li>- Large and not very travel friendly, blush colors are too strong, no mirror</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I figured i&#x27;d take a chance &amp; purchase the item.</li>
            <li>This is really the first highlight/contour set I have owned</li>
            <li>The colors are really pigmented and blend pretty well.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>noticed that there was powder everywhere, opened it all the way and one of the colors was pretty much powder.</li>
            <li>More things I love about this palette is that you can build on it for a damatic night look or go subtle for daytime because they are pigmented.</li>
            <li>the way i came to own this product is a little funny, my finger slipped.</li>
            <li>when applying this product, start with a little and add more if needed!</li>
            <li>Really nice and easy to apply, with a dry brush or a wet sponge.</li>
            <li>The pans are very large (about the size of a normal pressed powder compact).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that this palette was going to be so large.  </li>
            <li>I certainly do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also rather large: too large to carry around.</li>
            <li>I use the top left and top middle color to highlight, obvisouly the bottom middle to contour, and both colors on the right are blush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect brown with grey undertones (rather than pink or blue) that works well for contouring.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the darkest shade for contour, but the blushes are really pretty as well.</li>
            <li>They do not cost as much as name brand stuff from large retailers.</li>
            <li>Little did I know how handy it would come in when my daughters dance recital rolled around.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great, although a little different than they appear on the computer screen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented therefore you don&#x27;t really need to use much of the product.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very pigmented</li>
            <li>also, my pimples formed in straight lines on both my cheeks where i used</li>
            <li>very pigmented and blendable</li>
            <li>&amp; for the price it wouldn&#x27;t have been much of a loss.</li>
            <li>The item was packaged very well but somehow the blush still got messed up.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>all very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Its really the luck of the draw.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone</li>
            <li>I can now do my whole face with one palette.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use.</li>
            <li>There all very matte colors, no shimmer, sheen, sparkle..</li>
            <li>The two tan colors I don&#x27;t really use.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this palette, but alas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it as much as my overpriced MAC blushes.</li>
            <li>It applies well, but throughout the whole day, you&#x27;d have to reapply it on.</li>
            <li>It has a very chalky consistency that you can&#x27;t even apply to your skin.</li>
            <li>I would not get too much on the brush</li>
            <li>Got more than what i expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Really really really like this set.</li>
            <li>It brushed on cheap as well.</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>This is a real bargin.</li>
            <li>Colors indicated are really  what you see.</li>
            <li>i was really looking forward to using this and adding it to my kit</li>
            <li>All of these are very pigmented, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>This is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Colors blend very well and</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really big!There is so much product in them.</li>
            <li>Works very well for contouring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased my anastasia contour pallet and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li>This is why I am giving this a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am changing my rating because customer service offered a free replacement on second contact.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>shipping was on time and fast and the product is..AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors and the variety.</li>
            <li>, I would buy again, responsible vendor.</li>
            <li>and you get so much product for the price.</li>
            <li>and you dont have to use that much product to get the results you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li>want to know who is responsible for this, because I never seem this before.</li>
            <li>It can be very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;^.^</li>
            <li>It also blends really well</li>
            <li>I used this palette along with a primer and finishing spray, the foundation lasts all day, and even at night if I don&#x27;t wash my face really</li>
            <li>shipped fast &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving two stars because I&#x27;m not getting much color payoff from these.</li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t even look like in real life...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even real...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t contour that much.  </li>
            <li>It was very well packaged</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t show up on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It is ok but not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>I mix it with the shade above it to warm up my face overall, but use it straight to contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  </li>
            <li>Very speedy with delivery.</li>
            <li>Even though the brown looks scarily dark, if you use small amounts as I suggested, it will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>the White is really white which is a nice highlighter.  </li>
            <li>No where on the product or packaging is it labeled &amp;#34;coastal scents.&amp;#34; I have personally shopped with coastal scents several times and the products are ALWAYS labeled as being one of their own.</li>
            <li>They are very light on the skin, and you only need a small amount of the product on your brush :)</li>
            <li>The pink blushes are flattering and it&#x27;s great that the highlight shades are matte like the other colors.  </li>
            <li>I chose this specifically because of the shades I saw after looking at many other options, but I did not get what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The blush on the other hand is ok.</li>
            <li>It works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>So, twenty years later, having never found the right palette or successfully getting much makeup out of its case, I finally found this by accident when it showed up with some other search on Amazon.     </li>
            <li>They give you an amazing amount to last you a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY inexpensive and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>I love in Florida, and the expected date for me to receive it wasn&#x27;t until February 6th, but it came in a whole month early!</li>
            <li>Very fast, professional service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.. not very excited</li>
            <li>The 2 blushes on the right are a little two strong for me</li>
            <li>I usually use the beige and dark chocolate together on temples, top of forhead, and nose to get a nice countour.  </li>
            <li>Love the dark brown for contour.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you know how to contour before buying this product because otherwise, it&#x27;s not really worth it.</li>
            <li>I will say that coastal scents runs this on sale for $11 pretty frequently</li>
            <li>I will be buying new from now on!</li>
            <li>My new palette arrived to my overseas address in 5 days!</li>
            <li>It is highly pigmented so a little application would be good enough.</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing, is way bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>A tad bit chalky, however less is more when using this</li>
            <li>Its a decent pallette.</li>
            <li>but the colors are so Vibrant and Rich!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>The white in the top left corner I use for highlighting..</li>
            <li>I can definitely create many looks with these different color palettes by mixing it with one another.</li>
            <li>i mainly use the brown for contouring.</li>
            <li>I am able to use the lighter colors for some highlighting but because I am a darker toned African American, the brown and the pinks</li>
            <li>The colors are a little different in person than they looked online, but it&#x27;s SO BIG and beautiful</li>
            <li>Less is definitely more, as each shade is highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Great solid not sparkly contouring colors, I like the dark brown for shadowing and the white for highlighting.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend that</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>:- ❧ HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I would have ordered this from the Coastal Scents site, but their shipping was a bit high</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend dealing with this company and using this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality waste of money</li>
            <li>THE CORRECT ITEM (Which I highly doubt they have coming from china)  </li>
            <li>The colors look scary intense when you first open it, but they all blend beautifully together</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented .</li>
            <li>then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As a previous reviewer stated, I too have very sensitive skin, and I have experienced NO problems with breakouts due to this product.  </li>
            <li>a nice, velvety texture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, all of these six colors are extremely matte.</li>
            <li>the other colors are more confusing -but good for extra high lighting-one must experiment.</li>
            <li>I love the contour shade although it is very dark.</li>
            <li>I guess it really just depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>The contents and chemistry of the product are gentle on sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like the palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not superfine milled, and silky like a department store brand, but it&#x27;s definately OK and suits</li>
            <li>love the variety of contouring colors.....will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The highlight color is pretty much useless for me and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>but honestly i didn&#x27;t mean to push the button that said \\&quot;buy now\\</li>
            <li>my cheeks and left and right jaws to contour.</li>
            <li>Overall, If you&#x27;re looking for a matte palate for blush and contour/highlighting, buy this right now.</li>
            <li>(but we know that makeup is never enough right?).</li>
            <li>You must use very little amounts at a time to really achieve that natural, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty decent palette.</li>
            <li>I use a long-wear foundation, and a primer on my lids bacause I live in the South</li>
            <li>This pallet earned a new home in my garbage can.</li>
            <li>and i cant live without it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Watch a tutorial on YouTube if you&#x27;re new to the product.</li>
            <li>No shimmer at all, which to me is a good thing and hard to find especially in a highlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brown is too harsh and the pink is to bright.</li>
            <li>colors are nice and i use it everyday for my contouring, especially the brown</li>
            <li>I have aged skin as well so maybe on younger, smoother skin this might be ok.</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin and none of the products bother me.</li>
            <li>It is has very natural matte colors.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with is that, I have oily skin so whether I used this palette just on top of my natural skin or on top of foundation, my T zone looked extremely greasy after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any amateur like me :)</li>
            <li>It is pretty big too.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>the only thing with this the darkest shade came mash up but other than that i love it</li>
            <li>Hi, I not usually write reviews but with this product I have to.</li>
            <li>And, given the sheer size of this product (about 5&amp;#34; x 7&amp;#34;), it is not practical for traveling or keeping it with you for reapplication.  </li>
            <li>If you have pale skin, you must apply the brown contour very lightly because it quickly builds for a dark look.</li>
            <li>blush colours are fresh and blend nicely.&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes applying these products, my pale face has a nice, natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was certain it was this product because it was the only thing new that I was using, and upon discontinuing use, the breakouts have stopped.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling this will last a really long time, each pot is HUGE.</li>
            <li>I love this product , especially the blush and the dark brown contouring powder.makes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the colors to be as great as they were but for me, they did go on very pigmented but unfortunately didn&#x27;t stay on too long.  </li>
            <li>Most of it stayed on my brush, and what actually got on my face was just a blotchy mess.  </li>
            <li>Very large and seems to blend very well, will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This product indeed caused me to break out so severely in large, red, puss-filled pimples all among the sides of my face where I contoured and my cheeks where I applied blush.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s rather large actually,</li>
            <li>*little* cheap.</li>
            <li>Too much of the dark contour shade can be a BIG mistake that&#x27;s tricky to fix without having to start over with a clean face</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size of the color palettes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, the dark color to contour is waaaaaay to dark for me and looks like mud, the color aren&#x27;t very pigmented to me.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels like play makeup my 5 year old daughter gets at Taget.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and not cakey/flakey at all.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to a budding young make-up artist.  </li>
            <li>the white doesn&#x27;t really show up for highlighting.</li>
            <li>to girls who like natural shades they are perfect..you can use it as a blush and to conture your face which is valuable</li>
            <li>The colors are all very pigmented and last FOREVER!</li>
            <li>They last all day and blend very well.</li>
            <li>I am just starting out in the make up thing, so when I was trying these colors, none of them really worked for me.</li>
            <li>The colors blend very well and it is much bigger than I</li>
            <li>I will definitely re-order this product when I am ready for another.  </li>
            <li>Only the brown and white colors are actually useful.</li>
            <li>usually first apply under eye corrector and light base foundation (I have European fair skin and blond hair) and then do the contouring with Coastal Scents white and brown shades, blending it all and finishing with a natural looking face powder and Coastal Scents</li>
            <li>I know other reviewers have mentioned this, but this palette is HUGE, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the other colors in the palette, they don&#x27;t really show up on my tan skin.</li>
            <li>It is just upsetting that I spent my money for nothing because I&#x27;ll never be able to use this again due to</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go at my skin super heavy with this since I am new to contouring.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived, but as soon as I tried it I realized this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I have never ordered something like this online before, but decided among reading other reviews that it seemed worth it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the blendable colors although I&#x27;m not really sure what you could use the white for, maybe under the eyes?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the light powders (the pure white, the peachy-pink, and the yellow)</li>
            <li>dark brown is really hard to blend so be careful not to apply too much by accident while contouring.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good deal for the price...</li>
            <li>Overall, this is one of my new \\&quot;must haves\\&quot; for my make-up bag.</li>
            <li>...it&#x27;s not something I would recommend for people with dry skin or for people who don&#x27;t know much about makeup.</li>
            <li>I use the white to help highlight my cheek bones and mix the low and high blush colors...works miracles!</li>
            <li>Because it was pressed makeup, I assumed it may crack (which can be fixed) but it had broken into so many pieces that I had already lost it all over the box/floor.</li>
            <li>The palette is very large, this will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li>I ordered my first set and needless to say 4 sets later I am still IN LOVE with their products.</li>
            <li>The blushes need a little more brush movement to get it onto the brush than the other colors.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of purchasing an off brand, but I love it!</li>
            <li>So, I dab my brush in the that blush, and then mix it with the light pinky shade in the lower left hand corner, and it instantly dilutes that pink down to a very wearable shade for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great but the quality of the product is bad every time I try to use them they fall apart.</li>
            <li>Even if you go to the official website and view the contour and blush palette you can see that this product is clearly a knock off because it is not the same package or container that anyone writing a review has OR that the website itself has posted images of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went back and forth between this palette and the Coastal Scents 10 color professional palette, but in the end chose this one for the contouring shades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve inly used the white and brown color so far to contour abd</li>
            <li>And this takes the place of ALL of them (unless you want a shimmery effect, because these are all completely and utterly matte).  </li>
            <li>I had broken one of the compressed powders (the one I use most, of course).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Convenience:  I literally have half a dozen bronzer compacts, two or three highlight compacts plus a few liquid/cream highlights, and even more blush compacts.  </li>
            <li>I mix a few colors on my brush to create just the right mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i thought this palette was going to be exactly the same as the other.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, I was a bit confused but now a few weeks in, I have been able to understand&lt;br /&gt;how</li>
            <li>The dark brown is really dark so start out lightly if you have fair/olive skin</li>
            <li>Blush is ok however I don&#x27;t care for the bronzer because it gives a choppy not smooth application for contouring.</li>
            <li>That ended up being exactly what I needed because i used to half to buff out the brown so much to make it look natural and sometimes I would look like I was had ran a mile  because the pink was too pink.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t look so artificial and more soft natural makeup look.  </li>
            <li>This is because shadows are greyish, not pink or blue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like putting chalk on your face and the light peach color makes your face look ridiculously cakey and the contour color is the only thing I can can use in this pallet</li>
            <li>but when i have too much application of either blush or contour the flesh tone helps to blend it out and tone it down.</li>
            <li>and I find the cold dark brown shade very nice for contouring.</li>
            <li>They are pigmented very well without being so super saturated your afraid to dip your brush in, and they are silky soft and a dream to blend.  </li>
            <li>I tried the dark brown and thought nothing of it hitting my main problem area (which hasn&#x27;t bothered me in a while).  </li>
            <li>and so you really need to use a little.</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and show up beautifully on my dark, Indian skin.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, large palette for a very small price!</li>
            <li>You have a very complete blush/contour/highlighter matte palette that I could dare to say you won&#x27;t need any other blush/bronzer/highlighter</li>
            <li>Colors are very pigmented, so the highlight is extremely white on skin and contour color is very dark.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a good, big size for the price, but the quality is just bad.</li>

            <li> I did some research on mineral oil and lanolin and it&#x27;s controversial as to whether or not it causes acne.</li>
            <li> The two blush colors aren&#x27;t my favorite colors I own</li>
            <li> Not my favorite makeup piece I own</li>

            <li> I have not been able to find many contour products that don&#x27;t have some shimmer to them.</li>
            <li> Search on google/yahoo/whatever for Coastal Scents for their website where you will find more rave reviews.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure how to use the shades, there are plenty of youtube makeup gurus who will show you how :)</li>
            <li> I love this palette</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I really recommend it to anyone from a beginner to someone that has been doing makeup for years.</li>
            <li> I e-mail Amazon and my replacement arrived the very next day, perfectly intact</li>
            <li> They are better than stuff you can buy at say Walmart..</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve found that most highlighters on the market are sparkly or glittery and for a 35 y/o</li>
            <li> I prefer the sophisticated look that the matte highlighter gives me.  </li>
            <li> Im glad I did</li>

            <li> I love this pallet.  </li>

            <li> The bronzer is what I use the most, a dab with do ya.</li>
            <li> but I do use them because it&#x27;s just more convenient.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette.  </li>
            <li> Like really really love.</li>
            <li> maybe someone with darker skin would look better with this :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the texture and the matte finish of these blushes/pressed powders.</li>
            <li> and I have been satisfied with the quality of the product for the price.</li>
            <li> It is more of a powder texture, rather than a creamy texture.</li>
            <li> and im satisfied.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find any better make-up at comparable or cheaper pricing.</li>
            <li> I love all the products I&#x27;ve purchased from coastal scents brand</li>
            <li> I was amazed with how well the color came out :)</li>

            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; powder, but it may suit some people who have fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the blushes in this palette.</li>
            <li> but i wasn&#x27;t as in love with this palette as i thought i would be.</li>

            <li> you can always add more.</li>
            <li> I was able to return a pricey mac highlight/contour kit.</li>
            <li> This makes it even more valuable to me because I was really only planning on using the darkest and lightest shades and one of the blushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value!</li>
            <li> Enjoy, I know I will!</li>
            <li> I love the size of it</li>
            <li> I love Coastal Scents and have faith in their products, hence</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product all around!</li>
            <li> It appears chalky even if you decide to apply it on top of foundation or BEFORE applying foundation.</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love this product......</li>
            <li> the colors are the same as in the picture and this is a great buy for those women out there trying to find a good product to contour there face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> My face looked thinner &amp; more of an oval shape.  </li>
            <li> but the shipping is more pricey.</li>
            <li> Very amazing and high quality!</li>
            <li> The customer service was great (the first time my product arrived, it was completely shattered but Amazon happily replaced it), and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a contour palette.</li>
            <li> As always Amazon and their great customer service team pulls through and hopefully I will receive my new palette unbroken!  </li>
            <li> It is a lot of powder for the money and goes on very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is great because it&#x27;s colors are versatile (depending on how much you apply) and the staying power is very good (especially for work).</li>
            <li> i just think it&#x27;s a pretty good price considering the size of the palette.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good</li>
            <li> This is a great product, lasts a long time, and for the price that i paid im super happy.</li>
            <li> I was able to achieve this easily , building the layers up until I got where I wanted it.</li>
            <li> This Coastal Scents palette could replace pounds of powders (stuffed in my bathroom, each in its plastic container), and be used much more often because it&#x27;s so easy and versatile.</li>
            <li> so i was just checking it out with no real intention to buy, however, its one of the best accidents i ever made because i LOVE this pallet.</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome..  amateur mua, mua or even if u just love doing ur own make up...</li>
            <li> This is a good sized palette (6\\&quot;x9\\&quot;) with large pressed powders.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product is very nice.</li>
            <li> The palettes are huge and I can&#x27;t imagine I will have to be ordering more anytime soon.</li>
            <li> If you like light makeup coverage, you can use this for most of your needs.</li>
            <li> contour color, two awesome universal blushes, a great highlighting color, and warm and cool toned powders which i&#x27;m not clear as to how I&#x27;m supposed to use them...</li>
            <li> With blending skills, the brown has great pigmentation and will look totally natural.</li>
            <li> It was a nice surprise and worth the money.</li>
            <li> used it last night and got really good results!</li>
            <li> , make sure you are getting an original,</li>
            <li> It is def a great deal price wise since the product is pretty big</li>
            <li> So, unlike other reviewer, my product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Easy to blend and contour</li>
            <li> and it was fairly easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to practice on contouring my face and this product is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> the blush &amp; contour shade are easy to place-</li>
            <li> The colors are well pigmented, but they don&#x27;t blend as easily as hoped for.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Love, I dont like to wear foundation, so this combination powder set makes my skin look natural and bright</li>
            <li> It is easily repaired though with alcohol (there are some instructional videos floating around youtube).</li>
            <li> The colors go on well and are easy to blend.  </li>
            <li> Easy to mix shades.</li>
            <li> The blushes are really strong</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results of this palette,  I highly recommend this and will be purchasing more coastal products!  </li>
            <li> Easy to work with as long as you have good brushes...lasted all day for the most part!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person to buy eye shadows first then</li>
            <li> Of course because they are so inexpensive they aren&#x27;t as good as the top name brands such as MAC or Sephora, but I have used their eye shadows and contour pallets for years and been satisfied.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if i should order this product since it was so cheap!</li>
            <li> As for the comments about it being too light or too dark, I think the pigmentation is actually perfect.</li>
            <li> Really bold colors, which I like!</li>
            <li> Very pretty at the top of the cheekbones.   </li>
            <li> My very first BH Cosmetics purchase, and I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li> Huge pots of beautiful smooth powder(the yellow is my favorite) with just the right amount of color to do the job.  </li>
            <li> They feel very chalky, I have light to medium skin tone and the colors just don&#x27;t look nice on me</li>
            <li> This is huge.  </li>
            <li> Huge pigments.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how huge each pot is.</li>
            <li> This make-up is cheap quality.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS</li>
            <li> (I did not need the 50 dollars worth of items that would have qualified me for free shipping, as much as I would have liked to have had more stuff)</li>
            <li> Really great qulity, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> , I confirmed that it was.</li>
            <li> so it just takes a light touch.  </li>
            <li> Be light handed</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this palette.</li>
            <li> Great basic for contouring.</li>
            <li> It is really big and has a great mix of colors for contour and blush.  </li>
            <li> Looked cheap.  </li>
            <li> The blushes pigmented so light dusting would be recommended if trying this product.</li>
            <li> the blushes are fabulous</li>
            <li> I have had my eye on this for a while, and was ecstatic that I could get free shipping through amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I am fairly light and was looking for a product that would allow me to do conturing using a powder consistency  instead of foundation.</li>
            <li> The consistency is smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great palette, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a contour palette that had no shimmer, this seemed to be the best choice out of the few ones</li>
            <li> available.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the shipping was great, not only I received it at my US address  </li>
            <li> Great colors to match my yellow undertones!</li>
            <li> I use this lightly, after applying my foundation and powder.  </li>
            <li> it was so cheap</li>
            <li> great palet the only ting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so happy with this, and will be using it daily.</li>
            <li> so i always use it sparingly and apply with using a light dusting motion rather than buffering it into my skin like i do the blush.</li>
            <li> i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li> Great value for such an in-demand product!</li>
            <li> Apply with a light hand.</li>
            <li> set fit the bill!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It is about twice the price, but totally worth it since it has better ingredients.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about is the size of them:)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, looks like it does in the photo, thinking about exchanging for another one, was really excited about this.</li>
            <li> Best contours out there if you&#x27;re incredibly pale like I</li>
            <li> The price here is right, and FREE SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll give them one more chance to make it right.</li>
            <li> highly pigmented, applies well, and matte (which I love!).  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful contour palette for the price.</li>
            <li> but it works well if you use it lightly and make sure to shake the brush off first.</li>
            <li> It highlights my skin so beautifully and the peachy blush shade looks phenomenal on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> If you want to brighten up your complexion, this is fast and easy, and you couldn&#x27;t ask for better colors.      </li>
            <li> I bought this product with low expectations because its price but boy what an amazing surprise!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of fun!</li>
            <li> I was quite excited about this product</li>
            <li> Fades significantly almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Previously I was working with bronzers but most of them have a warm undertone and the effect is not as nice as with the Coastal Scents.&lt;br /&gt;Surely a product to try, well priced and quickly delivered.</li>
            <li> This product is great and the price is great compared to other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I had a Lauren Hutton face disk with smaller tins of powders and creams that I liked but did not use many of the shades, and quit using it at all a while ago.</li>
            <li> Brown is pretty dark for contour in my opinion but works great to fill in brows!</li>
            <li> get it and enjoy it as much as i&#x27;m doing :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use all of the shades so far to achieve a more contoured look.</li>
            <li> The cheek colors are probably the only ones I use, sometimes, they are ok and the colors look nice for going out at night.  </li>
            <li> great universal colors, blendable, highly pigmented- more for makeup artists who know what they are doing...</li>
            <li> But the Blushes are very pigmented and the light and dark contours make the perfect shade.</li>
            <li> Very chalky and powdery, was not happy or impressed with it, I think this pallet is best used for teens starting out with make-up or want to play around with make-up styles and practice techniques.</li>
            <li> but also not a bad product at all specially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Because that dark tone wouldn&#x27;t be to much use.&lt;br /&gt;I am brown/dark-skinned so it fits me perfectly..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this compact/palette</li>
            <li> Lets just say I have to swipe my brush a good 3-4 time to get enough product to apply and show where I want it.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t get much better for under $20.</li>
            <li> Overall though, for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Plus more thanks</li>
            <li> I loved the product the second I tried it.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> the bluses are really good and last all day.</li>
            <li> , how deep I don&#x27;t know.....delievered on time and the product looks good.</li>
            <li> ready to order more Coastal Scents products.....</li>
            <li> i most say that i really like the colors.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Then I used a hint of the medium blush color (bottom right) just on the ball of my cheek and used another face brush to blend and smooth all the areas</li>
            <li> every single colour is nice, and can be used for many things</li>
            <li> Shipping was really quick.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, its actually bigger in person that the pictures love the colors.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I noticed the blushes wear off on my skin quite quickly, as well as the contour.</li>
            <li> I gave it a week and tried it again, just to make sure this palette was the cause, and sure enough</li>
            <li> Super pigmented and matte--perfect for me.</li>
            <li> seller was quick, but I did not like the makeup.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and item was received as pictured.</li>
            <li> But this palette is extraordinarily versatile because you can mix the shades.  </li>
            <li> The pans are huge, and the colors highly pigmented but easy to wear and layer.</li>
            <li> For instance,the blush in the upper right hand corner is way to bright for me.  </li>
            <li> The blush tones are great: one is pinkish and one is reddish, but both are bold, dark colors.</li>
            <li> This is huge- didn&#x27;t expect it to be so much!</li>
            <li> The white color is so perfect for highlighting under the eyes to make them appear much brighter, and make you look young and rested.</li>
            <li> Even the dark contour color works great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and cannot recommend it enough.      </li>
            <li> Shipped very fast and was not damaged!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty big lasts a long time and good product and good shipping.</li>
            <li> Pallette is nice for special occasions when you want to look extra polished.</li>
            <li> I previously ordered their 32 piece brush set from Costal Scents and had a great expirence with the company so when all my make up was stolen</li>
            <li> and I love it so far!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> The colors were vivid and the product blended ok on cream foundation.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this palette, I use it everyday its amazing....!!!</li>
            <li> I love how natural this looks and the white makes a gorgeous high light.</li>
            <li> The powder isn&#x27;t anything special but works to tone down color that is too bright.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented  Must use with a light hand.  </li>
            <li> The pigments are so intense and bright, definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> and I could see all the bright pink color of one of the blush from inside the palette all over the box.</li>
            <li> color payoff, great texture (not a cheap, chalky texture...</li>
            <li> and it is fun to experiment with the colors to see the affect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Useful to do the highlight or just for blush too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still worth buying even with that.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be ordering directly from the costal scents website instead; hopefully, they&#x27;ll treat it better.</li>
            <li> If you havent signed up for prime you should because it&#x27;s def worth it</li>
            <li> but it was worth the price I paid and serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This is why this palette is so useful, any color skin could use it just by mixing colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will still use this LIGHTLY around my face, mostly the white as a highlighter</li>
            <li> This palette is nice and big</li>
            <li> I really only use the two pinkish blushes so it seems kind of wasteful.</li>
            <li> its worth ever penny</li>
            <li> I felt the need to reapply throughout the day, however, it did not blend as well without a fresh coat of primer or foundation.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer is fantastic, looks good on me and I am extremely pale (NC15 Mac).</li>
            <li> Great product to give dimension to my pale skin.</li>
            <li> After not receiving it the first time.. they quickly resolved my issue and sent me another one</li>
            <li> only is it a huge palette, but the colours are universally flattering (less for fair skin, more for darker).&lt;br /&gt;The brown contours and blends very nicely, and the light peach and white colours are my highlighters.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Every skin tone will be able to blend the perfect match, then use the light colors for highlighting, the bright pink (highly pigmented) for the apple of the cheek, the darker pink (less pigmented) for more of a blush/bronze effect, and the brown for mixing shades and for contouring like hiding upper eyelid bags or slimming the nose.</li>
            <li> Colors are true to the photo; white, light beige/tan, bright (slightly warm) pink, light peach, brown, and medium/dark cool pink.</li>
            <li> Other than that the colors are gorgeous .</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Matched with the right brushes you can have a face that&#x27;s on point.</li>
            <li> I guess I ordered at the right time.</li>
            <li> (my preference is the bottom right).  </li>
            <li> Arrived right on time....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect as such BIG box as what I got.&lt;br /&gt;this works beautifully in your face</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not only help full for contouring but for eye shadows as well :)</li>
            <li> For the people that commented that they loved it and couldn&#x27;t see how they went without it, I assume they are use to cheap products because for light skinned people this stuff sucks!  </li>
            <li> If you know how to high light &amp; contour for the shape of your face</li>
            <li> but they are all very pigmented with great color pay off, the skin tone above the contour shade is nearly identical to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Bright enough to look like a natural flush.</li>
            <li> and a super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The actual shades were bright and loud.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented-so much that I think it would even be great for extremely dark skin.</li>
            <li> I could only give this product 4 stars because of the fact that i have used it for a prolonged amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion point of this review: If you want a lot of great quality product for a small price, this is for you :)</li>
            <li> and i relieved it very fast</li>
            <li> The same feeling with the very light color as well.  </li>
            <li> I am acne prone (cystic, no less), but I have it under control and it isn&#x27;t too easily irritated.  </li>
            <li> The product does get a little powdery when you start to pick it up on your brush, but nothing a shake-off and a good blend wouldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I do wish that it has two white powders as it seems thats the one I go through the most to build highlights.</li>
            <li> I saw the Coastal Scents palates first on You Tube watching makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li> This along with another Coastal Scents Palette were the first from that brand for me</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always HOT and HUMID.</li>
            <li> The white highlight color actually gives a nice light shimmer to cheek bones</li>
            <li> and I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I read reviews first, but don&#x27;t see the problems I read about.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Recommend this Palette to people trying contouring for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than three months now, and it looks exactly the same as when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I first started playing around with makeup years ago and didn&#x27;t even know it was still in existence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise people who are interested in this product to review the ingredients before buying.</li>
            <li> The Blush is very big and lovely colors</li>
            <li> first time contouring and</li>
            <li> the colors are exact.</li>
            <li> I MAYBE wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it if I read the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> I found that this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like the blushes and light contour but their somewhat chalky,  the dark contour seems even more chalky and doesn&#x27;t brush on well..</li>
            <li> it also isn&#x27;t consistent..</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine getting a better blush/contour palette than this one for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this basic makeup!</li>
            <li> it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Basically the lightest color is white and the contrast between the 2 med shades is greater than it appears in the photo.  </li>
            <li> daughet took the first box</li>
            <li> It does have a fishy smell when you first put it on, but it does fade throughout the day</li>
            <li> on time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;i really like it !</li>
            <li> i loved this the few times i used this...beautiful blush contour and highlight.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is frail, you need a gentle hand because the pans are so big that any impact cracks them easily!  </li>
            <li> I applied it using the flat top bronzer brush found on the Coastal Scents website.</li>
            <li> When I open the package, mind you how excited I have been since I ordererd this!.</li>
            <li> Colors are great and it was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> its decent pigmentation, they seem kinda like dry or chalky, its nothing amazing, but i like the matte highlighters</li>
            <li> Not a big deal since what is left (which is a good amount)</li>
            <li> - Large and not very travel friendly, blush colors are too strong, no mirror</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I figured i&#x27;d take a chance &amp; purchase the item.</li>
            <li> This is really the first highlight/contour set I have owned</li>
            <li> The colors are really pigmented and blend pretty well.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> noticed that there was powder everywhere, opened it all the way and one of the colors was pretty much powder.</li>
            <li> More things I love about this palette is that you can build on it for a damatic night look or go subtle for daytime because they are pigmented.</li>
            <li> the way i came to own this product is a little funny, my finger slipped.</li>
            <li> when applying this product, start with a little and add more if needed!</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy to apply, with a dry brush or a wet sponge.</li>
            <li> The pans are very large (about the size of a normal pressed powder compact).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this palette was going to be so large.  </li>
            <li> I certainly do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also rather large: too large to carry around.</li>
            <li> I use the top left and top middle color to highlight, obvisouly the bottom middle to contour, and both colors on the right are blush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect brown with grey undertones (rather than pink or blue) that works well for contouring.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the darkest shade for contour, but the blushes are really pretty as well.</li>
            <li> They do not cost as much as name brand stuff from large retailers.</li>
            <li> Little did I know how handy it would come in when my daughters dance recital rolled around.  </li>
            <li> The colors are great, although a little different than they appear on the computer screen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented therefore you don&#x27;t really need to use much of the product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very pigmented</li>
            <li> also, my pimples formed in straight lines on both my cheeks where i used</li>
            <li> very pigmented and blendable</li>
            <li> &amp; for the price it wouldn&#x27;t have been much of a loss.</li>
            <li> The item was packaged very well but somehow the blush still got messed up.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> all very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Its really the luck of the draw.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone</li>
            <li> I can now do my whole face with one palette.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use.</li>
            <li> There all very matte colors, no shimmer, sheen, sparkle..</li>
            <li> The two tan colors I don&#x27;t really use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this palette, but alas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it as much as my overpriced MAC blushes.</li>
            <li> It applies well, but throughout the whole day, you&#x27;d have to reapply it on.</li>
            <li> It has a very chalky consistency that you can&#x27;t even apply to your skin.</li>
            <li> I would not get too much on the brush</li>
            <li> Got more than what i expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Really really really like this set.</li>
            <li> It brushed on cheap as well.</li>
            <li> really like it</li>
            <li> This is a real bargin.</li>
            <li> Colors indicated are really  what you see.</li>
            <li> i was really looking forward to using this and adding it to my kit</li>
            <li> All of these are very pigmented, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> This is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Colors blend very well and</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really big!There is so much product in them.</li>
            <li> Works very well for contouring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased my anastasia contour pallet and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li> This is why I am giving this a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am changing my rating because customer service offered a free replacement on second contact.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> shipping was on time and fast and the product is..AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and the variety.</li>
            <li> , I would buy again, responsible vendor.</li>
            <li> and you get so much product for the price.</li>
            <li> and you dont have to use that much product to get the results you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li> want to know who is responsible for this, because I never seem this before.</li>
            <li> It can be very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;^.^</li>
            <li> It also blends really well</li>
            <li> I used this palette along with a primer and finishing spray, the foundation lasts all day, and even at night if I don&#x27;t wash my face really</li>
            <li> shipped fast &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving two stars because I&#x27;m not getting much color payoff from these.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t even look like in real life...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even real...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t contour that much.  </li>
            <li> It was very well packaged</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t show up on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It is ok but not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I mix it with the shade above it to warm up my face overall, but use it straight to contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  </li>
            <li> Very speedy with delivery.</li>
            <li> Even though the brown looks scarily dark, if you use small amounts as I suggested, it will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> the White is really white which is a nice highlighter.  </li>
            <li> No where on the product or packaging is it labeled &amp;#34;coastal scents.&amp;#34; I have personally shopped with coastal scents several times and the products are ALWAYS labeled as being one of their own.</li>
            <li> They are very light on the skin, and you only need a small amount of the product on your brush :)</li>
            <li> The pink blushes are flattering and it&#x27;s great that the highlight shades are matte like the other colors.  </li>
            <li> I chose this specifically because of the shades I saw after looking at many other options, but I did not get what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The blush on the other hand is ok.</li>
            <li> It works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So, twenty years later, having never found the right palette or successfully getting much makeup out of its case, I finally found this by accident when it showed up with some other search on Amazon.     </li>
            <li> They give you an amazing amount to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY inexpensive and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> I love in Florida, and the expected date for me to receive it wasn&#x27;t until February 6th, but it came in a whole month early!</li>
            <li> Very fast, professional service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.. not very excited</li>
            <li> The 2 blushes on the right are a little two strong for me</li>
            <li> I usually use the beige and dark chocolate together on temples, top of forhead, and nose to get a nice countour.  </li>
            <li> Love the dark brown for contour.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you know how to contour before buying this product because otherwise, it&#x27;s not really worth it.</li>
            <li> I will say that coastal scents runs this on sale for $11 pretty frequently</li>
            <li> I will be buying new from now on!</li>
            <li> My new palette arrived to my overseas address in 5 days!</li>
            <li> It is highly pigmented so a little application would be good enough.</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing, is way bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> A tad bit chalky, however less is more when using this</li>
            <li> Its a decent pallette.</li>
            <li> but the colors are so Vibrant and Rich!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> The white in the top left corner I use for highlighting..</li>
            <li> I can definitely create many looks with these different color palettes by mixing it with one another.</li>
            <li> i mainly use the brown for contouring.</li>
            <li> I am able to use the lighter colors for some highlighting but because I am a darker toned African American, the brown and the pinks</li>
            <li> The colors are a little different in person than they looked online, but it&#x27;s SO BIG and beautiful</li>
            <li> Less is definitely more, as each shade is highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Great solid not sparkly contouring colors, I like the dark brown for shadowing and the white for highlighting.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend that</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> :- ❧ HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I would have ordered this from the Coastal Scents site, but their shipping was a bit high</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend dealing with this company and using this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality waste of money</li>
            <li> THE CORRECT ITEM (Which I highly doubt they have coming from china)  </li>
            <li> The colors look scary intense when you first open it, but they all blend beautifully together</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented .</li>
            <li> then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer stated, I too have very sensitive skin, and I have experienced NO problems with breakouts due to this product.  </li>
            <li> a nice, velvety texture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, all of these six colors are extremely matte.</li>
            <li> the other colors are more confusing -but good for extra high lighting-one must experiment.</li>
            <li> I love the contour shade although it is very dark.</li>
            <li> I guess it really just depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> The contents and chemistry of the product are gentle on sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like the palette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not superfine milled, and silky like a department store brand, but it&#x27;s definately OK and suits</li>
            <li> love the variety of contouring colors.....will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The highlight color is pretty much useless for me and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> but honestly i didn&#x27;t mean to push the button that said \\&quot;buy now\\</li>
            <li> my cheeks and left and right jaws to contour.</li>
            <li> Overall, If you&#x27;re looking for a matte palate for blush and contour/highlighting, buy this right now.</li>
            <li> (but we know that makeup is never enough right?).</li>
            <li> You must use very little amounts at a time to really achieve that natural, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty decent palette.</li>
            <li> I use a long-wear foundation, and a primer on my lids bacause I live in the South</li>
            <li> This pallet earned a new home in my garbage can.</li>
            <li> and i cant live without it.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Watch a tutorial on YouTube if you&#x27;re new to the product.</li>
            <li> No shimmer at all, which to me is a good thing and hard to find especially in a highlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brown is too harsh and the pink is to bright.</li>
            <li> colors are nice and i use it everyday for my contouring, especially the brown</li>
            <li> I have aged skin as well so maybe on younger, smoother skin this might be ok.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin and none of the products bother me.</li>
            <li> It is has very natural matte colors.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with is that, I have oily skin so whether I used this palette just on top of my natural skin or on top of foundation, my T zone looked extremely greasy after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to any amateur like me :)</li>
            <li> It is pretty big too.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> the only thing with this the darkest shade came mash up but other than that i love it</li>
            <li> Hi, I not usually write reviews but with this product I have to.</li>
            <li> And, given the sheer size of this product (about 5&amp;#34; x 7&amp;#34;), it is not practical for traveling or keeping it with you for reapplication.  </li>
            <li> If you have pale skin, you must apply the brown contour very lightly because it quickly builds for a dark look.</li>
            <li> blush colours are fresh and blend nicely.&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes applying these products, my pale face has a nice, natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was certain it was this product because it was the only thing new that I was using, and upon discontinuing use, the breakouts have stopped.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling this will last a really long time, each pot is HUGE.</li>
            <li> I love this product , especially the blush and the dark brown contouring powder.makes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the colors to be as great as they were but for me, they did go on very pigmented but unfortunately didn&#x27;t stay on too long.  </li>
            <li> Most of it stayed on my brush, and what actually got on my face was just a blotchy mess.  </li>
            <li> Very large and seems to blend very well, will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product indeed caused me to break out so severely in large, red, puss-filled pimples all among the sides of my face where I contoured and my cheeks where I applied blush.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s rather large actually,</li>
            <li> *little* cheap.</li>
            <li> Too much of the dark contour shade can be a BIG mistake that&#x27;s tricky to fix without having to start over with a clean face</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size of the color palettes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, the dark color to contour is waaaaaay to dark for me and looks like mud, the color aren&#x27;t very pigmented to me.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels like play makeup my 5 year old daughter gets at Taget.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and not cakey/flakey at all.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to a budding young make-up artist.  </li>
            <li> the white doesn&#x27;t really show up for highlighting.</li>
            <li> to girls who like natural shades they are perfect..you can use it as a blush and to conture your face which is valuable</li>
            <li> The colors are all very pigmented and last FOREVER!</li>
            <li> They last all day and blend very well.</li>
            <li> I am just starting out in the make up thing, so when I was trying these colors, none of them really worked for me.</li>
            <li> The colors blend very well and it is much bigger than I</li>
            <li> I will definitely re-order this product when I am ready for another.  </li>
            <li> Only the brown and white colors are actually useful.</li>
            <li> usually first apply under eye corrector and light base foundation (I have European fair skin and blond hair) and then do the contouring with Coastal Scents white and brown shades, blending it all and finishing with a natural looking face powder and Coastal Scents</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers have mentioned this, but this palette is HUGE, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the other colors in the palette, they don&#x27;t really show up on my tan skin.</li>
            <li> It is just upsetting that I spent my money for nothing because I&#x27;ll never be able to use this again due to</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go at my skin super heavy with this since I am new to contouring.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived, but as soon as I tried it I realized this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered something like this online before, but decided among reading other reviews that it seemed worth it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the blendable colors although I&#x27;m not really sure what you could use the white for, maybe under the eyes?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the light powders (the pure white, the peachy-pink, and the yellow)</li>
            <li> dark brown is really hard to blend so be careful not to apply too much by accident while contouring.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good deal for the price...</li>
            <li> Overall, this is one of my new \\&quot;must haves\\&quot; for my make-up bag.</li>
            <li> ...it&#x27;s not something I would recommend for people with dry skin or for people who don&#x27;t know much about makeup.</li>
            <li> I use the white to help highlight my cheek bones and mix the low and high blush colors...works miracles!</li>
            <li> Because it was pressed makeup, I assumed it may crack (which can be fixed) but it had broken into so many pieces that I had already lost it all over the box/floor.</li>
            <li> The palette is very large, this will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first set and needless to say 4 sets later I am still IN LOVE with their products.</li>
            <li> The blushes need a little more brush movement to get it onto the brush than the other colors.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing an off brand, but I love it!</li>
            <li> So, I dab my brush in the that blush, and then mix it with the light pinky shade in the lower left hand corner, and it instantly dilutes that pink down to a very wearable shade for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The colors are great but the quality of the product is bad every time I try to use them they fall apart.</li>
            <li> Even if you go to the official website and view the contour and blush palette you can see that this product is clearly a knock off because it is not the same package or container that anyone writing a review has OR that the website itself has posted images of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between this palette and the Coastal Scents 10 color professional palette, but in the end chose this one for the contouring shades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve inly used the white and brown color so far to contour abd</li>
            <li> And this takes the place of ALL of them (unless you want a shimmery effect, because these are all completely and utterly matte).  </li>
            <li> I had broken one of the compressed powders (the one I use most, of course).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Convenience:  I literally have half a dozen bronzer compacts, two or three highlight compacts plus a few liquid/cream highlights, and even more blush compacts.  </li>
            <li> I mix a few colors on my brush to create just the right mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i thought this palette was going to be exactly the same as the other.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, I was a bit confused but now a few weeks in, I have been able to understand&lt;br /&gt;how</li>
            <li> The dark brown is really dark so start out lightly if you have fair/olive skin</li>
            <li> Blush is ok however I don&#x27;t care for the bronzer because it gives a choppy not smooth application for contouring.</li>
            <li> That ended up being exactly what I needed because i used to half to buff out the brown so much to make it look natural and sometimes I would look like I was had ran a mile  because the pink was too pink.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look so artificial and more soft natural makeup look.  </li>
            <li> This is because shadows are greyish, not pink or blue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting chalk on your face and the light peach color makes your face look ridiculously cakey and the contour color is the only thing I can can use in this pallet</li>
            <li> but when i have too much application of either blush or contour the flesh tone helps to blend it out and tone it down.</li>
            <li> and I find the cold dark brown shade very nice for contouring.</li>
            <li> They are pigmented very well without being so super saturated your afraid to dip your brush in, and they are silky soft and a dream to blend.  </li>
            <li> I tried the dark brown and thought nothing of it hitting my main problem area (which hasn&#x27;t bothered me in a while).  </li>
            <li> and so you really need to use a little.</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and show up beautifully on my dark, Indian skin.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, large palette for a very small price!</li>
            <li> You have a very complete blush/contour/highlighter matte palette that I could dare to say you won&#x27;t need any other blush/bronzer/highlighter</li>
            <li> Colors are very pigmented, so the highlight is extremely white on skin and contour color is very dark.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a good, big size for the price, but the quality is just bad.</li>
            <li> It barely takes any powder on the brush at all, so this product will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I had often imagined something just like this contour &amp; blush palette, but figured I would have to make it by taking the tins of powder out of their compacts and gluing them into some sort of flat palette.</li>
            <li> And as a bonus, I received an email stating I didn&#x27;t need to return the original broken item.</li>
            <li> Opened box excited for my purchase and found one blush broken up and all over the rest of the colors.</li>
            <li> I have such a round face and even though the dark brown contour color looks scary at first, I was able to sculpt my cheeks and add definition with these shades.  </li>
            <li> I brushed the dark color just under my cheek bone up to my ear and blended it softly.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re big circles and last a long time.</li>
            <li> And the shades themselve are big, matte, and can last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I opened the palettte I was disappointed because  the brown was much lighter than the bh brown and the blushes were more orange.</li>
            <li> I can do the same with the white to get and even paler pink, or mix it with the upper middle for a peachier toned shade.</li>
            <li> last a long time when you put them on.</li>
            <li> It lasts for such a long time--a year now</li>
            <li> I can see it would last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> This palette will last me a very long time</li>
            <li> These shades are not super pigmented and completely matte</li>
            <li> As a newbie to contouring and highlighting, I wanted something the would make it easy and not end up looking fake or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Bought it as a birthday present for my boss and it was much bigger than any of us expected.</li>
            <li> gave it a five star is because I believe both blush colors are too similar and they could have given you another color as&lt;br /&gt;oppose to staying with the same pink hue.</li>
            <li> I then tried the light color above my cheeks to draw the attention up to my eye area and also put it on the bridge of my nose with a very thin brush.  </li>
            <li> Price was fabulous, can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t take as long to get here, and arrives in one piece.</li>
            <li> because I waited so long...</li>
            <li> and i use a combination of the pink blushes and the white for eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I adore the pink and white highlighters.  </li>
            <li> make-up also stay quite long...</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive so it did not break me out with acne.</li>
            <li> Much larger than expected.</li>
            <li> look for blushes and other facial powders.</li>
            <li> and I shipped the other palette back.</li>
            <li> I also find that they do not stay on very long...   </li>
            <li> I place an exchange order, I mailed back my broken palette  and in another two days I got a brand new palette with no extra cost.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, go for the coastal scents camoflauge concealer palette.</li>
            <li> I do the same with the bronzer (the dark brown shade)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;***I purchased this from Amazon, and the first palette delivered was broken.</li>
            <li> I got my package in two days, even though the box was undamaged the first palette that I got was broken.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and decided to get it.  </li>
            <li> When I have the time to sit down and properly apply my make-up I must have this contour palette.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got this item</li>
            <li> If you were darker complexion it would not work as the color is not highly pigmented  </li>
            <li> Not high quality makeup</li>
            <li> Two pink blushes, 3 highlight colors and 1 contour color...</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s pink blushscattered everywhere  </li>
            <li> Tcontainer was all pink?</li>
            <li> but mine arrived with the pink side all smashed up.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy this again, I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I expected a compact size similer to Mally&#x27;sshimmer, shape and glow.</li>
            <li> it was broken, and i was very upset about it.</li>
            <li> The only downsides to this palette is that it seems extremely fragile: mine arrived broken, with the powders shattered and mixed up.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected</li>
            <li> But I received the package damaged; three of the palette are crushed.</li>
            <li> My skin is only a few shades lighter than the brown in this.</li>
            <li> But thankfully it was packaged carefully and was well protected through the shipping</li>
            <li> so maybe a few trial runs with it and maybe for the actual day...</li>
            <li> i also like the wide variety of colors this palette provides.</li>
            <li> its not mach with my dry skin!!</li>
            <li> top-middle colour has slight yellow undertones, so I use that for dark circles (which I have in abundance) and it does okay.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is a little dark for me in terms of using it to contour my face especially in the cheek area and around my jawline.</li>
            <li> The other 2 shades do not really suit my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The palette comes in a very classic black matte casing and none of the products in the palette were broken or cracked when i received it,</li>
            <li> The colors have a lot of pigment, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of powder as well and a  little goes a long way with this set.</li>
            <li> Like the reviews say a little go a LONG way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would also warn any one who uses it that a little goes a long way on this pallet.</li>
            <li> I have recently become obsessed with makeup and trying new looks.</li>
            <li> Other than that I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All through the other colors.</li>
            <li> they are extremely pigmented which can be a blessing and a curse.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way on these colors!</li>
            <li> for the price, it is extremely pigmented and works well with my skin tone as well as my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> the dark color is not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Opened box excited for my purchase and found one blush broken up and all over the rest of the colors !!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to other dark-skinned people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I checked youtube for tutorials to see how other women used this palette as well.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A COASTAL SCENT PALETTE, EXTREMELY  DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I tried it and it extremely powdery,  </li>
            <li> But other than that, I would still use this product after I find a way to control my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It was packaged extremely well and survived shipping with no issues.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m the only one it happened too other than at</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have a round face with long hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with the other colors as well.  </li>
            <li> The brown color is too dark &amp;#62;~&amp;#60; Although it is themost important color for contouring ! :(</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you MUST be careful not to drop it or bang it around because the pressed powder will explode (duh).</li>
            <li> , it hardly applied at all, the the case was completely blank (there should be a Costal Scents logo)</li>
            <li> I use this palette quite a bit, i find the contour color to be a little dark and a little difficult to find the right ratio for my skin color</li>
            <li> My skin was consistently clear until I used this product and it completely ruined the clear skin I worked so hard to achieve :(    </li>
            <li> and I saw the dark brown color</li>
            <li> contour powder not as dark</li>
            <li> One of the blushes is too dark for use as a blush, on my skin.</li>
            <li> The dark brown for contouring didn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> The dark contour color looks darker than it is on your skin.</li>
            <li> Too dark for me to bronzer with</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is extremely dark but you can mix with the lighter colors for your desired shade.</li>
            <li> Not worth my time to return but upset that this happened</li>
            <li> The quality is average.</li>
            <li> No problem, I have Hazel eyes, so I use that pink for an eyeshadow (and the deeper brown on my crease) and it makes the green in my eyes POP.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM CAME BROKEN AFTER WAITING NEARLY A MONTH</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is acne prone, and I have not experienced an increase in my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> : I hate buying palettes most of the time because if you don&#x27;t like even one of the products in the palette, it seems wasteful to me.  </li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, only four stars because it can be difficult to blend!</li>
            <li> Been using this daily for the past couple of months, and no complaints!  </li>
            <li> Reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I was a little worried that I would receive the merchandise in pieces.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the white one - it seriously feels like I&#x27;m putting chalk on my face.</li>
            <li> Like all powders have to be careful if drop can be a mess!</li>
            <li> a huge person on buying blush/bronzers and countour makeup, this by far was the worst for me!</li>
            <li> Very disappointied - this was an unfortunate waste of money and time on my part.</li>
            <li> so I do not have a previous set to compare it</li>
            <li> The cream worked well but this palette is so much less time-consuming and cleaner to apply.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because it really is BIG, so it might be a little difficult to take in a trip or on the go with you.</li>
            <li> All the palette paint were scather and it was a mess of a make up im returning the product</li>
            <li> What a powdered mess.</li>
            <li> Two of the blushes were completely broken in tiny pieces and scattered all over the other four colors.</li>
            <li> Such a waist of my hard earned money,.. never again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty afraid to try the rest in heavy doses.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to make it look less round.  </li>
            <li> If not, it can look a little muddy.  </li>
            <li> A little too chalky for my liking</li>
            <li> You must know a little bit of contouring in order to use this.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of play makeup when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Dark powder was all over the place!</li>
            <li> After putting on my foundation and just a little powder to &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; my look.</li>
            <li> A tad expensive, but I can tolerate this price because it seems that this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> On the days I do decide to go a little heavy, it does the trick</li>
            <li> The contouring brown powder is very dark.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is very dark.</li>
            <li> The brown is very dark but it works out well if you blend it correctly.</li>
            <li> The contour color is very dark.</li>
            <li> but it can be a little difficult to blend and look natural.</li>
            <li> Stage make up has to be heavy and the face must be well contoured.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> that just looks childish.  </li>
            <li> and I had trouble getting it from the palette to my cheaks.</li>
            <li> When I received the palette the lower left tan color was broken up a bit from shipping I assumed.</li>
            <li> This is an everyday go-to to finish off my face.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars is before I even bought this item, I had read some of the reviews where their palettes had been received broken.  </li>
            <li> I just received this palette today and me being the impatient person I am, tried it out</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday for on camera news.</li>
            <li> I had to waste a lot of powder in cleaning it up</li>
            <li> i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I use it everyday now  </li>
            <li> These are grainy but fairly heavily pigmented.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never run out, even if you use a heavy amount everyday.</li>
            <li> You can do anything from highlighting/contouring to evening or everyday</li>
            <li> When you think about it, buying six shades of blush/bronzer/highlight for under $20 is not going to happen, with a few exceptions.  </li>
            <li> if your brownskin/ darkskin its not recommended for us black women!</li>
            <li> Hate to let this go to waste even though it was inexpensive, it was a decent enough palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li> I am quite pale; cool-toned.</li>
            <li> The brown for contouring is too dark, you have to seriously use a little.  </li>
            <li> The reason for the three stars is that this palette breaks my skin out pretty badly.</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying how shocked I was at the size of each color.</li>
            <li> It is not Original product !</li>
            <li> , I would recommend for anyone who loves to add a little color to their face!</li>
            <li> and once you do, it takes very little practice to get the hang of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are pigmented but blend down to be subtle.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product quickly, as usual.</li>
            <li> Waste of $!</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened with shipping</li>
            <li> experience :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a fluke</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually like costal scents</li>
            <li> All of them swatched terribly for me except for the brown and bottom right pink.</li>
            <li> it was broken and the dark contour shade got all over me.</li>
            <li> While all of this isn&#x27;t too bad and pretty acceptable, all things considered, the big downfall was how badly it broke out my skin.  </li>
            <li> But the size, price, &amp; variety of colors is hard to say no to.</li>
            <li> High pigment,  really hard to blend :(</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear this stuff everyday because it does mask your face up which is really bad for your skin (especially if acne prone).</li>
            <li> That being said, it takes some practice because the colors and insanely pigmented, so use a light hand when applying.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was skeptical at purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I put some of the broken brown powder into a small case that I carry in my travel makeup bag, but if yours arrives intact</li>
            <li> I was actually afraid that the very dark color would not work at all for me and probably a waste of money on a color</li>
            <li> i use the palette on nights when im contouring and putting some serious effort into my appearance.</li>
            <li> but nothing too serious or often ever again.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this palette</li>
            <li> Not a good highlighter as it goes on matte and not a good setting powder as it goes on looking ashy.</li>
            <li> the pallet in not really good for contouring ..</li>
            <li> I mean worse case scenario, I would&#x27;ve just given it to my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit afraid when i bought these colors.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> only have 1 bad thing to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;They smell weird.</li>
            <li> and it arrived broken, 2 were cracked 1 was shattered.</li>
            <li> Some people get it broken, and some people dont.</li>
            <li> I honeslty was not happy with this.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this product it was delivered to me broken and the makeup powder is out all over the place..</li>
            <li> No cracked or broken powder.     </li>
            <li> Broken to pieces on arrival.</li>
            <li> One of the blushes was broken and all over the case that it came in.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> When I received the box, I opened it and the bronzer had broken and spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li> Slightly irritating to my skin though.</li>
            <li> I received this palettes broken and durty.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> looks like expired, broken and durty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> when i opened it alot of it was broken .</li>
            <li> arriving broken</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing, I had purchased brushes and other things from Coastal Scents</li>
            <li> Not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing, but if you&#x27;re looking for a luminous highlighter shade (which I usually use), look elsewhere for that.</li>
            <li> I did it for a few days, getting the hang of this technique and started noticing the bumps :(  </li>
            <li> The product I got was a blatant fake-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be wary of product.</li>
            <li> Sorry but did not like at all.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying i was skeptical about</li>
            <li> but i was wrong...</li>
            <li> This product is useless to me..</li>
            <li> i know that sounds silly</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I wanted to try my hand at contouring</li>
            <li> but alas, it did not!</li>
            <li> IT IS FALSELY ADVERTISED!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this pallet was of very poor quality, it looked chalky and I just had to return it on principle alone.</li>
            <li> The white powder, that supposedly is for highlighting,... SUCK SO BAD, I&#x27;m so angry!!!</li>
            <li> and I was afraid, but after watching a youtube video or two</li>
            <li> and it made my face look dirty.</li>
            <li> How disappointing</li>
            <li> I was also afraid of it</li>
            <li> Seriously, IT SMELLS BAD!  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with product!</li>
            <li> so mad...</li>
            <li> and unfortunately mine did as well &#x3D;(.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FAKE!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> which was really disappointing :(</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed when the item arrived because one of the blushes was completely broken.</li>
            <li> so I assume it was packaged well and was just treated badly during shipping.</li>
            <li> inespecially like the fact that the colors are matte and no shimmer which on women in their 40s can be a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe a got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> my chalking it up to a bad palette.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate it....</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when i opened the box</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well I opened the pallette and one of the blushes was ALLLLLL broken!!!!</li>
            <li> How sad that she looked forward to this!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> THE WORST---</li>
            <li> but I did not like this contour palette at all and the blush colors are horrible.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SOOOOOO BAD!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible...</li>
            <li> The worst shop....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a decent pallette. The shipping was fast. The colors are well pigmented.</li>
            <li> Love love love this pallet.  I mainly use the darkest shade for contour, but the blushes are really pretty as well. The product itself is very pigmented and so you really need to use a little. Very happy with this pallet and the price!</li>
            <li> awesome. in reality the palette is big</li>
            <li> This make-up is cheap quality. You can feel the difference in texture and it makes my skin irritate. The brown is too harsh and the pink is to bright. I&#x27;ve tried different brushes but could not control the intensity of the colors. You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results of this palette,  I highly recommend this and will be purchasing more coastal products!  You can&#x27;t beat the price and results,</li>
            <li> I bought this product for daily contouring of my face and I adore it. Little did I know how handy it would come in when my daughters dance recital rolled around.  Stage make up has to be heavy and the face must be well contoured. I was able to achieve this easily , building the layers up until I got where I wanted it. I find that using an angled brush followed by a buffing brush to blend works best. I do wish that it has two white powders as it seems thats the one I go through the most to build highlights. Definitely going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> i loved this the few times i used this...beautiful blush contour and highlight.  but i had acne on the places i used this on!!!  my cheeks and left and right jaws to contour. i know that this is the cause because i have NEVER had acne around my jaws and i didnt use anything else on my cheeks and jaws.  also, my pimples formed in straight lines on both my cheeks where i used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, yes i loved the colors on my face when i used this, but i am now suffering from severe acne because of it.  beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also want to add that i used their concealer camouflage palette and i highly recommend that and that didnt give me acne even though i used it the same areas that i used this contour and blush palette on.</li>
            <li> if your brownskin/ darkskin its not recommended for us black women! just saying! it made me look ghostly lol</li>
            <li> really good quality for that price! very pigmented and blendable</li>
            <li> Love this palette! Highly pigmented, only four stars because it can be difficult to blend!</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying how shocked I was at the size of each color. They are very big and will last a while. I love the fact that the colors are matte finish. I have not been able to find many contour products that don&#x27;t have some shimmer to them. The white color is so perfect for highlighting under the eyes to make them appear much brighter, and make you look young and rested. The colors have a lot of pigment, so a little goes a long way. The blush colors are perfect for any skin tone. I am very fair and the colors work well for me. I have actually ended up using the brown for eyeshadow. It is a little dark for me in terms of using it to contour my face especially in the cheek area and around my jawline. It would work well for an olive complexion. Overall, this is one of my new \\&quot;must haves\\&quot; for my make-up bag.</li>
            <li> Wow! Actually, I had often imagined something just like this contour &amp; blush palette, but figured I would have to make it by taking the tins of powder out of their compacts and gluing them into some sort of flat palette. So, twenty years later, having never found the right palette or successfully getting much makeup out of its case, I finally found this by accident when it showed up with some other search on Amazon.     I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this compact/palette - I use every color and I love that they are all matte (much more effective). This is a good sized palette (6\\&quot;x9\\&quot;) with large pressed powders. Colors are true to the photo; white, light beige/tan, bright (slightly warm) pink, light peach, brown, and medium/dark cool pink. Every skin tone will be able to blend the perfect match, then use the light colors for highlighting, the bright pink (highly pigmented) for the apple of the cheek, the darker pink (less pigmented) for more of a blush/bronze effect, and the brown for mixing shades and for contouring like hiding upper eyelid bags or slimming the nose. I had a Lauren Hutton face disk with smaller tins of powders and creams that I liked but did not use many of the shades, and quit using it at all a while ago. This Coastal Scents palette could replace pounds of powders (stuffed in my bathroom, each in its plastic container), and be used much more often because it&#x27;s so easy and versatile. If you like light makeup coverage, you can use this for most of your needs. If you want to brighten up your complexion, this is fast and easy, and you couldn&#x27;t ask for better colors.      This is a superior product. Search on google/yahoo/whatever for Coastal Scents for their website where you will find more rave reviews. BTW, it is fragrance-free even though \\&quot;scent\\&quot; is part of the brand name.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I have such a round face and even though the dark brown contour color looks scary at first, I was able to sculpt my cheeks and add definition with these shades.  The pink blushes are flattering and it&#x27;s great that the highlight shades are matte like the other colors.  If you&#x27;re unsure how to use the shades, there are plenty of youtube makeup gurus who will show you how :)</li>
            <li> Okay I do not use the word &#x27;perfect&#x27; because nothing is really perfect...but this is. It&#x27;s so amazing, I&#x27;m fair skinned and I saw the dark brown color and I was afraid, but after watching a youtube video or two then I learned the best way for contouring. I love this palette it is my go to because it has two blushes and it&#x27;s just amazing. I&#x27;m the kind of person to buy eye shadows first then look for blushes and other facial powders. This is a great product and I really recommend it to anyone from a beginner to someone that has been doing makeup for years. For beginners I suggest checking some youtube gurus videos because it does help (personally I used xsparkage&#x27;s video)    I want to add that I purchased the palette and it arrived broken, 2 were cracked 1 was shattered. I e-mail Amazon and my replacement arrived the very next day, perfectly intact and I shipped the other palette back. So thats just to comment on amazons great customer service and reliablity.</li>
            <li> I saw the Coastal Scents palates first on You Tube watching makeup tutorials. I ordered my first set and needless to say 4 sets later I am still IN LOVE with their products. They do not cost as much as name brand stuff from large retailers. They are better than stuff you can buy at say Walmart..but the colors are so Vibrant and Rich!&lt;br /&gt;They last a long time when you put them on. They are awesome in my arsenal. ALL the stuff I have from them is great!I recommend it over Sephora and Mac..I LOVE IT...I have very very sensitive skin and none of the products bother me. If you want good makeup for you or maybe your Teen..this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the pigment.  Easy to blend and contour</li>
            <li> Very useful contour palette for the price.</li>
            <li> Great solid not sparkly contouring colors, I like the dark brown for shadowing and the white for highlighting. It&#x27;s pretty big lasts a long time and good product and good shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought the coastal scents 120 pallette and this blush pallete work great with my make up collection.  I&#x27;m intermediate in terms of expertise, but I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with contouring and this allows me a splash of color and the basic colors needed to contour as well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> First of all the packaging was perfect! Shipping was really quick. It arrived with not a scratch on it. Thanks Amazon!!! Ok, so now about the product. I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for ten years now, &amp; I must say, this product is one of the best. After reading all the positive reviews I figured i&#x27;d take a chance &amp; purchase the item. &amp; for the price it wouldn&#x27;t have been much of a loss. I mean worse case scenario, I would&#x27;ve just given it to my daughter to play with. But i&#x27;m very happy about purchasing this coastal scents pallette. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my clients!!</li>
            <li> Just received this in the mail today! The colors are a little different in person than they looked online, but it&#x27;s SO BIG and beautiful that I&#x27;ll just make it work. I love in Florida, and the expected date for me to receive it wasn&#x27;t until February 6th, but it came in a whole month early!</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good but I was very disappointed when the item arrived because one of the blushes was completely broken. The item was packaged very well but somehow the blush still got messed up. Other than that I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, its actually bigger in person that the pictures love the colors. Highly, highly recommended. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect as such BIG box as what I got.&lt;br /&gt;this works beautifully in your face&lt;br /&gt;the rosy blushes are superwow&lt;br /&gt;I luv those shades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery can&#x27;t wait to try this out tonight!!!</li>
            <li> This palette is pretty awesome for the price. Arrived fast. Bigger than i expected. A tad bit chalky, however less is more when using this so it&#x27;s fine. Overall pretty decent palette.</li>
            <li> Love how bright the blushes are and the brown contour is great, nice and matte too. I don&#x27;t really use the other colors in the palette, they don&#x27;t really show up on my tan skin. I gave it 4 stars because I noticed the blushes wear off on my skin quite quickly, as well as the contour. But it is a great price.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between this palette and the Coastal Scents 10 color professional palette, but in the end chose this one for the contouring shades. My package arrived with all blushes intact. The pigmentation of the colors are great, and I love them for the nice matte highlight and contour finish. If you have pale skin, you must apply the brown contour very lightly because it quickly builds for a dark look. This along with another Coastal Scents Palette were the first from that brand for me and I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> For only under $19, this deal can&#x27;t beat.  Two pink blushes, 3 highlight colors and 1 contour color... all very pigmented.  This palette will last me a very long time and I use it everyday.  I especially like the white matte highlight color.  I&#x27;ve found that most highlighters on the market are sparkly or glittery and for a 35 y/o that just looks childish.  I prefer the sophisticated look that the matte highlighter gives me.  I&#x27;ve already received compliments on the look of my cheeks.  I will definately buy from coastal scents again.  Good deal for the $$. In fact, I&#x27;ve just ordered the Warm 88 Eyeshadow Palette.  Can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was skeptical at purchasing this. Im glad I did, heres what I found:  *Shipping  It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Some people get it broken, and some people dont. Its really the luck of the draw.  *Acne Prone Skin  After reading a review that stated the product made the customer(s) break out, I was definitely hesitant. My skin is very acne prone so I was worried. Ive been using the product for almost a week and see no irritation. I guess it really just depends on how sensitive your skin is. Yes, it contains Talc, if you know you&#x27;re allergic to it, or know it triggers breakouts in your skin, obviously dont buy it.  *Size  I have a feeling this will last a really long time, each pot is HUGE. Less is definitely more, as each shade is highly pigmented.  Overall, If you&#x27;re looking for a matte palate for blush and contour/highlighting, buy this right now.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with product! Brown is pretty dark for contour in my opinion but works great to fill in brows!</li>
            <li> So far the pros; I received it in a quick 2 days, which was great, the size was much bigger than I thought it was awesome, the colors seem bright, Can&#x27;t wait to play with my Makeup!!!</li>
            <li> contour powder not as dark but i like it, really nice. blush is just lovely&lt;br /&gt;in all i recommend it</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when i opened the box and there&#x27;s pink blushscattered everywhere  and i was actually looking forward in using this product.</li>
            <li> -:¦:-•:*&#x27;&amp;#34;*:•.-:¦:-•❧FABULOUS ❧ -:¦:- ❧ HIGHLY RECOMMEND❧ -:¦:-•:*&#x27;&amp;#34;*:•.-:¦:-</li>
            <li> I love this pallet.  Really good for contouring!  Colors work for just about everyone.  Also like the blush colors.  Would recommend purchasing!</li>
            <li> I honeslty was not happy with this. The colors arent so great either, Im lightskin and I had trouble getting it from the palette to my cheaks. I also find that they do not stay on very long...   Im a huge person on buying blush/bronzers and countour makeup, this by far was the worst for me! The only thing good about is the size of them:)</li>
            <li> I posted a review on the official Coastal Scents website but they never allowed it to post. I guess they don&#x27;t want to lose sales but it has to be made known that this product will likely cause you to break out if you have acne prone skin. I did some research on mineral oil and lanolin and it&#x27;s controversial as to whether or not it causes acne. As of now, I know for a fact no one can tell me any different. This product indeed caused me to break out so severely in large, red, puss-filled pimples all among the sides of my face where I contoured and my cheeks where I applied blush. My skin was consistently clear until I used this product and it completely ruined the clear skin I worked so hard to achieve :(    If you don&#x27;t suffer from skin problems however, then this palette is wonderful. I love the pigmentation of the colors. You must use very little amounts at a time to really achieve that natural, healthy glow. I love the blushes and the contour color is perfect. Even though the brown looks scarily dark, if you use small amounts as I suggested, it will work wonderfully. I applied it using the flat top bronzer brush found on the Coastal Scents website. I just used the corner of the brush to create that contour line and it was fairly easy (esp. for a makeup beginner like myself).     It is just upsetting that I spent my money for nothing because I&#x27;ll never be able to use this again due to it&#x27;s acne aggravating ingredients.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this ! The colors are awesome..  amateur mua, mua or even if u just love doing ur own make up...a must have ! get it and enjoy it as much as i&#x27;m doing :)</li>
            <li> I saw a video on youtube that featured this product. I immediately researched this product and the company that makes it. I would have ordered this from the Coastal Scents site, but their shipping was a bit high (I did not need the 50 dollars worth of items that would have qualified me for free shipping, as much as I would have liked to have had more stuff) so I checked Amazon. The price here is right, and FREE SHIPPING! I recieved the product quickly, as usual. I love it. Really great qulity, especially for the price. I had been looking for a MATTE contour pallete for a while. I went to Sephora, and purchased a Philosophy dual color (Hugs and Kisses) blush and contour compact. The Coastal Scents Palette is superior.      I am quite pale; cool-toned. All of the colors suit me. Even the dark contour color works great. I can now do my whole face with one palette. One of the blushes is too dark for use as a blush, on my skin. No problem, I have Hazel eyes, so I use that pink for an eyeshadow (and the deeper brown on my crease) and it makes the green in my eyes POP. The colors last all day. I use a long-wear foundation, and a primer on my lids bacause I live in the South and it&#x27;s always HOT and HUMID. This is a wonderful product and I have already reccomended it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for someone recovering from an illness. I thought the colors in the palette were perfect in the photo and might brighten her day. It arrived today and although the packaging had bubble wrap around it, the box itself was not sealed at all. Two of the blushes were completely broken in tiny pieces and scattered all over the other four colors. Very disappointied - this was an unfortunate waste of money and time on my part.</li>
            <li> Awesome set! Colors are great and it was bigger than I expected. It will last awhile.</li>
            <li> When I received the palette the lower left tan color was broken up a bit from shipping I assumed. Not a big deal since what is left (which is a good amount) I don&#x27;t really use. There all very matte colors, no shimmer, sheen, sparkle.. nothing. The bronzer is what I use the most, a dab with do ya. The two blush colors aren&#x27;t my favorite colors I own but I do use them because it&#x27;s just more convenient. The white in the top left corner I use for highlighting.. Lets just say I have to swipe my brush a good 3-4 time to get enough product to apply and show where I want it. The two tan colors I don&#x27;t really use. Not my favorite makeup piece I own but I do like it and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I JUST recieved this in the mail. Have not even gotten to use it yet!! When I open the package, mind you how excited I have been since I ordererd this!. Tcontainer was all pink? Hmmm I was wondering why. Well I opened the pallette and one of the blushes was ALLLLLL broken!!!! All through the other colors. I guess this was my lesson not to buy from a place like this! I will be buying new from now on! So discouraged!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this product it was delivered to me broken and the makeup powder is out all over the place..</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! It blends so well and it works great on my skin color.. It&#x27;s very pigmented therefore you don&#x27;t really need to use much of the product. I&#x27;ve been trying to practice on contouring my face and this product is easy to work with. I&#x27;d recommend this to any amateur like me :)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this palette, but alas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to any cosmetics I&#x27;ve put on my face, but this caused my face to break out in rash-like redness as soon as I applied it. I gave it a week and tried it again, just to make sure this palette was the cause, and sure enough, I confirmed that it was. NOT recommended. Waste of $!</li>
            <li> The palette is beautiful! Colors are great...Problem was that it took 3 weeks to arrive, when I got it today and opened it..it was broken and the dark contour shade got all over me. I sent out for a replacement. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t take as long to get here, and arrives in one piece. I\\&quot;M so mad...because I waited so long...but I&#x27;ll give them one more chance to make it right.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette.  Like really really love. lol  You can blend and highlight to your hearts content.  Huge pots of beautiful smooth powder(the yellow is my favorite) with just the right amount of color to do the job.  It&#x27;s earned a place on my must have list now.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the blendable colors although I&#x27;m not really sure what you could use the white for, maybe under the eyes?  I usually use the beige and dark chocolate together on temples, top of forhead, and nose to get a nice countour.  The blush is nice as well and looks good with the contouring.  You get a lot of powder as well and a  little goes a long way with this set.</li>
            <li> Really bold colors, which I like! Easy to work with as long as you have good brushes...lasted all day for the most part!</li>
            <li> I received this product on time and it was properly package so there was no damage. I was surprised at the size of the color palettes. The product seems to work well and it is fun to experiment with the colors to see the affect. I would highly recommend dealing with this company and using this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, lasts a long time, and for the price that i paid im super happy. It is pretty big too.</li>
            <li> Nice powdery feel to the product.  the White is really white which is a nice highlighter.  Love the dark brown for contour.  The blushes are really strong so it just takes a light touch.  Price was fabulous, can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I previously ordered their 32 piece brush set from Costal Scents and had a great expirence with the company so when all my make up was stolen I began to rebuild my make up collection. Instead of heading to Mac and buying a boat loas of expensive products I decided to try this has it has many of the essentials I was looking for. Like the reviews say a little go a LONG way they are extremely pigmented which can be a blessing and a curse. Be light handed and this pallet could be your best friend!</li>
            <li> This product is great because it&#x27;s colors are versatile (depending on how much you apply) and the staying power is very good (especially for work). Very pleased! It&#x27;s a lot of fun! I like it as much as my overpriced MAC blushes.</li>
            <li> colors are nice and i use it everyday for my contouring, especially the brown and i use a combination of the pink blushes and the white for eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Very pigmented  Must use with a light hand.  Great for traveling.  I have olive colored skin and blush look great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, the dark color to contour is waaaaaay to dark for me and looks like mud, the color aren&#x27;t very pigmented to me. They feel very chalky, I have light to medium skin tone and the colors just don&#x27;t look nice on me maybe someone with darker skin would look better with this :) but it did come very fast and packaged very nicely</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the texture and the matte finish of these blushes/pressed powders. This is an everyday go-to to finish off my face. I use the white and neutrals for highlighting and the deeper brown with a shadow brush for contouring. Definitely an all-in-one.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing, I had purchased brushes and other things from Coastal Scents and I have been satisfied with the quality of the product for the price. Unfortunately this pallet was of very poor quality, it looked chalky and I just had to return it on principle alone. Did not want this stuff on my face ¼</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I have been looking for a good contour palette for some time and my sister who knows a lot about make up recommended I try out Coastal Scents.I am very happy I did the make up was very good quality and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I can definitely create many looks with these different color palettes by mixing it with one another. And I think each color palette can be replaced with another one...? Not sure. Anyhoo, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this palette, but it works wonders! Super pigmented and matte--perfect for me. I like the matte-finish, and it does just that. It applies well, but throughout the whole day, you&#x27;d have to reapply it on. It lasts for such a long time--a year now and I apply it everytime I go out. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived, but as soon as I tried it I realized this product was a waste of money. It has a very chalky consistency that you can&#x27;t even apply to your skin. Most of it stayed on my brush, and what actually got on my face was just a blotchy mess.  I am so disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if i should order this product since it was so cheap! it was delivered in good condition, and i find it very useful on days where i want to contour and highlight! It is more of a powder texture, rather than a creamy texture. I would not get too much on the brush when applying this product, start with a little and add more if needed! Especially on the blush and brown color. A little goes a long way on these colors! Overall i would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this palette. for the price, it is extremely pigmented and works well with my skin tone as well as my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been contemplating this palette for some time.  I finally broke down and decided to get it.  Ordering from Amazon is always a joy.  Super fast delivery and in perfect condition.  No cracked or broken powder.     As for the product,  it is great!  I use it daily now.  The contouring brown powder is very dark. I do mix it a bit with the yellow/beige powder above it, to mellow the brown.  If not, it can look a little muddy.  Both of the blush colors are great. Bright enough to look like a natural flush. I adore the pink and white highlighters.  Very pretty at the top of the cheekbones.   All of the powders are matte, so you don&#x27;t look like a big shimmery ball.  I am very pleased with this product and cannot recommend it enough.      As a previous reviewer stated, I too have very sensitive skin, and I have experienced NO problems with breakouts due to this product.  But, I am also a fiend about cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> PROS: great universal colors, blendable, highly pigmented- more for makeup artists who know what they are doing...the blush &amp; contour shade are easy to place- the other colors are more confusing -but good for extra high lighting-one must experiment. Pallette is nice for special occasions when you want to look extra polished.CON: Directions would have been helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> I use this palette quite a bit, i find the contour color to be a little dark and a little difficult to find the right ratio for my skin color but they are all very pigmented with great color pay off, the skin tone above the contour shade is nearly identical to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> the dark color is not very pigmented. The blushes are great. The two skin colors haven&#x27;t matched any of my clients yet. the white is translucent and sets under eye makeup well.</li>
            <li> The blushes worked well. The dark brown for contouring didn&#x27;t blend well and it made my face look dirty. It is all matte so there is no shimmer. It is definitely a good, big size for the price, but the quality is just bad. The white color for contouring broke into pieces. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> its decent pigmentation, they seem kinda like dry or chalky, its nothing amazing, but i like the matte highlighters so that is why i bought it and im satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is great contour makeup but mine arrived with the pink side all smashed up. I&#x27;m not sure what happened with shipping but I left feedback and got no response or follow-up.</li>
            <li> Im so in love with these! The pigments are so intense and bright, definitely a must have! Got more than what i expected for the price. Very happy with my Coastal Scents purchase. :)</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, large palette for a very small price! The customer service was great (the first time my product arrived, it was completely shattered but Amazon happily replaced it), and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a contour palette. You really can&#x27;t get much better for under $20. I LOVE THIS PALETTE!</li>
            <li> just received my palette today.  BEAUTIFUL colors!  highly pigmented, applies well, and matte (which I love!).  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars is before I even bought this item, I had read some of the reviews where their palettes had been received broken.  I took the chance and had ordered it and unfortunately mine did as well &#x3D;(.  As always Amazon and their great customer service team pulls through and hopefully I will receive my new palette unbroken!  *fingers crossed*</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Broken to pieces on arrival. It looks and feels like play makeup my 5 year old daughter gets at Taget.</li>
            <li> Use this for face...Good product. Have it for a while.Like all powders have to be careful if drop can be a mess!</li>
            <li> Great product for price and quality. This is huge- didn&#x27;t expect it to be so much! Great basic for contouring. Quality is good. Colors are pleasant and useful. I&#x27;d recommend it for all, great for beginners getting used to contouring. Lots of product here- so great for professionals as well.</li>
            <li> Really really really like this set. The blushes need a little more brush movement to get it onto the brush than the other colors. The bronzer is very dark. Sort of dirt colored but it works well if you use it lightly and make sure to shake the brush off first. I like that only the white pod has shimmer.</li>
            <li> The powders in here are great! I have had this for several months and still have a bunch left. The dark contour color looks darker than it is on your skin. I use this almost every day.</li>
            <li> The colors are well pigmented, but they don&#x27;t blend as easily as hoped for. The blush colors are very bright - too much for my fair skin. Overall though, for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal. The white highlight color actually gives a nice light shimmer to cheek bones and I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I didn&#x27;t realize that this palette was going to be so large.  It is really big and has a great mix of colors for contour and blush.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the price and quality of the Coastal Scents range.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and are very pigmented. My only complaint is the white one - it seriously feels like I&#x27;m putting chalk on my face. Not a good highlighter as it goes on matte and not a good setting powder as it goes on looking ashy.</li>
            <li> All the palette paint were scather and it was a mess of a make up im returning the product</li>
            <li> Low quality.  Looked cheap.  It brushed on cheap as well.</li>
            <li> I read reviews first, but don&#x27;t see the problems I read about.  It is a lot of powder for the money and goes on very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I just received this palette today and me being the impatient person I am, tried it out right away.&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s just start with packaging. The palette comes in a very classic black matte casing and none of the products in the palette were broken or cracked when i received it, so that&#x27;s a plus! Also, This palette is BIG!!!! Each product is about the diameter of a five year olds palm which when you think about it, is a lot of product, hence my title, AMOUNTed up to my expectations. I could only give this product 4 stars because of the fact that i have used it for a prolonged amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion point of this review: If you want a lot of great quality product for a small price, this is for you :) It&#x27;s worth the money. Trust me.</li>
            <li> i use the palette on nights when im contouring and putting some serious effort into my appearance. i like the matte finish</li>
            <li> Love the palette it is awesome will buy again. It was exactly what I was looking for. Plus more thanks</li>
            <li> it is very good for the price, the color are very pigmented, great for highlighting and contouring, it is a  good buy.</li>
            <li> I have used Coastal Scents for years. All of their products are quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Of course because they are so inexpensive they aren&#x27;t as good as the top name brands such as MAC or Sephora, but I have used their eye shadows and contour pallets for years and been satisfied. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any better make-up at comparable or cheaper pricing.</li>
            <li> I love this pallete! I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. A little too chalky for my liking but I still use the colours and don&#x27;t mind them.&lt;br /&gt;The dark brown is really hard to blend so be careful not to apply too much by accident while contouring.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good deal for the price...but I don&#x27;t think that I would buy again if I had the choice.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy this again, I use this everyday. I love all the products I&#x27;ve purchased from coastal scents brand</li>
            <li> Opened box excited for my purchase and found one blush broken up and all over the rest of the colors !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad experience :/</li>
            <li> I love this product , especially the blush and the dark brown contouring powder.makes my face slim and tanned .beautiful product</li>
            <li> great product! great price! and a super fast shipping. I was very satisfied with everything! I was amazed with how well the color came out :)</li>
            <li> all the color look great when i applay them on my almond color skin, its so good i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this some days ago.. and i have to say that it arrived earlier than i have expected.&lt;br /&gt;This coastal scents is VERY GOOD ! It is highly pigmented so a little application would be good enough. I didn&#x27;t have to use so many powder because this palette covers it all !&lt;br /&gt;The colors (circles) are Big so i think it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;The make-up also stay quite long...&lt;br /&gt;I think light-skinned people should buy another color ofcourse..Because that dark tone wouldn&#x27;t be to much use.&lt;br /&gt;I am brown/dark-skinned so it fits me perfectly.. I would recommend it to other dark-skinned people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it so i would totally buy again..</li>
            <li> quick service great colors</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the size of this compact.  I expected a compact size similer to Mally&#x27;sshimmer, shape and glow. This is huge.  The powders go on soft and the colors are wonderful.  This is a real bargin.</li>
            <li> I was quite excited about this product but when I received it, it was all damaged. I didn&#x27;t even open the bubble wrap and I could see all the bright pink color of one of the blush from inside the palette all over the box. I had to return the product. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the product. As a make-up artist who is building her kit I have to say this is a very good addition. The shades are great for contouring and highlighting without shimmer. I think this is very important and gives you alot of control. My one issue is the white seems to come off chalky. Other than that I Like the product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a fluke but the palette I received had different colors than what was pictured which was really disappointing :(</li>
            <li> I was looking for a contour palette so that I can do my own wedding make up. THIS PALETTE IS AMAZING AND SUCH A GREAT PRICE!! It looks natural and not cakey/flakey at all. Recommend this Palette to people trying contouring for the first time.</li>
            <li> Use this every day. It lasts forever. It&#x27;s all about how you make it work for you. Good buy</li>
            <li> Love it I will be purchasing this profuct.❤👍❤👍</li>
            <li> Love this blush pallet.  This pallet is a nice size.  You will definitely like it......I certainly do.  Colors indicated are really  what you see.</li>
            <li> its not mach with my dry skin!! I&#x27;de rather the creamy than this</li>
            <li> This is kind of a sucky blush palette. If you want some great blushes with a lot of pigment go to makeupmania and purchase the la femme pods for about $3 each. Much better buy.</li>
            <li> This is not the greatest product out there but also not a bad product at all specially for the price.  You must know a little bit of contouring in order to use this.  It is powdery as people describe and can last you all day if you use a primer underneath and sealing spray or finishing powder.  I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend for people with very fair skin unless you know make up and how to use it.</li>
            <li> it was broken, and i was very upset about it. i didnt even get to use it!!! i was really looking forward to using this and adding it to my kit</li>
            <li> It is not Original product ! the pallet in not really good for contouring ..i have cryollaen creamy contour , It is better than this one ! But I heard about this is very good and easy to contour so I try it .. The brown color is too dark &amp;#62;~&amp;#60; Although it is themost important color for contouring ! :(</li>
            <li> All of these are very pigmented, which I don&#x27;t mind. Just use a light hand when applying and blend, blend, blend! I&#x27;ve been able to use all of the shades so far to achieve a more contoured look. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great palette, beautiful colors and good quality.Useful to do the highlight or just for blush too. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to try contouring without paying about $45 for a kit. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it is great. After I got used to contouring, this set is great and I use it everyday. I am very fair skinned and have red hair, and it works great for my skin tone. Just use a VERY light hand. This is very pigmented. Great value!</li>
            <li> Love this palette and I use it everyday for on camera news. These shades are not super pigmented and completely matte which is what I was looking for. I use the contour shade the most but when i have too much application of either blush or contour the flesh tone helps to blend it out and tone it down.</li>
            <li> Blush is ok however I don&#x27;t care for the bronzer because it gives a choppy not smooth application for contouring. Too dark for me to bronzer with and I have Asian skin tone. Plus it breaks me out. I have aged skin as well so maybe on younger, smoother skin this might be ok. The highlighting colors seem to be ok but again I have breakouts by the end of the day. I have oily, acne proned skin so maybe that could be why this product doesn&#x27;t work well with my skin. The blushes pigmented so light dusting would be recommended if trying this product. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> After seeing many youtube reviews, I have decided to order this palette and I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I use white and brown ones for contouring and the two blushers. The other 2 shades do not really suit my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I usually first apply under eye corrector and light base foundation (I have European fair skin and blond hair) and then do the contouring with Coastal Scents white and brown shades, blending it all and finishing with a natural looking face powder and Coastal Scents blusher.&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice product and I find the cold dark brown shade very nice for contouring. Previously I was working with bronzers but most of them have a warm undertone and the effect is not as nice as with the Coastal Scents.&lt;br /&gt;Surely a product to try, well priced and quickly delivered.</li>
            <li> Buy from the website. The product I got was a blatant fake- two of the palettes were the same colour, the colour was unnatural, it hardly applied at all, the the case was completely blank (there should be a Costal Scents logo)</li>
            <li> This Coastal Scents Contour &amp; Blush Palette is a really good value.  Heard about it on YouTube.  Purchased this along with the CS 88 Eyeshadow Palette (matte).  Been using this daily for the past couple of months, and no complaints!  Colors are nicely pigmented...you have everything you need: a bronzer (which should work on any skin tone), blushes, &amp; highlighter. You get a lot of product for the money, and the case is convenient for travelling.  Love the colors &amp; texture.  Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I loved the product the second I tried it. the palette came perfectly packed and the delivery was fast. overall I am very happy with my purchase. It definitely wont be the last time I purchase from coastal scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this set, 4 stars only because I have no need for the pinks.</li>
            <li> This palette is so big that&#x27;s gonna last me forever. The colors are perfect and you can build them up according to your style. The highlighter is perfect for oily skin because is matte. You have a very complete blush/contour/highlighter matte palette that I could dare to say you won&#x27;t need any other blush/bronzer/highlighter (but we know that makeup is never enough right?). The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because it really is BIG, so it might be a little difficult to take in a trip or on the go with you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium-toned Indian girl who likes to contour her nose; this palette is perfect for contouring darkish skin. The blush tones are great: one is pinkish and one is reddish, but both are bold, dark colors. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the light powders (the pure white, the peachy-pink, and the yellow) but they work well as setting powders. These powders don&#x27;t mattify, but they do seal in makeup rather well.    The best part of this palette is the brown shade. It&#x27;s the perfect brown with grey undertones (rather than pink or blue) that works well for contouring. This is because shadows are greyish, not pink or blue. I use this palette every day.    The only downsides to this palette is that it seems extremely fragile: mine arrived broken, with the powders shattered and mixed up. I had to waste a lot of powder in cleaning it up so I could use it. It&#x27;s also rather large: too large to carry around. I put some of the broken brown powder into a small case that I carry in my travel makeup bag, but if yours arrives intact I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to port this powder with you.    Overall, a good purchase. A tad expensive, but I can tolerate this price because it seems that this will last me a very long time. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than three months now, and it looks exactly the same as when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love, I dont like to wear foundation, so this combination powder set makes my skin look natural and bright, I would recommend for anyone who loves to add a little color to their face!</li>
            <li> I love this , this is the best kit ever it&#x27;s not only help full for contouring but for eye shadows as well :)</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy to apply, with a dry brush or a wet sponge. It cover great and defines the contour.</li>
            <li> I like and use this product more than I ever thought I would.  The contents and chemistry of the product are gentle on sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM CAME BROKEN AFTER WAITING NEARLY A MONTH BUT THATS NOT THE WORST--- IT IS NOT EVEN COASTAL SCENTS--- ITS A KNOCK OFF!!!!!!!!!! A NOTHING BRAND FROM CHINA!! -------DO NOT BUY-------!!</li>
            <li> Love this pallet! I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I bought this to learn how to contour and it is perfect! Colors blend very well and it is a great price! The palette is very large, this will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> This was a gift to a budding young make-up artist.  Evidently Coastal Scents is a great brand.  This palette has some lovely colors.</li>
            <li> I like the product, the only thing I didn&#x27;t realized how big the box was.  I still like it and I would recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really big!There is so much product in them. it fits perfectly in my makeup case. totally recommend for anyone who does a lot of makeup!</li>
            <li> This pallet is huge!&lt;br /&gt;I went online on YouTube to see how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically used for contouring&lt;br /&gt;And you can use some of the contour colors for eyeshadow and then there is blush and concealer&lt;br /&gt;Amazing value</li>
            <li> i mainly use the brown for contouring. the white doesn&#x27;t really show up for highlighting. the bluses are really good and last all day. you can use any of these colors for eye shadows as well. i just think it&#x27;s a pretty good price considering the size of the palette. they&#x27;re big circles and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I first started playing around with makeup years ago and didn&#x27;t even know it was still in existence. The packaging is frail, you need a gentle hand because the pans are so big that any impact cracks them easily!  However this aside, they are too chalky to blend if you had all day to sit there and blend! Not worth the money. Try It Cosmetics&#x27;s My Sculpted Face, it&#x27;s not only the perfect formula but they include tutorials on how to change your face with highlighting and shadow contouring.</li>
            <li> What a powdered mess. One of the blushes was broken and all over the case that it came in. How disappointing</li>
            <li> This is really the first highlight/contour set I have owned so I do not have a previous set to compare it t</li>
            <li> My problem with this product was there are no instructions on how to contour your face with the palette.  I tried different things but it just did not work out for me.  Instructions would make all the difference in this product.</li>
            <li> The colors went on patchy .</li>
            <li> The colors are to pasty and makes the shading look like kids play makeup. I am not happy with this product at all. Very cheap quality waste of money</li>
            <li> This collection is very useful colors and made my girlfriend very happy when she opened it up and was looking at it.  Seems to be good quality as well.</li>
            <li> Works very well for contouring. I love it . It was everything I expected and i relieved it very fast</li>
            <li> Will be buying another Contour and Blush Palette!! It&#x27;s great for the price and great for beginners. The product does get a little powdery when you start to pick it up on your brush, but nothing a shake-off and a good blend wouldn&#x27;t fix. The three blushes are all beautiful colors and really well pigmented!!</li>
            <li> No me gusto en absoluto a un que llego a tiempo</li>
            <li> I have used this forever. The highlighter isn&#x27;t amazing. Fades significantly almost immediately. But the Blushes are very pigmented and the light and dark contours make the perfect shade. Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a birthday present for my boss and it was much bigger than any of us expected. It was a nice surprise and worth the money. It looks really nice too.</li>
            <li> This palette would be great for a beginner in contouring and highlighting! It has the basic shades; bronzers and blushes that one needs to achieve that look. Matched with the right brushes you can have a face that&#x27;s on point. More things I love about this palette is that you can build on it for a damatic night look or go subtle for daytime because they are pigmented. And the shades themselve are big, matte, and can last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I have light-medium skin. My skin is not sensitive so it did not break me out with acne. I&#x27;d advise people who are interested in this product to review the ingredients before buying.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! every single colour is nice, and can be used for many things</li>
            <li> I usually like costal scents but I did not like this contour palette at all and the blush colors are horrible. The white powder is a joke. It&#x27;s like putting chalk on your face and the light peach color makes your face look ridiculously cakey and the contour color is the only thing I can can use in this pallet but i don&#x27;t because of the ingredients used in the pallet. I&#x27;ve purchased my anastasia contour pallet and I&#x27;m much happier. This pallet earned a new home in my garbage can.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, the quality is awesome. I love the contour shade although it is very dark. I found out that I had no use for some of the colors, but this is the way for most palettes anyway. The blush is matt which is my favorite. But I received the package damaged; three of the palette are crushed. The seller only wrapped the package in bubble wrap and it came to me damaged. I contacted the seller but they did not respond. This is why I am giving this a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am changing my rating because customer service offered a free replacement on second contact.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette. The colors are really pigmented and blend pretty well.</li>
            <li> This was a starter for me to attempt contouring. The 2 blushes on the right are a little two strong for me and I think that I am going to try contouring with a creme blend over a powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - Price and great starter kit&lt;br /&gt;Con - Large and not very travel friendly, blush colors are too strong, no mirror</li>
            <li> im glad i ordered this product. for the first time, i own a blush that i love using and also the contour powder is great. the makeup pigments well and overall i would recommend this. prompt delivery too. :)</li>
            <li> shipping was on time and fast and the product is..AMAZING. i use it everyday and i cant live without it. the blushes are fabulous but i LOVE the brown for contouring. best product ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect contour color, two awesome universal blushes, a great highlighting color, and warm and cool toned powders which i&#x27;m not clear as to how I&#x27;m supposed to use them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color payoff, great texture (not a cheap, chalky texture... a nice, velvety texture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, all of these six colors are extremely matte. Not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing, but if you&#x27;re looking for a luminous highlighter shade (which I usually use), look elsewhere for that. It&#x27;s still worth buying even with that.</li>
            <li> Loved this set! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Blush is very big and lovely colors, how deep I don&#x27;t know.....delievered on time and the product looks good.</li>
            <li> colors work for all skin tones and types. great value. the color disks are huge!! used it last night and got really good results!</li>
            <li> After not receiving it the first time.. they quickly resolved my issue and sent me another one glad I got this I love it.. first time contouring and it work beautifully..</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and the variety. Good value for money</li>
            <li> the only thing with this the darkest shade came mash up but other than that i love it but i still useing it</li>
            <li> to girls who like natural shades they are perfect..you can use it as a blush and to conture your face which is valuable</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers have mentioned this, but this palette is HUGE, especially for the price. It measures about a foot across and is going to last me years. The colors are great and easily blendable. I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of rave reviews about the affordability and quality of Coastal Scents products from makeup artists, and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> great value and nice starter set for a makeup artist!</li>
            <li> Ughhh, I&#x27;d rather not comment because you have to see for yourself, but so your not stuck like i am then read on;  The product is so chalky, so powdery and it irritated my skin  The brown for contouring is too dark, you have to seriously use a little.  For the people that commented that they loved it and couldn&#x27;t see how they went without it, I assume they are use to cheap products because for light skinned people this stuff sucks!  IT SMELLS SOOOOOO BAD!!!!!!!!! Seriously, IT SMELLS BAD!  The cheek colors are probably the only ones I use, sometimes, they are ok and the colors look nice for going out at night.  The white powder, that supposedly is for highlighting,... SUCK SO BAD, I&#x27;m so angry!!! If you put on cover up that white stuff makes your face look chalky!!!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, make sure you are getting an original, the one I got wasn&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about it coming with a brush mine had none. Such a waist of my hard earned money,.. never again!</li>
            <li> This is truly a staple for the makeup enthusiast. I use this for stage makeup and contouring and I can&#x27;t live without it. The colors are all very pigmented and last FOREVER! I&#x27;ve had this palette for years and still have not made a dent in any of the pots. The only thing is that you MUST be careful not to drop it or bang it around because the pressed powder will explode (duh). It is easily repaired though with alcohol (there are some instructional videos floating around youtube). The pans are very large (about the size of a normal pressed powder compact). I wouldn&#x27;t wear this stuff everyday because it does mask your face up which is really bad for your skin (especially if acne prone). Hence I only wear it for shows or for several hours and then take care to wash ALL of it off.</li>
            <li> Love the bronzer and the blush! Not crazy about the &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; powder, but it may suit some people who have fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> I have recently become obsessed with makeup and trying new looks. I absolutely love the blushes in this palette. They last all day and blend very well. I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am just starting out in the make up thing, so when I was trying these colors, none of them really worked for me. kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Coastal Scents products are always a great value!  I had broken one of the compressed powders (the one I use most, of course).  I immediately ordered a replacement. Two different gal pals asked for the remaining five unbroken compacts in the palette...yes, their products are THAT good!</li>
            <li> Shades were not as reflected on Amazon. The actual shades were bright and loud.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is great and the price is great compared to other similar products.  I use this product everyday and am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Great product. The pallette is bigger than I exprcted. the colors are exact. A little goes a long way. overall good company , good product and blink of an eye delivery! lol no joke. I got an email maybe 4hours after my purchase to say my product has shipped. I guess I ordered at the right time.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, I was a bit confused but now a few weeks in, I have been able to understand&lt;br /&gt;how to use this product properly. They give you an amazing amount to last you a long time. The reason&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a five star is because I believe both blush colors are too similar and they could have given you another color as&lt;br /&gt;oppose to staying with the same pink hue. Its a great product because it does not crease .</li>
            <li> I love this brand ! but i wasn&#x27;t as in love with this palette as i thought i would be.</li>
            <li> Very good product, great pigmentation, quality, I really like the result to apply not that great, I would buy again, responsible vendor.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I&#x27;m a medium skin tone and the color pay off is great for me and you get so much product for the price. Would definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> High pigment,  really hard to blend :( seller was quick, but I did not like the makeup.</li>
            <li> I would tell comment on the quality of the product if I had even opened it to try it. However upon arrival I immediately questioned the authenticity of this product. This is NOT a coastal scents product. No where on the product or packaging is it labeled &amp;#34;coastal scents.&amp;#34; I have personally shopped with coastal scents several times and the products are ALWAYS labeled as being one of their own. Even if you go to the official website and view the contour and blush palette you can see that this product is clearly a knock off because it is not the same package or container that anyone writing a review has OR that the website itself has posted images of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary of product. I am going to send back for a refund before i even touch this. IT IS FALSELY ADVERTISED!</li>
            <li> On the days I do decide to go a little heavy, it does the trick</li>
            <li> I love this contour palette. ONLY THING. It contains talc which breaks a lot of people out. I MAYBE wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it if I read the ingredients first. But the size, price, &amp; variety of colors is hard to say no to. I love this palette. I mix a few colors on my brush to create just the right mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind: the white powder is not a highlight. It&#x27;s a translucent powder, which can set your makeup &amp; mattify your lipsticks. However, it does make a good brow highlight.</li>
            <li> I use to love the bh cosmetics palette and when I went to order another one... the price went up. i thought this palette was going to be exactly the same as the other. When I opened the palettte I was disappointed because  the brown was much lighter than the bh brown and the blushes were more orange. That ended up being exactly what I needed because i used to half to buff out the brown so much to make it look natural and sometimes I would look like I was had ran a mile  because the pink was too pink. The orange actually brings out my yellow undertones. My skin is only a few shades lighter than the brown in this. (I wear honey beige in maybelline)</li>
            <li> I have had my eye on this for a while, and was ecstatic that I could get free shipping through amazon prime. When I received the box, I opened it and the bronzer had broken and spilled everywhere. Because it was pressed makeup, I assumed it may crack (which can be fixed) but it had broken into so many pieces that I had already lost it all over the box/floor. I was very disappointed. However, it was wrapped in a lot of bubble wrap so I assume it was packaged well and was just treated badly during shipping. I am returning the item and I&#x27;ll be ordering directly from the costal scents website instead; hopefully, they&#x27;ll treat it better.</li>
            <li> love this palette I am very fair so the colors are great. If you were darker complexion it would not work as the color is not highly pigmented  I use it everyday now  inespecially like the fact that the colors are matte and no shimmer which on women in their 40s can be a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I was a little worried that I would receive the merchandise in pieces. Thankfully, that did not happen! The packaging was great and it arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately eager to try on the blushes, and they are beyond amazing! The colors have great pigment. I am fairly light and was looking for a product that would allow me to do conturing using a powder consistency  instead of foundation. I found that this is exactly what i was looking for. For the price, I couldn&#x27;t have chosen anything better! Great product.</li>
            <li> so I was going back and forth between this palette and another coastal scents palette with 12 colors.  I&#x27;m glad i went with this one! The consistency is smooth.  The colors go on well and are easy to blend.  I use the top left and top middle color to highlight, obvisouly the bottom middle to contour, and both colors on the right are blush (my preference is the bottom right).  I checked youtube for tutorials to see how other women used this palette as well.  It is def a great deal price wise since the product is pretty big and you dont have to use that much product to get the results you&#x27;re looking for.  Shipping was fast of course since I use prime (best thing about shopping on amazon! If you havent signed up for prime you should because it&#x27;s def worth it) I would def recommend!</li>
            <li> Though I am impressed by the palette size and the quality of the supplied pigments, they are not the colours depicted in the product images. I chose this specifically because of the shades I saw after looking at many other options, but I did not get what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Huge pigments. Love it.</li>
            <li> Not high quality makeup but it was worth the price I paid and serves it&#x27;s purpose. I do like it but it can be a little difficult to blend and look natural.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! IT&#x27;S FAKE! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!! THIS IS NOT A COASTAL SCENT PALETTE, EXTREMELY  DISSAPOINTED. I WANT EITHER THE CORRECT ITEM (Which I highly doubt they have coming from china)  FOR WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING OR MY MONEY BACK TO BUY THE CORRECT ONE FROM THE COASTALSCENTS WEBSITE WHAT  I SHOULD OF DONE IN THE 1ST PLACE.</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for. I thought this pallette was going to be creamy and it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s powder &amp; you can&#x27;t even tell you have it on. The blush on the other hand is ok.</li>
            <li> Its more than good , thanke you .. I love it</li>
            <li> I like the blushes and light contour but their somewhat chalky,  the dark contour seems even more chalky and doesn&#x27;t brush on well.. it also isn&#x27;t consistent.. it brushes on rather streaky.  Maybe a got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> These are grainy but fairly heavily pigmented. Great starter kit!</li>
            <li> Plenty of product and value for money. Seems chalky. Slightly irritating to my skin though. It may be the fragrance</li>
            <li> Loved using it. Best contours out there if you&#x27;re incredibly pale like I am.&lt;br /&gt;However,&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of owning it I opened it up one day to discover that the lighter bronzer (the one I use) had &#x27;exploded&#x27; inside the palette and proceeded to get all over my bathroom. I had a similar experience with one of their eyeshadow palettes.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how or why this happened???</li>
            <li> The colors are great but the quality of the product is bad every time I try to use them they fall apart. Other than that the colors are gorgeous . The white does not work to highlight.</li>
            <li> Great palette, especially for the price. The bronzer is extremely dark but you can mix with the lighter colors for your desired shade. This is why this palette is so useful, any color skin could use it just by mixing colors. Very pigmented-so much that I think it would even be great for extremely dark skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with low expectations because its price but boy what an amazing surprise! Im very happy with the results!!,,,</li>
            <li> perfect, the pigmentation is very good for the price</li>
            <li> Very amazing and high quality! Shipped very fast and was not damaged! Powders are buttery and blend beautifully</li>
            <li> Very chalky and powdery, was not happy or impressed with it, I think this pallet is best used for teens starting out with make-up or want to play around with make-up styles and practice techniques. Sorry but did not like at all.</li>
            <li> It works great and a little goes a long way. All of the colors blend together well on me. This is a good contouring palette. I would definite recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Crapy pigments, ashy appearance. Definetly won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again. Would not recommend this product for experienced makeup artists.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this contour kit. The size if perfect and the colors are the perfect variety. A must have for any make up kit.</li>
            <li> I received this palettes broken and durty.&lt;br /&gt;Its looks like expired, broken and durty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to know who is responsible for this, because I never seem this before.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to have a selection as I have recently started hosting a youtube cooking show.  I am enjoying the quality and variety in one convenient location.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a contour palette that had no shimmer, this seemed to be the best choice out of the few ones available.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the shipping was great, not only I received it at my US address  one day before it was estimated.. It was also in perfect condition when I received it 3 days later ( am from UAE and use shop and ship). This was my biggest concern.. But thankfully it was packaged carefully and was well protected through the shipping presses.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the palette today and I love it so far! They are very light on the skin, and you only need a small amount of the product on your brush :)&lt;br /&gt;The size of each shade is huge! I can see it would last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s only the matter of learning how to contour, and getting to know my face (?) ;)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing an off brand, but I love it! It doesn&#x27;t break me out (I have acne/prone skin) Great colors to match my yellow undertones!</li>
            <li> Just arrived today, when I opened the box noticed that there was powder everywhere, opened it all the way and one of the colors was pretty much powder. Other than that it&#x27;s fine, looks like it does in the photo, thinking about exchanging for another one, was really excited about this.</li>
            <li> This is so cute!!! Loved everything about it! Would buy again and recommend it to everyone! I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> This product is very good for the price.  It&#x27;s VERY inexpensive and does a decent job.  It&#x27;s not superfine milled, and silky like a department store brand, but it&#x27;s definately OK and suits it&#x27;s purpose.  I have sensitive skin that is acne prone, and I have not experienced an increase in my breakouts.  I use this lightly, after applying my foundation and powder.  When I have the time to sit down and properly apply my make-up I must have this contour palette.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect product for contouring my chubby face. I have tried everything. I finally broke down and got this item and i was very pleased. It is has very natural matte colors. I would also warn any one who uses it that a little goes a long way on this pallet. It can be very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;^.^</li>
            <li> The pans are huge, and the colors highly pigmented but easy to wear and layer. I&#x27;ve tried the colors on myself (very fair) and 2 friends, one Hispanic, one African-American. You can combine and build the products and it will work on anyone. The powder isn&#x27;t anything special but works to tone down color that is too bright. The bronzer is fantastic, looks good on me and I am extremely pale (NC15 Mac). The highlighter is great because it isn&#x27;t glittery. I can&#x27;t imagine getting a better blush/contour palette than this one for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I purchased this from Amazon, and the first palette delivered was broken. I notified them and had immediate communication regarding a replacement, which they shipped the next day. My new palette arrived to my overseas address in 5 days! Incredible. And as a bonus, I received an email stating I didn&#x27;t need to return the original broken item. Very fast, professional service.A+++++++++</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying i was skeptical about product cause it was so cheap but i was wrong... its greatand awesome for many things such as lip gloss if used with vaseline, blush, contouring of the face, and even eyeshadow.... So in conclusion, I LOVE IT!!! ready to order more Coastal Scents products.....</li>
            <li> This product is useless to me.. I tried it and it extremely powdery,  zero pigmentation.. I cannot use this.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, my daughter is using it every morning.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Coastal Scents palette because it was cheaper than the Sedona Lace palette. I loved almost everything about this palette. The colors are highly pigmented and show up beautifully on my dark, Indian skin. It also blends really well so it looks good on top of any foundation. It also did not make me break out. The only problem I had with is that, I have oily skin so whether I used this palette just on top of my natural skin or on top of foundation, my T zone looked extremely greasy after a few minutes. I think I need to invest in a mattifying face primer. But other than that, I would still use this product after I find a way to control my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Coastal Scents for a while now. I have very sensitive skin and this product is very nice. Great colors and very good contour.</li>
            <li> Good makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Useful. Prefer creme for contour.&lt;br /&gt;But love this pallet</li>
            <li> I love this basic makeup!</li>
            <li> So far, I really like the palette. I&#x27;ve inly used the white and brown color so far to contour abd it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Excellent palette if you like a powder blush or contour. Easy to mix shades. Keep in mind it&#x27;s a BIG palette so you may not want to travel with it.</li>
            <li> The reason for the three stars is that this palette breaks my skin out pretty badly. The colors are nice and work well for contouring, my skin just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I figured I was taking a risk with this palette because it was cheaper than I thought it should be. But I really love it. The colors blend very well and it is much bigger than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;When I used this palette along with a primer and finishing spray, the foundation lasts all day, and even at night if I don&#x27;t wash my face really well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan and will likely buy again.</li>
            <li> Coastal Scents is another one of my brands. I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and is absolutely in love with it. I can contour, blush and highlight all in the same palette!!</li>
            <li> great palet the only ting when i opened it alot of it was broken .</li>
            <li> Reminds me of play makeup when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Very nice, and LOTS of it too. Pigment is nice.</li>
            <li> Almost the only powder face(and even eye) makeup you will ever need. The colors look scary intense when you first open it, but they all blend beautifully together and you can make all the colors you need. Watch a tutorial on YouTube if you&#x27;re new to the product. You&#x27;ll see how it is intended to be used and once you do, it takes very little practice to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;They are pigmented but blend down to be subtle. And you can&#x27;t beat the value...the amount of product you get is amazing.</li>
            <li> I received the item in perfect condition and in a short period of time. The brown is very dark but it works out well if you blend it correctly.</li>
            <li> Great quality and size. Symply love it and will definitely keep restocking on this product! :D</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer: I purchased this on a separate account so it doesn&#x27;t say that I purchased this)&lt;br /&gt;I love this! My very first BH Cosmetics purchase, and I&#x27;m so pleased (: It came a day before estimated, which is so awesome. The pans are SO huge! You&#x27;ll never run out, even if you use a heavy amount everyday. That being said, it takes some practice because the colors and insanely pigmented, so use a light hand when applying. All the colors are bright and blend so easy!! I&#x27;m so so happy with this, and will be using it daily. (:</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this palette but I am so happy I got it. The dark brown is really dark so start out lightly if you have fair/olive skin you can always add more. I love how natural this looks and the white makes a gorgeous high light. I was able to return a pricey mac highlight/contour kit.</li>
            <li> It is GREAAATT for contouring !</li>
            <li> Hi, I not usually write reviews but with this product I have to. The product itself is amazing, is way bigger than I expected. The colors are perfect for highlight and contour and the price was really good. I got my package in two days, even though the box was undamaged the first palette that I got was broken. I place an exchange order, I mailed back my broken palette  and in another two days I got a brand new palette with no extra cost. AMAZING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can wait to order more products from this guys :D</li>
            <li> the way i came to own this product is a little funny, my finger slipped. i know that sounds silly but honestly i didn&#x27;t mean to push the button that said \\&quot;buy now\\&quot; it was a total accident. i had seen a popular beauty blogger review this product so i was just checking it out with no real intention to buy, however, its one of the best accidents i ever made because i LOVE this pallet. It highlights my skin so beautifully and the peachy blush shade looks phenomenal on my pale skin. Too much of the dark contour shade can be a BIG mistake that&#x27;s tricky to fix without having to start over with a clean face so i always use it sparingly and apply with using a light dusting motion rather than buffering it into my skin like i do the blush. Great product to give dimension to my pale skin.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered to me in pieces! So pissed off that this is the gift I was supposed to give to a loved one on Valentine&#x27;s Day! Dark powder was all over the place! Pieces of powder on our clothes,hands, and rug! How sad that she looked forward to this!!! Shame on you!</li>
            <li> This product arrived within 24 hours of ordering it. It was packaged extremely well and survived shipping with no issues.  The tray is beautiful and is of great quality.  I will definitely re-order this product when I am ready for another.  The colors are great, although a little different than they appear on the computer screen.  Basically the lightest color is white and the contrast between the 2 med shades is greater than it appears in the photo.  This makes it even more valuable to me because I was really only planning on using the darkest and lightest shades and one of the blushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value! Enjoy, I know I will!</li>
            <li> love it, still learning on how to contour and highlight, but i am very pleased with this product, i do recomend it. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit afraid when i bought these colors.&lt;br /&gt;But i most say that i really like the colors. Really good pigmenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have 1 bad thing to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;They smell weird. They smell like painting, and that kinda worries me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i still use it every day.</li>
            <li> I like it my second order from the same order is in the way&lt;br /&gt;My daughet took the first box</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and item was received as pictured.</li>
            <li> I have always been leary of ordering make-up online.  But I am very pleased with this line of make-up...I will order this line again...</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do - it&#x27;s great for contouring. I love the size of it (it&#x27;s rather large actually, so be prepared) and the colors are FANTASTIC with my skin tone (I&#x27;m very fair), but the makeup itself seems a *little* cheap. I&#x27;m not complaining, just letting others know. I would definitely buy this again for the value, size, color tones, and the longevity.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I wanted to try my hand at contouring so I figured this would be a good place to start.  I didn&#x27;t expect the colors to be as great as they were but for me, they did go on very pigmented but unfortunately didn&#x27;t stay on too long.  While all of this isn&#x27;t too bad and pretty acceptable, all things considered, the big downfall was how badly it broke out my skin.  I am acne prone (cystic, no less), but I have it under control and it isn&#x27;t too easily irritated.  I didn&#x27;t go at my skin super heavy with this since I am new to contouring.  I tried the dark brown and thought nothing of it hitting my main problem area (which hasn&#x27;t bothered me in a while).  I did it for a few days, getting the hang of this technique and started noticing the bumps :(  Since nothing else has been different for me, I can&#x27;t attribute it to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still use this LIGHTLY around my face, mostly the white as a highlighter but around my eyes and brows.  I&#x27;m pretty afraid to try the rest in heavy doses.  I do have an event coming up so maybe a few trial runs with it and maybe for the actual day...but nothing too serious or often ever again.  Hate to let this go to waste even though it was inexpensive, it was a decent enough palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped fast &amp; I was also afraid of it arriving broken but alas, it did not!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.. not very excited</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving two stars because I&#x27;m not getting much color payoff from these. All of them swatched terribly for me except for the brown and bottom right pink. Both of those show up on my fair skin quite dramatically but none of the others did. Maybe I got a bad batch? I love Coastal Scents and have faith in their products, hence my chalking it up to a bad palette.</li>
            <li> Jumbo pallet. Nice colors.  Super love love love!! I can&#x27;t believe how huge each pot is. Highly pigmented . all of them are matte. I&#x27;m pretty happy!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible... The colors don&#x27;t even look like in real life... It&#x27;s shipped from China.... It&#x27;s not even real... Hate it.... The worst shop.... Never buying make up in amazon</li>
            <li> It has a fish smell? Stunk up my brushes.. Not sure if I&#x27;m the only one it happened too other than at it works pretty good</li>
            <li> This palette is nice and big but I wish I would have gone with a blush palette instead. I really don&#x27;t contour that much.  I really only use the two pinkish blushes so it seems kind of wasteful.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product all around! It is incredible the amount of product you get with this palette! You can do anything from highlighting/contouring to evening or everyday looks with this one palette! This is such a bargain I have recommended this item to family/friends and cannot say enough about it. The colors are gorgeous, super blendable and look great on any skin tone. The palettes are huge and I can&#x27;t imagine I will have to be ordering more anytime soon. It was very well packaged and I am looking forward to trying more products from this company!</li>
            <li> Opened box excited for my purchase and found one blush broken up and all over the rest of the colors. Not worth my time to return but upset that this happened</li>
            <li> ...it&#x27;s not something I would recommend for people with dry skin or for people who don&#x27;t know much about makeup. It appears chalky even if you decide to apply it on top of foundation or BEFORE applying foundation. Make sure you know how to contour before buying this product because otherwise, it&#x27;s not really worth it. Only the brown and white colors are actually useful. As for the comments about it being too light or too dark, I think the pigmentation is actually perfect. The white one does not appear as white as it does and don&#x27;t fear the brown. With blending skills, the brown has great pigmentation and will look totally natural. You just gotta know how to use it. The packaging, I had no problem with. It does have a fishy smell when you first put it on, but it does fade throughout the day so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a contour palette for oily skin, give this a try. If you have dry skin, go for the coastal scents camoflauge concealer palette.</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the colors were as displayed in the picture on the website. i also like the wide variety of colors this palette provides. i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time....love the variety of contouring colors.....will last a long time.  Would buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> on time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;i really like it !</li>
            <li> i ordered this along with a concealer palette and i absolutely love this product...... its worth ever penny the colors are the same as in the picture and this is a great buy for those women out there trying to find a good product to contour there face</li>
            <li> Great value for such an in-demand product! Colors are very pigmented, so the highlight is extremely white on skin and contour color is very dark. Apply with a light hand.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! The blush colors are nice but don&#x27;t have the staying power I was expecting. The highlight color is pretty much useless for me and I have fair skin. It doesn&#x27;t show up on the skin. The contour color is very dark.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered something like this online before, but decided among reading other reviews that it seemed worth it.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I was actually afraid that the very dark color would not work at all for me and probably a waste of money on a color I probably would not use.  The same feeling with the very light color as well.  I was wrong!  After putting on my foundation and just a little powder to &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; my look. I dare tried the darkest color for contouring just to see.  I was amazed at just a hint of it on the brush how it changed the shape of my face.  I have a round face with long hair and I wanted to make it look less round.  I brushed the dark color just under my cheek bone up to my ear and blended it softly.  It looked great.  Then I put it just above my temples and under my chin/jaw line. Blending is key.  My face looked thinner &amp; more of an oval shape.  I then tried the light color above my cheeks to draw the attention up to my eye area and also put it on the bridge of my nose with a very thin brush.  It really highlighted the areas perfectly.  Then I used a hint of the medium blush color (bottom right) just on the ball of my cheek and used another face brush to blend and smooth all the areas so it doesn&#x27;t look so artificial and more soft natural makeup look.  It barely takes any powder on the brush at all, so this product will last a very long time.  I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with the other colors as well.  If you know how to high light &amp; contour for the shape of your face then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this palette, I use it everyday its amazing....!!! I use the white to help highlight my cheek bones and mix the low and high blush colors...works miracles!</li>
            <li> I am able to use the lighter colors for some highlighting but because I am a darker toned African American, the brown and the pinks really don&#x27;t show up on my skin tone.  This product is definitely NOT for darker toned individuals.</li>
            <li> Awsome for the price.</li>
            <li> All I can say is great great !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is ok but not quite what I expected. There are only two colours that I would use out of the set. The quality is average.</li>
            <li> Very large and seems to blend very well, will last a long time. The white is white, it is not a highlighting shimmer.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Coastal Scents cream concealer palette for contouring before I saw this item. The cream worked well but this palette is so much less time-consuming and cleaner to apply. I use four of the six colours on a regular basis. The powders are smooth and blend great, and the cakes are huge! Favourite recent beauty buy.</li>
            <li> Good. But I still dont know what the finallity of this one.</li>
            <li> came intact and in good time, colors are good and pigmented, pretty good quality for the price and this is great for beginners</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  So here is what I judge this product on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: the powders in this palette are an amazing quality.  They are pigmented very well without being so super saturated your afraid to dip your brush in, and they are silky soft and a dream to blend.  And they are 100% matte.  No shimmer at all, which to me is a good thing and hard to find especially in a highlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience:  I literally have half a dozen bronzer compacts, two or three highlight compacts plus a few liquid/cream highlights, and even more blush compacts.  And this takes the place of ALL of them (unless you want a shimmery effect, because these are all completely and utterly matte).  I put on foundation, set it with a setting powder, and then grab this palette.  End of story, it replaces three or four compacts for blush/bronzer/highlight, and in all seriousness, I could probably use a mixture of one or two of the lighter flesh-toned shades as a setting powder in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatility: I hate buying palettes most of the time because if you don&#x27;t like even one of the products in the palette, it seems wasteful to me.  But this palette is extraordinarily versatile because you can mix the shades.  For instance,the blush in the upper right hand corner is way to bright for me.  I can never imagine wearing that color even sheered out.  So, I dab my brush in the that blush, and then mix it with the light pinky shade in the lower left hand corner, and it instantly dilutes that pink down to a very wearable shade for my skin tone.  I can do the same with the white to get and even paler pink, or mix it with the upper middle for a peachier toned shade. I do the same with the bronzer (the dark brown shade)  I mix it with the shade above it to warm up my face overall, but use it straight to contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  When you think about it, buying six shades of blush/bronzer/highlight for under $20 is not going to happen, with a few exceptions.  I will say that coastal scents runs this on sale for $11 pretty frequently but the shipping is more pricey.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to contouring and highlighting, I wanted something the would make it easy and not end up looking fake or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;This set fit the bill!&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it a huge palette, but the colours are universally flattering (less for fair skin, more for darker).&lt;br /&gt;The brown contours and blends very nicely, and the light peach and white colours are my highlighters.&lt;br /&gt;The top-middle colour has slight yellow undertones, so I use that for dark circles (which I have in abundance) and it does okay.&lt;br /&gt;The blush colours are fresh and blend nicely.&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes applying these products, my pale face has a nice, natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very speedy with delivery. Much larger than expected. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> So, unlike other reviewer, my product arrived in perfect condition. The colors were vivid and the product blended ok on cream foundation. My complaints are; 1) this product made me breakout. I was certain it was this product because it was the only thing new that I was using, and upon discontinuing use, the breakouts have stopped. Additionally, the product did not stay on.  I felt the need to reapply throughout the day, however, it did not blend as well without a fresh coat of primer or foundation.  And, given the sheer size of this product (about 5&amp;#34; x 7&amp;#34;), it is not practical for traveling or keeping it with you for reapplication.  I would not recommend and I will not buy again. I have switched to Tarte&#x27;s contour kit which I have absolutely loved. It is about twice the price, but totally worth it since it has better ingredients.</li>
