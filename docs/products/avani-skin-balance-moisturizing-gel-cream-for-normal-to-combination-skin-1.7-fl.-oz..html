            <li>I finally got it and happy.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the Avani skinn care line.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing cream for my skin, I&#x27;ve tried many other skin products and this has been the only one that has worked, I truly recommend to woman who suffer from acne and oily skin, is the best and also affordable !!!!!</li>
            <li>Would recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this originally in 2011 at a booth in a Hawaiian market.</li>
            <li>The Gel is light and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t leave a residue which is super important to</li>
            <li>This is not one of those &amp;#34;fake moisturizers&amp;#34;, you know, the kind that are just basically containers of Alcohol and dry your skin even more than it was before you began using it.</li>
            <li>What was left is fine, nice and creamy, but has some fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyway back to this product: Its light, not heavy, its smooth and truly a gel, and it MOISTURIZES YOUR SKIN!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just really prefer to get jars that are actually full.</li>
            <li>First got into this product out in Hawaii,</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted and I have to say I haven&#x27;t had any problems ordering thru Amazon.com for anything that I wanted</li>
            <li>it does exactly what i needed it too</li>
            <li>Feels soft but my oily areas remain clean feeling.</li>
            <li>She really likes it that it doesn&#x27;t make her skin oily.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered it on Amazon because it was much cheaper, but I soon found out why.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect way to cleanse and feel pretty without an expensive facial or spa treatment.</li>
            <li>(very masculine) and feels very sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly highly recommend the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle scent, and the cream is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the better lines on the market - no animal testing and Dead Sea minerals.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin type, did not know it was for normal to oily skin when it was order.</li>
            <li>Although I really love some of Avani&#x27;s facial products (their facial peel is incredible), this moisturizer smells bad</li>
            <li>I use this product and love it, that being said, the product came open and only half full.</li>
            <li>Love the feel &amp; leaves me blemish free as I have tried so many other expensive cream &amp; don&#x27;t do what this one does...Love it!</li>
            <li>Love Avani Dead Sea products!</li>
            <li>And considering all the other better thing this product offers, I will buy this again and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>International vendors in a large area.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My face feels soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Love th Avani products as they put whatever is missing in my skin back in it!</li>
            <li>The one thing that is superior that the expensive one has is the scent.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this, so I ordered a second jar from a different seller.</li>
            <li>and ALL were one third or less full</li>
            <li>This jar appeared to be unopened, but was also only about half full.</li>
            <li>I ordered it once from a different seller, and the jar that arrived appeared to have been opened and was only half full, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I gave this one a try because it&#x27;s actually thicker and richier and definitely makes my skin feels silky &amp; smoother than the expensive one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not happy with the Avani moisture balanca face cream; first of all, the container was only half full when I opened it and second of all when the cream dries on your face it leaves white residue</li>
            <li>If you live in a dry climate or have TRULY DRY SKIN, then this is the moisturizer for you.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry to apply my mineral based foundation.</li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took over a month to get it to the West Coast of Canada and the tracking stoped after only few days of shipping and still in Israel.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I like how it feels</li>
            <li> Avani Dead Sea product line has beat all the big department store lines hand down, and for a lot less money though Amazon..</li>
            <li> I have an oily t zone and can not use a heavy moisturizer but need something for dry skin and aging.</li>
            <li> I realize I paid over half price</li>
            <li> Everyday Moisturizer-</li>
            <li> before pHisoderm changed the ingredients and ruined it as well-except this product is missing the Ester-C in it.</li>
            <li> While the texture of the cream seemed heavy to the touch</li>
            <li> Not overly heavy or greased feeling.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer that I&#x27;ve been using is also dead sea mineral product but it costs $169.00 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It takes the dead skin off making your face feel</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, seemed not full, maybe from the cold climate it settled???</li>
            <li> That crap is simply a container of skin drying alcohol/astringent-gel, like a gel form of Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to open the bottles.</li>
            <li> But this one doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> Example: {Cosmetic Skin Solutions</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible also.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> break out city! Rash, and zits. Avani is certainly not for sensitive skin. The smell is terrible also. Not for anyone with allergies.</li>
            <li> Love Avani Dead Sea products!</li>
            <li> Gel cream in the mornings,  the cream at night.  Wonders are felt.  First got into this product out in Hawaii, International vendors in a large area.  I had to find another product or the same on.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cream ever! Would recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this originally in 2011 at a booth in a Hawaiian market. Loved it then and still love it now. Makes my skin feel soft and luxurious. It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product nice cream&lt;br /&gt;Jocelyne</li>
            <li> I have bought this product at the mall and unfortunately paid ALOT MORE for it. But I will only buy it on amazon from now on. It is the best product at any price!</li>
            <li> Felt very nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not greasy and soaks in quickly. Great for under make up. Other products are excellent as well.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my mom who likes gel-type moisturizers. She really likes it that it doesn&#x27;t make her skin oily.</li>
            <li> Love th Avani products as they put whatever is missing in my skin back in it! Love the feel &amp; leaves me blemish free as I have tried so many other expensive cream &amp; don&#x27;t do what this one does...Love it!</li>

            <li> If you live in a dry climate or have TRULY DRY SKIN, then this is the moisturizer for you. This is not one of those &amp;#34;fake moisturizers&amp;#34;, you know, the kind that are just basically containers of Alcohol and dry your skin even more than it was before you began using it. Example: {Cosmetic Skin Solutions Best Day Moisturizing Cream}...That crap is simply a container of skin drying alcohol/astringent-gel, like a gel form of Sea Breeze. Anyway back to this product: Its light, not heavy, its smooth and truly a gel, and it MOISTURIZES YOUR SKIN!!! It reminds me of -pHisoderm pH2O Everyday Moisturizer-before pHisoderm changed the ingredients and ruined it as well-except this product is missing the Ester-C in it. Other than that I would definitely recommend this product for TRULY DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> The product is great, have used it for 4 years now.&lt;br /&gt;It took over a month to get it to the West Coast of Canada and the tracking stoped after only few days of shipping and still in Israel. I finally got it and happy.</li>
            <li> I have an oily t zone and can not use a heavy moisturizer but need something for dry skin and aging. This is a perfect light moisturizer. Feels soft but my oily areas remain clean feeling. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I use this at night.  Actually I ordered it by mistake.  I need more moisture for the day so again ordered the enriched moisturizing cream. This does help with the oil that accumulates around my nose area.  It is the only oily spot remaining.  All Avani products are good.  It is one of the better lines on the market - no animal testing and Dead Sea minerals.  What is not to like?</li>
            <li> I use this product and love it, that being said, the product came open and only half full. I realize I paid over half price but I should be warned of the condition and amount so I can decide if I still want to order.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this Gel- Cream but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  While the texture of the cream seemed heavy to the touch I was impressed at how light it felt once applied.</li>
            <li> He product works wonderfully. It&#x27;s a perfect way to cleanse and feel pretty without an expensive facial or spa treatment.</li>
            <li> As good as or better than pricey Obagi products.  Not overly heavy or greased feeling.  Good product  and good price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the Avani skinn care line.  I was in Hawaii and tried it in one of the kiosks.  So glad I didn&#x27;t commit then, as Amazon has all their wonderful products at a huge discount.  The Gel is light and super moisturizing. My face feels soft and not greasy.  I have their entire line and ove it.</li>
            <li> Although I really love some of Avani&#x27;s facial products (their facial peel is incredible), this moisturizer smells bad (very masculine) and feels very sticky on the skin. In addition, it balls up and flakes off if you try to wear it under make-up. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle scent, and the cream is quickly absorbed.  No greasy feeling, and dries quickly. I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry to apply my mineral based foundation.</li>
            <li> I like what I buy from the Avani store much much better but the price for this one is better, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great, light moisturizer for those of us who have normal to oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to open the bottles. I purchased three and ALL were one third or less full so I basically got one bottle for the price of three. I would not purchase again from these guys anymore.</li>
            <li> This cream is to drying for my skin. I have combination skin type, did not know it was for normal to oily skin when it was order.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s a good product or not because of the price. The moisturizer that I&#x27;ve been using is also dead sea mineral product but it costs $169.00 on Amazon. I&#x27;m very glad that I gave this one a try because it&#x27;s actually thicker and richier and definitely makes my skin feels silky &amp; smoother than the expensive one. The one thing that is superior that the expensive one has is the scent. I will miss that.  But this one doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. And considering all the other better thing this product offers, I will buy this again and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave a residue which is super important to me.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;I dont plan to order it again I will be going back to Viva per lei</li>
            <li> I use all Avani products. They are the best! Will use nothing else. Good for older women and I imagine any women!</li>
            <li> Good product and worth the money.  Wish it came in larger sizes.  Would buy again and recommend to others. Works well on dry skin too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Skin feels great, no breakouts, non greasy.  Have ordered more at this great price.  My daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> I love this product line.. Amazon saves me bunches of money buying it though them... Avani Dead Sea product line has beat all the big department store lines hand down, and for a lot less money though Amazon..</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and I have to say I haven&#x27;t had any problems ordering thru Amazon.com for anything that I wanted</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome it does exactly what i needed it too and it arrived quickly highly recommend the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> Love this!! It takes the dead skin off making your face feel so soft!!&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and does great job.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in stores before and was very happy. I ordered it on Amazon because it was much cheaper, but I soon found out why. When I got the product in, it smelled different than ones bought in the store. It was crusty at the top. I won&#x27;t be buying this online again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the Avani moisture balanca face cream; first of all, the container was only half full when I opened it and second of all when the cream dries on your face it leaves white residue so I do not use it in the morning, only at night when noone can see me</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cream for my skin, I&#x27;ve tried many other skin products and this has been the only one that has worked, I truly recommend to woman who suffer from acne and oily skin, is the best and also affordable !!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered it once from a different seller, and the jar that arrived appeared to have been opened and was only half full, so I returned it. I really wanted to try this, so I ordered a second jar from a different seller. This jar appeared to be unopened, but was also only about half full. Very disappointing. On the other hand, I like how it feels and I like the scent. I&#x27;d just really prefer to get jars that are actually full. I ordered another Avani product at the same time, and had no issues with that one.</li>
            <li> If you are allergic to scents, this is not he product for you. You can smell the scent even without opening the bottle.</li>
