            <li>Im a latino face and this glasses just suit perfect, besides are nice and very resistant!!</li>
            <li>Came in perfect condition and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>If they weren&#x27;t good, I would&#x27;ve shopped around for another brand, but for the money, they sure fit well and do what they&#x27;re supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Frames are light weight but sturdy, fit very nicely.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>Kinda stylish.</li>
            <li>this ones have polycarbonite lens, just be sure to have your correct prescription.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>If anything, regarding the plastic case that comes with the pair, I&#x27;d propose a more neutral color.  </li>
            <li>The work ok</li>
            <li>LOVE em.  </li>
            <li>or they misread the order other than that they are excellent quality and my doctor concurred</li>
            <li>I like the fit.</li>
            <li>The spring hinges are a plus and make for a snug fit.  </li>
            <li>To my great surprise I heard back quickly and with an apology.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly though, these glasses were full-featurd, high quality, comfortable and all for less than $7 (although shipping was $5).  </li>
            <li>My husband likes the fact they come in a little case and is overall very happy with these glasses.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they provide more gender neutral color for the plastic case - I received purple.</li>
            <li>This is my first pair of reading glasses…..to confront &amp;#34;aging eyes&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The half-rim style was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>They pretty much have anything you would need as they also do prescription lenses.    </li>
            <li>There are very few ethical businesses today and I was amazed he did the right thing and was courteous through the whole refunding.</li>
            <li>, all the other reading glasses were good to experiment with, but to use regularly they pretty much sucked.  </li>
            <li>He not only refunded my money but sent me the correct pair for free.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice it so much anymore.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, feel like they will last a while, and the lenses are really clear.</li>
            <li>Thanks, very comfortable and less strain on my eyes...</li>
            <li>They have a pretty strong smell of plastic or paint, not sure what it is</li>
            <li>If you go directly to their site you can customize your glasses even more and get these for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m new to these glasses and wanted something to just fix the focus not magnify as well.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight, I hardly feel them on my face over 2 hours of use.</li>
            <li>They come in a convenient (if utilitarian) plastic case with a soft cloth for wiping and protection while they&#x27;re in the case.  </li>
            <li>these reading glasses are well worth the money they came with a translucent green case and a very soft med-large cleaning cloth,I also like the variety of magnification you can find them in from this company.</li>
            <li>(first set: crushed inadvertantly by wifey.  </li>
            <li>A pink case wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice.</li>
            <li>These are as good as I described in my prior statement but this pair my doctor told me after he checked them are 0.50 so either someone filling the order grabbed wrong glasses</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only (super minor) thing I could say is that the power is not marked on the glasses, so</li>
            <li>At first the smell was stronger but it has worn down and now I can only occasionally smell that toxic smell and its more faint than when I first got them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably have to buy a few more pairs in the next few months, but at least I know I can count on this product and seller! &#x3D;)</li>

            <li> The quality of the optics is very good for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frame seems sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;The nose bridge did not emit a foul smell as some others mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have these for just a couple of days, so do not know how well (or long) they hold up.</li>
            <li> Nice product .!!!! I love it. OK. I guess,  I will be a buy it again another unit in the future. I like it.</li>
            <li> Fits well for even larger skulls.  Kinda stylish. I like the fit. Only one complaint - the smell.  They have a pretty strong smell of plastic or paint, not sure what it is but it smells toxic.  At first the smell was stronger but it has worn down and now I can only occasionally smell that toxic smell and its more faint than when I first got them.  To the manufacturer, fix that smell and you have a home run!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Quality product in this low prescription. Came with case, Cloth and cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband since it is hard to find .75 strength in the store.  Arrived the next day.  They are great and look good.</li>
            <li> I was working with my eye doctor to get reading glasses for close up work.  He said to try off-the-shelf +1.00 power, but maybe I would need +0.75 power, and tell me how things looked at my next appointment.  Well I bought a variety of inexpensive reading glasses from amazon to experiment with.  I bought these because they had the relatively uncommon +0.75 power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, all the other reading glasses were good to experiment with, but to use regularly they pretty much sucked.  Surprisingly though, these glasses were full-featurd, high quality, comfortable and all for less than $7 (although shipping was $5).  When I went for my eye appointment, my eye doctor was actually impressed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered a few pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (super minor) thing I could say is that the power is not marked on the glasses, so if you have a few pairs, you won&#x27;t know which is which.</li>
            <li> just great!! phenomenal!! it save me wasting $100, dont go with what the optometrist says, remembers they are not real doctors and they will come with the  BS that you need to buy them the eyeglasses because they &amp;#34;have to measure your face, look at this and that and at the end is false&amp;#34;....this ones have polycarbonite lens, just be sure to have your correct prescription. Im a latino face and this glasses just suit perfect, besides are nice and very resistant!!</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic when it come to online shopping and was weary of buying reading glasses on the internet but took a gamble. At first I was greatly disappointed when I received the wrong pair of glasses and figured I just lost my money to a scam. A friend suggested I contact the seller but I figured he would blow me off. To my great surprise I heard back quickly and with an apology. He not only refunded my money but sent me the correct pair for free. There are very few ethical businesses today and I was amazed he did the right thing and was courteous through the whole refunding. It restores my faith in good people. Do not hesitate to buy from this company.</li>

            <li> My husband likes the fact they come in a little case and is overall very happy with these glasses.  He is also happy he can find the .75 strength on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to order these three times now (first set: crushed inadvertantly by wifey.  Second set: lost God knows where because I&#x27;m forgetful).  If they weren&#x27;t good, I would&#x27;ve shopped around for another brand, but for the money, they sure fit well and do what they&#x27;re supposed to.  They come in a convenient (if utilitarian) plastic case with a soft cloth for wiping and protection while they&#x27;re in the case.  Let&#x27;s face it... I&#x27;ll probably have to buy a few more pairs in the next few months, but at least I know I can count on this product and seller! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These are the best!... great quality for the price. If you go directly to their site you can customize your glasses even more and get these for a little cheaper. I love them</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Very light weight, I hardly feel them on my face over 2 hours of use. Yeah some say the nose peaces &amp;#34;smell strong&amp;#34; but I felt that this went away somewhat and I don&#x27;t notice it so much anymore. Some people are too critical over a $20 pair of reading glasses. Overall a good product, feel like they will last a while, and the lenses are really clear. Cheers!!!</li>
            <li> Look great, are durable and were a great choice.</li>
            <li> Frames are light weight but sturdy, fit very nicely. I only wish they provide more gender neutral color for the plastic case - I received purple.</li>
            <li> This is my first pair of reading glasses…..to confront &amp;#34;aging eyes&amp;#34;.  I appreciate the durability of these well-made glasses as I put them on and take them off repeatedly throughout the day.  The half-rim style was exactly what I was looking for.  The spring hinges are a plus and make for a snug fit.  And yes, the vision-correcting lenses allow me to read again.  If anything, regarding the plastic case that comes with the pair, I&#x27;d propose a more neutral color.  A pink case wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice.</li>
            <li> The work ok but I&#x27;m new to these glasses and wanted something to just fix the focus not magnify as well.  These magnify as well as fix the focus.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with these glasses.</li>
            <li> Thanks, very comfortable and less strain on my eyes...</li>
            <li> Those reading glasses are excellent quality for the price. They do the job and very pleased to have them.</li>
            <li> Sadly these were for me lol.  LOVE em.  Lightweight and durable.  A great find!</li>
