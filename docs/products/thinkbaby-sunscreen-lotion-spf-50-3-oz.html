            <li>I bought it to use it on the body so that I do not have to use chemical sunscreens, but this one is very matte and fades away after rubbing it so well that I can use it perfectly on the face also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We ended up loving the Honest sunscreen and now it came out in a spray form</li>

            <li>Although it has a light and pleasant fragrance, I did not have any allergy issues.  </li>
            <li>so it makes me feel like it&#x27;s good quality, but it&#x27;s easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>Good consistency and applies easily.</li>

            <li>very easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong coconut smell (that attracts every bug in a 5 mile radius to you), and it is a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and love that I can pronounce and understand ALL the ingredients!  </li>
            <li>:) We love it!</li>

            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind it because it&#x27;s such a great sunscreen with good ingredients!</li>
            <li>The best natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Having tried may sunscreens, in search of one we liked that is also rated well on the EWG as being safe and non-toxic, this is one of our favorites.</li>

            <li>This is one of the best natural mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s keeping baby safe from harmful rays AND chemicals.</li>
            <li>Getting a safe and effective sunscreen is like threading a needle, I suppose.</li>
            <li>If they can use safe but effective  sized particles of zinc, why not of titanium too?</li>
            <li>As far as we can tell, it works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cruelty free and rated good with the EWG</li>
            <li>My 2 year old is very fair and wore this all summer without getting a sunburn!</li>

            <li>is the best so far that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good size I can fit in my bag.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells great - fresh and citrus-like.</li>
            <li>Bonus is that it rubs in completely, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells great!</li>
            <li>It is like wearing nothing at all for protection, and yet the protection it offers is awesome.</li>
            <li>Scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great smell and protected my 11 month old&#x27;s extremely fair skin.</li>

            <li>After applying the sunscreen to my skin, it feels very light</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very very light, so if that is what you are going after it is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is really great stuff, the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without making my face break out.  </li>

            <li>This is great, non-toxic sunscreen for a decent price!</li>

            <li>I wanted to use something safe for her, but I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s going to hurt.</li>
            <li>(see the EWG Sunscreen Guide for more info on what&#x27;s in your environmental products and their safety).</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s totally safe, and I think this sunscreen rubs in much better than babyganics.</li>
            <li>Spend you money on a better product.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I feel safe using this and knowing that the product is safe for infants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay if they look like Mulan.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it smells surprisingly nice!</li>
            <li>Our favorite sunscreen</li>
            <li>Make sure you put it on before heading out to the beach or pool.</li>
            <li>I really love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly pay anything to ensure the health &amp; safety of my LO.</li>
            <li>Melanoma risk doubles when one has more than 5 sunburns.  </li>
            <li>but except that, I love this</li>
            <li>We purchased this cream to protect our baby from the sun and it we are glad we did.</li>
            <li>While we do take all precautions to shade her from the sun, we feel confident that when her skin is exposed, she won&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;re fairly sure it came from this.</li>
            <li>Smooth and smells nice.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re buying more for the upcoming summer</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better than the chemical sunscreens, not for us.</li>
            <li>Make sure to read the instructions and reapply as directed though.  </li>
            <li>We use this Thinkbaby and babyganics on hubby and I when we travel to the tropics, it protects wonderful especially our faces, a 50 SPF protection is a must,</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>product is supposed to be so safe for baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I read a blog that had given it a top review.</li>
            <li>I really love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It blends very well without leaving my son looking pasty and it smells great.</li>
            <li>It is hands-down my favorite for my son.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d say it has a light, nice scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Burnout worked better even though that has a tendency to crust around the cap when the kids &amp;#34;serve&amp;#34; themselves.</li>
            <li>My kids haven&#x27;t had a sunburn all year and they love to apply this.</li>
            <li>Love this sunblock.</li>
            <li>This is rated &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; by the EWG meaning that it&#x27;s top rated for being safe for baby and the environment.</li>
            <li>The consistency is lighter (more like lotion than paste)</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen for our kids.  </li>
            <li>Kids love it too.  </li>
            <li>My favorite baby sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Have used this many times and baby has no tan/burn.</li>
            <li>I make sure to rub it in my hands before applying so</li>
            <li>This sunscreen gets top marks from EWG on safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did my research and found a product that works for my family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One person suggested adding titanium for even better performance.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, smells like orange creamsicle.</li>
            <li>We decided to go with mineral based and we love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second comes appropriate clothing and accessories.</li>
            <li>So not knowing these details may get you unprotected while you mistakenly believe you are safe...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The &#x27;innocent&#x27; guys are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love that it isn&#x27;t supposed to be eaten</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find sunscreen that can be eaten, either.</li>
            <li>I will say though that because it is more liquidy we do end up using more</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more tubes.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I prefer a spray, and am not a fan of lotion.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered 4 more tubes for this summer.</li>
            <li>and I was able to return the product for a refund.</li>
            <li>Will order more..</li>
            <li>And it is safe for kids.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have any prominently chapped lips</li>
            <li>you want to look your best, as far as stuff you can apply to your skin, sunscreen is the primary tool in your toolkit.</li>
            <li>My family and I love this product.</li>
            <li>love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li>So you will end up buying more than what you need.</li>
            <li>I found myself trying to blend this in a bit more whenever I looked at my arms and</li>
            <li>But I just wish it was easier to blend and a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Kept baby safe in July sun</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a daily sunscreen for my son!</li>

            <li>Be sure you apply 20 min before sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>

            <li>I recommend trying this or Tom&#x27;s of Maine depending on which is a better value at your time of shopping for sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

            <li>* Healthy ingredients (EWG rating &#x3D;</li>

            <li>Love how this sunscreen smells.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen when I buy it from a store; it has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>and a healthy percentage of it at that (20%).  </li>
            <li>love it, love it, love it...  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I bought 5 more tubes for my family.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Excellent product, EWG pick, low toxicity.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I also feel it blocks better &amp; more waterproof because of thickness.</li>
            <li>Check out Environmental Working Group sunscreen review to see toxicty in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Compared to California Baby, Thinkbaby&#x27;s sunscreen is much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love that I can give my kids protection from the sun knowing that I am not rubbing a bunch of chemicals on them.</li>
            <li>100% love this sunblock for my kids.  </li>
            <li>I choose this to use for myself because a lot more review for this one indicating more people buy this so batches may be fresher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching around for that best sun block that has no irritable ingredients and finally landed on this one.</li>
            <li>My skin is more acne prone</li>
            <li>Great product, fast prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>Not a terrible price.</li>
            <li>This and the Thinksport livestrong sunscreen are the best physical blockers on the market.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, and assumed I would because of all of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking, however, for something better.</li>
            <li>It smells like orangey vanilla creamsicle though so its ok for us to use once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My tube has an expiration date of 2016, so I thought I would be ok to use the rest of it up this year.</li>
            <li>She was subjected to many tests, none conclusive.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, protects very well.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous and this is the best quality.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite baby sunscreen yet.</li>

            <li>Love EWG rating of 1.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Thinkbaby is our favorite brand now for sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but it actually goes on very nicely and smells fruity too!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>The fact that I have the time to be able to rub it in all the way (babies aren&#x27;t exactly the most patient people in the world when it comes to sitting still) is good.</li>
            <li>All this mom wants is a safe AND EFFECTIVE sunscreen and this one isn&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li>However, if he rubs it in more while he is first applying it he can get good coverage and avoid the ashy look.</li>
            <li>For the high level of safety and for the sun protection this did great.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage… Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, rubs in well, and the price is right!</li>
            <li>But on top of that, it was so easy to smooth onto my skin!</li>
            <li>It rubs in much more easily than most Zinc based screens and we never get burned.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spread, does not leave too much residue, does not smell and protects great.</li>
            <li>It smells very pleasant, isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and definitely blocks the sun out!</li>
            <li>I like that is not thick and it smells great.</li>
            <li>We spend long days on the boat and this sunsreen has protected my son wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great product, love that it is natural.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and none go on as easily and transparently as this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mineral-based but easy to rub in (unlike Badger and others) and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell that some others have.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite baby sunscreen, easy to spread and seems to work.</li>
            <li>I tried The Honest Co mineral sunscreen and it was SUPER greasy and made her break out in a rash</li>
            <li>The Thinkbaby Safe Suncreen SPF 50+ smells really good, and it goes on pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li>light scented… very smooth</li>
            <li>Just make sure to reapply when you&#x27;re supposed to and it should work just fine.</li>
            <li>Has a strong citrus type of scent, I&#x27;d like it better if it wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li>Very good one, we were looking for a similar one</li>
            <li>and we both have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t experienced any rashes or skin break outs.</li>
            <li>Smooth elegant application.</li>
            <li>Love it, except wish it was fragrance free</li>
            <li>Of course, most importantly it does it&#x27;s job-</li>
            <li>With &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; ingredients, I feel more comfortable to use it on our daughter and the rest of the family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truly, the most indispensable tool in your cosmetic kit is sunscreen as sun exposure is the number one cause of &amp;#34;skin unhappiness&amp;#34; in both men and women as well as the leading factor in skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A great product for your baby or young child in sunscreen protection.  </li>
            <li>Offers great sun protection.</li>
            <li>great for adults too, although the thinksport is the adult version which is cheaper, almost identical ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great in my 18 month olds sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research for sunscreen for my 4 year old this summer, and am happy with my decision to use this product.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, IT WORKS.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of it if great for an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Tried another highly rated sunscreen that is also very popular with those looking for a healthier alternative to chemical filled sunscreens, but my son burned.  </li>
            <li>WIth the high environmental-friendly code and pleasant smell, I have recommended this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li>It goes on much more smoothly than Badger brand, the one we used before, but Badger didn&#x27;t smell as strongly nor did it irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs nicely, and all in all a great physical sunscreen especially compared to what is offered out there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very nice scent that is neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency, and a very light, natural scent.</li>
            <li>I have used virtually every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen on my toddler - this is the best.</li>
            <li>Outside with fair skinned child and no sunburn!</li>
            <li>While getting it all rubbed in can be a challenge, it works well and knowing it&#x27;s safe makes it worth it to me!</li>
            <li>Went on nice and smooth and blocked my kids from the hot California sun!</li>
            <li>Great EWG rating, makes me feel good about what I&#x27;m putting on my little girl&#x27;s skin to protect her..</li>
            <li>and I am grateful this didn&#x27;t happen to my sweet baby!</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It rubbed in fairly easily</li>
            <li>And easy to spread.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and blends in well.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is easy to spread and our baby loves the massage she gets as we apply it.</li>
            <li>I found that it rubbed in relatively easily</li>
            <li>Easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>For a sunblock it applied easily without the pasty appearance.</li>
            <li>So far this is the absolute best sunscreen I&#x27;ve purchased for my kids.</li>
            <li>It also seems easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily but it does take some effort to rub in order to avoid the ghost look.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild, and it applies easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I must say I don&#x27;t burn easily under the sun</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to apply-</li>
            <li>But it smooths out easily (unlike Babyganics -</li>
            <li>Easily rubs in, which is always the battle with mineral sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen remaining will be easy to apply.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, no sun burns while using this.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li>used zinc oxide sunscreens before and this one is the best so far because I can spread it on my skin much easier.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply to my kids</li>
            <li>scent is also very mild.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread and not have your baby look like a snowman/</li>
            <li>Easy application…</li>

            <li>Easy to apply, no fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the baby.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy...</li>
            <li>I strongly advise against buying this product.</li>
            <li>Nice price for this item, it uses good, a bit white.</li>
            <li>So far so good. :)</li>
            <li>No matter how many times and how much you apply, you will end up with nice brown tan.</li>
            <li>Goes on well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Safe, works wonderfully, and safe to use on my sweet little girl.</li>
            <li>I use this on their faces and went with Blue Lizard for the rest of their bodies -- it is a very nice sunscreen at a much more affordable price (and comparable hefty 8.75 ounce bottle).</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super greasy and had a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are very safe and gentle too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Physical sunscreens has many brilliant applications over their traditional counterparts, but in my mind, there are two distinct disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My complaints (1) it smells mediciny, kind of like diaper ointment, and (2) it protects from burn pretty well</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best sunscreen out there.  </li>
            <li>Would be fine for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; outdoor activities, but doesn&#x27;t work for us as our sunscreen for the pool.  </li>
            <li>Extremely easy and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>it is fine.</li>
            <li>I use it in our backyard and that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine on my baby daughter.</li>
            <li>Went on smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Smells great too, and most importantly, it muscle tests better than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive, fair skin</li>
            <li>Our absolute favorite sunscreen for our daughter!</li>
            <li>Speedo Men&#x27;s UPF 50+ Easy Short Sleeve Rashguard Swim Tee]] happily .</li>
            <li>Worked ok at first until it separated and liquified!</li>
            <li>; very funny!</li>
            <li>For everything else, I&#x27;ll be fine with good old coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>best ever, no strong smell, not greasy, easy to spread</li>
            <li>My child has sensitive, very fair skin, and this product really protects.</li>
            <li>It rubs in really quickly compared to other non-nano sunscreens (like honest company) and smells really nice unlike some others (honest company).</li>
            <li>A huge stream of water squirted out from two of these tubes.</li>
            <li>The texture of this is great, smooth and creamy, no grittiness or chalky feel like some of the similar sunscreen products for baby.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good--a light kind of citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t dump a huge blob on one area at once.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, not white, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is PABA, paraben, phthalate &amp; BPA free.</li>
            <li>I find that I prefer the light smell to no smell at all.</li>
            <li>I used light layers to apply it and added additional amounts where needed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread smoothly.</li>
            <li>Consistency is creamy and scent is light.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and works well</li>
            <li>However when I shake the product , it has the sound iof water instead of cream...</li>
            <li>but it was not fragrance  free.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, no zinc clumping like Badger or others.</li>
            <li>this sunscreen goes on smoothly and protects well.</li>

            <li>It goes on smooth too.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous like tangerines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of sunscreens available from the grocery and pharmacy, but broke out in hives with each within hours of applying.</li>
            <li>From my experience, it looks great on and smells like 70% oranges mixed with 30% chocolate.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is about as chemical free as sunscreen comes.  </li>
            <li>It has light citrus scent, but dont worry the scent isnt overpowering at all and gone in minutes.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or sticky and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>liked it so much that I bought extras to give as gifts to my aunts and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>A light citrus-y smell.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable putting this on my child&#x27;s skin and appreciate that the company continues their mission of making safer products.</li>
            <li>This can seem like a hassle, but honestly it&#x27;s the best way to get any natural sunscreen off you if you don&#x27;t want to be covered all day (I kind of have a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; for not feeling thick sunscreen/lotion/etc.</li>
            <li>This one does not leave you white, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and smells GREAT</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face sunburn free and my body chemical free.</li>
            <li>The reviews all said this was a light sunscreen (both in scent and texture).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for a month, but it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Nothing overpowering, just a light citrus note.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the natural sunscreens on the market and really liked this one.  </li>
            <li>I love that this sunscreen is safe for my whole family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a lot of natural baby sunscreens and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It smells like oranges and is good on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Besides it is rated as having a good balance of UV A and UV B protection by many external websites I have searched including EWG itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried SOOOOO many zinc oxide-based sunscreens, and this is my absolute, hands-down favorite.</li>
            <li>I use this on myself and not a baby, but so far has been good.</li>
            <li>After trying all kinds of natural sunscreens this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I am on a quest to try safe, non-chemical, physical, moisturizing sunscreen with good ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.</li>
            <li>I use it on my fair skinned toddler who has sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin and it protects her well in the sun.</li>
            <li>I loved all the of safety ratings and health conscious aspects of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>One of the best safer less chemical-filled sunscreens I have used!  </li>
            <li>Surely someone can make a formula that is chemical free AND prevents sunburn and sun damage, right?</li>
            <li>I applied this before leaving and the first thing I noticed was it does not spread nicely but instead soaks in rather quickly, so seems to take a lot of product to get your skin covered.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this, in fact, I plan to buy more when mine runs out!</li>
            <li>Otherwise an excellent product-much easier to apply than other sunscreens I have used, accompanied by a mild sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li>It rubs in very easily, smells nice, and you don&#x27;t have any white residue leftover.</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far, but like pretty much any product, there are trade-offs...</li>
            <li>Nanoparticle sized makes them pleasant and perhaps just as effective, but I certainly don&#x27;t like the idea of nanoparticles tumbling through my bloodstream like jagged rocks relative to the size of my cells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because of its excellent rating on the ewg skin deep database and the high reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>Consistency is a bit pasty but goes on fairly easy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is the easiest to spread on of any I have tried and rubs in quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quick and easy to remove once you use a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen to any parent looking for a natural, safe, and effective sunscreen for your kids!</li>
            <li>Finding a product that can protect the children safely from the sun, I&#x27;d be willing to pay any price.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a considerable price and knowing that it is safe for my children is the most important thing.</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>However, I planned on using this on my toddler as well, so I decided to do a patch test on the top of my hand first.</li>
            <li>This is some pretty potent stuff to have done that to my skin.</li>
            <li>The higher the ZO, the more SPF.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, lasts a long time too</li>
            <li>:) can work like a gel and keep my baby&#x27;s bangs out of his eyes which is a bonus ;)</li>
            <li>Perfect for small kids though.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>It also does a great job of protecting my toddler&#x27;s delicate skin (its most important role!).</li>
            <li>I was looking for a ingredient friendly sunscreen and found this.</li>
            <li>So far it works quite well on my very fair skinned, bald 15 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>( Smells nice and spreads much better than most of the other ones we have tried.</li>
            <li>I live in a warm humid climate</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, rubs in nicely, and protects completely.</li>
            <li>I also have tried several brands of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen, this is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens in an effort to find one that is low in terms of health risks/chemicals added, while also being effective and non-oily.  </li>
            <li>I got this at Whole Foods and had to get it when I saw it on Amazon, I love this scent and it goes on smoothly on both my kids.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>They are fair, blue eyes and light hair.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen spreads on pretty easily (much easier than Baby Badger types) and has a nice light scent to it.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much! :) :)</li>
            <li>It seemed so good on our first two uses, I&#x27;ve already bought more to last through the summer.</li>
            <li>I have a very fair skinned little girl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase, this sunscreen rubs in so much easier than Honest and is way less greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, slightly citrus-y and maybe a hint of coconut, but light and nice.  </li>
            <li>Good protection but other mineral products blend on skin better.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend specially to a person with oily skin problem.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t purchase again for that reason, but this is a great option for those who don&#x27;t need to be so careful.</li>
            <li>Her eyes were bright red each time after using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It rubs into the skin pretty well, but not as good as the old formulation of Burn out</li>
            <li>It smells good, isn&#x27;t too greasy, doesn&#x27;t make your face all white.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen based on the low toxicity and chemicals in this sunscreen and based on its good rating on the EWG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is a red head with the extremely fair skin to go with it.  </li>
            <li>This is our absolute favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh and it doesn&#x27;t not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I bought this product last summer because the good reviews.</li>
            <li>makers of Thinkbaby seem to have come up with a good idea -- make the zinc oxide particles smaller, but not nano-sized.</li>
            <li>My experience is that this product does protect me from the sun, although the true SPF might not be 50+.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are all physical barrier which is good.  </li>
            <li>Those ingredients are believed to be relatively harmless while offering good UV</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind the instructions and re-apply regularly and you are good to go...</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind the instructions and re-apply regularly and you are good to go...</li>
            <li>It has sweet scent like vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and goes on thick, so I feel like she is well protected.</li>
            <li>The smell of it is sweet and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;One of the top rated baby sunscreens, so whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>For the more sun intense work days I have (living in Africa)</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>This works into the skin very evenly and as someone who hates the feel of any type of lotion on my skin, I was able to tolerate the feel of it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good daily sunscreen, but your baby does get suntan in swimming pool.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think people should use those tubes full of liquid.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good, not like regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so I know the kids have full coverage and no missed spots and this provides that.  </li>
            <li>Although I cannot comment on it&#x27;s true effectiveness as when I used it my son was in a stroller with an spf shade on, I do like the smell and the consistency of this along with the price.  </li>
            <li>My 2-year-old son has developed some kind of allergic reaction to an ingredient in sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and he had no bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing per say unless you are going to an outdoor wedding or something like that.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not bad for my kids.</li>
            <li>One nice thing about it is that it rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky white residue.</li>
            <li>but it has pretty strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like how this sunscreen is pretty easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Goes on pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Not messy, great sunscreen for my 5 month old baby and for myself!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve found Thinkbaby to be the next best thing to the old formulation of Burn out, which was hands-down my favorite natural/safe sunblock.</li>
            <li>Easy to Apply and very clean natural products</li>
            <li>(separates quickly in tube).</li>
            <li>Nice and thick to provide good protection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t agree with previous reviewers that it is easy to spread or pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly and goes away.</li>
            <li>No greasy feel, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell (slightly tropical) which is not overly strong...</li>
            <li>Nice and thick for good coverage.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it all that much yet, but will post an update if I&#x27;m not just as happy as I am upon initial use!</li>
            <li>No smell apart from a mild fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;-Price</li>
            <li>It does goes quickly though.</li>
            <li>She specifically recommended this as her favorite brand of sunscreen to wear daily on the face, because it contains SAFE ingredients and is without carcinogens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been poring over information and reviews about the most natural, non-toxic sunscreen available, without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for work, running errands, but sweats off in intense humidity and physical activity.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it protected my child from getting a sunburn and it didn&#x27;t break out his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I tend to reapply after about 4 hours in the pool for my super fair-skinned daughter, but for everybody else, once in the morning</li>
            <li>and I needed to get something from the store quick and one of my twins&#x27; eyes puffed up and his skin broke out.  </li>
            <li>With the high concentration of zinc oxide (20%), I&#x27;d expect better performance.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that this was one of the most highly rated baby sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It is such a great sunscreen normally!</li>
            <li>We like the sunscreen very much since its quite hot here in Guangdong China and my baby needs this, easy to clean</li>
            <li>This sunscreen gets the best rating from the Environmental Working Group ([...]) but is still easy to apply, unlike other products that receive the same rating.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all those general information, here comes my hands on experience after two months of use:&lt;br /&gt;-It is effective:</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>the humidity here is super high, it is summer time and this sunscreen is so GREASY!!!</li>
            <li>We bought this for our most recent trip to Disney World for my 1 year old who is VERY fair skinned and has sensitive skin in addition.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, less oily than</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very absorbent and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m leaning toward trying another brand since I really dislike the strong scent.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, gentle for children</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and protects very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spreads easily and really protects from sunburn.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily, rubs in well, and has a very slight and pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>good on dry skin.</li>
            <li>The ThinkBaby and ThinkSport go on smoothly, rub in (admittedly with a little more work than sunscreens with microparticles) and in my opinion, smells great - not like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, I love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of natural sunscreens for my family over the years and this most recent purchase I have been very pleased with.</li>
            <li>I knew the first time I tried it!  </li>
            <li>One of our girls has sensitive skin but had no problem with this sunscreen, even on the face! :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this sunscreen would fair in all-day-at-the-beach sort of conditions (and I don&#x27;t plan to test it!).  </li>
            <li>We will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>My son went for 4 hours straight on the beach with one application at the hottest time of the day and he did just fine.</li>
            <li>It has the pleasant very light smell of lemon grass and other natural oils.</li>
            <li>This is great sunscreen for little ones.</li>
            <li>This works great for our little one.</li>
            <li>* Proceeds go to a good cause (despite a certain disgraced former</li>
            <li>This product was by far the most reasonably priced option which fit both criteria.</li>
            <li>I now enjoy using Thinkbaby sunscreen, knowing that its ingredients are not unhealthy and that my skin will be protected from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.</li>
            <li>On top of working well and being safer, it has a pleasant, subtle citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I also prefer using products with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Takes some time to rub in, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It is not enough on its own.</li>
            <li>I use it on my kids with much success.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchase many natural sunscreens and this one is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s on the pricier side, it&#x27;s worth it for peace of mind and ease of use.</li>
            <li>The kids got burnt and I applied as directed and even put on more frequently than required.</li>
            <li>safe for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite baby sunscreen</li>
            <li>My first time using for a trip to Cape Cod and my experience was that it was easy to apply and the smell was pleasant and not strong.</li>
            <li>I love that it works for my 1 year old.  </li>
            <li>The texture is much better without any danger so far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>But, I also don&#x27;t want to slather myself in chemicals or nanoparticles of zinc oxide that can be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Thinkbaby has a fresh peachy sort of scent, doesn&#x27;t leave us looking like ghosts, and it WORKS--even at the beach.  </li>
            <li>SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The thinkbaby sunscreens are my favorite natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I used the Honest Company sunscreen last year, but tried this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li>BUT be careful not to get this into your loved one&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Basically, it wasn&#x27;t worth my money</li>
            <li>The upside is that this sunblock doesn&#x27;t contain the toxic chemicals (Google it) contained in most sunblocks, however it didn&#x27;t protect us from sunburn like my old &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunblock.</li>
            <li>but these products rarely do</li>
            <li>, it hydrates your skin and makes it soft and smooth, while reversing the signs of sun damage!</li>
            <li>ive tried tons of natural sunscreens and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>It is worth it</li>
            <li>It is worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of the sun.</li>
            <li>I always try to find sunblocks that are on the &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; more natural side.</li>
            <li>It also applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you ghostly white.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I have something to protect my 10 month old.</li>
            <li>There are many natural mineral sunscreens that pill (roll off).</li>
            <li>far, I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>She did a lot of research for safe sunscreen for our 6 month old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Definitely provides nice protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I thought to use this on myself before ever trusting it on my 3 month old baby.</li>
            <li>Buy Thinkbaby, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>non oily, effective, smells good, non irritating.</li>
            <li>Goes on pretty easily without too much rubbing in.</li>
            <li>:)  A little spreads very easily.  </li>
            <li>Great ingredients - so much safer than other products out there.  </li>
            <li>This is a safe product unlike many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>At first it was fine but after one or two uses I noticed it was really watery with chunks of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>In terms of sun-protection it works extremely well at preventing a sun burn even on fair skin tones.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it rubs in fairly well compared to other brands...</li>
            <li>I just ordered another one from Amazon today and hopefully this order will be as good as the other set I have purchased</li>
            <li>I buy this one (and one other sunscreen) because it has good ratings on the EWG.</li>
            <li>It has a very thick consistency and requires some rubbing in order to avoid a &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; kind of face, but I feel very confident that it protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li>This spreads right on, like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li>right over the sunscreen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a triathlete and always looking for the right formula.</li>
            <li>We spent 4 hours in the hot sun at the fair</li>
            <li>Goes on nearly clear(I feel like my body warmth helps it to completely disappear), has a pleasant scent, and has protected my face, tattoo colors and decolletage VERY well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i fell back into using neutrogena pure &amp; free baby when i couldn&#x27;t find a good natural sunscreen as it was zinc &amp; titanium dioxide based with no oxybenzone and no parabens</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and rub in with no white afterglow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply as it spreads well and absorbs quickly, no white residue either.</li>
            <li>it was pretty funny!</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-Really</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-Really</li>
            <li>Great product doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry or irritated, unlike other zinc oxide sunscreen, love the ingredients, smells like cream biscuit.</li>
            <li>Our fair skinned toddler hasn&#x27;t had a single line or burn yet this summer, and it&#x27;s all thanks to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The chemical sunscreens go from not so safe to much worse, but nanoparticles have not been proven safe, though zinc oxide fares better than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old</li>
            <li>means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days the low ZO works well.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy though it does rub on kind of thick, does not leave significant white cast on fair skin.</li>
            <li>though it seems strange to have this kind of flagrance for sunscreens.)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do keep in mind that there&#x27;s a time limit on how long it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>my very sensitive daughter was fine with it.</li>
            <li>This one actually rubs in very easily and works really well!  </li>
            <li>I love that this is safer than most sunblock, but some almost always ends up in my little one&#x27;s eyes from her sweating, or rubbing her eyes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so greasy and it melts right into my daughter&#x27;s eyes when it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li>Pleasant light citrus scent that, for mysterious reasons, makes my 5 year old nearly vomit.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in more local stores but easy enough to order here.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like the old BurnOut sunscreen which spreads easily and disappears on my face.  </li>
            <li>He developed a bright red splotchy rash.</li>
            <li>My son is a red head and we have had no burns or redness of any kind thanks to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Nice moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The last two times I used this on my fair skinned 10 month old</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, rubs in clear.  </li>
            <li>We spent 10 days in Hawaii with our 8 month old baby and with this sunscreen he never got a tanline, no burns, it worked great.</li>
            <li>this one is great, never got burned, rubs in quite well and is white at first then clear, slight film left on skin but its fine and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that I really like and is also very creamy.  </li>
            <li>I researched online for sunscreen for my 1 year old, this brand was rated as being natural yet effective.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed smoothly and completely into my skin and does the job.</li>
            <li>It worked really well in Florida, swimming in the ocean and very hot sunny days.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my own face as I usually burn easily.</li>
            <li>The bonus is that for a sunscreen this is actually very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very smooth as a moisturiser and does not make skin white after application.</li>
            <li>Parents beware: I thought this was fine for my toddler, but I got the adult version and have burned twice while using it according to product instructions.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that my one-year old occasionally (ie: always) has his hands in his mouth - and I can rest easy knowing that there isn&#x27;t toxic lotion all over him. :)</li>
            <li>That makes it so much easier to get them ready!!</li>
            <li>I found this on the EWG website, where it got the lowest score of 1 for toxicity, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My first reaction upon putting this on my face was, \\&quot;yuck, who chose the scent?\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>Ties for first with the MyChelle line of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>My first time purchasing this.</li>
            <li>I bought this in January and was going to use it for the first time today (March 21)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sunscreen and we will never go back!</li>
            <li>At first smells like cookies then smells like metal.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time on a trip to the desert museum and saguaro national park in Tucson, AZ on a 100 degree day, full-sun, from about 10am to 2pm...</li>
            <li>My words of advice, and something I&#x27;ll be more cautious of in the future, is to be aware of anything that might wipe the sunblock off (seat belts, purse straps, towels).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a zinc-based sunblock, which means it&#x27;s a physical sunblock and more prone to coming off.</li>
            <li>Overall it seems to protect against UV pretty well, just make sure you apply liberally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>In the first week using it, he has had 3 sunburns.</li>
            <li>I used it yesterday for the first time this year on my kids.</li>
            <li>About a week later, I used it again and the first thing that spilled out was water, water, and more water.</li>
            <li>Have a fair-skinned child, and this has worked consistently well now for two summers.  </li>
            <li>I think it is just ok especially for the price</li>
            <li>My daughter has been using this sunscreen for her two-year-old twin boys since they first ventured into sunshine.</li>
            <li>Since it is for kids, I wish it was fragrance free because kids are so sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I recommend using rash guards (top part of swim suits that can block UV while not causing a big restriction.)</li>
            <li>it is okay especially when considering the availability to order it through subscribe and save and get an additional upto 20% discount (at the time I bought it).</li>
            <li>it is okay especially when considering the availability to order it through subscribe and save and get an additional upto 20% discount (at the time I bought it).</li>
            <li>It is outstanding and going forward will be the only sunscreen I buy.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t stay white and sit on top (like some sunscreens).</li>
            <li>and I first put it on his face, then each arm, then each leg.</li>
            <li>Used it in Vegas while it was really hot</li>
            <li>and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is a good sunscreen but does not last for more than a few months.</li>
            <li>And it makes skin soft and smooth, while reversing the signs of sun damage.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Great consistency - not liquid and not overly thick like some.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that the skin will still get some sun, so don&#x27;t expect that you will not tan at all.</li>
            <li>Very concerning!</li>
            <li>I find that if you put coconut oil on first, let soak in, then apply sunscreen the application is even easier.  </li>
            <li>When I squeezed it the first thing that came out was water .  </li>
            <li>really well - no one has been sunburned!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, mostly when I&#x27;m out at the beach or hiking.</li>
            <li>First, squeeze out 90% of the water from the tube.</li>
            <li>My current favorite sunscreen for the face.</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a white residue but there isn&#x27;t much of one!</li>
            <li>The only thing tip is you have to shake the tube until it doesn&#x27;t sound like its full of liquid.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had more sun blocking capabilities, but maybe physical sunscreens will never perform as well as chemical ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be a higher SPF&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time on my baby when we went to the beach.  </li>
            <li>This was the first sunscreen that I purchased for my infant -</li>
            <li>We were told numerous times to keep our 5 month baby covered and in the shade for our trip to Hawaii, but we still needed a product for the top of his hands &amp; feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.)</li>
            <li>Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is VERY creamy!  </li>
            <li>Rubs in very well!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll keep buying higher factor sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I still came back &amp; bought more though</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and rubs in so that it&#x27;s clear and non-staining.</li>
            <li>Although there are higher scored sunscreen in the EWG site, I purchase it based on the</li>
            <li>I first like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients and ultimately bought for the ratings on Skin Deep.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>After trying more than 10 &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens over the course of the summer, this is the only one that my sensitive-skinned 3-yr-old son can tolerate.  </li>
            <li>Found it through EWG Skin Deep when we were trying to find a safe, non toxic sunscreen for my baby.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how well it works and how safe it is.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because I rubbed my eyes by accident and instantly regretted it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good natural sunscreen for my kids for a long time.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but too creamy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;Expected to be lighter, not as heavy.</li>
            <li>Anyways, a great little thing you need to carry around with you if you live in place like Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>We had good results with this sunblock in dry conditions but when we used it at the pool it came off completely in water.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, smells good, no white residue, does leave a slight greasy feel</li>
            <li>It does go on super white, but it has rubbed in fairly easily for us if we don&#x27;t use too much (toddlers help too.much sometimes ).</li>
            <li>Nice product.. Worked fine for my baby and its delicate on skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for chemical free sunscreen for my little one,finally I found one, there are many sunscreen but those are with chemicals.</li>
            <li>Got home and checked my old bottle and saw that the newer versions first ingredient is now water - would have liked a mention of a different formula.</li>
            <li>My son loves the smell so makes it easy to put on a normally wiggly 3 year old!</li>
            <li>Thinkbaby&#x27;s sunscreen sets a very high quality standard in terms of safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the ingredients are more natural and less toxic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked okay on my bigger kids, but it was very ineffective on my baby.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and thick (not runny) and I love that it is rated top safety ratings.</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;ve come to the point that I could be 100% confident to say that I know this product very well by now.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not so much considerate of getting 100% SUNSCREEN, which in fact it is made for initially, and you&#x27;re more concerned about environment and your/</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>It has an EWG rating of 1, goes on nice and smooth, not too thick, and I really like the light orange smell (and I tend to be sensitive to smells).</li>
            <li>To be fair, sunscreen was only part of my skin-saving routine, I went in the morning to avoid the harshest UV rays (9:30am) and was only out for two hours.  </li>
            <li>We have tried a number of natural kid-friendly sunscreens and this is by far, the favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the texture and spreadability but the protection cannot be beat which is the most important thing when buying sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I was initially looking for something safe for my baby, but now my whole family uses this product.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, a little citrusy, not a heavy coverup like in some of the more mainstream sunscreens for babies.</li>
            <li>and my fair haired/blue eyed little one has not burned a bit!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries quickly while you are blending it, so it doesn&#x27;t spread very far and you need more&lt;</li>
            <li>Well worth the (somewhat) high pricetag.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my sensitive face yet, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as shiny as so many others I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>We have used other sunscreens from Badger and other highly recommended brands and this is the best we have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I love that it&#x27;s SPF 50 (instead of the typical 30), it has a top EWG rating (1), and I love the slight citrus scent!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but the texture reminds me exactly of Elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
            <li>pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>Because I bought it almost at the end of summer, I didn&#x27;t use much and didn&#x27;t expose it to hot temperature.</li>
            <li>We are on our second tube of this great sunscreen-it rubs in well, does not leave white streaks and blends in completely.</li>
            <li>Gets overall great reviews for being a safer sunscreen due to it&#x27;s ingredients.  </li>
            <li>We bought one at first to try it and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>all, I am pretty happy about the purchase and apply it without much concern to my kids as an additional sun protection to other methods, I discussed above.</li>
            <li>all, I am pretty happy about the purchase and apply it without much concern to my kids as an additional sun protection to other methods, I discussed above.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural sunscreen that I felt comfortable with him wearing fairly regularly, and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>However, I could get past this since it promises good protection from the sun and didn&#x27;t seem overly greasy on my face.    </li>
            <li>after using it on my 3 year old son for a full week, his skin had a rash</li>
            <li>So I guess the product only good for one summer, then you need to toss it out no matter how much has left in the tube.</li>
            <li>We all have fair skin and usually will sunburn at the beginning of the season, even with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I have the world&#x27;s most sensitive skin - it came out in a white cream which quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>The old formula had an offensive, sweet smell that i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase (as a part of the subscribe &amp; save program) and the first one was fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This went on white and rubbed in clear very easily.</li>
            <li>I loved this one - wasn&#x27;t too pasty, although a little stickier than the neutrogena dry touch that I normally use, but was happier knowing that it was &#x27;safer and better&#x27; sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I like it better on my skin than my other favorite - Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li>As a diligent pale skinned sun avoider with 3 fair daughters, I was looking for a physical block that applied without too much white cast, non-runny consistency to avoid getting into kids&#x27; eyes, nice orange scent, and under $12.  </li>
            <li>Rubs in easily with no white leftover on her skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so non-greasy that it&#x27;s the first zinc-based sunscreen that I feel comfortable wearing under makeup on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that I don&#x27;t burn and rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t feel too gross after applying.  </li>
            <li>Pure watery liquid.  </li>
            <li>So I purchased this from Amazon&#x27;s sister site, Diapers.com - the bottle I received was pure liquid (like water).</li>
            <li>therefore, it requires shaking if you don&#x27;t want pure water to come out.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, it spreads easily, and there is only a minimal amount of white residue.</li>
            <li>other ingredients are fairly well known to me - no endless list of dodgy chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is expected for a more natural product where there are no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>My 22 month old has sensitive skin and experiences breakouts easily.</li>
            <li>I had purchased one before from a different online retailer and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>It goes on white, but with some blending it disappear quickly!</li>
            <li>switched to physical sunscreens a few years ago and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.</li>
            <li>And very high ratings on EWG.</li>
            <li>Due to the Zinc oxide, you will expect the whitish paste, but overall very smooth and easy to apply and blend.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.</li>
            <li>We made it through the MN summer with 2 tubes, and that is with application every single day as we live outside when it is nice out!  </li>
            <li>Other reviews say the smell is pleasant, so it is up to personal preference, but I think it smells chemically</li>
            <li>I like that it only has two ingredients, one being zinc, and it&#x27;s still easy to apply (unlike many other zinc screens).</li>
            <li>Not only is it great at blocking out the sun, it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals that is detrimental to the body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash hands carefully and thoroughly after application because this stuff really burns if it gets into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash hands carefully and thoroughly after application because this stuff really burns if it gets into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.</li>
            <li>We really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after BurnOut changed their formulation, really hoping I&#x27;ve found a substitute.  </li>
            <li>It soesn&#x27;t smell, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make him white like a ghost except around the hairline.  </li>
            <li>We use it for the whole family and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>and it did not block the whole time.  </li>
            <li>and the whole thing was basically liquid water.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen for kids and adults alike!</li>
            <li>I tried several different chemical free sunscreens and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li>and it protected them very well.  </li>
            <li>I applied this very liberally on my LO and no burns at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>It takes much longer to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems very sweat resistant as well.</li>
            <li>Very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really protect the skin from tanning.</li>
            <li>After using so many brands of natural and effective sunscreens, I can tell this is the only one which does not contain harsh chemicals and also not oily.</li>
            <li>Price varies so much that at the beginning of summer I ordered two tubes for $10 and now it&#x27;s $15 for one.</li>
            <li>This one is very stable.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like my child is protected when this is on her.</li>
            <li>but If this one lasts the whole summer I will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset about it.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was unscented since it seems to linger quite a bit on her skin.  </li>
            <li>The most effective and the least harmful preventive measure is to avoid exposure to sun during critical hours.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses it</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t gone out in the sun much to use this a lot yet</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, some tender children&#x27;s skins need to be protected from too much sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one though.</li>
            <li>Very water</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one and the sport variety!</li>
            <li>Gentle on baby</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>When applied it&#x27;s very cakey</li>
            <li>Some dermatologists say that vitamin c (in the form of ascorbic acid) and vitamin e in your sunscreen can help to prevent sun damage, and of course zinc oxide is much safer than chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple years now and it works really</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this brand by someone who works at whole foods.</li>
            <li>However, it seems to use up fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen for my kids.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works really well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with looking &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face real shiny.  </li>
            <li>Whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>I used this on my daughter and myself the whole week.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It blends in very well.</li>
            <li>It rubs in really well.</li>
            <li>I received the cream on the 9th and the real shipping date was the 4th on the package.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>It really protects your skin from the Sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li>and you have to really blend it&lt;</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You really need to dilute it</li>
            <li>but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;</li>
            <li>really need to dilute it</li>
            <li>but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;</li>
            <li>Applies so very easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly and if rubbed in well, there is no white residue.</li>
            <li>It was really noticeable while at the pool</li>
            <li>It is much smoother and creamier.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>We use it for the whole family now.</li>
            <li>My kids looked like ghosts the whole vacation.</li>
            <li>The sunblock spreads on very well.</li>
            <li>Very greasy can not use on my face.</li>
            <li>and I find that I don&#x27;t reach for it very often.</li>
            <li>and we really like it.  </li>
            <li>Within a day of applying this to my son, he broke out in very itchy contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>Whole fam used it.</li>
            <li>Maybe she is using too much however.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The bees came straight for us.</li>
            <li>Arrived really early, a week earlier than expected, which is great.</li>
            <li>We have sensitive skin and aren&#x27;t able to use traditional chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>However among the list of 462 sunscreens clearly investigated by that independent agency, this one still rates among the top products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It did not cause any irritation or skin problems,it is also written on the bottle to be safe for babies over 6 months old (younger than that</li>
            <li>We have tried many different brands of chem-free sunblock on our 10 month old, this is one of our favorites.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve read the recent research about sunscreen, popular brands can actually cause cancer once the chemicals interact with sunlight and seep into your skin.</li>
            <li>From all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve used (probably 6-8) that are ranked low on the ewg website, this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, no chalky residue, smells nice &amp; works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands of sunscreen for my toddler, and I think this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue that many natural sunscreens leave.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and provides good protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick one &amp; will stay on during exercise fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin that burns easily, but after putting a thin layer of this on the first day (it&#x27;s pricey, so I was being cheap by putting on a thin layer...)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on very smoothly, which has been an issue with other sunscreens we have bought that are very &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; and do not spread well.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using this sunscreen for my 18month old daughter, but upon opening the tube and squeezing gently, watery liquid squirted out (as several other reviewers have experienced).</li>
            <li>I burn easily and it kept me burn free when a crowd of family that doesn&#x27;t usually burn got burnt.</li>
            <li>Once I received it I was pleased to find that the sunscreen goes on smoothly without being overly thick, which is often a problem with these safe sunscreens in which zinc oxide is the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>but myself and my 6 year old son both felt like our skin was burning right after we put it on our faces.</li>
            <li>I used the Honest Company sunscreen previously and find Thinkbaby rubs in much better and is less greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can feel confident using it on my son knowing that he is not being exposed to harmful chemicals that are found in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I guess this product has glowing reviews due to the safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers stated, the tube was mostly a watery substance.  </li>
            <li>After reading about all the issues w/ sunblock from the other brands, I&#x27;m glad I bought this based on amazon&#x27;s review.  </li>
            <li>We love that this sunscreen isn&#x27;t as greasy as some of the other &amp;#34;better for you&amp;#34; sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Like all other sunblocks, make sure to reapply after time in the water.</li>
            <li>It is a better brand than other chemicals on the market, but why pay for something that ids priced as the quality sunscreens without the quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Goes on transparent, unlike most of the other non-chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I put this the first time on my baby and a couple of hours later she had a rash on her arms; I tried a second time just to make sure it wasnt something else</li>
            <li>It might be okay for other babies</li>
            <li>We were in the hot LA sun all day, and even though I reapplied often, I was sure he was going to show a little sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I have used the Honest Company Sunscreen previously for my little ones, and Thinkbaby is better because it has 20% zinc oxide.</li>
            <li>thinkbaby doesn&#x27;t leave a white layer and goes on cleanly.</li>
            <li>The reason I rate it below the first two is that it contains a bunch of ingredients and can readily be absorbed by body, enter blood stream or have effects in local skin tissue.</li>
            <li>, it absorbed pretty well, and left my children without a sunburn.</li>
            <li>This is one of the top rated natural/organic type sunscreens (active ingredient: Zinc oxide).  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and light, it really works hard to block the harmful rays of the sun, and it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>Thinkbaby sunscreen have nice citrus scent, it rubs on easily, made mineral base so that it won&#x27;t cause acne to flare up, it has non nano zinc oxide, and contains no other skin irritable or health hazardous ingredients/toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>Mexitan has both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, has a good texture but leaves white clumps unless you really rub hard right away.</li>
            <li>It feels good to wear after about a half hour of initial whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on a little white like most mineral sunscreens but it is very easy to rub in and it doesn&#x27;t leave her looking ghostly white.</li>
            <li>Based on the outstanding reviews here, I decided to purchase this sunscreen for my 2.5 year old and 1.5 year old as well as an extra tube for myself.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my 15 month old on her first vacation to Mexico.  </li>
            <li>(some reviewers point out bigger 6 ounce sizes are available for cheaper in external websites which might be worth considering too...</li>
            <li>(some reviewers point out bigger 6 ounce sizes are available for cheaper in external websites which might be worth considering too...</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t use a lot when you apply, but the tube is kind of small for every day use.</li>
            <li>not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li>On her first day of daycare (today) a friend wanted to keep me busy</li>
            <li>The scent was mild, the consistency was smooth and it didn&#x27;t leave my face looking ghostly and pale.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use this sunscreen for the first time while on vacation, but the tube was just mostly water with little sunscreen pieces!</li>
            <li>The product rubs in very nicely &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a thick white coating like so many other zinc based products.</li>
            <li>Thick cream, perfect protection when it came to my little one.</li>
            <li>We live in hawaii where its always sunny!  </li>
            <li>This is my new go to!  </li>
            <li>Despite being very white at first, it absorbs very fast and has no odor.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, but company should address issues related to the watery stuff coming out of tube or note that this is a normal occurrence and not related to quality of the product nor the protection it provides.</li>
            <li>We were diligent about applying before we headed out and despite hours out in the New England summer, no burns for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Reviews convinced me to purchase this brand but the truth is that drug store brands cost 75% less and work much better.</li>
            <li>I love that it has less chemicals.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more for summer back home.</li>
            <li>My main goal is to avoid the chemical-based sunscreens, though, so the search is still on.  </li>
            <li>Did not leave a white cakey film like many similar sunscreens.</li>
            <li>If it lists anything else as anactive ingredient, then it is most likely a hybrid or traditional chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The price tag is more than I usually would spend on sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t mind paying the higher price if it protects me while I hike.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly care for it.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more and use daily during the summer months</li>
            <li>All in all, I think it took about a full week before my skin went back to its normal texture.</li>
            <li>I looked at the ingredients and one of the main ones is Ascorbic Acid (which is a form of Vitamin C).</li>
            <li>Looks as in the picture shown, decent size</li>
            <li>The reason i bought this particular one is because it&#x27;s all-natural.  </li>
            <li>great protection, but very white and thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few natural sunscreens and hadn&#x27;t found one that I liked.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my kids to use, mainly for their face and hands so it wouldn&#x27;t burn their eyes.</li>
            <li>THE SELLER:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers this cream with free shipping with a possible 1-2 weeks waiting time.</li>
            <li>After trying many different sunscreens, we always go back to Think Baby.</li>
            <li>Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good sunscreen for the last few years...tried many expensive ones...</li>
            <li>i have tried so many brands (costing sooooo many dollars since they&#x27;re basically thrown away when they fail)</li>
            <li>We keep a steady supply coming in.  </li>
            <li>But when I began to look for one to buy, it seemed the reviews weren&#x27;t very good for many of them - they are thick and hard to apply without the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; coating left on skin, they are greasy, etc.</li>
            <li>Practical and effective on my daughter&#x27;s very pale skin.</li>
            <li>I love knowing that it is not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>The kids thought it was very funny, but you obviously you don&#x27;t want to use this if you need to look presentable.  </li>
            <li>After having two kids, I am suddenly allergic to pretty much all sunscreen, including those &#x27;gentle&#x27; ones for babies.</li>
            <li>Have tried other sunscreens looking for a great one that is easy to spread, protects my son, and isn&#x27;t filled with bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t have as high an SPF as this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>Melanoma risk is increased from the use of tanning beds by as high as 70%.  </li>
            <li>High dose of zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I thought i&#x27;d invest in this one since it&#x27;s highly rated and regarded.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it has a high SPF</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this sunscreen as it was highly rated on Amazon and ewg.org.</li>
            <li>Cost is high.</li>
            <li>and I like that it has a high SPF of 50</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much that I don&#x27;t put on enough sunscreen, but I&#x27;ve never found one that I liked enough to use the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s highly rated on the EWG website, and isn&#x27;t shiny/oily/sticky</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High ratings on EWG.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product?</li>
            <li>this is has a high safety rating for sunscreens on EWG website.</li>
            <li>It smells like oranges (not chemicals) and is rated highly by EWG.  </li>
            <li>Highly Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is highly rated by ewg.org, the environmental working group.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a safer sunscreen to use.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen went on kind of thick and white, but quickly rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>This may or may not mean something.</li>
            <li>It did not cake on white (which I have experienced from other natural options - such as Mercola&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>The fagrance is a very light citrus smell and it rubs in very well and isn&#x27;t greasy unlike many other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used which leave a white film or a greasy feeling and as for people saying that they still tanned using this, I might agree that there was some slight tanning but no burn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this and the other one I bought at Costco- &amp;#34;Sunology&amp;#34; (this one spreads easily compares to thinkbaby) to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather pay a little extra for great skin protection especially to not have</li>
            <li>Even though it is only 3 oz, it is so worth it to spend a little more for this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work really well at preventing sun burns without too frequent of re-application.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen for my 5 month old.</li>
            <li>so we will probably switch to that to make life much easier with a 9 month old that won&#x27;t sit still.</li>
            <li>This sunblock is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t take too much to rub into my 2 year old&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this sunscreen for myself (I&#x27;m an adult) and really like the citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin and no rashes so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This pretty much repeated itself two months later on a rafting trip.  </li>
            <li>Not like normal sunscreen and not useable.</li>
            <li>but I definitely worth the spending extra knowing it&#x27;s safer for you skin.</li>
            <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it is effective and I feel comfortable with putting it on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as harsh as most sunblock and doesn&#x27;t sting from my experience, but it does irritate her eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this product, and i use it everyday under my make up...great for baby or adults.</li>
            <li>WONDERFULLY well, lasts long, not overly expensive</li>
            <li>I have 1 year old twins who love being outside, it&#x27;s only August</li>
            <li>Nice texture, not too thick, not too</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was comfortable putting a minimal amount of this on him because after lots of research, it&#x27;s much more natural than the other sunscreens which was something I was concerned about since his hands &amp; feet are always in his mouth!</li>
            <li>It goes on good, but runs down your body once you get wet.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend for anyone who wants sun protection but a sunscreen that actually blends in completely and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you have white paint on your face.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice after it is shaken and mixed properly, it is not too thick and applies to skin easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to apply and she&#x27;s never gotten a burn in the 3 summers</li>
            <li>The texture is creamy (not hard, not runny).  </li>
            <li>It is fine to use on arms and other areas of the body for me, despite the smell.</li>
            <li>Does the job, and I really appreciate the faint yet pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Excellent texture, does not go on too thick like some other physical sunblocks I have tried.</li>
            <li>I read so many positive reviews and a handful of negative ones</li>
            <li>My kids are very, very fair and get at least a little sunburnt</li>
            <li>We all need sunlight for proper Vitamin D synthesis in our body however a 20 minute/day direct exposure (not blocked by window glass or clear plastic) is more than enough for that purpose.</li>
            <li>BUT recently i noticed that the first listed ingredient was alumina, a form of aluminum, which i don&#x27;t want on my skin &amp; particularly my face for ongoing well-known dementia concerns.  </li>
            <li>did, doesn&#x27;t leave a pastie whiteness like other mineral sunblock, and I can use it on my face without getting pimples, which is huge for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially interested because of online reviews, and looked up the EWG&#x27;s rating of &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; for this product, which means it&#x27;s rated as low hazard and high efficacy.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida so sunscreen is a must.  </li>
            <li>I bought this before a trip to New Mexico in the summer, where it was sunny and ninety degrees.  </li>
            <li>and we live in the south, and she&#x27;s never gotten burned while wearing this.</li>
            <li>Given that I live in Florida, going without sunscreen isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>It is a safer product than some nationally known brands, so I will live with it and buy it again.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m on the hunt for a new zinc sunblock.</li>
            <li>I live in Vegas and this Sunscreen has helped me avoid getting sunburn and skin discomfort.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice that much of a smell - used it on my exposed body areas like legs, hands and neck but not the face as I think it would be hard to put makeup on top of it though.</li>
            <li>effect as there are with so many other zinc oxide sunscreens on the market by other brands (Neutrogena, looking at you right now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are extremely careful with the products we put onto ourselves especially for the kids, so after some research I was so glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li>There is a slight white cast left upon application but it quickly fades and our summer pictures show a healthy, tanned smiling kid.</li>
            <li>Aside from those issues it is a decent sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We went back to our regular Banana Boat Tear Free sunblock to protect us from sunburn, despite the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Blends in without leaving a white mask; smells fresh without being overly fragrant; keeps my kids&#x27; sensitive skin rash- and eczema-free.  </li>
            <li>and you can tell it has a healthy coat on the skin to prevent a burn on my little one!</li>
            <li>I love this product because I have the piece of mind knowing that the hormone disruptors are not in this product, and it will protect my little ones from the damaging sun and is water proof!  </li>
            <li>Smells lovely and protects my little man well!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as white as other high zinc screens and is easy to disguise with a little powder/bronzer (I skip the powder most of the time unless I need to look put together).</li>
            <li>My toddler has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also, she has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My daughter has VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Too bad because it has SUCH a wonderful texture and goes on so nicely compared to a lot of other physical sunblocks.</li>
            <li>Applies very easily with little to no white residue on their skin.  </li>
            <li>This sunblock fulfills all my requirements and I am so pleased with this product, now using exclusively this one for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li>When you first apply, it comes out as a white cream that seems to linger on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first time he&#x27;s ever burned, so I&#x27;m going back to California Baby.</li>
            <li>Think baby feels just like normal sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t have that oily feel that some natural brands have.</li>
            <li>After a TON of research, we started buying this sunscreen last summer to avoid the toxic ingredients in most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>we missed a spot during application and it burned pretty red, but anywhere that was covered was no problem at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other physical sunscreen and they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couole of months now and my 6 month old has not burned once!</li>
            <li>We used it for the first time last weekend at the beach.</li>
            <li>At first, the product will leave a white sheen to the skin but it goes away after 15-20mins.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd purchase of non-chemical sunblock for my toddler (the first was Badger Baby).</li>
            <li>I recently purchased thinkbaby for the first time.  </li>
            <li>So far no burning for me or her!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe, mineral based, and relatively non-greasy compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to block pores on my face- no pimples so far!  </li>
            <li>I have found it to be exact opposite.  </li>
            <li>It definitely wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.  </li>
            <li>Easy to rub in with wiggly little kids and not as sticky as a lot of mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s little strong for baby.  </li>
            <li>I did try to keep her out of the sun as much as possible but after 8 days of playing in the sand and water she never burned and came back as pale and fair as she was when she arrived.</li>
            <li>It has clean ingredients and a very low rating on the EWG Skin Deep Database</li>
            <li>I used MY normal SPF 15 lotion from another company on my face and the only thing that got slightly burnt was my nose (because I sweat there the most) and</li>
            <li>The high SPF and low toxicity can&#x27;t be argued and I will try to keep using this when the sun is intense.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many of the all-natural chemical free sunscreens and found most to be thick and difficult to apply with one thing or another that didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, as it was easy to use, little amounts were needed, and it worked!</li>
            <li>Smells great, goes on easily, and doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it!</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t go on too thick like some other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works well and doesn&#x27;t feel too thick like many other baby/kid sunscreens available.</li>
            <li>Goes on hazy-white but clears over time which I find very useful when slathering down our toddler.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight citrus scent that I actually enjoy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not greasy and with slight coconut smell.</li>
            <li>if I had been less cheap</li>
            <li>They work well, and they&#x27;re so much better for my sensitive skin than chemical sunscreens, but usually they smell like clay</li>
            <li>The same is true when it is mixed with old fashioned titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li>It leaves a slight white residue, but it&#x27;s still one of better organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I would love if they had a 9oz with a equal or less price per oz.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four because the smell is not very pleasant, but I&#x27;ll take that if it means safe protection for my child.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to apply and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a physical sunblock, which means it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear when applied, but I find it to be less noticeable than many of the others.</li>
            <li>It was also pretty easy to wash off, we just wet a towel and rubbed him down before his bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It must be said that my kiddos are not fair skinned and tan very easily.</li>
            <li>THis sunscreen is thick and takes a little work to rub in, but I love that it is a higher SPF than most other baby sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Having so much disappointment with natural sunscreens, I myself started using Blue Lizard which is quick to apply, offers good sun protection, but isn&#x27;t so natural.     </li>
            <li>I just had a little sunburn on the back of my neck and top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li>a little fresh lemon smell... and not so much like chemical.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell, its a little minerally smelling.</li>
            <li>Not only that this doesn&#x27;t fade away easily due to its strong water resistance.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>a little thick and if I put just a smidge too much on it&#x27;ll leave me white as a ghost, but it works great.</li>
            <li>With a little bit of online research, I learned that it is very rare to have an allergy to zinc oxide.</li>
            <li>It rubs on smooth and leaves a minimal white haze on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The most pronounced two adverse effects are premature aging of skin and skin cancer, not to mention horrible immediate redness and tenderness followed by peeling of skin which can cancel your all joy from a beach</li>
            <li>So far no burns and this size should last the whole summer.</li>
            <li>Taking 1 star off as it doesn&#x27;t spread clear</li>
            <li>And my face is clear all day.</li>
            <li>We bought this for a trip to Florida for my 6 month old.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my 8 month old baby boy.  </li>
            <li>Four adults, two children and a 4 month old baby went to the beach one day.  </li>
            <li>My three year old does not mind having this sunscreen put on at all.</li>
            <li>The watery part of this product completely separated from the cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the least toxic brands to use on my face, and while I&#x27;m ok with using this brand on my body, I&#x27;ve found an alternative for my face:</li>
            <li>I switched to All Natural Organic Ayurvedic Mineral SPF30 Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen started about well, but by the time I got halfway through it, the remaining sunscreen had become completely liquid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my baby since she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li>Yet in spring 2015 it is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 6 month old at the time</li>
            <li>I can use it on my body, but it irritates my face (my face is extremely sensitive).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the easiest to spread of all zinc oxide sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s been alive.</li>
            <li>I trust this sunscreen completely and don&#x27;t ever see a reason to switch to another.</li>
            <li>traditional sunscreens, from beginning to end, it takes me about 2 minutes to apply to my whole body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used natural sunscreens (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) for about one year now.</li>
            <li>I switched from California Baby to this for my 5 year old son.</li>
            <li>None of the pictures from last summer could be really printed for framing.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I started using it when my son was about a year old.  </li>
            <li>My dad also started using it because he developed sensitivity to chemical sunscreens and titanium dioxide, but this one works with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and protected</li>
            <li>So far this is working well for my toddler.</li>
            <li>I like the orange ice cream smell, so does my 6 year old boy, but not my 8 year old boy.</li>
            <li>We did a lot of research before settling on this sunscreen for our 6 month old son.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that I really wish you got more for your money.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and this sunscreen has not irritated her skin at all.</li>
            <li>My child is 1 year old now</li>
            <li>So if you can avoid being under direct sunlight between 10am and 3pm</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for my 8 yr old swimmer and tennis player.  </li>
            <li>and I used this on me and my 3 yr old &amp; neither of us ever burned.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My 1 year old sits on my hubby&#x27;s lap</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Bought this to use on my extremely sensitive skinned 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-rated by the EWG as far as safety and ingredients, and it has protected well and held up with sweat for our purposes.</li>
            <li>but I bought it for my 6 month old.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t burned so far either.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 2 year old and so far has kept him from getting burned.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this all summer on our (now) 6 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave much sticky residue, and there are not clumpy white bits.  </li>
            <li>This product does this naturally.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 mo old son.</li>
            <li>All natural, no chemical sunscreens are going to do that.  </li>
            <li>The tubes that were sent were complete liquid.</li>
            <li>I even used it when he was 3 months old</li>
            <li>Even applying generous amount of this sunscreen with frequent application, it did not help me or my children avoid getting tan or sun</li>
            <li>I bought this after reviewing a lot of sunscreens for my 6 month old and now she and I use this exclusively.</li>
            <li>This will suit my grown-up sensitive acne-prone skin!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>my daughter used this on my 3 and 5 year old grandchildren at the beach</li>
            <li>This does the job, however, will leave you with a bit of the &amp;#34;ghost face&amp;#34;, especially if you put too much on.</li>
            <li>Not one of us got burned being outside in the sun for over a week straight.  </li>
            <li>This means it&#x27;ll last a bit longer because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.  </li>
            <li>No sunburn here on our 4 week old baby</li>
            <li>We put this on her even though she was not in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>One of them has sensitive skin and did not have any reaction to this.  </li>
            <li>works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet.</li>
            <li>Solar RX Therapeutic Sunblock SPF 30 - very moisturizing, transparent, non-irritating to the eyes, but does not block the sun enough</li>
            <li>enough&lt;br /&gt;DeVita Professional Skin Care - Ultra Solar 50 - not moisturizing, transparent, irritates eyes, does not block the sun enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and all over my 6 month old baby.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out a few different mineral sunscreens and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>The benefits far outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t use much at all - i can see this tube lasting almost a year.  </li>
            <li>I received an unexpected box of sample products that included a couple bottles of this sunscreen so we have been using it during swim lessons.</li>
            <li>So far this sunscreen has served me well.  </li>
            <li>natural sunscreens-</li>
            <li>This one absorbs well and although it goes on white, it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a sheen.</li>
            <li>It goes on white, but rubs in very well.</li>
            <li>In regards to fragrance, I was worried because it would irritate eczema skin, and I have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking my two year old daughter to a swimming pool.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter won&#x27;t use it because of the scent.</li>
            <li>(some natural sunscreens can be runny--this one was not).  </li>
            <li>because I completely forgot to put ANYTHING on them).</li>
            <li>I use it on my six month old baby and three year old.</li>
            <li>Would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t need to be reapplied so frequently.</li>
            <li>We tried a variety of sunscreens (Target brand, Coppertone Water Babies, Banana Boat Natural, etc.).</li>
            <li>He still developed the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to really rub it in for the white film to go away.  </li>
            <li>When we put it on him, it of course ended up in his eyes because he is 6 months old.</li>
            <li>For people with sensitive skin this sunscreen is gentle enough for a baby, but offers all the protection anyone could ever need.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, all of my expectations have been met.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is that you really have to blend into the skin because it&#x27;s a heavier creme than what she is used too.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>We go to the pool several times a week, this is nice and thick, although a pain to wash off your hands.</li>
            <li>have tried many natural sunscreens and either they have been too thick to spread or didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I wish I could love this sunscreen, but after applying a thick layer to my 2 year old&#x27;s body, he still got a burn.</li>
            <li>and I live in San Francisco where high heat exposure is likely, even in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For this, I use a wash cloth and put cool water on it, then I rub down the areas I applied sunscreen to..</li>
            <li>I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and fairly clear compared to the others I&#x27;ve tried that take some serious work in order to get all the way rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>First time I opened this sunscreen, I had to drain so much water and half of the tube was gone.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, rubs in easily, not too thick.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s slower than the traditional counterpart, it&#x27;s much better than some of the other physical sunscreens that would take 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>I sent one brand back because I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled, and put up with looking white from other brands, not knowing there was a better one out there.</li>
            <li>In my two previous orders, I have received tubes full of liquid, but I kept returning them until I got the product in tact.</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen and not as thick as some of the other baby ones.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen for our baby, it&#x27;s a little thick but goes on easy and seems to last without being too sticky.</li>
            <li>but if you rub it in well (easily and quickly accomplished) and don&#x27;t use an excessive quantity (doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way), the white really isn&#x27;t noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it was just a bad batch - good luck to everyone trying it!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the separation of ingredients, when I opened the tube, there was clear watery liquid coming my out first and then white creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>Went on vacation to Key West when our baby was only 2.5 months old and this worked real well!</li>
            <li>(btw - i am NOT associated in any way with this company &amp; a rarely do reviews on amazon - even though my ups driver is here constantly due to them -</li>
            <li>It is all natural, contains high concentration of zinc oxide and yet does not leave a white cast even though in does not use nano technology which I want to avoid.</li>
            <li>It still leaves a bit more of a white residue than say Coppertone, but not nearly as noticeable as some other natural brands.</li>
            <li>Expensive, small tube and not the best scent in the world, but works well</li>
            <li>Overall, a decent product to try.</li>
            <li>I tried a few different sunscreens from EWG&#x27;s skin deep 1 rating, and this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve liked so far.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty much a physical sunblock -- goes on white, and kinda keeps you ghostly!</li>
            <li>but that is also to be expected since you can&#x27;t get 100% coverage really from any normal sunscreen</li>
            <li>With that kind of family history, we take sunscreen very seriously.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite pin down what it is, but it&#x27;s soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>BUT, it burns like no other if you get it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a sunscreen without the harmful chemicals in it, but no sun protection pretty much makes it useless.</li>
            <li>On super pale, freckled kids ranging from 8 years old to 1 year old.</li>
            <li>This goes on a little white, and is a little oily, but overall it rubs in, works well and is rated very highly by [...] as being very safe and non-toxic.</li>
            <li>I would never again use such a highly perfumed product on my baby.</li>
            <li>When I was in the market of trying new sunscreens I ordered this and Babo Botanicals 30 SPF Clear Zinc Sunscreen at the same time.</li>
            <li>It worked when new but 8 months later has zero effectiveness on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>I found it a little more difficult to spread this out since it&#x27;s a lotion, and I&#x27;m used to using more runny/thin sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay; a little too white to wear as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but I also haven&#x27;t been exposed to strong and direct sun lately even while living in Florida.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is not super thick or greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only wish price were a little less, but still VERY MUCH worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about sunscreen for myself, so I was even more critical about choosing a sunscreen for my very pale baby.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re a huge pain in the butt to rub into your skin, and they usually end up being even greasier than chemical sunscreens once you do blend them in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy at first but fine once it absorbs a little.</li>
            <li>Still a little think and pasty but better than other natural sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li>I want the highest ZO especially when it is priced right since ZO is expensive and more</li>
            <li>so, it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry up as I&#x27;m putting it on like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Later that night, I noticed that my skin was super scaly and literally felt like sandpaper compared to my other hand.</li>
            <li>So it is hard to apply it without dripping some of the precious fluid on the ground or clothing.</li>
            <li>California Baby good, but heavy, hard to rub in, and has the micronized titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li>I will be tossing the entire new bottle.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be my new regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.)</li>
            <li>The rash was clearly itchy and only a couple doses of Benedryl would clear it</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t turn you completely white, just a very hint of white depending on the amount applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not BAD, really, but not good either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rub on, it is thick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and reasonably easy to apply, but it leaves the baby smelling like cake.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2015, all the major players are starting to produce physical sunscreens!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the product probably because it had so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>A little pastey but covers very well!!</li>
            <li>Still seeking a broad spectrum go-to...</li>
            <li>My toddlers have never got burned with it on and they play in a very hot climate everyday.</li>
            <li>If you look into the chemicals on a lot of the major brands you will see how harmful some of those products can be.  </li>
            <li>Rubs on and absorbs just fine leaving only a slight white cast.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and rubs in easy, so they don&#x27;t have the white haze some other products leave behind on their skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend first moisturizing with CeraVe moisturizing Lotion (not Cream, but rather Lotion, there are two different products) and once the CeraVe lotion &amp;#34;sinks in&amp;#34; then apply this product, otherwise, the zinc oxide will &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; the dry cuticles/dry flakes on your fingers/</li>
            <li>My other sunscreen products didn&#x27;t score anywhere near as highly in safety factors, as did this item, but I KNOW, for a FACT, that sunscreen works for aging &amp;, I believe, skin cancer!  </li>
            <li>It does have a slight white cast upon application but that quickly fades.</li>
            <li>Thinkbaby wins hands down!</li>
            <li>Too bad, otherwise this seemed like a great product.</li>
            <li>Unless you have hair, which kind of makes it more difficult and leaves that Casper look behind.  </li>
            <li>--they turn red and clearly bother her.</li>
            <li>However, I also have sensitive skin and have developed rashes and acne breakouts after using several different brands of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Our family has extremely sensitive skin and multiple family members have been diagnosed with melanoma.</li>
            <li>The only concern is with one the ingredient: \\&quot;natural fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Considering the recent report about harmful ingredients in a lot of the sunscreeens meant for young ones makes me worry.</li>
            <li>I used it on my one year old on a recent beach trip.</li>
            <li>Definitely prevented my 14 month old from getting sun burnt this summer.</li>
            <li>Our whole family used this on our vacation in Hawaii and we did not have even the slightest pink tone from a sunburn.</li>
            <li>We took my ten month old daughter to Las Vegas and it was sunny 100plus weather.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and is Casper white.</li>
            <li>, I am searching for, yet, a natural sunscreen that is not as greasy and doesn&#x27;t make skin white.</li>
            <li>It was much thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Go buy Blue Lizard Sensitive or Baby instead...</li>
            <li>I got this for my 6 month old and have used it a few times so far and really like it.</li>
            <li>They should be worn especially by children although I, as an adult men, got used to wearing one</li>
            <li>Actually, I would go as far as to say the Thinkbaby sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy after absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently vacationed to the Eastern Caribbean with my husband and 2 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Used it daily on my 16 month old for 2 weeks at the beach.  </li>
            <li>my skin is so soft after applying it &amp; stays that way the vast majority of the day, if not all day.  </li>
            <li>I apply this liberally and go out for moderate amounts of time (often over an hour) to my garden in direct sun</li>
            <li>but you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>What can i say, i finally found the natural sunscreen for our family.</li>
            <li>It is natural and a physical sunscreen with zinc oxide and does not rub in all the way.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would repurchase tis again as I prefer to use natural products.</li>
            <li>niece had a similar problem at a young age, so my sister took her to an allergist.</li>
            <li>Finally found a sunblock for my son that doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i am in my early 60s - which has shocked more than a few dermatologists when they initially meet me - which may account a tad for my skin loving the richness of this formulation.  </li>
            <li>Love the thin packing-great for a purse.</li>
            <li>It actually goes on pretty dry and pulls on skin when you don&#x27;t use enough.</li>
            <li>A new study shows that vitamin E actually increases skin cancer when applied topically.</li>
            <li>There is a slight white cast to your skin, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me - hairy arms/legs and often have scruff on your face - this is pretty much not useful because it&#x27;s so hard to rub in and takes awhile to apply and leaves too much of a white look (after lots of rubbing, I looked &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>The only cons for me is the price for just a little amount, and it does run out really fast !!</li>
            <li>I can see one tube lasting at least 3 weeks, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen rubs in much easier than other zinc oxide sunscreens like CA Baby and Johnsons Zinc.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be very water resilient and it doesn&#x27;t leave my childs skin looking chalky or irridescent like some other brands.</li>
            <li>Also, very cost-friendly compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is a little thick, you have to use kind of a lot to spread evenly anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>It goes on smelling like orange cream but then refers back to smelling like Thinksport, which is not so great but not too bad either.  </li>
            <li>fashioned zinc oxide sunscreen is safe, effective, but miserable to wear.</li>
            <li>A bit expensive, but feel safe to apply on my kids who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Applies very easily - smooth but still thick enough to coat well.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen slightly irritates my super sensitive skin (ezcema and acne on my face), but for the most part it is much less irritating than the majority of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>my little one, for the first time, stuck out her tongue and tried to lick the smell...</li>
            <li>Despite having used half the bottle on our family in only one afternoon, we are all very very crispy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other baby sunscreens and they worked fine</li>
            <li>Goes on white and pasty looking, but rubs right in and soaks in after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It appears to be not lasting very long during normal non-water sports usage - didn&#x27;t do a scientific testing but just feel like it</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a little thick to apply, like most natural ones.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on other chemical filled baby sunscreen</li>
            <li>For me, they spread much easier than other similar products.  </li>
            <li>Overall definitely worth the few extra bucks if your considering a healthier option for your family!</li>
            <li>and I feel it truely protects their delicate skin.</li>
            <li>There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed.</li>
            <li>First few times a bit too liquid/separated.  </li>
            <li>This gets very tricky especially if you have active boys like me.</li>
            <li>Other zinc-based products are really hard to rub in but this one goes on nicely, is not sticky or greasy and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I tried it a second day being careful to apply it thickly, under straps and made sure to rub it in well and waited 30 minutes before going outside.</li>
            <li>and my daughter doesnt mind it, unlike the more thick white paste like ones of some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that my family only needed two bottles on a week long vacation.</li>
            <li>particular product has 20% zinc oxide as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.</li>
            <li>I wanted something I could use on my face when outside that had a high SPF, but could also use on other parts of my body without smelling like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Protects very well and slightly easier to wash off than regular thinksport sunblock.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t super thick and doesn&#x27;t leave your face all white and chalky.  </li>
            <li>Since it was a low cost compared to other similar products and I like the fact that the SPF is so high, I&#x27;m giving this a 3 as there&#x27;s value to it.</li>
            <li>What I like is that it goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t have to rub it in very hard for the white to disappear.  </li>
            <li>My son also developed very dry patches on his skin after using this.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has worked very well for the two little faces in our household</li>
            <li>Maybe a little too much like cake.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after much research and debate for our little guy</li>
            <li>I like the cream itself, seems to be gentle enough for our little one but every time I use it</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it would leave me looking white and pastey, but with just a little extra rubbing, it blends very well</li>
            <li>it goes on so easily and is not sticky or thick like a lot of the other safer ones.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s def not that bad if u have fair skin.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not all the bad junk, and no sunburn.  </li>
            <li>But it is hugely overrated considering its really poor visual / cosmestic effect.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> We bought this sunscreen after tons of research on the best product for an infant.</li>

            <li> the best price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found</li>

            <li> This purchase was solely based on ewg.org ratings (the best website, you should put it in your favorites!).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And, it smells SO GOOD!!</li>
            <li> It was the perfect sun screen (with exception of the smell).</li>

            <li> I bought it to use it on the body so that I do not have to use chemical sunscreens, but this one is very matte and fades away after rubbing it so well that I can use it perfectly on the face also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We ended up loving the Honest sunscreen and now it came out in a spray form</li>
            <li> Do one area at a time and it blends in so nicely.</li>

            <li> In a constant frustration to find a good all around sunscreen, I am very impressed with thinkbaby brand.  </li>
            <li> Although it has a light and pleasant fragrance, I did not have any allergy issues.  </li>
            <li> so it makes me feel like it&#x27;s good quality, but it&#x27;s easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> Good consistency and applies easily.</li>
            <li> We do subscribe and save on this item because we fly through it so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It smells yummy and goes on very easily.  </li>
            <li> Its texture is not too greasy and it spreads out very easily.</li>

            <li> Neither of us have had any burns, I don&#x27;t feel like it washes off very easily in the bath/shower</li>
            <li> very easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong coconut smell (that attracts every bug in a 5 mile radius to you), and it is a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and love that I can pronounce and understand ALL the ingredients!  </li>
            <li> :) We love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highest rating for safety on a completely unbiased website!  </li>
            <li> I gave it a good shake and it seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li> We loved it, we applied it 3x/day in SoCal while outdoors as well as on the road and baby is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind it because it&#x27;s such a great sunscreen with good ingredients!</li>
            <li> The best natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Having tried may sunscreens, in search of one we liked that is also rated well on the EWG as being safe and non-toxic, this is one of our favorites.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I tested so far.</li>
            <li> My family has had great success with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, kind of orangy.  </li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best natural mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s keeping baby safe from harmful rays AND chemicals.</li>
            <li> Getting a safe and effective sunscreen is like threading a needle, I suppose.</li>
            <li> If they can use safe but effective  sized particles of zinc, why not of titanium too?</li>
            <li> As far as we can tell, it works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cruelty free and rated good with the EWG</li>
            <li> My 2 year old is very fair and wore this all summer without getting a sunburn!</li>
            <li> It also smells kind of refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the performance of this product so far.</li>
            <li> The best natural sunscreen my family has ever used.  </li>
            <li> This looked like one of the best options as far as reviews and</li>
            <li> favorite kind of sunscreen to get.</li>
            <li> The best natural sunscreen for children that I have found.</li>
            <li> is the best so far that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good size I can fit in my bag.</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells great - fresh and citrus-like.</li>
            <li> Bonus is that it rubs in completely, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells great!</li>
            <li> It is like wearing nothing at all for protection, and yet the protection it offers is awesome.</li>
            <li> Scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great smell and protected my 11 month old&#x27;s extremely fair skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 different kinds of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunscreens &amp; I liked this one the best.</li>
            <li> Goes on very easy (unlike many others) and has worked well in the sun preventing burns.</li>
            <li> Not only is it rated great by the EWG (the reason I purchased it), but it smells good, goes on nicely, and we have had no incidences of sunburn in our family.  </li>
            <li> I rarely review products, but this sunscreen is amazing!  </li>
            <li> and it worked great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> This is a quite good baby sunscreen and the most important thing it is safe to use.</li>
            <li> It rubs in easily, very light scent and lasts well in the water.  </li>
            <li> After applying the sunscreen to my skin, it feels very light</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very very light, so if that is what you are going after it is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff, the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without making my face break out.  </li>

            <li> Safe for baby&#x27;s and sensitive skin (I use it on my face) and it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, but causes me and my kids to have dry flaky skin after using it.</li>
            <li> But it does rub in mostly and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It smells great, goes on smoothly and it is super safe</li>
            <li> Its texture blends in perfectly, didnt leave white cast or oily residue and very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> For us, Thinkbaby offers very good sun protection, absorbs easliy and does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This is great, non-toxic sunscreen for a decent price!</li>
            <li> One of our top picks for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a safe version of sunscreen for their children.</li>

            <li> (see the EWG Sunscreen Guide for more info on what&#x27;s in your environmental products and their safety).</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s totally safe, and I think this sunscreen rubs in much better than babyganics.</li>

            <li> Melanoma risk doubles when one has more than 5 sunburns.  </li>
            <li> but except that, I love this</li>
            <li> We purchased this cream to protect our baby from the sun and it we are glad we did.</li>
            <li> While we do take all precautions to shade her from the sun, we feel confident that when her skin is exposed, she won&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;re fairly sure it came from this.</li>
            <li> Smooth and smells nice.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re buying more for the upcoming summer</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than the chemical sunscreens, not for us.</li>
            <li> Make sure to read the instructions and reapply as directed though.  </li>
            <li> We use this Thinkbaby and babyganics on hubby and I when we travel to the tropics, it protects wonderful especially our faces, a 50 SPF protection is a must,</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> product is supposed to be so safe for baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I read a blog that had given it a top review.</li>
            <li> I really love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It blends very well without leaving my son looking pasty and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It is hands-down my favorite for my son.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d say it has a light, nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Burnout worked better even though that has a tendency to crust around the cap when the kids &amp;#34;serve&amp;#34; themselves.</li>
            <li> My kids haven&#x27;t had a sunburn all year and they love to apply this.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock.</li>
            <li> This is rated &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; by the EWG meaning that it&#x27;s top rated for being safe for baby and the environment.</li>
            <li> The consistency is lighter (more like lotion than paste)</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen for our kids.  </li>
            <li> Kids love it too.  </li>
            <li> My favorite baby sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Have used this many times and baby has no tan/burn.</li>
            <li> I make sure to rub it in my hands before applying so</li>
            <li> This sunscreen gets top marks from EWG on safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did my research and found a product that works for my family.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One person suggested adding titanium for even better performance.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells like orange creamsicle.</li>
            <li> We decided to go with mineral based and we love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second comes appropriate clothing and accessories.</li>
            <li> So not knowing these details may get you unprotected while you mistakenly believe you are safe...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The &#x27;innocent&#x27; guys are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love that it isn&#x27;t supposed to be eaten</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been able to find sunscreen that can be eaten, either.</li>
            <li> I will say though that because it is more liquidy we do end up using more</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 more tubes.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I prefer a spray, and am not a fan of lotion.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered 4 more tubes for this summer.</li>
            <li> and I was able to return the product for a refund.</li>
            <li> Will order more..</li>
            <li> And it is safe for kids.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have any prominently chapped lips</li>
            <li> you want to look your best, as far as stuff you can apply to your skin, sunscreen is the primary tool in your toolkit.</li>
            <li> My family and I love this product.</li>
            <li> love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> So you will end up buying more than what you need.</li>
            <li> I found myself trying to blend this in a bit more whenever I looked at my arms and</li>
            <li> But I just wish it was easier to blend and a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Kept baby safe in July sun</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for a daily sunscreen for my son!</li>

            <li> Excellent product, EWG pick, low toxicity.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I also feel it blocks better &amp; more waterproof because of thickness.</li>
            <li> Check out Environmental Working Group sunscreen review to see toxicty in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Compared to California Baby, Thinkbaby&#x27;s sunscreen is much more manageable.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, and assumed I would because of all of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking, however, for something better.</li>
            <li> It smells like orangey vanilla creamsicle though so its ok for us to use once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My tube has an expiration date of 2016, so I thought I would be ok to use the rest of it up this year.</li>
            <li> She was subjected to many tests, none conclusive.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>

            <li> Thinkbaby is our favorite brand now for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but it actually goes on very nicely and smells fruity too!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> The fact that I have the time to be able to rub it in all the way (babies aren&#x27;t exactly the most patient people in the world when it comes to sitting still) is good.</li>
            <li> All this mom wants is a safe AND EFFECTIVE sunscreen and this one isn&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li> However, if he rubs it in more while he is first applying it he can get good coverage and avoid the ashy look.</li>
            <li> For the high level of safety and for the sun protection this did great.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage… Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, rubs in well, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> But on top of that, it was so easy to smooth onto my skin!</li>
            <li> It rubs in much more easily than most Zinc based screens and we never get burned.</li>
            <li> It is easy to spread, does not leave too much residue, does not smell and protects great.</li>
            <li> It smells very pleasant, isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and definitely blocks the sun out!</li>
            <li> I like that is not thick and it smells great.</li>
            <li> We spend long days on the boat and this sunsreen has protected my son wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great product, love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and none go on as easily and transparently as this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mineral-based but easy to rub in (unlike Badger and others) and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell that some others have.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite baby sunscreen, easy to spread and seems to work.</li>
            <li> I tried The Honest Co mineral sunscreen and it was SUPER greasy and made her break out in a rash</li>
            <li> The Thinkbaby Safe Suncreen SPF 50+ smells really good, and it goes on pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li> light scented… very smooth</li>
            <li> Just make sure to reapply when you&#x27;re supposed to and it should work just fine.</li>
            <li> Has a strong citrus type of scent, I&#x27;d like it better if it wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li> Very good one, we were looking for a similar one</li>
            <li> and we both have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t experienced any rashes or skin break outs.</li>
            <li> Smooth elegant application.</li>
            <li> Love it, except wish it was fragrance free</li>
            <li> Of course, most importantly it does it&#x27;s job-</li>
            <li> With &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; ingredients, I feel more comfortable to use it on our daughter and the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truly, the most indispensable tool in your cosmetic kit is sunscreen as sun exposure is the number one cause of &amp;#34;skin unhappiness&amp;#34; in both men and women as well as the leading factor in skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Tried another highly rated sunscreen that is also very popular with those looking for a healthier alternative to chemical filled sunscreens, but my son burned.  </li>
            <li> WIth the high environmental-friendly code and pleasant smell, I have recommended this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> It goes on much more smoothly than Badger brand, the one we used before, but Badger didn&#x27;t smell as strongly nor did it irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs nicely, and all in all a great physical sunscreen especially compared to what is offered out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very nice scent that is neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a good consistency, and a very light, natural scent.</li>
            <li> I have used virtually every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen on my toddler - this is the best.</li>
            <li> Outside with fair skinned child and no sunburn!</li>
            <li> While getting it all rubbed in can be a challenge, it works well and knowing it&#x27;s safe makes it worth it to me!</li>

            <li> Easy to apply, no fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the baby.</li>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t super greasy and had a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are very safe and gentle too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Physical sunscreens has many brilliant applications over their traditional counterparts, but in my mind, there are two distinct disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is PABA, paraben, phthalate &amp; BPA free.</li>
            <li> I find that I prefer the light smell to no smell at all.</li>
            <li> I used light layers to apply it and added additional amounts where needed.</li>

            <li> One of the best safer less chemical-filled sunscreens I have used!  </li>
            <li> Surely someone can make a formula that is chemical free AND prevents sunburn and sun damage, right?</li>
            <li> I applied this before leaving and the first thing I noticed was it does not spread nicely but instead soaks in rather quickly, so seems to take a lot of product to get your skin covered.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this, in fact, I plan to buy more when mine runs out!</li>
            <li> Otherwise an excellent product-much easier to apply than other sunscreens I have used, accompanied by a mild sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li> It rubs in very easily, smells nice, and you don&#x27;t have any white residue leftover.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far, but like pretty much any product, there are trade-offs...</li>
            <li> Nanoparticle sized makes them pleasant and perhaps just as effective, but I certainly don&#x27;t like the idea of nanoparticles tumbling through my bloodstream like jagged rocks relative to the size of my cells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because of its excellent rating on the ewg skin deep database and the high reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> Consistency is a bit pasty but goes on fairly easy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is the easiest to spread on of any I have tried and rubs in quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quick and easy to remove once you use a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen to any parent looking for a natural, safe, and effective sunscreen for your kids!</li>
            <li> Finding a product that can protect the children safely from the sun, I&#x27;d be willing to pay any price.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a considerable price and knowing that it is safe for my children is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> However, I planned on using this on my toddler as well, so I decided to do a patch test on the top of my hand first.</li>
            <li> This is some pretty potent stuff to have done that to my skin.</li>
            <li> The higher the ZO, the more SPF.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> :) can work like a gel and keep my baby&#x27;s bangs out of his eyes which is a bonus ;)</li>
            <li> Perfect for small kids though.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> It also does a great job of protecting my toddler&#x27;s delicate skin (its most important role!).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a ingredient friendly sunscreen and found this.</li>
            <li> So far it works quite well on my very fair skinned, bald 15 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> ( Smells nice and spreads much better than most of the other ones we have tried.</li>
            <li> I live in a warm humid climate</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, rubs in nicely, and protects completely.</li>
            <li> I also have tried several brands of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen, this is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens in an effort to find one that is low in terms of health risks/chemicals added, while also being effective and non-oily.  </li>
            <li> I got this at Whole Foods and had to get it when I saw it on Amazon, I love this scent and it goes on smoothly on both my kids.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> They are fair, blue eyes and light hair.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen spreads on pretty easily (much easier than Baby Badger types) and has a nice light scent to it.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much! :) :)</li>
            <li> It seemed so good on our first two uses, I&#x27;ve already bought more to last through the summer.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair skinned little girl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase, this sunscreen rubs in so much easier than Honest and is way less greasy.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, slightly citrus-y and maybe a hint of coconut, but light and nice.  </li>
            <li> Good protection but other mineral products blend on skin better.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend specially to a person with oily skin problem.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t purchase again for that reason, but this is a great option for those who don&#x27;t need to be so careful.</li>
            <li> Her eyes were bright red each time after using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It rubs into the skin pretty well, but not as good as the old formulation of Burn out</li>
            <li> It smells good, isn&#x27;t too greasy, doesn&#x27;t make your face all white.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen based on the low toxicity and chemicals in this sunscreen and based on its good rating on the EWG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is a red head with the extremely fair skin to go with it.  </li>
            <li> This is our absolute favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh and it doesn&#x27;t not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last summer because the good reviews.</li>
            <li> makers of Thinkbaby seem to have come up with a good idea -- make the zinc oxide particles smaller, but not nano-sized.</li>
            <li> My experience is that this product does protect me from the sun, although the true SPF might not be 50+.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are all physical barrier which is good.  </li>
            <li> Those ingredients are believed to be relatively harmless while offering good UV</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind the instructions and re-apply regularly and you are good to go...</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind the instructions and re-apply regularly and you are good to go...</li>
            <li> It has sweet scent like vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and goes on thick, so I feel like she is well protected.</li>
            <li> The smell of it is sweet and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;One of the top rated baby sunscreens, so whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> For the more sun intense work days I have (living in Africa)</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li> This works into the skin very evenly and as someone who hates the feel of any type of lotion on my skin, I was able to tolerate the feel of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good daily sunscreen, but your baby does get suntan in swimming pool.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think people should use those tubes full of liquid.  </li>
            <li> It smells really good, not like regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I know the kids have full coverage and no missed spots and this provides that.  </li>
            <li> Although I cannot comment on it&#x27;s true effectiveness as when I used it my son was in a stroller with an spf shade on, I do like the smell and the consistency of this along with the price.  </li>
            <li> My 2-year-old son has developed some kind of allergic reaction to an ingredient in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and he had no bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing per say unless you are going to an outdoor wedding or something like that.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not bad for my kids.</li>
            <li> One nice thing about it is that it rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky white residue.</li>
            <li> but it has pretty strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like how this sunscreen is pretty easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Goes on pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Not messy, great sunscreen for my 5 month old baby and for myself!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve found Thinkbaby to be the next best thing to the old formulation of Burn out, which was hands-down my favorite natural/safe sunblock.</li>
            <li> Easy to Apply and very clean natural products</li>
            <li> (separates quickly in tube).</li>
            <li> Nice and thick to provide good protection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with previous reviewers that it is easy to spread or pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs quickly and goes away.</li>
            <li> No greasy feel, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell (slightly tropical) which is not overly strong...</li>
            <li> Nice and thick for good coverage.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it all that much yet, but will post an update if I&#x27;m not just as happy as I am upon initial use!</li>
            <li> No smell apart from a mild fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;-Price</li>
            <li> It does goes quickly though.</li>
            <li> She specifically recommended this as her favorite brand of sunscreen to wear daily on the face, because it contains SAFE ingredients and is without carcinogens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been poring over information and reviews about the most natural, non-toxic sunscreen available, without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for work, running errands, but sweats off in intense humidity and physical activity.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it protected my child from getting a sunburn and it didn&#x27;t break out his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I tend to reapply after about 4 hours in the pool for my super fair-skinned daughter, but for everybody else, once in the morning</li>
            <li> and I needed to get something from the store quick and one of my twins&#x27; eyes puffed up and his skin broke out.  </li>
            <li> With the high concentration of zinc oxide (20%), I&#x27;d expect better performance.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that this was one of the most highly rated baby sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It is such a great sunscreen normally!</li>
            <li> We like the sunscreen very much since its quite hot here in Guangdong China and my baby needs this, easy to clean</li>
            <li> This sunscreen gets the best rating from the Environmental Working Group ([...]) but is still easy to apply, unlike other products that receive the same rating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all those general information, here comes my hands on experience after two months of use:&lt;br /&gt;-It is effective:</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> the humidity here is super high, it is summer time and this sunscreen is so GREASY!!!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our most recent trip to Disney World for my 1 year old who is VERY fair skinned and has sensitive skin in addition.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, less oily than</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very absorbent and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m leaning toward trying another brand since I really dislike the strong scent.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, gentle for children</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and protects very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spreads easily and really protects from sunburn.  </li>
            <li> It applies easily, rubs in well, and has a very slight and pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> The ThinkBaby and ThinkSport go on smoothly, rub in (admittedly with a little more work than sunscreens with microparticles) and in my opinion, smells great - not like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of natural sunscreens for my family over the years and this most recent purchase I have been very pleased with.</li>
            <li> I knew the first time I tried it!  </li>
            <li> One of our girls has sensitive skin but had no problem with this sunscreen, even on the face! :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this sunscreen would fair in all-day-at-the-beach sort of conditions (and I don&#x27;t plan to test it!).  </li>
            <li> We will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> My son went for 4 hours straight on the beach with one application at the hottest time of the day and he did just fine.</li>
            <li> It has the pleasant very light smell of lemon grass and other natural oils.</li>
            <li> This is great sunscreen for little ones.</li>
            <li> This works great for our little one.</li>
            <li> * Proceeds go to a good cause (despite a certain disgraced former</li>
            <li> This product was by far the most reasonably priced option which fit both criteria.</li>
            <li> I now enjoy using Thinkbaby sunscreen, knowing that its ingredients are not unhealthy and that my skin will be protected from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.</li>
            <li> On top of working well and being safer, it has a pleasant, subtle citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I also prefer using products with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to rub in, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> It is not enough on its own.</li>
            <li> I use it on my kids with much success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase many natural sunscreens and this one is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s on the pricier side, it&#x27;s worth it for peace of mind and ease of use.</li>
            <li> The kids got burnt and I applied as directed and even put on more frequently than required.</li>
            <li> safe for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite baby sunscreen</li>
            <li> My first time using for a trip to Cape Cod and my experience was that it was easy to apply and the smell was pleasant and not strong.</li>
            <li> I love that it works for my 1 year old.  </li>
            <li> The texture is much better without any danger so far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> But, I also don&#x27;t want to slather myself in chemicals or nanoparticles of zinc oxide that can be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Thinkbaby has a fresh peachy sort of scent, doesn&#x27;t leave us looking like ghosts, and it WORKS--even at the beach.  </li>
            <li> SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The thinkbaby sunscreens are my favorite natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I used the Honest Company sunscreen last year, but tried this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> BUT be careful not to get this into your loved one&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Basically, it wasn&#x27;t worth my money</li>
            <li> The upside is that this sunblock doesn&#x27;t contain the toxic chemicals (Google it) contained in most sunblocks, however it didn&#x27;t protect us from sunburn like my old &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunblock.</li>
            <li> but these products rarely do</li>
            <li> , it hydrates your skin and makes it soft and smooth, while reversing the signs of sun damage!</li>
            <li> ive tried tons of natural sunscreens and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> It is worth it</li>
            <li> It is worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid of the sun.</li>
            <li> I always try to find sunblocks that are on the &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; more natural side.</li>
            <li> It also applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you ghostly white.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I have something to protect my 10 month old.</li>
            <li> There are many natural mineral sunscreens that pill (roll off).</li>
            <li> far, I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> She did a lot of research for safe sunscreen for our 6 month old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Definitely provides nice protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I thought to use this on myself before ever trusting it on my 3 month old baby.</li>
            <li> Buy Thinkbaby, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> non oily, effective, smells good, non irritating.</li>
            <li> Goes on pretty easily without too much rubbing in.</li>
            <li> :)  A little spreads very easily.  </li>
            <li> Great ingredients - so much safer than other products out there.  </li>
            <li> This is a safe product unlike many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> At first it was fine but after one or two uses I noticed it was really watery with chunks of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> In terms of sun-protection it works extremely well at preventing a sun burn even on fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it rubs in fairly well compared to other brands...</li>
            <li> I just ordered another one from Amazon today and hopefully this order will be as good as the other set I have purchased</li>
            <li> I buy this one (and one other sunscreen) because it has good ratings on the EWG.</li>
            <li> It has a very thick consistency and requires some rubbing in order to avoid a &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; kind of face, but I feel very confident that it protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li> This spreads right on, like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> right over the sunscreen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a triathlete and always looking for the right formula.</li>
            <li> We spent 4 hours in the hot sun at the fair</li>
            <li> Goes on nearly clear(I feel like my body warmth helps it to completely disappear), has a pleasant scent, and has protected my face, tattoo colors and decolletage VERY well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i fell back into using neutrogena pure &amp; free baby when i couldn&#x27;t find a good natural sunscreen as it was zinc &amp; titanium dioxide based with no oxybenzone and no parabens</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and rub in with no white afterglow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply as it spreads well and absorbs quickly, no white residue either.</li>
            <li> it was pretty funny!</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-Really</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-Really</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry or irritated, unlike other zinc oxide sunscreen, love the ingredients, smells like cream biscuit.</li>
            <li> Our fair skinned toddler hasn&#x27;t had a single line or burn yet this summer, and it&#x27;s all thanks to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The chemical sunscreens go from not so safe to much worse, but nanoparticles have not been proven safe, though zinc oxide fares better than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old</li>
            <li> means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days the low ZO works well.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy though it does rub on kind of thick, does not leave significant white cast on fair skin.</li>
            <li> though it seems strange to have this kind of flagrance for sunscreens.)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind that there&#x27;s a time limit on how long it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> my very sensitive daughter was fine with it.</li>
            <li> This one actually rubs in very easily and works really well!  </li>
            <li> I love that this is safer than most sunblock, but some almost always ends up in my little one&#x27;s eyes from her sweating, or rubbing her eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so greasy and it melts right into my daughter&#x27;s eyes when it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li> Pleasant light citrus scent that, for mysterious reasons, makes my 5 year old nearly vomit.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available in more local stores but easy enough to order here.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like the old BurnOut sunscreen which spreads easily and disappears on my face.  </li>
            <li> He developed a bright red splotchy rash.</li>
            <li> My son is a red head and we have had no burns or redness of any kind thanks to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Nice moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The last two times I used this on my fair skinned 10 month old</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, rubs in clear.  </li>
            <li> We spent 10 days in Hawaii with our 8 month old baby and with this sunscreen he never got a tanline, no burns, it worked great.</li>
            <li> this one is great, never got burned, rubs in quite well and is white at first then clear, slight film left on skin but its fine and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that I really like and is also very creamy.  </li>
            <li> I researched online for sunscreen for my 1 year old, this brand was rated as being natural yet effective.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed smoothly and completely into my skin and does the job.</li>
            <li> It worked really well in Florida, swimming in the ocean and very hot sunny days.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my own face as I usually burn easily.</li>
            <li> The bonus is that for a sunscreen this is actually very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very smooth as a moisturiser and does not make skin white after application.</li>
            <li> Parents beware: I thought this was fine for my toddler, but I got the adult version and have burned twice while using it according to product instructions.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that my one-year old occasionally (ie: always) has his hands in his mouth - and I can rest easy knowing that there isn&#x27;t toxic lotion all over him. :)</li>
            <li> That makes it so much easier to get them ready!!</li>
            <li> I found this on the EWG website, where it got the lowest score of 1 for toxicity, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My first reaction upon putting this on my face was, \\&quot;yuck, who chose the scent?\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> Ties for first with the MyChelle line of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> My first time purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I bought this in January and was going to use it for the first time today (March 21)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen and we will never go back!</li>
            <li> At first smells like cookies then smells like metal.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time on a trip to the desert museum and saguaro national park in Tucson, AZ on a 100 degree day, full-sun, from about 10am to 2pm...</li>
            <li> My words of advice, and something I&#x27;ll be more cautious of in the future, is to be aware of anything that might wipe the sunblock off (seat belts, purse straps, towels).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a zinc-based sunblock, which means it&#x27;s a physical sunblock and more prone to coming off.</li>
            <li> Overall it seems to protect against UV pretty well, just make sure you apply liberally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> In the first week using it, he has had 3 sunburns.</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday for the first time this year on my kids.</li>
            <li> About a week later, I used it again and the first thing that spilled out was water, water, and more water.</li>
            <li> Have a fair-skinned child, and this has worked consistently well now for two summers.  </li>
            <li> I think it is just ok especially for the price</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this sunscreen for her two-year-old twin boys since they first ventured into sunshine.</li>
            <li> Since it is for kids, I wish it was fragrance free because kids are so sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I recommend using rash guards (top part of swim suits that can block UV while not causing a big restriction.)</li>
            <li> it is okay especially when considering the availability to order it through subscribe and save and get an additional upto 20% discount (at the time I bought it).</li>
            <li> it is okay especially when considering the availability to order it through subscribe and save and get an additional upto 20% discount (at the time I bought it).</li>
            <li> It is outstanding and going forward will be the only sunscreen I buy.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t stay white and sit on top (like some sunscreens).</li>
            <li> and I first put it on his face, then each arm, then each leg.</li>
            <li> Used it in Vegas while it was really hot</li>
            <li> and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen but does not last for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> And it makes skin soft and smooth, while reversing the signs of sun damage.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great consistency - not liquid and not overly thick like some.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that the skin will still get some sun, so don&#x27;t expect that you will not tan at all.</li>
            <li> Very concerning!</li>
            <li> I find that if you put coconut oil on first, let soak in, then apply sunscreen the application is even easier.  </li>
            <li> When I squeezed it the first thing that came out was water .  </li>
            <li> really well - no one has been sunburned!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, mostly when I&#x27;m out at the beach or hiking.</li>
            <li> First, squeeze out 90% of the water from the tube.</li>
            <li> My current favorite sunscreen for the face.</li>
            <li> It stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a white residue but there isn&#x27;t much of one!</li>
            <li> The only thing tip is you have to shake the tube until it doesn&#x27;t sound like its full of liquid.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had more sun blocking capabilities, but maybe physical sunscreens will never perform as well as chemical ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be a higher SPF&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time on my baby when we went to the beach.  </li>
            <li> This was the first sunscreen that I purchased for my infant -</li>
            <li> We were told numerous times to keep our 5 month baby covered and in the shade for our trip to Hawaii, but we still needed a product for the top of his hands &amp; feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.)</li>
            <li> Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is VERY creamy!  </li>
            <li> Rubs in very well!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll keep buying higher factor sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I still came back &amp; bought more though</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and rubs in so that it&#x27;s clear and non-staining.</li>
            <li> Although there are higher scored sunscreen in the EWG site, I purchase it based on the</li>
            <li> I first like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and ultimately bought for the ratings on Skin Deep.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> After trying more than 10 &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens over the course of the summer, this is the only one that my sensitive-skinned 3-yr-old son can tolerate.  </li>
            <li> Found it through EWG Skin Deep when we were trying to find a safe, non toxic sunscreen for my baby.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how well it works and how safe it is.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because I rubbed my eyes by accident and instantly regretted it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good natural sunscreen for my kids for a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but too creamy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;Expected to be lighter, not as heavy.</li>
            <li> Anyways, a great little thing you need to carry around with you if you live in place like Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> We had good results with this sunblock in dry conditions but when we used it at the pool it came off completely in water.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, smells good, no white residue, does leave a slight greasy feel</li>
            <li> It does go on super white, but it has rubbed in fairly easily for us if we don&#x27;t use too much (toddlers help too.much sometimes ).</li>
            <li> Nice product.. Worked fine for my baby and its delicate on skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for chemical free sunscreen for my little one,finally I found one, there are many sunscreen but those are with chemicals.</li>
            <li> Got home and checked my old bottle and saw that the newer versions first ingredient is now water - would have liked a mention of a different formula.</li>
            <li> My son loves the smell so makes it easy to put on a normally wiggly 3 year old!</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby&#x27;s sunscreen sets a very high quality standard in terms of safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are more natural and less toxic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked okay on my bigger kids, but it was very ineffective on my baby.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and thick (not runny) and I love that it is rated top safety ratings.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve come to the point that I could be 100% confident to say that I know this product very well by now.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not so much considerate of getting 100% SUNSCREEN, which in fact it is made for initially, and you&#x27;re more concerned about environment and your/</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> It has an EWG rating of 1, goes on nice and smooth, not too thick, and I really like the light orange smell (and I tend to be sensitive to smells).</li>
            <li> To be fair, sunscreen was only part of my skin-saving routine, I went in the morning to avoid the harshest UV rays (9:30am) and was only out for two hours.  </li>
            <li> We have tried a number of natural kid-friendly sunscreens and this is by far, the favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the texture and spreadability but the protection cannot be beat which is the most important thing when buying sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I was initially looking for something safe for my baby, but now my whole family uses this product.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent, a little citrusy, not a heavy coverup like in some of the more mainstream sunscreens for babies.</li>
            <li> and my fair haired/blue eyed little one has not burned a bit!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries quickly while you are blending it, so it doesn&#x27;t spread very far and you need more&lt;</li>
            <li> Well worth the (somewhat) high pricetag.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my sensitive face yet, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as shiny as so many others I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> We have used other sunscreens from Badger and other highly recommended brands and this is the best we have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I love that it&#x27;s SPF 50 (instead of the typical 30), it has a top EWG rating (1), and I love the slight citrus scent!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but the texture reminds me exactly of Elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
            <li> pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> Because I bought it almost at the end of summer, I didn&#x27;t use much and didn&#x27;t expose it to hot temperature.</li>
            <li> We are on our second tube of this great sunscreen-it rubs in well, does not leave white streaks and blends in completely.</li>
            <li> Gets overall great reviews for being a safer sunscreen due to it&#x27;s ingredients.  </li>
            <li> We bought one at first to try it and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> all, I am pretty happy about the purchase and apply it without much concern to my kids as an additional sun protection to other methods, I discussed above.</li>
            <li> all, I am pretty happy about the purchase and apply it without much concern to my kids as an additional sun protection to other methods, I discussed above.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural sunscreen that I felt comfortable with him wearing fairly regularly, and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> However, I could get past this since it promises good protection from the sun and didn&#x27;t seem overly greasy on my face.    </li>
            <li> after using it on my 3 year old son for a full week, his skin had a rash</li>
            <li> So I guess the product only good for one summer, then you need to toss it out no matter how much has left in the tube.</li>
            <li> We all have fair skin and usually will sunburn at the beginning of the season, even with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s most sensitive skin - it came out in a white cream which quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The old formula had an offensive, sweet smell that i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase (as a part of the subscribe &amp; save program) and the first one was fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This went on white and rubbed in clear very easily.</li>
            <li> I loved this one - wasn&#x27;t too pasty, although a little stickier than the neutrogena dry touch that I normally use, but was happier knowing that it was &#x27;safer and better&#x27; sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I like it better on my skin than my other favorite - Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li> As a diligent pale skinned sun avoider with 3 fair daughters, I was looking for a physical block that applied without too much white cast, non-runny consistency to avoid getting into kids&#x27; eyes, nice orange scent, and under $12.  </li>
            <li> Rubs in easily with no white leftover on her skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so non-greasy that it&#x27;s the first zinc-based sunscreen that I feel comfortable wearing under makeup on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough that I don&#x27;t burn and rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t feel too gross after applying.  </li>
            <li> Pure watery liquid.  </li>
            <li> So I purchased this from Amazon&#x27;s sister site, Diapers.com - the bottle I received was pure liquid (like water).</li>
            <li> therefore, it requires shaking if you don&#x27;t want pure water to come out.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, it spreads easily, and there is only a minimal amount of white residue.</li>
            <li> other ingredients are fairly well known to me - no endless list of dodgy chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is expected for a more natural product where there are no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> My 22 month old has sensitive skin and experiences breakouts easily.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one before from a different online retailer and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> It goes on white, but with some blending it disappear quickly!</li>
            <li> switched to physical sunscreens a few years ago and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.</li>
            <li> And very high ratings on EWG.</li>
            <li> Due to the Zinc oxide, you will expect the whitish paste, but overall very smooth and easy to apply and blend.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.</li>
            <li> We made it through the MN summer with 2 tubes, and that is with application every single day as we live outside when it is nice out!  </li>
            <li> Other reviews say the smell is pleasant, so it is up to personal preference, but I think it smells chemically</li>
            <li> I like that it only has two ingredients, one being zinc, and it&#x27;s still easy to apply (unlike many other zinc screens).</li>
            <li> Not only is it great at blocking out the sun, it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals that is detrimental to the body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash hands carefully and thoroughly after application because this stuff really burns if it gets into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash hands carefully and thoroughly after application because this stuff really burns if it gets into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.</li>
            <li> We really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after BurnOut changed their formulation, really hoping I&#x27;ve found a substitute.  </li>
            <li> It soesn&#x27;t smell, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make him white like a ghost except around the hairline.  </li>
            <li> We use it for the whole family and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> and it did not block the whole time.  </li>
            <li> and the whole thing was basically liquid water.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen for kids and adults alike!</li>
            <li> I tried several different chemical free sunscreens and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li> and it protected them very well.  </li>
            <li> I applied this very liberally on my LO and no burns at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> It takes much longer to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems very sweat resistant as well.</li>
            <li> Very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really protect the skin from tanning.</li>
            <li> After using so many brands of natural and effective sunscreens, I can tell this is the only one which does not contain harsh chemicals and also not oily.</li>
            <li> Price varies so much that at the beginning of summer I ordered two tubes for $10 and now it&#x27;s $15 for one.</li>
            <li> This one is very stable.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like my child is protected when this is on her.</li>
            <li> but If this one lasts the whole summer I will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset about it.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was unscented since it seems to linger quite a bit on her skin.  </li>
            <li> The most effective and the least harmful preventive measure is to avoid exposure to sun during critical hours.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses it</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gone out in the sun much to use this a lot yet</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, some tender children&#x27;s skins need to be protected from too much sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I really like this one though.</li>
            <li> Very water</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one and the sport variety!</li>
            <li> Gentle on baby</li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> When applied it&#x27;s very cakey</li>
            <li> Some dermatologists say that vitamin c (in the form of ascorbic acid) and vitamin e in your sunscreen can help to prevent sun damage, and of course zinc oxide is much safer than chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years now and it works really</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this brand by someone who works at whole foods.</li>
            <li> However, it seems to use up fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen for my kids.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works really well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with looking &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face real shiny.  </li>
            <li> Whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter and myself the whole week.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It blends in very well.</li>
            <li> It rubs in really well.</li>
            <li> I received the cream on the 9th and the real shipping date was the 4th on the package.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It really protects your skin from the Sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> and you have to really blend it&lt;</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You really need to dilute it</li>
            <li> but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;</li>

            <li> goes on smoothly and if rubbed in well, there is no white residue.</li>
            <li> It was really noticeable while at the pool</li>
            <li> It is much smoother and creamier.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> We use it for the whole family now.</li>
            <li> My kids looked like ghosts the whole vacation.</li>
            <li> The sunblock spreads on very well.</li>
            <li> Very greasy can not use on my face.</li>
            <li> and I find that I don&#x27;t reach for it very often.</li>
            <li> and we really like it.  </li>
            <li> Within a day of applying this to my son, he broke out in very itchy contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> Whole fam used it.</li>
            <li> Maybe she is using too much however.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The bees came straight for us.</li>
            <li> Arrived really early, a week earlier than expected, which is great.</li>
            <li> We have sensitive skin and aren&#x27;t able to use traditional chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> However among the list of 462 sunscreens clearly investigated by that independent agency, this one still rates among the top products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It did not cause any irritation or skin problems,it is also written on the bottle to be safe for babies over 6 months old (younger than that</li>
            <li> We have tried many different brands of chem-free sunblock on our 10 month old, this is one of our favorites.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read the recent research about sunscreen, popular brands can actually cause cancer once the chemicals interact with sunlight and seep into your skin.</li>
            <li> From all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve used (probably 6-8) that are ranked low on the ewg website, this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, no chalky residue, smells nice &amp; works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands of sunscreen for my toddler, and I think this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue that many natural sunscreens leave.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and provides good protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick one &amp; will stay on during exercise fairly well.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin that burns easily, but after putting a thin layer of this on the first day (it&#x27;s pricey, so I was being cheap by putting on a thin layer...)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on very smoothly, which has been an issue with other sunscreens we have bought that are very &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; and do not spread well.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this sunscreen for my 18month old daughter, but upon opening the tube and squeezing gently, watery liquid squirted out (as several other reviewers have experienced).</li>
            <li> I burn easily and it kept me burn free when a crowd of family that doesn&#x27;t usually burn got burnt.</li>
            <li> Once I received it I was pleased to find that the sunscreen goes on smoothly without being overly thick, which is often a problem with these safe sunscreens in which zinc oxide is the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> but myself and my 6 year old son both felt like our skin was burning right after we put it on our faces.</li>
            <li> I used the Honest Company sunscreen previously and find Thinkbaby rubs in much better and is less greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can feel confident using it on my son knowing that he is not being exposed to harmful chemicals that are found in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I guess this product has glowing reviews due to the safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers stated, the tube was mostly a watery substance.  </li>
            <li> After reading about all the issues w/ sunblock from the other brands, I&#x27;m glad I bought this based on amazon&#x27;s review.  </li>
            <li> We love that this sunscreen isn&#x27;t as greasy as some of the other &amp;#34;better for you&amp;#34; sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Like all other sunblocks, make sure to reapply after time in the water.</li>
            <li> It is a better brand than other chemicals on the market, but why pay for something that ids priced as the quality sunscreens without the quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Goes on transparent, unlike most of the other non-chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I put this the first time on my baby and a couple of hours later she had a rash on her arms; I tried a second time just to make sure it wasnt something else</li>
            <li> It might be okay for other babies</li>
            <li> We were in the hot LA sun all day, and even though I reapplied often, I was sure he was going to show a little sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I have used the Honest Company Sunscreen previously for my little ones, and Thinkbaby is better because it has 20% zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> thinkbaby doesn&#x27;t leave a white layer and goes on cleanly.</li>
            <li> The reason I rate it below the first two is that it contains a bunch of ingredients and can readily be absorbed by body, enter blood stream or have effects in local skin tissue.</li>
            <li> , it absorbed pretty well, and left my children without a sunburn.</li>
            <li> This is one of the top rated natural/organic type sunscreens (active ingredient: Zinc oxide).  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and light, it really works hard to block the harmful rays of the sun, and it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby sunscreen have nice citrus scent, it rubs on easily, made mineral base so that it won&#x27;t cause acne to flare up, it has non nano zinc oxide, and contains no other skin irritable or health hazardous ingredients/toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Mexitan has both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, has a good texture but leaves white clumps unless you really rub hard right away.</li>
            <li> It feels good to wear after about a half hour of initial whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on a little white like most mineral sunscreens but it is very easy to rub in and it doesn&#x27;t leave her looking ghostly white.</li>
            <li> Based on the outstanding reviews here, I decided to purchase this sunscreen for my 2.5 year old and 1.5 year old as well as an extra tube for myself.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my 15 month old on her first vacation to Mexico.  </li>
            <li> (some reviewers point out bigger 6 ounce sizes are available for cheaper in external websites which might be worth considering too...</li>
            <li> (some reviewers point out bigger 6 ounce sizes are available for cheaper in external websites which might be worth considering too...</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t use a lot when you apply, but the tube is kind of small for every day use.</li>
            <li> not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li> On her first day of daycare (today) a friend wanted to keep me busy</li>
            <li> The scent was mild, the consistency was smooth and it didn&#x27;t leave my face looking ghostly and pale.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use this sunscreen for the first time while on vacation, but the tube was just mostly water with little sunscreen pieces!</li>
            <li> The product rubs in very nicely &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a thick white coating like so many other zinc based products.</li>
            <li> Thick cream, perfect protection when it came to my little one.</li>
            <li> We live in hawaii where its always sunny!  </li>
            <li> This is my new go to!  </li>
            <li> Despite being very white at first, it absorbs very fast and has no odor.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, but company should address issues related to the watery stuff coming out of tube or note that this is a normal occurrence and not related to quality of the product nor the protection it provides.</li>
            <li> We were diligent about applying before we headed out and despite hours out in the New England summer, no burns for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Reviews convinced me to purchase this brand but the truth is that drug store brands cost 75% less and work much better.</li>
            <li> I love that it has less chemicals.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more for summer back home.</li>
            <li> My main goal is to avoid the chemical-based sunscreens, though, so the search is still on.  </li>
            <li> Did not leave a white cakey film like many similar sunscreens.</li>
            <li> If it lists anything else as anactive ingredient, then it is most likely a hybrid or traditional chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The price tag is more than I usually would spend on sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t mind paying the higher price if it protects me while I hike.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly care for it.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more and use daily during the summer months</li>
            <li> All in all, I think it took about a full week before my skin went back to its normal texture.</li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients and one of the main ones is Ascorbic Acid (which is a form of Vitamin C).</li>
            <li> Looks as in the picture shown, decent size</li>
            <li> The reason i bought this particular one is because it&#x27;s all-natural.  </li>
            <li> great protection, but very white and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few natural sunscreens and hadn&#x27;t found one that I liked.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my kids to use, mainly for their face and hands so it wouldn&#x27;t burn their eyes.</li>
            <li> THE SELLER:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers this cream with free shipping with a possible 1-2 weeks waiting time.</li>
            <li> After trying many different sunscreens, we always go back to Think Baby.</li>
            <li> Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good sunscreen for the last few years...tried many expensive ones...</li>
            <li> i have tried so many brands (costing sooooo many dollars since they&#x27;re basically thrown away when they fail)</li>
            <li> We keep a steady supply coming in.  </li>
            <li> But when I began to look for one to buy, it seemed the reviews weren&#x27;t very good for many of them - they are thick and hard to apply without the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; coating left on skin, they are greasy, etc.</li>
            <li> Practical and effective on my daughter&#x27;s very pale skin.</li>
            <li> I love knowing that it is not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> The kids thought it was very funny, but you obviously you don&#x27;t want to use this if you need to look presentable.  </li>
            <li> After having two kids, I am suddenly allergic to pretty much all sunscreen, including those &#x27;gentle&#x27; ones for babies.</li>
            <li> Have tried other sunscreens looking for a great one that is easy to spread, protects my son, and isn&#x27;t filled with bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t have as high an SPF as this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Melanoma risk is increased from the use of tanning beds by as high as 70%.  </li>
            <li> High dose of zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I thought i&#x27;d invest in this one since it&#x27;s highly rated and regarded.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has a high SPF</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen as it was highly rated on Amazon and ewg.org.</li>
            <li> Cost is high.</li>
            <li> and I like that it has a high SPF of 50</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much that I don&#x27;t put on enough sunscreen, but I&#x27;ve never found one that I liked enough to use the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s highly rated on the EWG website, and isn&#x27;t shiny/oily/sticky</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High ratings on EWG.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product?</li>
            <li> this is has a high safety rating for sunscreens on EWG website.</li>
            <li> It smells like oranges (not chemicals) and is rated highly by EWG.  </li>
            <li> Highly Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is highly rated by ewg.org, the environmental working group.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a safer sunscreen to use.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen went on kind of thick and white, but quickly rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> This may or may not mean something.</li>
            <li> It did not cake on white (which I have experienced from other natural options - such as Mercola&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> The fagrance is a very light citrus smell and it rubs in very well and isn&#x27;t greasy unlike many other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used which leave a white film or a greasy feeling and as for people saying that they still tanned using this, I might agree that there was some slight tanning but no burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this and the other one I bought at Costco- &amp;#34;Sunology&amp;#34; (this one spreads easily compares to thinkbaby) to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather pay a little extra for great skin protection especially to not have</li>
            <li> Even though it is only 3 oz, it is so worth it to spend a little more for this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to work really well at preventing sun burns without too frequent of re-application.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen for my 5 month old.</li>
            <li> so we will probably switch to that to make life much easier with a 9 month old that won&#x27;t sit still.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t take too much to rub into my 2 year old&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen for myself (I&#x27;m an adult) and really like the citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin and no rashes so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This pretty much repeated itself two months later on a rafting trip.  </li>
            <li> Not like normal sunscreen and not useable.</li>
            <li> but I definitely worth the spending extra knowing it&#x27;s safer for you skin.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it is effective and I feel comfortable with putting it on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh as most sunblock and doesn&#x27;t sting from my experience, but it does irritate her eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this product, and i use it everyday under my make up...great for baby or adults.</li>
            <li> WONDERFULLY well, lasts long, not overly expensive</li>
            <li> I have 1 year old twins who love being outside, it&#x27;s only August</li>
            <li> Nice texture, not too thick, not too</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was comfortable putting a minimal amount of this on him because after lots of research, it&#x27;s much more natural than the other sunscreens which was something I was concerned about since his hands &amp; feet are always in his mouth!</li>
            <li> It goes on good, but runs down your body once you get wet.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend for anyone who wants sun protection but a sunscreen that actually blends in completely and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you have white paint on your face.</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice after it is shaken and mixed properly, it is not too thick and applies to skin easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to apply and she&#x27;s never gotten a burn in the 3 summers</li>
            <li> The texture is creamy (not hard, not runny).  </li>
            <li> It is fine to use on arms and other areas of the body for me, despite the smell.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and I really appreciate the faint yet pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Excellent texture, does not go on too thick like some other physical sunblocks I have tried.</li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews and a handful of negative ones</li>
            <li> My kids are very, very fair and get at least a little sunburnt</li>
            <li> We all need sunlight for proper Vitamin D synthesis in our body however a 20 minute/day direct exposure (not blocked by window glass or clear plastic) is more than enough for that purpose.</li>
            <li> BUT recently i noticed that the first listed ingredient was alumina, a form of aluminum, which i don&#x27;t want on my skin &amp; particularly my face for ongoing well-known dementia concerns.  </li>
            <li> did, doesn&#x27;t leave a pastie whiteness like other mineral sunblock, and I can use it on my face without getting pimples, which is huge for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially interested because of online reviews, and looked up the EWG&#x27;s rating of &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; for this product, which means it&#x27;s rated as low hazard and high efficacy.</li>
            <li> We live in Florida so sunscreen is a must.  </li>
            <li> I bought this before a trip to New Mexico in the summer, where it was sunny and ninety degrees.  </li>
            <li> and we live in the south, and she&#x27;s never gotten burned while wearing this.</li>
            <li> Given that I live in Florida, going without sunscreen isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> It is a safer product than some nationally known brands, so I will live with it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m on the hunt for a new zinc sunblock.</li>
            <li> I live in Vegas and this Sunscreen has helped me avoid getting sunburn and skin discomfort.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice that much of a smell - used it on my exposed body areas like legs, hands and neck but not the face as I think it would be hard to put makeup on top of it though.</li>
            <li> effect as there are with so many other zinc oxide sunscreens on the market by other brands (Neutrogena, looking at you right now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are extremely careful with the products we put onto ourselves especially for the kids, so after some research I was so glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> There is a slight white cast left upon application but it quickly fades and our summer pictures show a healthy, tanned smiling kid.</li>
            <li> Aside from those issues it is a decent sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We went back to our regular Banana Boat Tear Free sunblock to protect us from sunburn, despite the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Blends in without leaving a white mask; smells fresh without being overly fragrant; keeps my kids&#x27; sensitive skin rash- and eczema-free.  </li>
            <li> and you can tell it has a healthy coat on the skin to prevent a burn on my little one!</li>
            <li> I love this product because I have the piece of mind knowing that the hormone disruptors are not in this product, and it will protect my little ones from the damaging sun and is water proof!  </li>
            <li> Smells lovely and protects my little man well!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not as white as other high zinc screens and is easy to disguise with a little powder/bronzer (I skip the powder most of the time unless I need to look put together).</li>
            <li> My toddler has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Also, she has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My daughter has VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Too bad because it has SUCH a wonderful texture and goes on so nicely compared to a lot of other physical sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Applies very easily with little to no white residue on their skin.  </li>
            <li> This sunblock fulfills all my requirements and I am so pleased with this product, now using exclusively this one for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> When you first apply, it comes out as a white cream that seems to linger on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time he&#x27;s ever burned, so I&#x27;m going back to California Baby.</li>
            <li> Think baby feels just like normal sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t have that oily feel that some natural brands have.</li>
            <li> After a TON of research, we started buying this sunscreen last summer to avoid the toxic ingredients in most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> we missed a spot during application and it burned pretty red, but anywhere that was covered was no problem at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other physical sunscreen and they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couole of months now and my 6 month old has not burned once!</li>
            <li> We used it for the first time last weekend at the beach.</li>
            <li> At first, the product will leave a white sheen to the skin but it goes away after 15-20mins.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of non-chemical sunblock for my toddler (the first was Badger Baby).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased thinkbaby for the first time.  </li>
            <li> So far no burning for me or her!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe, mineral based, and relatively non-greasy compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to block pores on my face- no pimples so far!  </li>
            <li> I have found it to be exact opposite.  </li>
            <li> It definitely wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.  </li>
            <li> Easy to rub in with wiggly little kids and not as sticky as a lot of mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s little strong for baby.  </li>
            <li> I did try to keep her out of the sun as much as possible but after 8 days of playing in the sand and water she never burned and came back as pale and fair as she was when she arrived.</li>
            <li> It has clean ingredients and a very low rating on the EWG Skin Deep Database</li>
            <li> I used MY normal SPF 15 lotion from another company on my face and the only thing that got slightly burnt was my nose (because I sweat there the most) and</li>
            <li> The high SPF and low toxicity can&#x27;t be argued and I will try to keep using this when the sun is intense.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many of the all-natural chemical free sunscreens and found most to be thick and difficult to apply with one thing or another that didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, as it was easy to use, little amounts were needed, and it worked!</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on easily, and doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it!</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t go on too thick like some other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well and doesn&#x27;t feel too thick like many other baby/kid sunscreens available.</li>
            <li> Goes on hazy-white but clears over time which I find very useful when slathering down our toddler.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight citrus scent that I actually enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not greasy and with slight coconut smell.</li>
            <li> if I had been less cheap</li>
            <li> They work well, and they&#x27;re so much better for my sensitive skin than chemical sunscreens, but usually they smell like clay</li>
            <li> The same is true when it is mixed with old fashioned titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight white residue, but it&#x27;s still one of better organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I would love if they had a 9oz with a equal or less price per oz.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because the smell is not very pleasant, but I&#x27;ll take that if it means safe protection for my child.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to apply and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a physical sunblock, which means it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear when applied, but I find it to be less noticeable than many of the others.</li>
            <li> It was also pretty easy to wash off, we just wet a towel and rubbed him down before his bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It must be said that my kiddos are not fair skinned and tan very easily.</li>
            <li> THis sunscreen is thick and takes a little work to rub in, but I love that it is a higher SPF than most other baby sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Having so much disappointment with natural sunscreens, I myself started using Blue Lizard which is quick to apply, offers good sun protection, but isn&#x27;t so natural.     </li>
            <li> I just had a little sunburn on the back of my neck and top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li> a little fresh lemon smell... and not so much like chemical.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell, its a little minerally smelling.</li>
            <li> Not only that this doesn&#x27;t fade away easily due to its strong water resistance.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> a little thick and if I put just a smidge too much on it&#x27;ll leave me white as a ghost, but it works great.</li>
            <li> With a little bit of online research, I learned that it is very rare to have an allergy to zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> It rubs on smooth and leaves a minimal white haze on your skin.  </li>
            <li> The most pronounced two adverse effects are premature aging of skin and skin cancer, not to mention horrible immediate redness and tenderness followed by peeling of skin which can cancel your all joy from a beach</li>
            <li> So far no burns and this size should last the whole summer.</li>
            <li> Taking 1 star off as it doesn&#x27;t spread clear</li>
            <li> And my face is clear all day.</li>
            <li> We bought this for a trip to Florida for my 6 month old.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 8 month old baby boy.  </li>
            <li> Four adults, two children and a 4 month old baby went to the beach one day.  </li>
            <li> My three year old does not mind having this sunscreen put on at all.</li>
            <li> The watery part of this product completely separated from the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the least toxic brands to use on my face, and while I&#x27;m ok with using this brand on my body, I&#x27;ve found an alternative for my face:</li>
            <li> I switched to All Natural Organic Ayurvedic Mineral SPF30 Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen started about well, but by the time I got halfway through it, the remaining sunscreen had become completely liquid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my baby since she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li> Yet in spring 2015 it is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 6 month old at the time</li>
            <li> I can use it on my body, but it irritates my face (my face is extremely sensitive).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the easiest to spread of all zinc oxide sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s been alive.</li>
            <li> I trust this sunscreen completely and don&#x27;t ever see a reason to switch to another.</li>
            <li> traditional sunscreens, from beginning to end, it takes me about 2 minutes to apply to my whole body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural sunscreens (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) for about one year now.</li>
            <li> I switched from California Baby to this for my 5 year old son.</li>
            <li> None of the pictures from last summer could be really printed for framing.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I started using it when my son was about a year old.  </li>
            <li> My dad also started using it because he developed sensitivity to chemical sunscreens and titanium dioxide, but this one works with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and protected</li>
            <li> So far this is working well for my toddler.</li>
            <li> I like the orange ice cream smell, so does my 6 year old boy, but not my 8 year old boy.</li>
            <li> We did a lot of research before settling on this sunscreen for our 6 month old son.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that I really wish you got more for your money.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and this sunscreen has not irritated her skin at all.</li>
            <li> My child is 1 year old now</li>
            <li> So if you can avoid being under direct sunlight between 10am and 3pm</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for my 8 yr old swimmer and tennis player.  </li>
            <li> and I used this on me and my 3 yr old &amp; neither of us ever burned.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 1 year old sits on my hubby&#x27;s lap</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my extremely sensitive skinned 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-rated by the EWG as far as safety and ingredients, and it has protected well and held up with sweat for our purposes.</li>
            <li> but I bought it for my 6 month old.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t burned so far either.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old and so far has kept him from getting burned.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this all summer on our (now) 6 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave much sticky residue, and there are not clumpy white bits.  </li>
            <li> This product does this naturally.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 mo old son.</li>
            <li> All natural, no chemical sunscreens are going to do that.  </li>
            <li> The tubes that were sent were complete liquid.</li>
            <li> I even used it when he was 3 months old</li>
            <li> Even applying generous amount of this sunscreen with frequent application, it did not help me or my children avoid getting tan or sun</li>
            <li> I bought this after reviewing a lot of sunscreens for my 6 month old and now she and I use this exclusively.</li>
            <li> This will suit my grown-up sensitive acne-prone skin!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> my daughter used this on my 3 and 5 year old grandchildren at the beach</li>
            <li> This does the job, however, will leave you with a bit of the &amp;#34;ghost face&amp;#34;, especially if you put too much on.</li>
            <li> Not one of us got burned being outside in the sun for over a week straight.  </li>
            <li> This means it&#x27;ll last a bit longer because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.  </li>
            <li> No sunburn here on our 4 week old baby</li>
            <li> We put this on her even though she was not in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> One of them has sensitive skin and did not have any reaction to this.  </li>
            <li> works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet.</li>
            <li> Solar RX Therapeutic Sunblock SPF 30 - very moisturizing, transparent, non-irritating to the eyes, but does not block the sun enough</li>
            <li> enough&lt;br /&gt;DeVita Professional Skin Care - Ultra Solar 50 - not moisturizing, transparent, irritates eyes, does not block the sun enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and all over my 6 month old baby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out a few different mineral sunscreens and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> The benefits far outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t use much at all - i can see this tube lasting almost a year.  </li>
            <li> I received an unexpected box of sample products that included a couple bottles of this sunscreen so we have been using it during swim lessons.</li>
            <li> So far this sunscreen has served me well.  </li>
            <li> natural sunscreens-</li>
            <li> This one absorbs well and although it goes on white, it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a sheen.</li>
            <li> It goes on white, but rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> In regards to fragrance, I was worried because it would irritate eczema skin, and I have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking my two year old daughter to a swimming pool.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter won&#x27;t use it because of the scent.</li>
            <li> (some natural sunscreens can be runny--this one was not).  </li>
            <li> because I completely forgot to put ANYTHING on them).</li>
            <li> I use it on my six month old baby and three year old.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t need to be reapplied so frequently.</li>
            <li> We tried a variety of sunscreens (Target brand, Coppertone Water Babies, Banana Boat Natural, etc.).</li>
            <li> He still developed the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to really rub it in for the white film to go away.  </li>
            <li> When we put it on him, it of course ended up in his eyes because he is 6 months old.</li>
            <li> For people with sensitive skin this sunscreen is gentle enough for a baby, but offers all the protection anyone could ever need.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far, all of my expectations have been met.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is that you really have to blend into the skin because it&#x27;s a heavier creme than what she is used too.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> We go to the pool several times a week, this is nice and thick, although a pain to wash off your hands.</li>
            <li> have tried many natural sunscreens and either they have been too thick to spread or didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this sunscreen, but after applying a thick layer to my 2 year old&#x27;s body, he still got a burn.</li>
            <li> and I live in San Francisco where high heat exposure is likely, even in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For this, I use a wash cloth and put cool water on it, then I rub down the areas I applied sunscreen to..</li>
            <li> I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and fairly clear compared to the others I&#x27;ve tried that take some serious work in order to get all the way rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> First time I opened this sunscreen, I had to drain so much water and half of the tube was gone.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, rubs in easily, not too thick.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s slower than the traditional counterpart, it&#x27;s much better than some of the other physical sunscreens that would take 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I sent one brand back because I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled, and put up with looking white from other brands, not knowing there was a better one out there.</li>
            <li> In my two previous orders, I have received tubes full of liquid, but I kept returning them until I got the product in tact.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen and not as thick as some of the other baby ones.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen for our baby, it&#x27;s a little thick but goes on easy and seems to last without being too sticky.</li>
            <li> but if you rub it in well (easily and quickly accomplished) and don&#x27;t use an excessive quantity (doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way), the white really isn&#x27;t noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it was just a bad batch - good luck to everyone trying it!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the separation of ingredients, when I opened the tube, there was clear watery liquid coming my out first and then white creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> Went on vacation to Key West when our baby was only 2.5 months old and this worked real well!</li>
            <li> (btw - i am NOT associated in any way with this company &amp; a rarely do reviews on amazon - even though my ups driver is here constantly due to them -</li>
            <li> It is all natural, contains high concentration of zinc oxide and yet does not leave a white cast even though in does not use nano technology which I want to avoid.</li>
            <li> It still leaves a bit more of a white residue than say Coppertone, but not nearly as noticeable as some other natural brands.</li>
            <li> Expensive, small tube and not the best scent in the world, but works well</li>
            <li> Overall, a decent product to try.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different sunscreens from EWG&#x27;s skin deep 1 rating, and this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve liked so far.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty much a physical sunblock -- goes on white, and kinda keeps you ghostly!</li>
            <li> but that is also to be expected since you can&#x27;t get 100% coverage really from any normal sunscreen</li>
            <li> With that kind of family history, we take sunscreen very seriously.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite pin down what it is, but it&#x27;s soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> BUT, it burns like no other if you get it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a sunscreen without the harmful chemicals in it, but no sun protection pretty much makes it useless.</li>
            <li> On super pale, freckled kids ranging from 8 years old to 1 year old.</li>
            <li> This goes on a little white, and is a little oily, but overall it rubs in, works well and is rated very highly by [...] as being very safe and non-toxic.</li>
            <li> I would never again use such a highly perfumed product on my baby.</li>
            <li> When I was in the market of trying new sunscreens I ordered this and Babo Botanicals 30 SPF Clear Zinc Sunscreen at the same time.</li>
            <li> It worked when new but 8 months later has zero effectiveness on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I found it a little more difficult to spread this out since it&#x27;s a lotion, and I&#x27;m used to using more runny/thin sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; a little too white to wear as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but I also haven&#x27;t been exposed to strong and direct sun lately even while living in Florida.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is not super thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only wish price were a little less, but still VERY MUCH worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about sunscreen for myself, so I was even more critical about choosing a sunscreen for my very pale baby.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re a huge pain in the butt to rub into your skin, and they usually end up being even greasier than chemical sunscreens once you do blend them in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy at first but fine once it absorbs a little.</li>
            <li> Still a little think and pasty but better than other natural sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li> I want the highest ZO especially when it is priced right since ZO is expensive and more</li>
            <li> so, it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry up as I&#x27;m putting it on like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Later that night, I noticed that my skin was super scaly and literally felt like sandpaper compared to my other hand.</li>
            <li> So it is hard to apply it without dripping some of the precious fluid on the ground or clothing.</li>
            <li> California Baby good, but heavy, hard to rub in, and has the micronized titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> I will be tossing the entire new bottle.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be my new regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.)</li>
            <li> The rash was clearly itchy and only a couple doses of Benedryl would clear it</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t turn you completely white, just a very hint of white depending on the amount applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not BAD, really, but not good either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to rub on, it is thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and reasonably easy to apply, but it leaves the baby smelling like cake.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to 2015, all the major players are starting to produce physical sunscreens!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the product probably because it had so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> A little pastey but covers very well!!</li>
            <li> Still seeking a broad spectrum go-to...</li>
            <li> My toddlers have never got burned with it on and they play in a very hot climate everyday.</li>
            <li> If you look into the chemicals on a lot of the major brands you will see how harmful some of those products can be.  </li>
            <li> Rubs on and absorbs just fine leaving only a slight white cast.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and rubs in easy, so they don&#x27;t have the white haze some other products leave behind on their skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend first moisturizing with CeraVe moisturizing Lotion (not Cream, but rather Lotion, there are two different products) and once the CeraVe lotion &amp;#34;sinks in&amp;#34; then apply this product, otherwise, the zinc oxide will &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; the dry cuticles/dry flakes on your fingers/</li>
            <li> My other sunscreen products didn&#x27;t score anywhere near as highly in safety factors, as did this item, but I KNOW, for a FACT, that sunscreen works for aging &amp;, I believe, skin cancer!  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight white cast upon application but that quickly fades.</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby wins hands down!</li>
            <li> Too bad, otherwise this seemed like a great product.</li>
            <li> Unless you have hair, which kind of makes it more difficult and leaves that Casper look behind.  </li>
            <li> --they turn red and clearly bother her.</li>
            <li> However, I also have sensitive skin and have developed rashes and acne breakouts after using several different brands of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Our family has extremely sensitive skin and multiple family members have been diagnosed with melanoma.</li>
            <li> The only concern is with one the ingredient: \\&quot;natural fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Considering the recent report about harmful ingredients in a lot of the sunscreeens meant for young ones makes me worry.</li>
            <li> I used it on my one year old on a recent beach trip.</li>
            <li> Definitely prevented my 14 month old from getting sun burnt this summer.</li>
            <li> Our whole family used this on our vacation in Hawaii and we did not have even the slightest pink tone from a sunburn.</li>
            <li> We took my ten month old daughter to Las Vegas and it was sunny 100plus weather.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin and is Casper white.</li>
            <li> , I am searching for, yet, a natural sunscreen that is not as greasy and doesn&#x27;t make skin white.</li>
            <li> It was much thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Go buy Blue Lizard Sensitive or Baby instead...</li>
            <li> I got this for my 6 month old and have used it a few times so far and really like it.</li>
            <li> They should be worn especially by children although I, as an adult men, got used to wearing one</li>
            <li> Actually, I would go as far as to say the Thinkbaby sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy after absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently vacationed to the Eastern Caribbean with my husband and 2 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Used it daily on my 16 month old for 2 weeks at the beach.  </li>
            <li> my skin is so soft after applying it &amp; stays that way the vast majority of the day, if not all day.  </li>
            <li> I apply this liberally and go out for moderate amounts of time (often over an hour) to my garden in direct sun</li>
            <li> but you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> What can i say, i finally found the natural sunscreen for our family.</li>
            <li> It is natural and a physical sunscreen with zinc oxide and does not rub in all the way.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would repurchase tis again as I prefer to use natural products.</li>
            <li> niece had a similar problem at a young age, so my sister took her to an allergist.</li>
            <li> Finally found a sunblock for my son that doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i am in my early 60s - which has shocked more than a few dermatologists when they initially meet me - which may account a tad for my skin loving the richness of this formulation.  </li>
            <li> Love the thin packing-great for a purse.</li>
            <li> It actually goes on pretty dry and pulls on skin when you don&#x27;t use enough.</li>
            <li> A new study shows that vitamin E actually increases skin cancer when applied topically.</li>
            <li> There is a slight white cast to your skin, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me - hairy arms/legs and often have scruff on your face - this is pretty much not useful because it&#x27;s so hard to rub in and takes awhile to apply and leaves too much of a white look (after lots of rubbing, I looked &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> The only cons for me is the price for just a little amount, and it does run out really fast !!</li>
            <li> I can see one tube lasting at least 3 weeks, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen rubs in much easier than other zinc oxide sunscreens like CA Baby and Johnsons Zinc.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be very water resilient and it doesn&#x27;t leave my childs skin looking chalky or irridescent like some other brands.</li>
            <li> Also, very cost-friendly compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is a little thick, you have to use kind of a lot to spread evenly anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> It goes on smelling like orange cream but then refers back to smelling like Thinksport, which is not so great but not too bad either.  </li>
            <li> fashioned zinc oxide sunscreen is safe, effective, but miserable to wear.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but feel safe to apply on my kids who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Applies very easily - smooth but still thick enough to coat well.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen slightly irritates my super sensitive skin (ezcema and acne on my face), but for the most part it is much less irritating than the majority of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> my little one, for the first time, stuck out her tongue and tried to lick the smell...</li>
            <li> Despite having used half the bottle on our family in only one afternoon, we are all very very crispy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other baby sunscreens and they worked fine</li>
            <li> Goes on white and pasty looking, but rubs right in and soaks in after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It appears to be not lasting very long during normal non-water sports usage - didn&#x27;t do a scientific testing but just feel like it</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a little thick to apply, like most natural ones.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other chemical filled baby sunscreen</li>
            <li> For me, they spread much easier than other similar products.  </li>
            <li> Overall definitely worth the few extra bucks if your considering a healthier option for your family!</li>
            <li> and I feel it truely protects their delicate skin.</li>
            <li> There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed.</li>
            <li> First few times a bit too liquid/separated.  </li>
            <li> This gets very tricky especially if you have active boys like me.</li>
            <li> Other zinc-based products are really hard to rub in but this one goes on nicely, is not sticky or greasy and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I tried it a second day being careful to apply it thickly, under straps and made sure to rub it in well and waited 30 minutes before going outside.</li>
            <li> and my daughter doesnt mind it, unlike the more thick white paste like ones of some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that my family only needed two bottles on a week long vacation.</li>
            <li> particular product has 20% zinc oxide as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.</li>
            <li> I wanted something I could use on my face when outside that had a high SPF, but could also use on other parts of my body without smelling like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Protects very well and slightly easier to wash off than regular thinksport sunblock.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t super thick and doesn&#x27;t leave your face all white and chalky.  </li>
            <li> Since it was a low cost compared to other similar products and I like the fact that the SPF is so high, I&#x27;m giving this a 3 as there&#x27;s value to it.</li>
            <li> What I like is that it goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t have to rub it in very hard for the white to disappear.  </li>
            <li> My son also developed very dry patches on his skin after using this.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has worked very well for the two little faces in our household</li>
            <li> Maybe a little too much like cake.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after much research and debate for our little guy</li>
            <li> I like the cream itself, seems to be gentle enough for our little one but every time I use it</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would leave me looking white and pastey, but with just a little extra rubbing, it blends very well</li>
            <li> it goes on so easily and is not sticky or thick like a lot of the other safer ones.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s def not that bad if u have fair skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not all the bad junk, and no sunburn.  </li>
            <li> But it is hugely overrated considering its really poor visual / cosmestic effect.</li>
            <li> It is thick, so it takes a bit of rubbing to go on, but I figure that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greasy to me because I can not stand any heavy feels on my skin, but it is way better than other affordable brands on the market.  </li>
            <li> A little but pricey but the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have all those other toxic chemicals make it worth it.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in a small bottle that&#x27;s easy to throw in the diaper bag for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other zinc based suncreens, this one goes on smoothly and does not turn you white (at least not near as white).</li>
            <li> Neither my son or I are sensitive to other sunscreens</li>
            <li> some other natural sun screens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> My family has sensitive skin and develop rash after using other products, but Thinksport is one I found not to have any issues with their skin.  </li>
            <li> We accidentally missed a small section of my back in the mayhem of getting ready.</li>
            <li> My two main complaints is that the sunscreen will separate into solids and liquid, and I am not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen goes on easy though it is a little thick.  </li>
            <li> A good price for baby sunscreen, not too thick, but still a little smeary and hard to apply to a baby that doesn&#x27;t like to be rubbed all over.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen for everyday use for adults and children.</li>
            <li> One of the few brands with a high concentration of zinc.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen seems fine, goes on a little thick</li>
            <li> We used this sunscreen on our 13 month old for a trip to Mexico and she didn&#x27;t get a single spot of pink.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference past that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an SPF of 70.&lt;br /&gt;It will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like thick ointment or thick white cream to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick, but non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It is thick but spreads pretty well on my two squirmy toddlers.</li>
            <li> It feels cool and leaves shiny, thin layer of the sunscreen on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> We spend hours in the sun every week as we live in Hawaii and little one has never burned.</li>
            <li> At first it was only a little liquid, maybe half a teaspoon.</li>
            <li> My little girl has sensitive skin but wears this regularly and it keeps her from burning .</li>
            <li> I think some people think it&#x27;s kind of expensive, but since I only use it on my face, it is actually a lot cheaper than the Shiseido sunscreen that I usually buy.</li>
            <li> Though it isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy, it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin (like some other natural options have).  </li>
            <li> It really leaves a white layer that&#x27;s hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen goes on white but dried clear, even on the face.</li>
            <li> This product rubs in well with minimal white residue left on my child.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve quite used several sunscreens on my 2 year old son over the past couple of years with no problems and with Summer approaching</li>
            <li> It does go on pretty thick and leaves you white if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I was out for the same amount of time as him wearing Sun Harbor SPF 30, which is not easy to rub in (hence the reason why I didn&#x27;t use it on my 3 year old), and I did not burn at all.</li>
            <li> sports brand does not seem to have this problem, and it lasts longer which is important as reapplying sunscreen constantly is tough going with active babies.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> so I take sunscreen usage pretty seriously.</li>
            <li> The one thing that makes me not want to use it again is that it left big white marks all over my black bathing suit.</li>
            <li> Other similar products leave a very white film, not this one though!</li>
            <li> I find it to be very easy to rub in, leaving no white behind, and no more greasy than any other sunscreen I have used.</li>
            <li> She (my dog) has very thin ears and burns easily in the sun.</li>
            <li> I showered that night, and when I woke up the next morning, I noticed that my hand still had a white overcast on it, and appeared a little flaky, so I figured I probably didn&#x27;t wash it off well enough in the shower the night before.</li>
            <li> For baby, it&#x27;s gentle and knowing that it&#x27;s just Zinc Oxide and no other weird chemicals that can get into baby&#x27;s bloodstream is a big relief especially for first-time moms.</li>
            <li> 7 month old wore this all day out in the Florida sunshine and didn&#x27;t even think about turning pink!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super thick or greasy like other brands of chemical free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but if I can&#x27;t find anything else better, I&#x27;ll come back to this and try to tolerate the unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much too late to get a refund or anything</li>
            <li> It also seems to work really well, at least for us.</li>
            <li> I know I have a long road ahead of me</li>
            <li> It works well and seems to stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was like water and we have not had it for long.</li>
            <li> Zinc oxide, on that website , is rated as 2 with some minor concerns about cellular problems and bio-accumulation.</li>
            <li> Immediately after I applied it, I felt a small itch, but I figured that was normal and it went away almost immediately, so I ignored it.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s a minor one)</li>
            <li> so I found it strange that we had that reaction but</li>
            <li> I use this for daily use but also used it every day on a trip to Hawaii, where we spent a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I used this all summer long</li>
            <li> I spend long periods in the California sun and it works well though I do re-apply often.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit of a process to wash it off in the shower,  but that is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> so it is harder to apply but you can manage it without leaving the skin completely white.</li>
            <li> This is WHITE and pasty and harder to spread.</li>
            <li> It has a delicate fruity scent to it, and it spreads really nicely unlike other poorly made zinc oxide products.  </li>
            <li> While this is normal for mineral sunscreens, I have tried a few that were thinner and easier to rub, but they had other issues, like separating after being exposed to heat.  </li>
            <li> Kids actually like using it which is not that way when it comes to other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to other buyers and will purchase this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> The tube is bigger than expected!</li>
            <li> My toddler kept getting a red rash with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> After reading extensive reviews on other sunblock baby products, and looking them up on the EWG database I went with Thinkbaby.</li>
            <li> I wont be using anything other than ThinkBaby for them in the future!</li>
            <li> also checked the other unopened tube, same thing occurs, water inside.</li>
            <li> Goes on my olive skin white - fades a little but there is a white cast, hence can&#x27;t be used on face.</li>
            <li> I will only recommend using this, i guess, in winter or extreme dry weather.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth (not so thick and hard to spread on like CA Baby).</li>
            <li> I moisturized again, but it still felt dry.</li>
            <li> you have dry flaky skin, cuticles</li>
            <li> Does not feel oily, or chalky, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that this suncreen doesnt dry out  my skin yet still protects it well.</li>
            <li> my skin type is dry</li>
            <li> I expected it to be greasy, but it is exceptionally thick and very sticky.</li>
            <li> If you want a purely physical sunscreen, look for the active ingredients of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> I use it daily year round as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They still have that white look but the sunscreen is not heavy and thick like Badger&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too hard and does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; well because it is made like an underarm deodorant&lt;br /&gt;The cap is poorly designed and you have to make sure that you roll it back down into the applicator or the lid</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen, it is a little less chalky than some other sunscreens we&#x27;ve used, there is no fragrance</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little too thick and dries too quickly like the other one, so you need more&lt;</li>
            <li> even like that this sunscreen is feeling so oily on my skin, the smell is soft and nice but the feeling of oily greasy sensation on my skin is very bad</li>
            <li> I did and learned that there were ingredients in my old sunscreen that were not healthy to use.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different safe sunscreens and was really unhappy with how clumpy they were.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6-month-old after researching more natural sunscreen options as my son has terrible eczema and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not a bit of sunburn with long days spent in the sun.</li>
            <li> I read from Consumer Reports that mineral sunblock tend to come off or loose effectiveness when one swims in the water for a while.  </li>
            <li> I had white marks all up and down the sides from where it was rubbing off of my arms.</li>
            <li> (it can still be a little white, but nothing like some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried), and it gets a 1 on the Skin Deep website.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit to rub in and will live a slight white residue, but that is to be expected with a less chemical product.</li>
            <li> I applied it yesterday on an only 81F typical NYC day.</li>
            <li> I bought thinkbaby sunscreen when the blue band on the bottom was black.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like the tube I got at our local grocery store previously.</li>
            <li> So it has an overall rating of 1 out of 10 in EWG (Environmental Working Group) website (lower number means less harmful)</li>
            <li> Previously I was using a different sunscreen brand that changed formulas adding harsher chemicals.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the price, but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Cost less than ten moniez on sale.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It is expensive for how much you get; it will not last long</li>
            <li> Barely any white residue left behind.</li>
            <li> new formula ( with the blue banner) is poorly emulsified.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t quite as easy to apply as a standard sunscreen, but that isn&#x27;t to say it is bad.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to avoid getting it on the suit during application, and I waited about 15 minutes before putting on my (long sleeved) cover-up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler, and I like it WAY better than the Badger Baby sunscreen, which is VERY difficult to spread and doesn&#x27;t sink in due to its paste-like consistency.</li>
            <li> The downside is that my son did get a little red using this.</li>
            <li> : Feels a little sticky in the end of a day, makes me want to take a shower immediately back to hotel.</li>
            <li> is that It&#x27;s a little smaller than i</li>
            <li> We reapplied constantly and went through a little over 1 tube for a week of use.  </li>
            <li> I mixed in a little moisturizer and that helped, but it still looked a little gross and scaly after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed in a little moisturizer and that helped, but it still looked a little gross and scaly after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see any white spots after a little rubbing.</li>
            <li> it takes a little extra effort.  </li>
            <li> Spreads easily, little to no white residue, works</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle orange-y scent, which I don&#x27;t usually like, but in this case I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> and I had only the tiniest little bit of pink on my shoulders--</li>
            <li> sunsuit and hat were enough to allow everyone else a chance to be stupid while keeping the baby safe.</li>
            <li> this contains great sun protection without all the nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty unpleasant to put on my 16 month old.</li>
            <li> Bought this sunscreen for my 6month old twins after reading up on all the ingredients and deciding it was the safest for their delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this late summer last year (2nd tube) and the expiration date is 03/2016.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger size.  </li>
            <li> When rubbed in, I didn&#x27;t notice the white cast that is common with physical brands at all.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Leaves a heavy white cast.</li>
            <li> For swimming and water sports, I recommend Equate Ultra Protection Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, because the stuff stays on the skin even when wet.  </li>
            <li> Looking to avoid the harsh chemicals in traditional sunscreens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very stretchy.</li>
            <li> I brought the remaining product to Florida during vacation, only found out the remaining product has turned into watery waste.</li>
            <li> We spent 9 days in Florida</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on your skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time at the beach and the park.</li>
            <li> It is still looks white but not as heavy</li>
            <li> She never got sunburn or even pink for that matter.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s outside everyday during the summer</li>
            <li> I got pink on a 2-hour hike, applying before and during that hike, but never had any problems with it up until then.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t apply it too close) and the smell is stronger than I expected for something supposedly unscented.</li>
            <li> I also had it all around the neckline, and I had been so careful to avoid getting it there when applying.</li>
            <li> This came as expected for our family vacation.</li>
            <li> so I carefully pick out products that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> We spent 2 hours at the beach</li>
            <li> When I closed the tube and shook it, it sounded like water gushing around - which I would not expect for an SPF 50 sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It holds when the kiddos get wet.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a white residue once applied, but it disappears in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock, my boy hate the white stuff left on the face and arm from other natural sunblocks, and he will rub very hard to get ride of them.</li>
            <li> As noticed by other reviewers on first using this sunscreen, I did notice a watery liquid coming out of the tube and was afraid I had ended up with a bad tube, however upon a thorough shake-down, we did manage to get creamy/ lotion-like sunscreen and have been using with consistent results ever since (for the last couple of weeks, multiple frequent uses).</li>
            <li> A little difficult to rub on a child that is excited to jump in the water.</li>
            <li> But then after a couple weeks the lotion inside starts to separate, and pale yellow liquid shoots out when I tried to squeeze some out for use.</li>
            <li> my legs, arms, and back were still as pale as before</li>
            <li> And after a few trips to the beach and zoo and other outings in the sun, we managed to use an entire tube of this sunblock.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say my daughter came home from our trip just as pale as when we left and it was due to this product performing JUST as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for your little one!</li>
            <li> He was only outside for 40 minutes and his poor little legs are so red.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> It also comes off my hands easily, whereas other brands are virtually impossible to get off my hands or anything else they came in contact with.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me an initial occurrence when the tube is opened and if this is frequent the company should note as such, as that would likely assuage customers&#x27; fears that they have received a bad product.</li>
            <li> Used in Mexico on the beach for a week and baby didn&#x27;t get pink at all!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the trouble of returning it; so I decided to give it a long shake hoping that it would emulsify.  </li>
            <li> But I will be continuing to try other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> and she has gotten rashes other sunscreens .</li>
            <li> When I shook it I could hear the liquid moving around ( which has never happened with other sunscreens).  </li>
            <li> Small enough to keep in my purse for travel.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but read the reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and decided on this lotion due to the fact that it lacks a lot of the chemicals that are in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Purchased because it didn&#x27;t have a lot of the stuff you find in other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have tried the product on other areas of my body, where I don&#x27;t notice the fragrance</li>
            <li> Hats and glasses are other accessories that come to my mind as preventive measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other filler ingredients are listed as harmless except dimethicone which was rated 3 due to some organ level toxicity concerns as well as environmental toxicity issues.</li>
            <li> I am extremely cautious with sun exposure and slather sunblock every hour.  </li>
            <li> All other sunscreens we have tried cause her to break out in hives or a rash.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s a small bottle and pricy.  </li>
            <li> She never got even the slightest shade of pink!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my other sunscreen stained my shirts when I would wipe my face with my arm sleeves.  </li>
            <li> Since finding this, we haven&#x27;t used any other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not blend well with face cream or other lotions&lt;</li>
            <li> There is no residue after applying unlike other zinc based sunscreans i have used</li>
            <li> The bottle is really small, and only lasted one vacation.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it out after reading other reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> That separation of oil and other ingredients is a sign of &amp;#34;expiration&amp;#34; and defectiveness in all cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> Not like some of other brands.</li>
            <li> He hates other sunscreens that I have bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering trying some of the other Think sunblock.</li>
            <li> Once my kids got wet, it got all milky looking and started running down their bodies.</li>
            <li> The other ones were VERY thick, and left a white layer on my skin.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredient:</li>
            <li> Kids, baby, active, etc. are all marketing tools.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit thick and requires a lot of rubbing, but less so than some other brands of totally natural mineral sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any obvious whiteness (though I am naturally very pale, so it might not be as noticeable on me as it is on others).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can only find this small size.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not saying that it is not right for others.</li>
            <li> Such a hard thing to find.</li>
            <li> The first time I used one I was shocked at how hard it is to spread it on skin and that it turns white and is really obvious you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> works fantastic, doesn&#x27;t burn eyes as bad as some do...</li>
            <li> Only the baby (who also had a sunsuit and often a hat) was not burnt pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> sunblocks I&#x27;ve used made me &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; pretty bad, especially my arms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews before me this sunblock is a watery mess.  </li>
            <li> Finally I don&#x27;t have to hear him complaint in the morning.</li>
            <li> my only complaint</li>
            <li> Kids got really dark and burn when using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was recommended by a blogger who was writing about a cure for Melasma (dark spots on the face) which I also have.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price of the product.</li>
            <li> And some can be incredibly expensive (who wants to pay $39.95 for a 3 oz tube??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is greasy, thick, and leaves a shiny white cast all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Thick and leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit thick and leaves white residue, but that&#x27;s just how it goes with zinc oxide sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick white consistency that goes away when rubbed in well.</li>
            <li> Another reason is that it may give a false safety feeling since it is not effective until 15 minutes has past after applying and the protective effect vanishes after 80 minutes.(also true for this model as written on the bottle).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on too thick or white either, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough so that you can see where you&#x27;re applying</li>
            <li> It in initially goes on thick but rubs in well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick so will leave a white residue if you don&#x27;t rub in well.  </li>
            <li> her hair- got plastered down and stuck in the solution.</li>
            <li> Also, the little guy spent some time in the sun and even in water - I haven&#x27;t noticed any burning anywhere!</li>
            <li> Like any other sunscreen you have to reapply after you enter water or after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> The other thinkbaby which I brought does not sound like this.</li>
            <li> It tends to be a little thin to feel like it will do well, but so far no one has been sunburned, so it must work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small tube however a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I Iike that it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but the only down side is it really takes a lot to rub in.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m looking for something less toxic for my kids, then I expect zinc.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure if the potency/efficacy is still intact considering that the contents of the tube separated probably due to extreme temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought another tube and it&#x27; half WATER.</li>
            <li> WIth Thinkbaby, it takes me about 2 and a half minutes.</li>
            <li> Although it did not itch or bother him in anyway, it was odd.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and since we&#x27;re starting our dreaded Arizona summer I am obsessed with keeping her out of the sun as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s slightly citric)</li>
            <li> The smell is slight and non offensive, a bit coconut-ish.</li>
            <li> It does have a typical sunscreen scent which I wish it didn&#x27;t thus one star off he rating.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a larger tube and less expensive than the sunblock we currently use which is Mustela.  </li>
            <li> I would get the Neutrogena SPF 110 and just dilute it a little with my face cream for my face and a little body lotion for other areas.</li>
            <li> I would get the Neutrogena SPF 110 and just dilute it a little with my face cream for my face and a little body lotion for other areas.</li>
            <li> A 50+ sunscreen for less than the 30</li>
            <li> This formula has a less offensive smell</li>
            <li> +, and without coconut or cocoa oil (kids slightly allergic to).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell: Like oranges, not like your typical sunscreen&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on previous reviews, I decided to try Thinkbaby.</li>
            <li> Has a slight fragrance, would have preferred unscented.</li>
            <li> only *minor* complaint is that this can be difficult to take off, but that&#x27;s the same problem I&#x27;ve had with ALL</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to spread even on the skin, very thick and it left white on my boys&#x27; faces and they were pretending they were zombies.</li>
            <li> It just kept  squeezing out a mess of water</li>
            <li> But it did not mix and it was still a watery mess.</li>
            <li> so the small bottle lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> of the tubes have disintegrated into a watery mess.</li>
            <li> This product does the job, but it&#x27;s thick and not clear.</li>
            <li> Could be a little less creamy.</li>
            <li> even if you tan fine, the sun in the tropics is very dangerous.</li>
            <li> My very pale baby hasn&#x27;t gotten even remotely burned all summer.</li>
            <li> I actually misplaced my first bottle of it &amp; was so frustrated that I had just spent $17 on sunscreen &amp; then lost it.</li>
            <li> although, he does appear to have a little bit of a tan.  </li>
            <li> I just rub it in a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Apply and rub it a little</li>
            <li> and it goes in....perfect for little kids.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a little bit of a scent, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but</li>
            <li> although it still takes a little work to rub it in on his face well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little too expensive&lt;</li>
            <li> will a little face cream,</li>
            <li> will a little face cream,</li>
            <li> It makes her hair a little greasy since I use it on her face/ears</li>
            <li> Immediate shower for myself and the little one to get it off of ourselves.</li>
            <li> a little oily till it soaks in.</li>
            <li> Why would one month&#x27;s product be fine and the next one absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> we are big fans, including my four and seven year olds who are tough to please.</li>
            <li> but so far the Coppertone baby-stick has been the easiest to use and least irritating to my children.  </li>
            <li> From the beginning, I could see that nanoparticles were potentially dangerous as well as often very helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my toddler for a few months now, and he hasn&#x27;t gotten any burns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got a heavy texture.</li>
            <li> and I like that it didn&#x27;t have anything harsh in it.</li>
            <li> The reason it takes a bit longer is because you have to even out and have a thin layer on, or else the white film effect will linger on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li> However, I made the mistake of putting on my face and after just a few minutes of cycling in the sun, I couldn&#x27;t take the smell any longer.</li>
            <li> At 12 something a tube that&#x27;s not exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> It also did not leave any of our skin feeling overly greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> walk everyday for over an hr and haven&#x27;t gotten &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; yet, so I would say this thing</li>
            <li> Works great--high 20% zinc oxide content unlike Honest Company&#x27;s horrible disaster.</li>
            <li> Not too oily or messy.</li>
            <li> After this, I purchased green goddess and that was a nightmare to rub in -</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like to waste products</li>
            <li> never happy when I read the ingredients and the white streaks</li>
            <li> , you will still get a few UV rays here and there</li>
            <li> Whiteness goes away after few minutes.</li>
            <li> My girls were one of the few kids that didn&#x27;t get sunburned as we are at the beach every day for 5 days.</li>
            <li> The dryness persists for a few days even when we moisturize.</li>
            <li> It was pasty and felt heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not loaded with harsh chemicals either.</li>
            <li> and you could still see the harsh color underneath the foundation.</li>
            <li> We have used this sunscreen for a few years now, and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though I do find that it seems to work (if one reapplies after 2-3 hours), it is thick (not as thick as some of the other &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; formulas) and it really, really, dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe using less will help, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> not sure if that makes it less streaky and chalky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other baby sunscreens and they can be quite sticky and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> We even used this sunscreen for her in the Caribbean and on a cruise with NO REDNESS on her pale skin.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers, I have researched on EGW website to find the least toxic sunscreens for my eczema baby.</li>
            <li> Not too thick like other sunblocks.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick and pasty as some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my daughter, I&#x27;m afraid to use it on my husband or me, just because of the price.</li>
            <li> Spreads easily, no sunburns.</li>
            <li> Watery mess!  </li>
            <li> Watery Mess!  </li>
            <li> Over rated its a small bottle with little product.</li>
            <li> and I still use it, I just put it on our bodies and use hats and hope that my little one doesn&#x27;t manage to get it in her eyes :/</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this sunscreen uses a strong artificial scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or if the sunscreen got too hot during shipping</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby and Thinksport are some of the few that are rated as having very few health or toxic concerns</li>
            <li> All the other ones I tried or read about (BabyGanics, Babo, Badger, etc.) were so difficult to rub in and they would dry before I finish putting it on her.  </li>
            <li> i got  some kind of dirty water out it and no cream, there was a bad smell coming out if like a rotten egg..</li>
            <li> I applied liberally as instructed and at least a half hr before sun exposure (expiration date 1/17).</li>
            <li> I use it myself and ony little guy!</li>
            <li> Has protected a snowwhite little angel baby from any sunburn, or harm!  </li>
            <li> My children are ridiculously pale, and Badger Balm sunscreen failed us last summer.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to wash off, you&#x27;ll need a lot of soap, but I have learned that with all mineral sunscreens that is the case.</li>
            <li> It is thick and takes a little time to apply.</li>
            <li> This is a little thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> I am a bit crazy about sunscreens that only contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dawn on me until the next day, when he&#x27;d broken out in quite a bad rash over his face and neck, that it was due to this sunscreen as these were the only places where I&#x27;d applied it.  </li>
            <li> The metal is not appealing either.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A waste of $$ for three bottles of water?!</li>
            <li> It is totally a waste of money-it is so thick and oily.  </li>
            <li> It can get messy when trying to apply at the beach with all that sand!</li>
            <li> I usually buy whichever is cheaper at the moment.</li>
            <li> We have used this for the past two years.</li>
            <li> I  washed my hands, and moisturized as usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that &#x27;s the culprit, but</li>
            <li> Babies are small</li>
            <li> I tried to keep my baby shaded as much as possible; however, that was difficult with the hikes and time at the beach and pool.</li>
            <li> The size is small, like a tube of toothpaste, but I can tolerate it</li>
            <li> This was our sunscreen of choice this past summer.</li>
            <li> This brand lasts as well, if not better, then the chemical brands I used to use that claimed to be waterproof.</li>
            <li> Small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my face as an alternative to all the junk I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> but not sure it would hold up at the beach.</li>
            <li> and I am FRIED- very unevenly fried, too.</li>
            <li> $15 for 3oz is a little ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, I found it hard to rub it into my skin, but not as hard as some others, its not oily however.</li>
            <li> This is no very good for a person who lives in South Florida...</li>
            <li> We used this on our very pale, blond son and daughter and tested it in the midday sun of Kauai.</li>
            <li> have had a bad batch before (see my question above), but I think it was due to the improper storage issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what went wrong with it but is clearly not suncreen anymore</li>
            <li> Rubs in very easily, no chalky whiteness.</li>
            <li> Hard to get around hair twice.</li>
            <li> I tried shaking it hard, thinking that the sunscreen and its liquid had separated.</li>
            <li> Hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> Badger was thick and hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> But this has turned out to be a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a common issue in reviews.</li>
            <li> Purchased in late Aug 2014 with an expiration date of 2016.</li>
            <li> At least you get an even tan....</li>
            <li> I use this for myself and I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Difficult to rub in, but that&#x27;s to be expected with zinc formulas.</li>
            <li> * Leaves behind a faint white film</li>
            <li> but at least with this</li>
            <li> Not thrilled that I bought two of these...</li>
            <li> Not too thick, rubs in well.  </li>
            <li> No issues with a sunburn or anything but the product is too thick for my liking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be too thick to spread on</li>
            <li> it is not too thick.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is so thick, I swear it looks like the baby is wearing Halloween paint.</li>
            <li> This forced me to seek an alternative sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel thick.</li>
            <li> the sunscreen is thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and does not get chunky.</li>
            <li> It is thick but not pasty.  </li>
            <li> Protects just as well but not as thick.</li>
            <li> Babo Botanicals was HORRIBLE - chalky, had to rub it in till your skin felt raw and sticky, and left you with that white glow.</li>
            <li> Needs reapplying after water or excessive sweat!</li>
            <li> The only problem is it is expensive!</li>
            <li> Also - NO overwhelming smell!</li>
            <li> Not a single burn this summer and a faint faint tan after about four hours a day at the pool.</li>
            <li> Two years ago, it was almost impossible to find a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I just feel terrible that I didn&#x27;t test it on a small patch of skin first</li>
            <li> formula is basically like water, so as you can imagine it is EXTREMELY difficult to apply, and runs through your fingers wasting half of the bottle in the process.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any serious burns or freckles yet this Summer...</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> Also a little on the expensive side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 9 days in Hawaii, I am out unfortunately since it is a little on the pricier side</li>
            <li> I can only assume that Lot #4H32 expiration 08/16 is a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does leave a bit of a white hue on the skin, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as the Neutrogena or Coppertone Baby ones I&#x27;ve used on my kids.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a white cast, but it isn&#x27;t so bad that I&#x27;d avoid using it.</li>
            <li> Not good for face unless you have like an hour before you go out and</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as &#x27;Burn Out&#x27; kids sunscreen BEFORE it changed formulas (it had to for FDA shelf stability compliance).</li>
            <li> This is no good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually super sensitive to smells, but this sunscreen has a terrible cloying smell that I also just don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> That small spot burned badly, but all surrounding area wasn&#x27;t even pink!</li>
            <li> I had hard time smoothing it out!).  </li>
            <li> Crappy product, learned the hard way!</li>
            <li> Oxybenzene (endocrine distruptor) and some vitamin A derivatives (claimed by some sources as carcinogenic) are the most infamous nasty chemicals among the other bad fellows that make up the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this morning there must be at least 2 tbsp of liquid squirting out!</li>
            <li> Does the job to block the sun, but is very thick and chalky.</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> Very thick application.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For something for you face, it is very very thick</li>
            <li> The texture of this stuff is very thick</li>
            <li> Thin creams just don&#x27;t protect as well.</li>
            <li> If I had to rub it forever to absorb, I would get annoyed.</li>
            <li> It seems that every summer these spots get worse and worse.</li>
            <li> That shiny, thin layer doesn&#x27;t go away no matter what.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so poorly emulsified.</li>
            <li> Overall I don&#x27;t hate it and will finish off the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, I realize it&#x27;s just a bad product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy feeling and doesn&#x27;t melt into your skin like some other sunscreens, but all in all as a body sunscreen, it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> None of them smell bad, and the Thinksport and Thinksport Livestrong have very little scent at all, so my husband likes those.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was a bad batch</li>
            <li> Not sure whether its a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, and despite being thick isn&#x27;t difficult to spread.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple sunscreen products from the EWG recommendation list and they are all horrible (california baby, badger).  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin (on my arms) looking weird.</li>
            <li> Not knowing this, we ended up with weird tan lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not my type unfortunately....</li>
            <li> it absorbs into your skin without a weird metallic look.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> Unfortunately item was spilled all oveer the inside of the package when we received it.</li>
            <li> this stuff is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I regret ever buying it sadly.</li>
            <li> but  unfortunately my son got a rash from it:-</li>
            <li> , sorry</li>
            <li> (I was a sad mommy)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it makes my face breakout when using</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> It protected well enough from the sun, but the amount of fragrance was insane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what is wrong with it??</li>
            <li> For casual wear at the beach or pool</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy (highly annoying).  </li>
            <li> so I thought maybe it got too cold during shipment</li>
            <li> Extremely unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my face, and it stings like crazy.  </li>
            <li> He cried for an hour while we tried desperately to rinse his eyes out with saline.</li>
            <li> Dangerous to skin.  </li>
            <li> We were concerned with cancer-causing chemicals in our sunscreens (crazy, huh?).</li>
            <li> They are hard to spread and have a horrible odor.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> : The smell may not be unpleasant for some</li>
            <li> and it does not feel unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I did not sweat all, I was very uncomfortable and self-conscious because of the grease and thickness this sunscreen made me felt.  </li>
            <li> Very weird, I&#x27;m throwing the rest of this tube out.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase it to see if the one I got was just a bad batch</li>
            <li> I now see all of the posts about a bad batch</li>
            <li> Not as bad a others.  </li>
            <li> Thinking it might be a bad batch, I went to the thinkbaby website to get their phone number.</li>
            <li> Since I already had 2 bad bottles, I didn&#x27;t take them up on it and bought Neutrogena instead.</li>
            <li> whatever the ingredient is, it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad or appear to affect clothes it touches.</li>
            <li> , it hurts my eyes so bad when I take</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear sunscreen because I break our bad.  </li>
            <li> But this time, the product is terribly bad.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, not greasy, rubs in well.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just embarrassingly bad.</li>
            <li> TOO PAINFUL to eyes.</li>
            <li> Boo :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this sunscreen and now my family is suffering because I trusted it would do the job.</li>
            <li> disappointed in this regard.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a replacement for Burn Out. :(</li>
            <li> i am so disappointed with this product, it becomes so watery.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing since this is</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Yes the sunscreen works, but I hate the smell and cakey consistency.</li>
            <li> When I spread it on my daughter today, I hated the tacky feel and</li>
            <li> My nephew hated it whenever my sister had to put it on his face.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed .</li>
            <li> The worst part, though was that it made my childrens&#x27; eyes water.  </li>
            <li> Awful</li>
            <li> All are burned and miserable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It does not smell nasty.</li>
            <li> However, this sunscreen is beyond awful.  </li>
            <li> No harmful nasty chemicals!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smelled awful.</li>
            <li> so I use this product every day and wear a hat (socal sun is brutal on melasma!)</li>
            <li> but the two tubes I ordered smelled awful!</li>
            <li> I find the smell to be very annoying when applying.  </li>
            <li> But they decided to change the formula for the worst.</li>
            <li> We bought it because of the reviews, and it was simply awful.</li>
            <li> the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it attracts bees.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best baby sunscreen we&#x27;ve found. Applies very easily - smooth but still thick enough to coat well. I bought it because of it&#x27;s EWG rating. It even smells great!</li>
            <li> We really like this product.  Has a nice scent,  smells like baby asprin. Needs to be shaken well (separates quickly in tube).</li>
            <li> I bought this product after BurnOut changed their formulation, really hoping I&#x27;ve found a substitute.  But this has turned out to be a big disappointment.  It is greasy, thick, and leaves a shiny white cast all over my face.  It is nothing like the old BurnOut sunscreen which spreads easily and disappears on my face.  Thinkbaby definitely doesn&#x27;t work well for those who are looking for a face sunscreen to go under makeup.  I guess this product has glowing reviews due to the safe ingredients.  But it is hugely overrated considering its really poor visual / cosmestic effect.</li>
            <li> I loved this one - wasn&#x27;t too pasty, although a little stickier than the neutrogena dry touch that I normally use, but was happier knowing that it was &#x27;safer and better&#x27; sunblock.  Didn&#x27;t notice that much of a smell - used it on my exposed body areas like legs, hands and neck but not the face as I think it would be hard to put makeup on top of it though.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly. I don&#x27;t have the zinc/white layer issues others do regarding sunscreen. If I&#x27;m looking for something less toxic for my kids, then I expect zinc. thinkbaby doesn&#x27;t leave a white layer and goes on cleanly. One of our top picks for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> We bought this for a trip to Florida for my 6 month old. Works great, doesn&#x27;t go on too thick like some other natural sunscreens. I am very happy with it and my wife and I have even used it on ourselves. I will definitely be buying more for summer back home.</li>
            <li> Excellent texture, does not go on too thick like some other physical sunblocks I have tried. I use this product on my neck and face when I go jogging. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Smells great. Feels great. The best natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It smells good, isn&#x27;t too greasy, doesn&#x27;t make your face all white. Such a hard thing to find. Just bought my second bottle today</li>
            <li> Great item! We get it through subscribe and save. It goes on so easily and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen based on the low toxicity and chemicals in this sunscreen and based on its good rating on the EWG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked okay on my bigger kids, but it was very ineffective on my baby.  He is a red head with the extremely fair skin to go with it.  With only 30 minutes in the sub, he was still fried with a persistent sunburn.</li>
            <li> Smells and works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and a family history of skin cancer so I take sunscreen usage pretty seriously. However, I also have sensitive skin and have developed rashes and acne breakouts after using several different brands of sunscreen. I also prefer using products with more natural ingredients. After trying other natural and non-natural sunscreens, including a $30 per 3oz sunscreen from my dermatologist, this is my go to! I used this on a trip to the Caribbean--and no sunburn, rashes or acne! It does tend to separate, so shake well before using. It smells nice, rubs in well, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is excellent! It absorbs into the skin and smells great. The dermatologist recommends sunscreen with Titanium Dioxide as well as Zinc Oxide, which this doesn&#x27;t have. Our family has extremely sensitive skin and multiple family members have been diagnosed with melanoma. With that kind of family history, we take sunscreen very seriously. I probably won&#x27;t purchase again for that reason, but this is a great option for those who don&#x27;t need to be so careful.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 8 month old baby boy.  It soesn&#x27;t smell, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make him white like a ghost except around the hairline.  We&#x27;ve been at the beach and pool several times and he hasn&#x27;t burned at all; although, he does appear to have a little bit of a tan.  Because of that, I&#x27;m going to try a different brand (badger) and see if I prefer that one.  I probably would buy this again, though.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick to provide good protection. Thin creams just don&#x27;t protect as well. Takes some time to rub in, but worth it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many of the all-natural chemical free sunscreens and found most to be thick and difficult to apply with one thing or another that didn&#x27;t work for us. Badger was thick and hard to rub in. Mexitan has both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, has a good texture but leaves white clumps unless you really rub hard right away. Kabana didn&#x27;t work for us either; it left us feeling like we had a think coat on. California Baby good, but heavy, hard to rub in, and has the micronized titanium dioxide. Having so much disappointment with natural sunscreens, I myself started using Blue Lizard which is quick to apply, offers good sun protection, but isn&#x27;t so natural.     Then we tried Thinkbaby and are very pleased. For us, Thinkbaby offers very good sun protection, absorbs easliy and does not leave you feeling greasy. It has a very nice texture and goes on smoothly with a light and pleasant scent. The only concern is with one the ingredient: \\&quot;natural fragrance\\&quot;. What is that? A synthetic scent?     Having tried may sunscreens, in search of one we liked that is also rated well on the EWG as being safe and non-toxic, this is one of our favorites. We also just recently tried TruKid and like it too.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I initially chose it because it was rated as one of the safest on the market by the environmental working group.  I bought both this one as well as badger&#x27;s sunscreen and definitely prefer this one because it goes on a lot smoother.  It works great.</li>
            <li> best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. We use it for the whole family and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. It goes on easily and smells great.Kids actually like using it which is not that way when it comes to other sunscreens. Will definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> Pure watery liquid.  Seems to be a common issue in reviews.</li>
            <li> Four adults, two children and a 4 month old baby went to the beach one day.  Everyone was in and out of the water, everyone except the baby used a waterproof SPF 45 sunscreen.  The baby used this Thinkbaby sunscreen.  Everyone had sunscreen reapplied at the same interval.  Only the baby (who also had a sunsuit and often a hat) was not burnt pretty badly.  The baby was not sunburned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pretty much repeated itself two months later on a rafting trip.  This sunscreen plus s sunsuit and hat were enough to allow everyone else a chance to be stupid while keeping the baby safe.</li>
            <li> Used in Mexico on the beach for a week and baby didn&#x27;t get pink at all!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this. This was the only sunscreen that I carried on my trip and when i opened the seal and tried it.. i got  some kind of dirty water out it and no cream, there was a bad smell coming out if like a rotten egg.. will not recommend to buy it  from here.</li>
            <li> Considering the recent report about harmful ingredients in a lot of the sunscreeens meant for young ones makes me worry. The heat here reaches 120 in mid summer and there is no way we can go without sunscreen for a moment when outdoors! Finding a product that can protect the children safely from the sun, I&#x27;d be willing to pay any price. This sunscreen is a considerable price and knowing that it is safe for my children is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens all around.  I have tried multiple sunscreen products from the EWG recommendation list and they are all horrible (california baby, badger).  They are hard to spread and have a horrible odor.  This one is great!  It smells wonderful and spreads easily.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a safe version of sunscreen for their children.</li>
            <li> Based on the outstanding reviews here, I decided to purchase this sunscreen for my 2.5 year old and 1.5 year old as well as an extra tube for myself.  My first reaction upon putting this on my face was, \\&quot;yuck, who chose the scent?\\&quot;    This reminds me of the CT-scan solution (barium) that you have to drink by the gallon - if you&#x27;ve had this you probably know what I&#x27;m talking about.  I thought it was an unpleasant odor.  However, I could get past this since it promises good protection from the sun and didn&#x27;t seem overly greasy on my face.    The worst part, though was that it made my childrens&#x27; eyes water.  I really thought my son was crying during the day and didn&#x27;t attribute it to the sunscreen until it happened the next couple times we applied the sunscreen.  I also noticed the smell could linger on my face for hours before it seemed to fade away.    Well, I&#x27;ll keep trying others but so far the Coppertone baby-stick has been the easiest to use and least irritating to my children.  My main goal is to avoid the chemical-based sunscreens, though, so the search is still on.  We&#x27;ll use these thinkbaby sunscreens for our shoulders and body.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews before me this sunblock is a watery mess.  I will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs nicely, and all in all a great physical sunscreen especially compared to what is offered out there.  Ties for first with the MyChelle line of sunscreens.  Definitely worth a try.  Don&#x27;t forget to reapply if you are out in the sun,  I was out for 6+ hours and it did not block the whole time.  I should have re-applied.  Oops.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but I wish it would spread better. I think it is the sae formula as the sport one it has the same ingredients</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! I use it too - just an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> My first time purchasing this. I opened the bottle and liquid poured out all over my hand. I guess it&#x27;s a bad batch. I&#x27;ll be returning this.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock, great protection &amp; nice scent!</li>
            <li> I feel ok when use it for me and my baby</li>
            <li> This sunscreen rubs in much easier than other zinc oxide sunscreens like CA Baby and Johnsons Zinc.  think baby doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue on my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Parents beware: I thought this was fine for my toddler, but I got the adult version and have burned twice while using it according to product instructions. Thank god my child had on a hat and rashguard, but I won&#x27;t trust this company anymore. I chose this because of it&#x27;s low EWG rating, but shame on you, EWG and ThinkBaby, if the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t block sun. Surely someone can make a formula that is chemical free AND prevents sunburn and sun damage, right?</li>
            <li> Great consistency and we have used probably 4 times now and my fair haired/blue eyed little one has not burned a bit!  Excellent quality and I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Want so much to love this. Great texture. Scent is mild and pleasant. It does NOT break us out or make our faces itch. It is PABA, paraben, phthalate &amp; BPA free. It does have a slight white cast upon application but that quickly fades. But we tan in this. I cannot understand it. I am vigilant and regimented in reapplying. With the high concentration of zinc oxide (20%), I&#x27;d expect better performance. We did not even do beach time in this. It was just a summer afternoon, out &amp; about for 2 hours. I think they need to add Titanium dioxide. It is not enough on its own. Too bad because it has SUCH a wonderful texture and goes on so nicely compared to a lot of other physical sunblocks. I will repurchase it to see if the one I got was just a bad batch but I will not trust it to a beach vacation or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I bought this in January and was going to use it for the first time today (March 21) and the whole thing was basically liquid water.  I don&#x27;t know what went wrong with it but is clearly not suncreen anymore and I was left with nothing to protect my baby.  Does this stuff only last 2 months?</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell , goes on smooth. Needs reapplying after water or excessive sweat! Loved this product !</li>
            <li> Purchased this because of the good EWG rating as well as a recommendation from the Food Babe website.  I used it on my 15 month old on her first vacation to Mexico.  It rubbed in fairly easily and I feel like it offered good sun protection.  I did try to keep her out of the sun as much as possible but after 8 days of playing in the sand and water she never burned and came back as pale and fair as she was when she arrived.</li>
            <li> I love this product. it is not greasy at all and smells like oranges. My three year old does not mind having this sunscreen put on at all.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, smells great, great protection.</li>
            <li> I have used virtually every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen on my toddler - this is the best. It&#x27;s not greasy, rubs in well and doesn&#x27;t cast a white sheen to her skin, doesn&#x27;t run, prevents her from tanning, and lasts through hours of sand/water play. It is the only sunscreen that has not irritated her super-sensitive skin. And, it smells like a dreamsicle!</li>
            <li> Great smell and protected my 11 month old&#x27;s extremely fair skin. Rubs in easily with no white leftover on her skin.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I tested so far. I like that is not thick and it smells great. My son mentioned how he likes the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells good, rubs in easily. I used it on my one year old on a recent beach trip.</li>
            <li> Watery mess!  Make sure to shake the product before squeezing the tube.  The watery part of this product completely separated from the cream. So when I squeezed the tube, the liquid squirted all over the place.  I received a replacement.  Same thing.  I didn&#x27;t want the trouble of returning it; so I decided to give it a long shake hoping that it would emulsify.  It actually worked.  But I&#x27;m not sure if the potency/efficacy is still intact considering that the contents of the tube separated probably due to extreme temperature. So no, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to apply.  Also, no amount of rubbing in dissipated the chalky white color.  My child was mortified.</li>
            <li> good and safe goods. And easy to spread.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen! Goes on smoothly, rubs in nicely, and protects completely. I&#x27;ve been using this on my toddler for a few months now, and he hasn&#x27;t gotten any burns. Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this sunblock a lot and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> When the latest Environment Working Group list of best sunscreens came out I sought out sunscreen that was in their top rated category for safety and provided SPF 50+ protection. This product was by far the most reasonably priced option which fit both criteria. Once I received it I was pleased to find that the sunscreen goes on smoothly without being overly thick, which is often a problem with these safe sunscreens in which zinc oxide is the active ingredient. It also has a pleasant citrus smell. I highly recommend this sunscreen for kids and adults alike!</li>
            <li> Does the job to block the sun, but is very thick and chalky. I&#x27;ve been looking for the least toxic brands to use on my face, and while I&#x27;m ok with using this brand on my body, I&#x27;ve found an alternative for my face: Ocean Potion SPF 35 for Face. It has a good rating on EWG.ORG, and blends into the skin much better. I&#x27;m happy to reapply a lower SPF more often without having to use a mirror to ensure I don&#x27;t look like a corpse, with a grey-white cast on my face.</li>
            <li> Practical and effective on my daughter&#x27;s very pale skin. came to buy it because EWG recommended it and so do I.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of its excellent rating on the ewg skin deep database and the high reviews on amazon. I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but the texture reminds me exactly of Elmer&#x27;s glue. I expected it to be greasy, but it is exceptionally thick and very sticky. I don&#x27;t agree with previous reviewers that it is easy to spread or pleasant to use. When I spread it on my daughter today, I hated the tacky feel and how everything -especially her hair- got plastered down and stuck in the solution. I had to wash my hands several times to get the coating off. The high SPF and low toxicity can&#x27;t be argued and I will try to keep using this when the sun is intense. But I will be continuing to try other sunscreens. I tried and love the burnout kids SPF 30 sunscreen that had a good rating on ewg and it has an excellent non-greasy texture. But it doesn&#x27;t have as high an SPF as this one.</li>
            <li> A huge stream of water squirted out from two of these tubes. I switched to All Natural Organic Ayurvedic Mineral SPF30 Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen had a great fragrance and was easy to rub in.  Did not leave a white cakey film like many similar sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I tried several different chemical free sunscreens and this is by far my favorite product. It has the pleasant very light smell of lemon grass and other natural oils. I find that I prefer the light smell to no smell at all. This product is very easy to apply and a little goes a long way. I found it to be very water resilient and it doesn&#x27;t leave my childs skin looking chalky or irridescent like some other brands. It hasn&#x27;t seemed to irritate by sons eyes at all and we both have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t experienced any rashes or skin break outs. In terms of sun-protection it works extremely well at preventing a sun burn even on fair skin tones. My son went for 4 hours straight on the beach with one application at the hottest time of the day and he did just fine. It it also the best priced product in it&#x27;s class I only wish it came in a larger size options. I would prefer to buy a tube that is twice this size.     Overall definitely worth the few extra bucks if your considering a healthier option for your family! If your making the switching from something with chemicals like waterbabies you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the ease of use and results of this product.</li>
            <li> Watery Mess!  The sunscreen started about well, but by the time I got halfway through it, the remaining sunscreen had become completely liquid.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  Not too thick, rubs in well.  Outside with fair skinned child and no sunburn!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have tried for our kids. It actually protects for hours without leaving tons of white or stickiness all over them. Will definitely continue to buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so greasy and it melts right into my daughter&#x27;s eyes when it&#x27;s hot out--they turn red and clearly bother her. I wanted to use something safe for her, but I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s going to hurt.</li>
            <li> As a diligent pale skinned sun avoider with 3 fair daughters, I was looking for a physical block that applied without too much white cast, non-runny consistency to avoid getting into kids&#x27; eyes, nice orange scent, and under $12.  This sunblock fulfills all my requirements and I am so pleased with this product, now using exclusively this one for the past 3 years. I will not look for another brand sunblock again.  I did not find any difference between Think Baby and ThinkSport; I can&#x27;t find these in any physical stores.  I just buy whichever is cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen and we will never go back! It smells great, goes on smoothly and it is super safe (see the EWG Sunscreen Guide for more info on what&#x27;s in your environmental products and their safety). I only wish I could find in larger sizes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my baby since she was 6 months old. Love that it&#x27;s totally safe, and I think this sunscreen rubs in much better than babyganics. I use it on myself now too!</li>
            <li> Purchased in late Aug 2014 with an expiration date of 2016. Yet in spring 2015 it is completely ineffective. It worked when new but 8 months later has zero effectiveness on my 2 year old. The Thinksport that I purchased for myself had liquified in this same time frame. Contacted the manufacturer but they never responded. Reviews convinced me to purchase this brand but the truth is that drug store brands cost 75% less and work much better. Spend you money on a better product.</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent!!  Works great for my fair skin! Rubs in easily, doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all, smells great, and keeps me from burning!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen goes on white but dried clear, even on the face. I put it on my 3 year-old with no skin irritation or complaints. I used light layers to apply it and added additional amounts where needed.It was not sticky or greasy and prevented her from getting sunburned (she is extremely fair skinned). I highly recommend this product, as it was easy to use, little amounts were needed, and it worked!</li>
            <li> Great suncreen for kids. Smooth elegant application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the natural sunscreens on the market and really liked this one.  For the high level of safety and for the sun protection this did great.  We used this on our very pale, blond son and daughter and tested it in the midday sun of Kauai. After applying it in the morning before getting dressed then driving to the beach and splashing in the water for over an hour and finally rinsing off the sand.  It was at this time I noticed the sunscreen was still quite visible on their skin which was a good thing. The fagrance is a very light citrus smell and it rubs in very well and isn&#x27;t greasy unlike many other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used which leave a white film or a greasy feeling and as for people saying that they still tanned using this, I might agree that there was some slight tanning but no burn.  This proved to be quite water resistant as well.  I hope they come out with a bigger size!</li>
            <li> Great protection. Goes on easily, smells good, no white residue, does leave a slight greasy feel but it absorbs quickly and goes away. My toddler has very sensitive skin and she has gotten rashes other sunscreens .</li>
            <li> This was for my wife. She has been using this brand for some time and she loves it. She recommends it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I feel safe using this and knowing that the product is safe for infants.&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasant (orange vanilla? though it seems strange to have this kind of flagrance for sunscreens.)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It got a heavy texture. It doesn&#x27;t spread smoothly. Because of this, I have to pull my baby&#x27;s skin when I apply it and he hates it.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try a different product next time.</li>
            <li> I just opened this and its WATER! Its 100% un-usable and has to be thrown out. This is my second purchase (as a part of the subscribe &amp; save program) and the first one was fine. Of course I opened this 3 days after my 30 day return option. I am so upset. Why would one month&#x27;s product be fine and the next one absolutely horrible. Guess I am back to buying Bader products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too oily for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I was directed to this product because it is one of the safest I could find. However, the cons outweigh the benefits for me.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Most chemical sunscreens irritate my skin a bit but this is physical and didn&#x27;t irritate it at all.&lt;br /&gt;-It works.&lt;br /&gt;-Its safe.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- At first smells like cookies then smells like metal. As a man i don&#x27;t like smelling like cookies. The metal is not appealing either.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a heavy white cast. Not good for face unless you have like an hour before you go out and even then you need to wipe it off so you don&#x27;t look like Mulan.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves my skin (on my arms) looking weird. Not exactly white cast but they do look paler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend this unless you are using it on a baby because they don&#x27;t care what they smell like and it&#x27;s okay if they look like Mulan. Also it&#x27;s not just water, I don&#x27;t know why people are saying that.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers stated, the tube was mostly a watery substance.  When I shook it I could hear the liquid moving around ( which has never happened with other sunscreens).  I ordered it during the winter so I thought maybe it got too cold during shipment but now that I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, I realize it&#x27;s just a bad product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Extremely unhappy with my purchase. A waste of $$ for three bottles of water?!</li>
            <li> First time I opened this sunscreen, I had to drain so much water and half of the tube was gone.  I like the cream itself, seems to be gentle enough for our little one but every time I use it there&#x27;s water...</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen. 20%+ of zinc oxide. A little pastey but covers very well!!</li>
            <li> Thick and leaves a white residue. If you&#x27;re like me - hairy arms/legs and often have scruff on your face - this is pretty much not useful because it&#x27;s so hard to rub in and takes awhile to apply and leaves too much of a white look (after lots of rubbing, I looked &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34;). That all said, it does work…non oily, effective, smells good, non irritating. I&#x27;m looking for a healthier alternative to mass marketed commercial brands and will keep looking because lifestyle/ease is a part of my equation.</li>
            <li> Love it, except wish it was fragrance free (it has a sort of orange push-up scent).</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and rub in with no white afterglow. The downside is that my son did get a little red using this. I was out for the same amount of time as him wearing Sun Harbor SPF 30, which is not easy to rub in (hence the reason why I didn&#x27;t use it on my 3 year old), and I did not burn at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this sunscreen for my 6month old twins after reading up on all the ingredients and deciding it was the safest for their delicate skin.  We live in Florida so sunscreen is a must.  It smells yummy and goes on very easily.  No greasy feel, and absorbs quickly. Of course, most importantly it does it&#x27;s job- they wore it while we were out on a boat all day and it protected them very well.  I will purchase again when we run out!</li>
            <li> i bought this because of the rave reviews.  It is totally a waste of money-it is so thick and oily.  I applied it yesterday on an only 81F typical NYC day. Despite the fact that I did not sweat all, I was very uncomfortable and self-conscious because of the grease and thickness this sunscreen made me felt.  I was only on my way to postoffice for only an hour, I cant image wearing this all day...I will only recommend using this, i guess, in winter or extreme dry weather.</li>
            <li> a little thick and if I put just a smidge too much on it&#x27;ll leave me white as a ghost, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It works and I feel good about putting it on my baby!!</li>
            <li> Rubs in very easily, no chalky whiteness. Pleasant light citrus scent that, for mysterious reasons, makes my 5 year old nearly vomit. But I still love it for the rest of us!</li>
            <li> I chose this based on its EWG ratings. The first thing I noticed is that it smells surprisingly nice! It has a very subtle orange-y scent, which I don&#x27;t usually like, but in this case I enjoy it. I was concerned that it would leave me looking white and pastey, but with just a little extra rubbing, it blends very well and I didn&#x27;t notice any obvious whiteness (though I am naturally very pale, so it might not be as noticeable on me as it is on others). I tried it for the first time on a trip to the desert museum and saguaro national park in Tucson, AZ on a 100 degree day, full-sun, from about 10am to 2pm...I applied it only once before I left my house (an hour before going outside, 9am), and by 3pm I just had a little sunburn on the back of my neck and top of my shoulders. I believe the redness on my shoulders is from my purse strap and seat belt wiping the sunblock off, and the back of my neck probably got burned because I was sweating. My skin did not burn anywhere else. My words of advice, and something I&#x27;ll be more cautious of in the future, is to be aware of anything that might wipe the sunblock off (seat belts, purse straps, towels). It&#x27;s a zinc-based sunblock, which means it&#x27;s a physical sunblock and more prone to coming off. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Great chemical free sunscreen. Goes on easy and has a nice smell. Definitely prevented my 14 month old from getting sun burnt this summer.</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunscreen</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and has a pleasant scent.  I really like that I can feel confident using it on my son knowing that he is not being exposed to harmful chemicals that are found in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It gives rash on baby&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Changed formula now it&#x27;s WATERY.  I bought thinkbaby sunscreen when the blue band on the bottom was black. It was the best sunscreen ever for my sensitive, fair, toddler. Smelled great, never burned, was 50 vs 30 protection, etc. I bought another tube and it&#x27; half WATER. I thought maybe I had to shake it up but it sounds like coagulated water and sunscreen in the bottle. It just kept  squeezing out a mess of water and I did not trust it to protect my toddler and infant at all. Got home and checked my old bottle and saw that the newer versions first ingredient is now water - would have liked a mention of a different formula. I will be tossing the entire new bottle. Ugh. Going to try nature gate after borrowing a friends.</li>
            <li> I also have tried several brands of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen, this is the best I have used so far. Easy to apply and blends in well. Our whole family used this on our vacation in Hawaii and we did not have even the slightest pink tone from a sunburn. Highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> This item works as noted. I purchased this for my 6 month old at the time and I like that it didn&#x27;t have anything harsh in it. Make sure you put it on before heading out to the beach or pool. It can get messy when trying to apply at the beach with all that sand!</li>
            <li> This works great and is a great price for one of the &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; sunscreens out there (http://safemama.com/cheatsheets/sunscreen/ has great info about this).  I use it on my kids with much success.  I can use it on my body, but it irritates my face (my face is extremely sensitive).</li>
            <li> I really love this sunscreen.  There is a slight white cast to your skin, but worth it.  Like any other sunscreen you have to reapply after you enter water or after a few hours.  This is the second year my husband and I have used it and we haven&#x27;t had any burns when we properly apply… and we always do.  :)</li>
            <li> This is great sunscreen for little ones. We bought it for our 15 month olds first beach trip and it protected him wonderfully. I like that it only has two ingredients, one being zinc, and it&#x27;s still easy to apply (unlike many other zinc screens). It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> you should shock shock before use it</li>
            <li> After reading about all the issues w/ sunblock from the other brands, I&#x27;m glad I bought this based on amazon&#x27;s review.  I applied this very liberally on my LO and no burns at all. The sunscreen goes on easy though it is a little thick.  I just rub it in a little longer.  I&#x27;ll gladly pay anything to ensure the health &amp; safety of my LO.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite kids&#x27; sunscreen, and it&#x27;s surprisingly affordable too! It&#x27;s the easiest to spread of all zinc oxide sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried so far, I love that it&#x27;s SPF 50 (instead of the typical 30), it has a top EWG rating (1), and I love the slight citrus scent! I&#x27;ve tried California Baby, Badger, Alba Botanica for Kids, Neutrogena Pure&amp;Free, Coppertone Water Babies. I would definitely recommend this product, I love it!</li>
            <li> Really good when we use it under the strong sunshine.</li>
            <li> I and my kids use this whenever we go to the park to walk our dogs. Very effective!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Unlike the other zinc based suncreens, this one goes on smoothly and does not turn you white (at least not near as white). I have tried many others and none go on as easily and transparently as this. Great protection too. If you are in the water a lot you might need to reapply, but that goes for any sun lotion. Also has a nice smell. Use it on my children and myself.</li>
            <li> Easy to Apply and very clean natural products</li>
            <li> Good product. Still a little think and pasty but better than other natural sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunblock!  It&#x27;s wonderful to use on the face as well as the body.  Five stars!  I just want to share with y&#x27;all that sunblock is totally necessary during summer months.  The Thinkbaby Safe Suncreen SPF 50+ smells really good, and it goes on pretty smoothly.  I read from Consumer Reports that mineral sunblock tend to come off or loose effectiveness when one swims in the water for a while.  For swimming and water sports, I recommend Equate Ultra Protection Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, because the stuff stays on the skin even when wet.  Dear fair skinned folks, please do not use tanning beds.  Tanning beds are associated with increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.  Melanoma risk is increased from the use of tanning beds by as high as 70%.  For some people the tanning process only turns skin red, and the tan does not last.  Try sunless tanning lotion recommended by dermatologists or consumer reports, this may be an alternative beauty treatment that works.  P.S. Rate of death from melanoma is one person every hour.  One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.  Melanoma risk doubles when one has more than 5 sunburns.  One in fifty Americans will develop melanoma.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell. but except that, I love this</li>
            <li> Our absolute favorite sunscreen for our daughter! It&#x27;s not hard to apply and she&#x27;s never gotten a burn in the 3 summers she&#x27;s been alive. We even used this sunscreen for her in the Caribbean and on a cruise with NO REDNESS on her pale skin. The ingredients are rated wonderfully in this product. I recommend it to everyone! We use thinkbaby or thinksport. Just whatever is cheapest at the time. I trust this sunscreen completely and don&#x27;t ever see a reason to switch to another.</li>
            <li> We like the sunscreen very much since its quite hot here in Guangdong China and my baby needs this, easy to clean</li>
            <li> I wish I could give zero star on this. It was opened (clumps all over) and oil was leaking. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby smell wonderful, is easy to rub in, and contains no chemical sunscreens. This is the only one I will use for my son.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this brand and its oily for my face but good for my arms and neck.  I&#x27;ll use something different for my face.</li>
            <li> While getting it all rubbed in can be a challenge, it works well and knowing it&#x27;s safe makes it worth it to me!</li>
            <li> Nice sunscreen with a nice orange smell to it. As with all zinc oxide sunscreen u get a white layer when u apply to your skin but it&#x27;s def not that bad if u have fair skin. A little but pricey but the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have all those other toxic chemicals make it worth it.</li>
            <li> Information is power, and the internet is an amazing tool at dispersing information to the masses. Two years ago, it was almost impossible to find a physical sunscreen. I remember paying over $40 for a 3oz tube of physical sunscreen that left me looking like casper the ghost. Fast forward to 2015, all the major players are starting to produce physical sunscreens! Not only is it great at blocking out the sun, it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals that is detrimental to the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consumers for this item in 2013 were either:&lt;br /&gt;1. Allergic to the chemicals in traditional chemical sunscreens or;&lt;br /&gt;2. Looking to avoid the harsh chemicals in traditional sunscreens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical sunscreens has many brilliant applications over their traditional counterparts, but in my mind, there are two distinct disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It leaves a white residue on your skin&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes much longer to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinkbaby has addressed both of those concerns with their SPF 50+ sunscreen. When you first apply, it comes out as a white cream that seems to linger on your skin. Once you start massaging and working the sunscreen into your skin, the white cream disappears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With traditional sunscreens, from beginning to end, it takes me about 2 minutes to apply to my whole body. WIth Thinkbaby, it takes me about 2 and a half minutes. While it&#x27;s slower than the traditional counterpart, it&#x27;s much better than some of the other physical sunscreens that would take 5-6 minutes. The reason it takes a bit longer is because you have to even out and have a thin layer on, or else the white film effect will linger on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of different physical sunscreens out there now, but Thinkbaby is still one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: I&#x27;ve seen some hybrid sunscreens, physical and chemical. If you want a purely physical sunscreen, look for the active ingredients of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. If it lists anything else as anactive ingredient, then it is most likely a hybrid or traditional chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen. No nano-particles. Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Not very stretchy. Hard to get around hair twice. Did not work for my two year olds hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice sunscreen, though my kids did not care for the &#x27;baby&#x27; on the tube.  It has a delicate fruity scent to it, and it spreads really nicely unlike other poorly made zinc oxide products.  Overall it seems to protect against UV pretty well, just make sure you apply liberally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other baby sunscreens and they worked fine but we&#x27;re a bit too greasy. This one isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on easily. Ingredients are very safe and gentle too.</li>
            <li> We purchased this cream to protect our baby from the sun and it we are glad we did. While we do take all precautions to shade her from the sun, we feel confident that when her skin is exposed, she won&#x27;t burn. The sunscreen is easy to spread and our baby loves the massage she gets as we apply it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my children for a beach vacation. I found that it rubbed in relatively easily and it seemed to work really well at preventing sun burns without too frequent of re-application. I was happy with the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;But after using it on my 3 year old son for a full week, his skin had a rash all over- pretty much everywhere that wasn&#x27;t covered by a swim suit so we&#x27;re fairly sure it came from this. Although it did not itch or bother him in anyway, it was odd. Next time I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> Goes on non greasy and smells good! It seems to protect my fair skin child. She lives outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural sunscreens (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) for about one year now. The first time I used one I was shocked at how hard it is to spread it on skin and that it turns white and is really obvious you&#x27;re wearing it. This spreads right on, like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunscreen.  For anyone who is flying, I also like that it is three ounces and fits in a Ziploc bag, eliminating the need to by sunscreen on a recent vacation. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to rub in. Smells good. And very high ratings on EWG.</li>
            <li> Over rated its a small bottle with little product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t super thick and doesn&#x27;t leave your face all white and chalky.  Smooth and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6-month-old after researching more natural sunscreen options as my son has terrible eczema and sensitive skin. This fit our needs perfectly. I like that it comes in a small bottle that&#x27;s easy to throw in the diaper bag for everyday use. We used it all last summer and my son never had a reaction or got burned. We&#x27;re buying more for the upcoming summer and I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> I switched from California Baby to this for my 5 year old son. In the first week using it, he has had 3 sunburns. This is the first time he&#x27;s ever burned, so I&#x27;m going back to California Baby. I wrote his name on the tube to keep at school, otherwise I would return it. But I&#x27;m definitely not keeping it.</li>
            <li> Consistency is a bit pasty but goes on fairly easy and absorbs quickly. My complaints (1) it smells mediciny, kind of like diaper ointment, and (2) it protects from burn pretty well but it still tans. Not knowing this, we ended up with weird tan lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue looking but if I can&#x27;t find anything else better, I&#x27;ll come back to this and try to tolerate the unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/5/11 - After trying out Aubrey Organics and Vanicream, I came back to Thinkbaby and purchased the \\&quot;Thinkbaby benefiting Livestrong\\&quot; from Amazon. It is nothing like the tube I got at our local grocery store previously. Consistency is creamy and scent is light. My guess is perhaps the first tube I got had past its shelf-life?&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this sunscreen but only 4 stars because we still get tanned regardless how much/often we apply.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has worked very well for the two little faces in our household and they don&#x27;t fight the application of it because it smells like fruit!  I like that it provides good coverage without the \\&quot;ghostly\\&quot; palor.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was rated &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; on EWG&#x27;s list of sunscreens. It has a very thick consistency and requires some rubbing in order to avoid a &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; kind of face, but I feel very confident that it protects me from the sun. It has a slight citrus scent that I actually enjoy. The price tag is more than I usually would spend on sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t mind paying the higher price if it protects me while I hike. It seems very sweat resistant as well. It did not &amp;#34;run off&amp;#34; like others that I have tried. I definitely recommend this to other buyers and will purchase this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and works well</li>
            <li> We took my ten month old daughter to Las Vegas and it was sunny 100plus weather. She has sensitive skin and is Casper white. Her skin stayed protected, no sunburn and she was out in the sun at the pool all day! I was so happy with the product</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is wonderful. A little goes a long way. We spent hours at the beach and my 3 year old didn&#x27;t burn a bit.</li>
            <li> I like that this contains great sun protection without all the nasty chemicals. Small enough to keep in my purse for travel.</li>
            <li> Received this product with expiry dated July 16. However when I shake the product , it has the sound iof water instead of cream... The other thinkbaby which I brought does not sound like this. This is cheating.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this sunscreen for the first time while on vacation, but the tube was just mostly water with little sunscreen pieces! It was totally unusable. I contacted Thinkbaby and they said it wasn&#x27;t their problem. Awful</li>
            <li> My daughter had a reaction to something in this product.  Her eyes were bright red each time after using this sunscreen.  I switched to another brand and her eyes did not turn red.</li>
            <li> I now see all of the posts about a bad batch but I don&#x27;t think they were posted when I bought mine a while back. At first it was fine but after one or two uses I noticed it was really watery with chunks of sunscreen. I gave it a good shake and it seemed to be fine. But then shaking it didn&#x27;t help anymore so I tossed it. Much too late to get a refund or anything but I won&#x27;t buy it again. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It broke my son out immediately after I applied it. He developed a bright red splotchy rash. I thought it would be better than the chemical sunscreens, not for us.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing!!! I was skeptical at first but read the reviews and decided to give it a try. We have sensitive skin and aren&#x27;t able to use traditional chemical sunscreens. It is safe,  works great (no burns!), and even has a pleasant scent. It also lasts longer than you would think. I was surprised that my family only needed two bottles on a week long vacation. Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good natural sunscreen for my kids for a long time. I thought I found it when I bought this last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. High dose of zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;2. Makes your skin white like a kabuki mask. None of the pictures from last summer could be really printed for framing.&lt;br /&gt;3. Very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;4. Doesn&#x27;t really protect the skin from tanning. At least you get an even tan....&lt;br /&gt;5. THE BIGGEST ISSUE. I bought this late summer last year (2nd tube) and the expiration date is 03/2016. I used it yesterday for the first time this year on my kids. 5 minutes after putting it on, my kids, both of them, had an allergic reaction all over the face and arms. Because I bought it almost at the end of summer, I didn&#x27;t use much and didn&#x27;t expose it to hot temperature. They didn&#x27;t have any reaction last year at all. I don&#x27;t know if chemical changed but I stopped using it and just keeping it in case their allergy gets severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am searching for, yet, a natural sunscreen that is not as greasy and doesn&#x27;t make skin white. I know I have a long road ahead of me but hopefully someday I&#x27;ll find one.</li>
            <li> we love it on the baby!  it smells really nice too.. a little fresh lemon smell... and not so much like chemical.</li>
            <li> I found this on the EWG website, where it got the lowest score of 1 for toxicity, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. The texture of this is great, smooth and creamy, no grittiness or chalky feel like some of the similar sunscreen products for baby. It has a very light scent, a little citrusy, not a heavy coverup like in some of the more mainstream sunscreens for babies.</li>
            <li> My family has had great success with this sunscreen.  Not only is it rated great by the EWG (the reason I purchased it), but it smells good, goes on nicely, and we have had no incidences of sunburn in our family.  Make sure to read the instructions and reapply as directed though.  My only complaint is that I can only find this small size.  I wish they would make a bigger bottle of it.</li>
            <li> This is our absolute favorite sunscreen.  I started using it when my son was about a year old.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit thick and leaves white residue, but that&#x27;s just how it goes with zinc oxide sunscreens.  It also smells really good--a light kind of citrusy scent. My dad also started using it because he developed sensitivity to chemical sunscreens and titanium dioxide, but this one works with no irritation. They also make thinksport sunscreen.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference between them, so I usually buy whichever is cheaper at the moment.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and protected</li>
            <li> You have to rub it in a bit but it&#x27;s not a hormone disruptor like the popular brands of sunscreen.  I use this and the waterproof one-- think it&#x27;s the sports one.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase many natural sunscreens and this one is one of my favorites.  It rubs on smooth and leaves a minimal white haze on your skin.  Not as bad a others.  I love the smell, kind of orangy.  It works great.  No burning.  The only problem is it is expensive!</li>
            <li> We use this Thinkbaby and babyganics on hubby and I when we travel to the tropics, it protects wonderful especially our faces, a 50 SPF protection is a must, even if you tan fine, the sun in the tropics is very dangerous. We love it.</li>
            <li> It was much thicker than I expected. It&#x27;s more like thick ointment or thick white cream to me. Not my type unfortunately....</li>
            <li> Good, but there&#x27;s a smell. It&#x27;s not BAD, really, but not good either. Go buy Blue Lizard Sensitive or Baby instead... Cheaper anyway! Make a good travel tube, I guess.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 6 month old and have used it a few times so far and really like it. The scent is light and fresh and it doesn&#x27;t not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve quite used several sunscreens on my 2 year old son over the past couple of years with no problems and with Summer approaching I thought i&#x27;d invest in this one since it&#x27;s highly rated and regarded.  Within a couple of hours of application my son&#x27;s face got all puffy and he appeared to be in discomfort. It didn&#x27;t dawn on me until the next day, when he&#x27;d broken out in quite a bad rash over his face and neck, that it was due to this sunscreen as these were the only places where I&#x27;d applied it.  I just feel terrible that I didn&#x27;t test it on a small patch of skin first but nothing close to this has happened before. My recommendation is to test it before applying liberally. Very disappointing since this is product is supposed to be so safe for baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> After using so many brands of natural and effective sunscreens, I can tell this is the only one which does not contain harsh chemicals and also not oily. Apply and rub it a little and it goes in....perfect for little kids.</li>
            <li> So far this is working well for my toddler. I did a lot of research and decided on this lotion due to the fact that it lacks a lot of the chemicals that are in other sunscreens. I gave it a four because the smell is not very pleasant, but I&#x27;ll take that if it means safe protection for my child.</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research on the EWG site, I decided to give Thinkbaby Sunscreen a try. The first time I used it, I really liked it. The scent was mild, the consistency was smooth and it didn&#x27;t leave my face looking ghostly and pale.  About a week later, I used it again and the first thing that spilled out was water, water, and more water. I shook the tube and it sounded like a bottle of salad dressing. I tried shaking it hard, thinking that the sunscreen and its liquid had separated. But it did not mix and it was still a watery mess. I read so many positive reviews and a handful of negative ones re: wateriness. Thinking it might be a bad batch, I went to the thinkbaby website to get their phone number. Their site says the quickest way to reach them is by email, so I wrote to them expecting to get a call or email back. It has been about a week now and still I have not heard from anybody. I was hoping to give them the benefit of the doubt, thinking that maybe I got a defective batch. Since they ignored my email, I guess I&#x27;ll never know. Based on their unresponsive and lack of customer service, I will not be purchasing any of their products in the future. Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s amazing customer service. I called them and they apologized for the inconvenience, told me to discard the sunscreen and promptly refunded my money.</li>
            <li> It worked really well in Florida, swimming in the ocean and very hot sunny days. I have rosacea and was happy it did not cause a flareup.I also reapplied it every 2 hours and wore a sun hat. Did not burn!  Would have given it 5 stars but it was not fragrance  free. Had a bit of a fruity smell. For a sunblock it applied easily without the pasty appearance. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Purchased because it didn&#x27;t have a lot of the stuff you find in other sunscreens.  Have a fair-skinned child, and this has worked consistently well now for two summers.  No sunburns, easy to apply and rubs in well, non-irritating, pleasant smell, and no residue.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger size.  While it&#x27;s on the pricier side, it&#x27;s worth it for peace of mind and ease of use.</li>
            <li> the best sunscreen and good deal. Also, good seller. thank you.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is great.  It goes on smelling like orange cream but then refers back to smelling like Thinksport, which is not so great but not too bad either.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I read a blog that had given it a top review. I think it is just ok especially for the price (I paid $13.07 for 3 oz). No issues with a sunburn or anything but the product is too thick for my liking.  It has a pleasant smell (slightly tropical) which is not overly strong... I&#x27;ll go back to Aveeno Baby.</li>
            <li> I really love this sunscreen. It blends very well without leaving my son looking pasty and it smells great. Doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical sunscreen. I use this everyday. I wish they carried a bigger size. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed . I used as directed. Purchased for a beach trip . The kids got burnt and I applied as directed and even put on more frequently than required. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great sun screen. Price varies so much that at the beginning of summer I ordered two tubes for $10 and now it&#x27;s $15 for one.</li>
            <li> I only use ThinkBaby sunscreen on my kids. It workds great and I feel it truely protects their delicate skin. I use it myself and it does not make me feel oily or shiney.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last summer because the good reviews. This year April 2015 I brought the remaining product to Florida during vacation, only found out the remaining product has turned into watery waste. So I guess the product only good for one summer, then you need to toss it out no matter how much has left in the tube. Keep that in mind, only buy enough for the summer. For me, I won&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this from Amazon&#x27;s sister site, Diapers.com - the bottle I received was pure liquid (like water). Not like normal sunscreen and not useable. The replacement bottle I got from Diapers.com had the same problem. Again, this was as soon as I opened it and I live in San Francisco where high heat exposure is likely, even in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Thinkbaby - they offered to send me 2 additional bottles for the price of one, but that was all. Since I already had 2 bad bottles, I didn&#x27;t take them up on it and bought Neutrogena instead. I just wanted to let folks know in case they have the same experience.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent (mild) and burn protection. Still seeking a broad spectrum go-to...the U.S. Needs more options!</li>
            <li> Went on nice and smooth and blocked my kids from the hot California sun!</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen after reading about it on Lucie&#x27;s List. It is hands-down my favorite for my son. It&#x27;s mineral-based but easy to rub in (unlike Badger and others) and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell that some others have. In fact, I&#x27;d say it has a light, nice scent. It works well and seems to stay on for a long time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this sunscreen for her two-year-old twin boys since they first ventured into sunshine. She suggested that I investigate the product I was using and switch to this one. I did and learned that there were ingredients in my old sunscreen that were not healthy to use. I now enjoy using Thinkbaby sunscreen, knowing that its ingredients are not unhealthy and that my skin will be protected from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> We love that this sunscreen isn&#x27;t as greasy as some of the other &amp;#34;better for you&amp;#34; sunscreens. It also seems to work really well, at least for us.</li>
            <li> We are extremely careful with the products we put onto ourselves especially for the kids, so after some research I was so glad to have found this product. it has a pleasant scent, goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t give that ghost like appearance like the California Baby Sunscreen that we used to use. We are extremely happy this product and now even the adults are using it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and love that I can pronounce and understand ALL the ingredients!  This is one of the best natural mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve found.  It is a little bit thick and requires a lot of rubbing, but less so than some other brands of totally natural mineral sunscreen.  While this is normal for mineral sunscreens, I have tried a few that were thinner and easier to rub, but they had other issues, like separating after being exposed to heat.  This one is very stable.  And it smells nice!  Great for adults too.</li>
            <li> Great product but it has pretty strong fragrance. Since it is for kids, I wish it was fragrance free because kids are so sensitive to smells and I as a parent too.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has a high SPF and it is one of the safest (in terms of unsafe chemical additives) according to the Environmental Working Group. Think baby feels just like normal sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t have that oily feel that some natural brands have. I highly recommend it. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen is safe for my whole family. The orange smell is delicious.</li>
            <li> Worked ok at first until it separated and liquified! It was like water and we have not had it for long. Has a peculiar smell that kids and I did not like. Burnout worked better even though that has a tendency to crust around the cap when the kids &amp;#34;serve&amp;#34; themselves.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Completely effective and good EWG rating.</li>
            <li> Amazing product I used for my 8 months baby boy  and work great</li>
            <li> This is great, non-toxic sunscreen for a decent price! We&#x27;ve been using it all summer and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I like the orange ice cream smell, so does my 6 year old boy, but not my 8 year old boy. It is a little greasy to me because I can not stand any heavy feels on my skin, but it is way better than other affordable brands on the market.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is... it&#x27;s hard to spread even on the skin, very thick and it left white on my boys&#x27; faces and they were pretending they were zombies. &amp;#62;0&amp;#60; very funny! Maybe using less will help, but I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;d recommend this and the other one I bought at Costco- &amp;#34;Sunology&amp;#34; (this one spreads easily compares to thinkbaby) to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my child is protected when this is on her. It&#x27;s pretty thick, but non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to write reviews but this stuff merits one. I&#x27;ve been through a lot of natural baby sunscreens and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve found. The texture is great, it goes on smooth and ingredients are good. Other zinc-based products are really hard to rub in but this one goes on nicely, is not sticky or greasy and it smells great. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Smells great, less oily than honest co. Works well. Very pleased. Will buy again. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other chemical filled baby sunscreen</li>
            <li> So far this is the absolute best sunscreen I&#x27;ve purchased for my kids. It is non-greasy and thick (not runny) and I love that it is rated top safety ratings. My kids haven&#x27;t had a sunburn all year and they love to apply this. They think its just lotion. It doesn&#x27;t sting and it isn&#x27;t a pain to apply.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well. It&#x27;s thick so it takes a lot to cover my baby and it&#x27;s a little pricey but If this one lasts the whole summer I will probably purchase again. Has a nice lemony smell</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock. Just make sure you reapply!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no zinc clumping like Badger or others. Great EWG rating, makes me feel good about what I&#x27;m putting on my little girl&#x27;s skin to protect her..</li>
            <li> safe for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Expensive, small tube and not the best scent in the world, but works well and it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s keeping baby safe from harmful rays AND chemicals. Did a lot of research before choosing this one.</li>
            <li> We did a lot of research before settling on this sunscreen for our 6 month old son. This is rated &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; by the EWG meaning that it&#x27;s top rated for being safe for baby and the environment. I was worried it would be too thick to spread on but it actually goes on very nicely and smells fruity too! :) We love it! The only complaint is that I really wish you got more for your money. $15 for 3oz is a little ridiculous.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product, buy aloe gel with it!  We applied this product as directed to five fair-skinned individuals including three children.  All are burned and miserable.  I strongly advise against buying this product.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen goes on smoothly and protects well. it doesn&#x27;t clump. it is not too thick. we are big fans, including my four and seven year olds who are tough to please.</li>
            <li> Great coverage. My son loves the smell so makes it easy to put on a normally wiggly 3 year old!</li>
            <li> Well rated on EWG website, smells great like oranges and doesn&#x27;t sting my daughter&#x27;s skin when applying it on her!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite baby sunscreen and I have tried quite a few.  The consistency is lighter (more like lotion than paste) so, it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry up as I&#x27;m putting it on like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It also comes off my hands easily, whereas other brands are virtually impossible to get off my hands or anything else they came in contact with.  We spend long days on the boat and this sunsreen has protected my son wonderfully.</li>
            <li> We are on our second tube of this great sunscreen-it rubs in well, does not leave white streaks and blends in completely. My daughter has sensitive skin and this sunscreen has not irritated her skin at all. It has a pleasant, light orange creamscicle  scent to it. Protects sensitive and young baby skin from the harsh sun here in Southern California. I would strongly recommend for anyone who wants sun protection but a sunscreen that actually blends in completely and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you have white paint on your face.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve bought. I burn easily and it kept me burn free when a crowd of family that doesn&#x27;t usually burn got burnt. Will definitely be my new regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tube of water. I&#x27;m very upset about it. Won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen for my 5 month old. We don&#x27;t use it often but when I do it goes on easily and has a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen for our kids.  Applies very easily with little to no white residue on their skin.  Gets overall great reviews for being a safer sunscreen due to it&#x27;s ingredients.  Kids love it too.  We have used this for the past two years.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen was all water. A piece of s***.</li>
            <li> We have been searching for &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; alternative of sunscreens for our daughter and our friend recommended this brand. We bought one at first to try it and it worked very well. Its texture is not too greasy and it spreads out very easily. With &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; ingredients, I feel more comfortable to use it on our daughter and the rest of the family. The light orange scent smells very nice, too!</li>
            <li> My favorite baby sunscreen. A little pricey but it spreads well so the small bottle lasts longer than I expected. Nice and thick for good coverage. Have used this many times and baby has no tan/burn. Yummy smell.</li>
            <li> I used it for myself at the beach and kayaking. I like that it absorbs into your skin without a weird metallic look. It also feels like it moisturizers too. Not a bit of sunburn with long days spent in the sun. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Quick shipping and the product smells great. It also seems easy to apply. I haven&#x27;t used it all that much yet, but will post an update if I&#x27;m not just as happy as I am upon initial use!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen as it was highly rated on Amazon and ewg.org. The screen is smooth and not pasty. It spreads easily but it does take some effort to rub in order to avoid the ghost look. Smelling the sent from the tube, it appear to be a light citrus fragrance. However, I made the mistake of putting on my face and after just a few minutes of cycling in the sun, I couldn&#x27;t take the smell any longer. I have tried the product on other areas of my body, where I don&#x27;t notice the fragrance and it does appear to prevent sun exposure. I just can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Very thick. Takes quite a lot of effort to rub it in. I do feel like it gives good sun protection. My daughter has very sensitive, fair skin and this does not cause any reaction.</li>
            <li> Love the Thankbaby sunscreen! This is the only sunscreen I would use for my baby since I trust the company and know its the safest in the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this is a good product but it leaves a white residue over your skin. I like the 50 F FActor</li>
            <li> This was a five star product for us last year. Worked great. Smelled great...we loved it! This year for some reason it is just not working well. We keep getting lightly sunburned. Seems equivalent to SPF10 at best.  So sad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope others have better luck with the tubes they get! It is such a great sunscreen normally!</li>
            <li> Well my baby didn&#x27;t get sunburned and I actually used it too and didn&#x27;t get burned. Success!</li>
            <li> I rarely review products, but this sunscreen is amazing!  My kids are very, very fair and get at least a little sunburnt no matter what sunscreen they use, until now!  I bought this before a trip to New Mexico in the summer, where it was sunny and ninety degrees.  I applied it once on my kids each morning, and they did not get even one tan line.  This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> My first time using for a trip to Cape Cod and my experience was that it was easy to apply and the smell was pleasant and not strong. There is a slight white cast left upon application but it quickly fades and our summer pictures show a healthy, tanned smiling kid. We were diligent about applying before we headed out and despite hours out in the New England summer, no burns for the whole family. I make sure to rub it in my hands before applying so not sure if that makes it less streaky and chalky.</li>
            <li> Works well. Fruity smell. Kids love it as well!</li>
            <li> Great product. We feel very safe using this on our child. This sunscreen gets top marks from EWG on safe sunscreens. It&#x27;s very absorbent and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I love that it works for my 1 year old.  We have had no problems whatsoever. It smells like oranges and is good on his sensitive skin. It is a thick white consistency that goes away when rubbed in well. I even use it on my own face as I usually burn easily. My son is a red head and we have had no burns or redness of any kind thanks to this sunscreen. I&#x27;m glad I did my research and found a product that works for my family.</li>
            <li> From the beginning, I could see that nanoparticles were potentially dangerous as well as often very helpful. Getting a safe and effective sunscreen is like threading a needle, I suppose. The chemical sunscreens go from not so safe to much worse, but nanoparticles have not been proven safe, though zinc oxide fares better than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old fashioned zinc oxide sunscreen is safe, effective, but miserable to wear. The same is true when it is mixed with old fashioned titanium dioxide. Nanoparticle sized makes them pleasant and perhaps just as effective, but I certainly don&#x27;t like the idea of nanoparticles tumbling through my bloodstream like jagged rocks relative to the size of my cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers of Thinkbaby seem to have come up with a good idea -- make the zinc oxide particles smaller, but not nano-sized. The texture is much better without any danger so far as I can tell. My experience is that this product does protect me from the sun, although the true SPF might not be 50+. It feels good to wear after about a half hour of initial whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person suggested adding titanium for even better performance. Perhaps so, if non-nano. If they can use safe but effective  sized particles of zinc, why not of titanium too?</li>
            <li> I bought it to use it on the body so that I do not have to use chemical sunscreens, but this one is very matte and fades away after rubbing it so well that I can use it perfectly on the face also.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of natural sunscreens for my family over the years and this most recent purchase I have been very pleased with. The smell is very mild, and it applies easily. It is a little hard to wash off, you&#x27;ll need a lot of soap, but I have learned that with all mineral sunscreens that is the case. As for its protection from sunburn, every time I&#x27;ve used it I haven&#x27;t gotten a sunburn and when I forget to put it on, I get a sunburn. I would highly recommend this, in fact, I plan to buy more when mine runs out!</li>
            <li> Great product. See safety ratings on ewg.org</li>
            <li> Pros: Great sunscreen, smells great, good protection.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Feels a little sticky in the end of a day, makes me want to take a shower immediately back to hotel.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen and not as thick as some of the other baby ones.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen spreads on pretty easily (much easier than Baby Badger types) and has a nice light scent to it.</li>
            <li> it smells good and works well. If you don&#x27;t make your own, this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells like orange creamsicle. Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I emailed the company after a tube seperate and went all liquidy- never got a response from the company. Boo :(</li>
            <li> I saw this brand recommend in Parents magazine. We decided to go with mineral based and we love it. My baby hasn&#x27;t burned once!</li>
            <li> Nice price for this item, it uses good, a bit white.</li>
            <li> No residue, not sticky</li>
            <li> Safe for kids - yes! Actually prevent sunburn - DEFINITELY NO! SPF 50 - I don&#x27;t think so!</li>
            <li> My child is 1 year old now and since we&#x27;re starting our dreaded Arizona summer I am obsessed with keeping her out of the sun as much as possible.  That said, I felt that this had its pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Ingredients are all physical barrier which is good.  It does rub on excellently and since she squirms a lot I don&#x27;t get a lot of opportunity to rub it in.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave her too pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell may not be unpleasant for some but I find it to be very strong and I don&#x27;t particularly care for it.  I really wish it was unscented since it seems to linger quite a bit on her skin.  Also a little on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m leaning toward trying another brand since I really dislike the strong scent.</li>
            <li> We loved it, we applied it 3x/day in SoCal while outdoors as well as on the road and baby is perfectly fine. We loved the smell, too - dad says it reminds him of the beach (it&#x27;s slightly citric)</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen for our baby, it&#x27;s a little thick but goes on easy and seems to last without being too sticky. Will definitely buy more and use daily during the summer months</li>
            <li> In the summertime protecting myself and my children from harmful effects of sun is of great importance. We all need sunlight for proper Vitamin D synthesis in our body however a 20 minute/day direct exposure (not blocked by window glass or clear plastic) is more than enough for that purpose. Anything above that starts to show the adverse effects of the sun. What are they? The most pronounced two adverse effects are premature aging of skin and skin cancer, not to mention horrible immediate redness and tenderness followed by peeling of skin which can cancel your all joy from a beach holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid all those effects we have to take preventive measures. The most effective and the least harmful preventive measure is to avoid exposure to sun during critical hours. So if you can avoid being under direct sunlight between 10am and 3pm you are doing the best you can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second comes appropriate clothing and accessories. I recommend using rash guards (top part of swim suits that can block UV while not causing a big restriction.) They should be worn especially by children although I, as an adult men, got used to wearing one [[ASIN:B005QXESWW Speedo Men&#x27;s UPF 50+ Easy Short Sleeve Rashguard Swim Tee]] happily . Hats and glasses are other accessories that come to my mind as preventive measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third comes the sunscreens. The reason I rate it below the first two is that it contains a bunch of ingredients and can readily be absorbed by body, enter blood stream or have effects in local skin tissue. Therefore it is critical to know what is in it and what it does after routine daily use. Another reason is that it may give a false safety feeling since it is not effective until 15 minutes has past after applying and the protective effect vanishes after 80 minutes.(also true for this model as written on the bottle). So not knowing these details may get you unprotected while you mistakenly believe you are safe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to FDA website 17 ingredients are allowed to be topically applied to skin for the purpose of sun protection. External websites (including the Oz show and EWG) says 15 of them are proven endocrine distruptors which, after entering your blood stream can act as your hormones and cause imbalance, leading to different adverse effects. Oxybenzene (endocrine distruptor) and some vitamin A derivatives (claimed by some sources as carcinogenic) are the most infamous nasty chemicals among the other bad fellows that make up the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;innocent&#x27; guys are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Those ingredients are believed to be relatively harmless while offering good UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product has 20% zinc oxide as the active ingredient. So it has an overall rating of 1 out of 10 in EWG (Environmental Working Group) website (lower number means less harmful) Zinc oxide, on that website , is rated as 2 with some minor concerns about cellular problems and bio-accumulation. Other filler ingredients are listed as harmless except dimethicone which was rated 3 due to some organ level toxicity concerns as well as environmental toxicity issues. However among the list of 462 sunscreens clearly investigated by that independent agency, this one still rates among the top products. Besides it is rated as having a good balance of UV A and UV B protection by many external websites I have searched including EWG itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all those general information, here comes my hands on experience after two months of use:&lt;br /&gt;-It is effective: No sunburn in my children after our two weeks of beach holiday. (But I have to say we have avoided the sun by staying in shade as much as possible and used protective clothing too..)&lt;br /&gt;-It did not cause any irritation or skin problems,it is also written on the bottle to be safe for babies over 6 months old (younger than that: check with your doctor is what it says)&lt;br /&gt;-It does not smell nasty. No smell apart from a mild fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;-Price wise it is okay especially when considering the availability to order it through subscribe and save and get an additional upto 20% discount (at the time I bought it). (some reviewers point out bigger 6 ounce sizes are available for cheaper in external websites which might be worth considering too...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I am pretty happy about the purchase and apply it without much concern to my kids as an additional sun protection to other methods, I discussed above. Just keep in mind the instructions and re-apply regularly and you are good to go...&lt;br /&gt;-Price wise it is okay especially when considering the availability to order it through subscribe and save and get an additional upto 20% discount (at the time I bought it).

            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any sunburns on the baby, so I can&#x27;t complain. As far as we can tell, it works great! Don&#x27;t love that it isn&#x27;t supposed to be eaten but I haven&#x27;t been able to find sunscreen that can be eaten, either. Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> We go to the pool several times a week, this is nice and thick, although a pain to wash off your hands. My daughter has never had a sunburn or any skin problems with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a little bit of a scent, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will keep purchasing this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for my 8 yr old swimmer and tennis player.  We live in hawaii where its always sunny!  Love the EWG rating,coverage is great and goes on easy.  Tried many, the price seems to be one of the best and my daughter doesnt mind it, unlike the more thick white paste like ones of some of the other brands.  I will say though that because it is more liquidy we do end up using more</li>
            <li> This is the  best sunscreen ever.  It&#x27;s cruelty free and rated good with the EWG and it really works.  We spent 9 days in Florida and I used this on me and my 3 yr old &amp; neither of us ever burned.  It rubs in easily, very light scent and lasts well in the water.  I just ordered 2 more tubes.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is so thick, I swear it looks like the baby is wearing Halloween paint. This is one of the sunscreens that the Environmental Working Group approved so we&#x27;re giving it a try this summer.</li>
            <li> It works well &amp; I Iike that it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but the only down side is it really takes a lot to rub in.  It really leaves a white layer that&#x27;s hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  The whole family uses it</li>
            <li> After a TON of research, we started buying this sunscreen last summer to avoid the toxic ingredients in most other sunscreens.  Truthfully, I prefer a spray, and am not a fan of lotion.  But, I also don&#x27;t want to slather myself in chemicals or nanoparticles of zinc oxide that can be absorbed.  Thinkbaby has a fresh peachy sort of scent, doesn&#x27;t leave us looking like ghosts, and it WORKS--even at the beach.  I just ordered 4 more tubes for this summer.</li>
            <li> So glad to find a great sunscreen for baby! The tube is bigger than expected! Thanks so much! :) :)</li>
            <li> light scented… very smooth</li>
            <li> We have tried many different brands of chem-free sunblock on our 10 month old, this is one of our favorites.  Goes on very easy (unlike many others) and has worked well in the sun preventing burns. Like all other sunblocks, make sure to reapply after time in the water. Mom and Dad approved!</li>
            <li> I wish I could leave a review without any stars so I guess I&#x27;ll say the one star is for the only pro. It wasn&#x27;t runny or greasy. However, this sunscreen is beyond awful.  I am extremely cautious with sun exposure and slather sunblock every hour.  Despite having used half the bottle on our family in only one afternoon, we are all very very crispy.  My kids have never burned. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this sunscreen and now my family is suffering because I trusted it would do the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin. However, I planned on using this on my toddler as well, so I decided to do a patch test on the top of my hand first. Immediately after I applied it, I felt a small itch, but I figured that was normal and it went away almost immediately, so I ignored it. I showered that night, and when I woke up the next morning, I noticed that my hand still had a white overcast on it, and appeared a little flaky, so I figured I probably didn&#x27;t wash it off well enough in the shower the night before. I  washed my hands, and moisturized as usual. Later that night, I noticed that my skin was super scaly and literally felt like sandpaper compared to my other hand. I moisturized again, but it still felt dry. All in all, I think it took about a full week before my skin went back to its normal texture. This is some pretty potent stuff to have done that to my skin. I looked at the ingredients and one of the main ones is Ascorbic Acid (which is a form of Vitamin C). Depending on the percentage used, this is something that can cause exfoliation on the skin surface. Not sure if that &#x27;s the culprit, but whatever the ingredient is, it&#x27;s bad. Luckily Amazon is awesome and I was able to return the product for a refund. Still searching for the perfect sunblock...</li>
            <li> I like how this sunscreen is pretty easy to put on. It is thick but spreads pretty well on my two squirmy toddlers. So far no burns and this size should last the whole summer. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell, its a little minerally smelling. But I guess that is what no chemicals will smell like.</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this sunscreen because it is considered one of the safest ones for a baby but it was a pain to put on.  My daughter would be completely white because it is so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up loving the Honest sunscreen and now it came out in a spray form so we will probably switch to that to make life much easier with a 9 month old that won&#x27;t sit still.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I bought this for me and my daughter. It goes on white, but with some blending it disappear quickly! My recommendation is to put it on in increments. Don&#x27;t dump a huge blob on one area at once.  Do one area at a time and it blends in so nicely. Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Active Ingredient: Zinc Oxide 20% (Non-nano)&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: PURIFIED WATER (0), ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE (0), CAPRIC CAPRYLIC TRIGLYCERIDES(0), SORBITAN STEARATE (COCONUT BASED) (1), PINE WOOD RESIN (0), VEGETABLE GLYCERIN (0), CETYL DIMETHICONE (0), HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL (0), MAGNESIUM SULFATE (EPSOM SALT) (0), SUNFLOWER OIL, JOJOBA OIL (0), ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C) (0), TOCOPHEROLS (VITAMIN E) (1), OLIVE OIL (0), RASPBERRY SEED OIL (0), CRANBERRY SEED OIL (0), HYALURONIC ACID (MADE FROM VEGETABLE) (0), GLUCOSE &amp; GLUCOSE OXIDASE AND LACTOPEROXIDASE (0), PAPAYA (0).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different sunscreens with different amount of ZO Some offer 22.5%, 18%, 10%... The higher the ZO, the more SPF. I want the highest ZO especially when it is priced right since ZO is expensive and more means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days the low ZO works well. SUNSCREENS ARE NOT BEAUTY PRODUCTS. I USE TO PROTECT MY SKIN SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER. WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN. Read the ingredients not the marketing. Ingredients tell the truth. Kids, baby, active, etc. are all marketing tools. There are no regulations that a baby or a kid is suppose to get 18% ZO or 22% ZO. One needs to decide based on ingredients and the protection amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: Thinkbaby sells these 20% ZO claiming SPF %0+ which is a lie. ZO used is not specified as uncoated. Not an organic formula. Cost is high. It is a better brand than other chemicals on the market, but why pay for something that ids priced as the quality sunscreens without the quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock, my boy hate the white stuff left on the face and arm from other natural sunblocks, and he will rub very hard to get ride of them. This one is like self absorb, very easy to put on and smell good. Finally I don&#x27;t have to hear him complaint in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as the SPF 50+ Coppertone I regularly use.</li>
            <li> I have tried SOOOOO many zinc oxide-based sunscreens, and this is my absolute, hands-down favorite. It is the easiest to spread on of any I have tried and rubs in quickly and easily. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel like most others do, and the smell is pleasant. It&#x27;s so non-greasy that it&#x27;s the first zinc-based sunscreen that I feel comfortable wearing under makeup on a daily basis. Plus, I like the 50+ SPF value. It is outstanding and going forward will be the only sunscreen I buy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.. Works great.. Will order more..</li>
            <li> I like this product because you can work it into the skin and it doesn&#x27;t stay white and sit on top (like some sunscreens). My 1 year old sits on my hubby&#x27;s lap and I first put it on his face, then each arm, then each leg. The fact that I have the time to be able to rub it in all the way (babies aren&#x27;t exactly the most patient people in the world when it comes to sitting still) is good. If I had to rub it forever to absorb, I would get annoyed. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad or appear to affect clothes it touches. Also, the little guy spent some time in the sun and even in water - I haven&#x27;t noticed any burning anywhere! So I think it works. If I see any peeling or redness later, I&#x27;ll update my review. So far so good. :)</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS PERFECTLY!</li>
            <li> Has a strong citrus type of scent, I&#x27;d like it better if it wasn&#x27;t so strong. Product is a little thick, you have to use kind of a lot to spread evenly anywhere on your body. Looks as in the picture shown, decent size and I like that it has a high SPF of 50+ BTW I use this for myself and I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s. Used it in Vegas while it was really hot and it worked pretty well. I must say I don&#x27;t burn easily under the sun I just want protection from age spots.</li>
            <li> Got this for my kids.  Easy to apply.  Works very well.  And it is safe for kids.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 different kinds of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunscreens &amp; I liked this one the best. It isn&#x27;t heavy doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on your skin. I have used it on my face as well &amp; will probably use only this all summer. I ordered 2 more tubes after the 1st one!</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s light and not greasy and with slight coconut smell.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t gotten any burns while wearing this, so I guess it does the job. I picked this one because it had the best rating the EWG&#x27;s sunscreen safety guide. On top of working well and being safer, it has a pleasant, subtle citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen for my grandson. He has sensitive skin and we are very pleased with this thinkbaby brand</li>
            <li> This sunscreens works well and goes on smooth.  It also smells good. I tried it after EWG recommended it several years ago and it&#x27;s  all I use now.</li>
            <li> At any price this is the finest sunscreen product available today. The bonus is that for a sunscreen this is actually very reasonably priced. There is no &amp;#34;ghost face/geisha face&amp;#34; with this product at all and I&#x27;m light skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry flaky skin, cuticles I would recommend first moisturizing with CeraVe moisturizing Lotion (not Cream, but rather Lotion, there are two different products) and once the CeraVe lotion &amp;#34;sinks in&amp;#34; then apply this product, otherwise, the zinc oxide will &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; the dry cuticles/dry flakes on your fingers/hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have any prominently chapped lips when applying this product there will be no &amp;#34;ghosting/clown face&amp;#34; effect as there are with so many other zinc oxide sunscreens on the market by other brands (Neutrogena, looking at you right now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is that this sunscreens contains plant derived emollient/moisturizers and antioxidants so it does double duty as a moisture cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly, the most indispensable tool in your cosmetic kit is sunscreen as sun exposure is the number one cause of &amp;#34;skin unhappiness&amp;#34; in both men and women as well as the leading factor in skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to look your best, as far as stuff you can apply to your skin, sunscreen is the primary tool in your toolkit. This is the best sunscreen on the market and it is also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> this is a great sunscreen with a lemon scent.  The reason i bought this particular one is because it&#x27;s all-natural.  my only complaint (and it&#x27;s a minor one) is that It&#x27;s a little smaller than i expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again though - in fact, it&#x27;s in my subscribe-and-save cart</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Despite being very white at first, it absorbs very fast and has no odor. Ten days by the sea and no sun issues!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my extremely sensitive skinned 3 year old daughter. All other sunscreens we have tried cause her to break out in hives or a rash. She had no problems with this but myself and my 6 year old son both felt like our skin was burning right after we put it on our faces. My son also developed very dry patches on his skin after using this. Neither my son or I are sensitive to other sunscreens so I found it strange that we had that reaction but my very sensitive daughter was fine with it.</li>
            <li> My family and I love this product. It&#x27;s a physical sunblock, which means it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear when applied, but I find it to be less noticeable than many of the others. It&#x27;s well-rated by the EWG as far as safety and ingredients, and it has protected well and held up with sweat for our purposes.</li>
            <li> Previously I was using a different sunscreen brand that changed formulas adding harsher chemicals. This forced me to seek an alternative sunscreen. So I found Thinkbaby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the citrus smell. I have applied this sunscreen to my child on 3 occasions and all three times it worked beautifully. I love the fact that the ingredients are more natural and less toxic.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the opportunity to use this is 90 plus degree weather. If I find a different outcome I will post again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for now it gets 5 stars</li>
            <li> Smells great and somehow it&#x27;s not impossible to rub in. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product rubs in well with minimal white residue left on my child. I used the Honest Company sunscreen previously and find Thinkbaby rubs in much better and is less greasy. Actually, I would go as far as to say the Thinkbaby sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy after absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It spreads easier than the HC sunscreen, but not as well as, say, Coppertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my toddler&#x27;s face and it didn&#x27;t run in his eye (after sweating).</li>
            <li> Not my favorite natural sunscreen.  It goes on good, but runs down your body once you get wet. Would be fine for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; outdoor activities, but doesn&#x27;t work for us as our sunscreen for the pool.  Once my kids got wet, it got all milky looking and started running down their bodies.</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen but does not last for more than a few months. Mine turned into whitish water in a couple of months though I still have time for the expiration date. So you will end up buying more than what you need.</li>
            <li> It tends to be a little thin to feel like it will do well, but so far no one has been sunburned, so it must work. We tend to use this for faces and I am happy that the chemicals are specifically chosen for safety.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was rated as #1 safest for babies. It&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gone out in the sun much to use this a lot yet but I bought it for my 6 month old. I haven&#x27;t had any issues getting it rubbed in, leaving residue or feeling gross. Haven&#x27;t burned so far either.  I&#x27;d use this myself too.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! My very pale baby hasn&#x27;t gotten even remotely burned all summer. I wanted a natural sunscreen that I felt comfortable with him wearing fairly regularly, and this fit the bill. It doesn&#x27;t go on too thick or white either, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen slightly irritates my super sensitive skin (ezcema and acne on my face), but for the most part it is much less irritating than the majority of sunscreens.  My two main complaints is that the sunscreen will separate into solids and liquid, and I am not a huge fan of the smell. It requires a bit of shaking to properly use if the bottle has been lying around for a while. The consistency is nice after it is shaken and mixed properly, it is not too thick and applies to skin easily. Other reviews say the smell is pleasant, so it is up to personal preference, but I think it smells chemically and I also simply prefer no smell.  Aside from those issues it is a decent sunscreen for sensitive skin. 3.5 out of 5 stars</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old and so far has kept him from getting burned.  It does take a little bit to rub in and will live a slight white residue, but that is to be expected with a less chemical product.</li>
            <li> Well, this is one of the best sunscreens voted by EWG, something I am very mindful of. The smell is slight and non offensive, a bit coconut-ish. What I don&#x27;t like is the chalky texture it left on my skin. After rubbing it in for a good bit, I could see it settling into the pattern of my skin like pavement cracks. I found myself trying to blend this in a bit more whenever I looked at my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this sunscreen based on the rating alone. But I just wish it was easier to blend and a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the safest sunscreens for babies. I like how easy it is to apply- it isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on easier than most zinc based products, protects well.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen. Arrived quickly, great price.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and spreads easily. And it makes skin soft and smooth, while reversing the signs of sun damage.</li>
            <li> Kept baby safe in July sun</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells great.  Goes on pretty easy. Unless you have hair, which kind of makes it more difficult and leaves that Casper look behind.  Seems to last awhile even while going in the water.  The ocean anyways.  It does goes quickly though. That&#x27;s my only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  At 12 something a tube that&#x27;s not exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> Kids got really dark and burn when using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It gets white as it is made of minerals and not chemicals.  But it smooths out easily (unlike Babyganics - I had hard time smoothing it out!).  The texture is creamy (not hard, not runny).  It has sweet scent like vanilla.  I don&#x27;t mind it all but I think it&#x27;s little strong for baby.  I like using this for my toddler daughter&#x27;s body.  I hope they make stick type (for face).</li>
            <li> Goes on hazy-white but clears over time which I find very useful when slathering down our toddler.  Works great as evidenced by the March sun in Florida (for us who never see sun!)... we missed a spot during application and it burned pretty red, but anywhere that was covered was no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Found this on the EWG database, and have been very happy with it.  Goes on transparent, unlike most of the other non-chemical sunscreens.  It even smells nice, kind of like pineapple.  Perfect for a daily sunscreen for my son!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for my baby. She&#x27;s got very fair skin and we live in the south, and she&#x27;s never gotten burned while wearing this. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to run in her eyes. It goes on smooth too.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this all summer on our (now) 6 month old daughter. We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time at the beach and the park. Her porcelain skin has never shown any signs of being in the sun at all! It&#x27;s a small tube however a little bit goes a long way. A little on the pricey side but I&#x27;d rather pay a little extra for great skin protection especially to not have a cranky sun burned baby!</li>
            <li> great protection, but very white and thick.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best sunscreen out there.  Safe, works wonderfully, and safe to use on my sweet little girl.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying I have never in my entire life used an entire bottle of sunscreen before its expiration date.  It&#x27;s not so much that I don&#x27;t put on enough sunscreen, but I&#x27;ve never found one that I liked enough to use the entire bottle.  I love this sunscreen.  It&#x27;s thick enough so that you can see where you&#x27;re applying but it also rubs into the skin without leaving a white chalky residue.  It&#x27;s creamy but not gloppy.  And after a few trips to the beach and zoo and other outings in the sun, we managed to use an entire tube of this sunblock.  Verdict?  She&#x27;s tan in some places (arms, legs) where I wasn&#x27;t as diligent about reapplying, but her face is still pristine white.  That&#x27;s about as good of a review as I can give.    I also love that it&#x27;s from thinkbaby and that it&#x27;s non toxic and SPF 50.  I would recommend this sunscreen in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen ever! I&#x27;ve tried other physical sunscreen and they&#x27;re okay. They work well, and they&#x27;re so much better for my sensitive skin than chemical sunscreens, but usually they smell like clay, they&#x27;re a huge pain in the butt to rub into your skin, and they usually end up being even greasier than chemical sunscreens once you do blend them in. Not this sunscreen! First, it smells wonderful. It has a very bright citrus-y scent, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. But on top of that, it was so easy to smooth onto my skin! Thicker than a chemical sunscreen, but I didn&#x27;t have to fight it. And it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy once it settled in. Nice moisture for my dry skin. I think I need to buy about eight more tubes!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  Safe for baby&#x27;s and sensitive skin (I use it on my face) and it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> I work outdoors all day most days and I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens in an effort to find one that is low in terms of health risks/chemicals added, while also being effective and non-oily.  This is it!!  I knew the first time I tried it!  It will turn you white - but if you rub it in well (easily and quickly accomplished) and don&#x27;t use an excessive quantity (doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way), the white really isn&#x27;t noticeable.  Great consistency - not liquid and not overly thick like some.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my sensitive face yet, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as shiny as so many others I&#x27;ve used before.  The best part - it&#x27;s highly rated on the EWG website, and isn&#x27;t shiny/oily/sticky (ie you can go outside and do yard work and you come back inside with grass bits and dirt stuck to you).  Might be designed for babies, but great for adults too!  Also - NO overwhelming smell!</li>
            <li> My child has sensitive, very fair skin, and this product really protects. WIth the high environmental-friendly code and pleasant smell, I have recommended this to all of my friends. Be aware that the skin will still get some sun, so don&#x27;t expect that you will not tan at all. But, reapplied regularly, you&#x27;re protected as well as can be without clothing. A little pricey, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different safe sunscreens and was really unhappy with how clumpy they were.  This stuff is perfect.  It is thick, so it takes a bit of rubbing to go on, but I figure that&#x27;s worth.  It doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, and despite being thick isn&#x27;t difficult to spread.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave much sticky residue, and there are not clumpy white bits.  My girls and I put the ThinkBaby on our faces and necks every morning/</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couole of months now and my 6 month old has not burned once! I like feeling assured that this is a nontoxic product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!! Smells good, not all the bad junk, and no sunburn.  What more could you want?</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well! I&#x27;m impressed. have tried many natural sunscreens and either they have been too thick to spread or didn&#x27;t work at all. This is easy to apply and smells nice. My toddlers have never got burned with it on and they play in a very hot climate everyday. It must be said that my kiddos are not fair skinned and tan very easily. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I never thought I would find a sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t laden with chemicals that I could actually rub into my toddler&#x27;s skin.  All the other ones I tried or read about (BabyGanics, Babo, Badger, etc.) were so difficult to rub in and they would dry before I finish putting it on her.  On numerous occasions, we went to the grocery store with white splotches all over her face.  This one actually rubs in very easily and works really well!  We spent 4 hours in the hot sun at the fair and she didn&#x27;t even get the slightest bit of red.</li>
            <li> Upon lots of research and recommendation from Lucie&#x27;s list, we settled on this one. Used them for our 10 month girls and loved it. A very light and pleasant scent. Extremely easy and smooth to apply. One of our girls has sensitive skin but had no problem with this sunscreen, even on the face! :)</li>
            <li> Smells good &amp; seems to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> THis sunscreen is thick and takes a little work to rub in, but I love that it is a higher SPF than most other baby sunscreens.  Smells nice.  Babies are small so you don&#x27;t use a lot when you apply, but the tube is kind of small for every day use.</li>
            <li> Got this for my kids for swim camp.  It has a good safety rating from EWG.  The only thing is that it&#x27;s a small bottle and pricy.  I prefer Blue Lizzard Baby.</li>
            <li> Yes the sunscreen works, but I hate the smell and cakey consistency. It&#x27;s pretty unpleasant to put on my 16 month old. I think I&#x27;ll be trying a different brand once I am finished with this bottle.</li>
            <li> Finally a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t give my kid a rash. Blends in nicely and washes off great.  No smell either.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it is safe to use on my kids. Product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that I trust to put on my children. I love knowing that it is not full of chemicals. After all your skin is the largest organ, that means it soaks up whatever you put on your skin.</li>
            <li> A great product for your baby or young child in sunscreen protection.  Even in the brightest sunshine, this product protects against any HARMFUL rays of the sun.  Bear in mind that sunlight is necessary for our bodies to absorb enough Vitamin D.  Nevertheless, some tender children&#x27;s skins need to be protected from too much sunlight.  This product does this naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few natural sunscreens and hadn&#x27;t found one that I liked. I really like this one though. It rubs in the best of all the kinds I&#x27;ve tried. Barely any white residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my baby! Smells wonderful and goes on thick, so I feel like she is well protected. I use this for daily use but also used it every day on a trip to Hawaii, where we spent a lot of time in the sun. I tried to keep my baby shaded as much as possible; however, that was difficult with the hikes and time at the beach and pool. She never got even the slightest shade of pink! Also, she has very sensitive skin and it seems like everything causes her to break out in a rash but we never had that problem with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I got this at Whole Foods and had to get it when I saw it on Amazon, I love this scent and it goes on smoothly on both my kids.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s non toxic, but you look like a ghost when you put this on your face.  The kids thought it was very funny, but you obviously you don&#x27;t want to use this if you need to look presentable.  For casual wear at the beach or pool it is fine.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen! I bought it for my kids to use, mainly for their face and hands so it wouldn&#x27;t burn their eyes. We used it for the first time last weekend at the beach. I have a very fair skinned little girl and she got no sun at all, and we were out in the sun all day Saturday, and most of the day Sunday and Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things we love:&lt;br /&gt;1. It works! No sunburn, or any redness at all for that matter, and (shame on me, I know), we didn&#x27;t even re apply!&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells good. Not the biggest deal, but a nice bonus&lt;br /&gt;3. No harmful nasty chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t burn eyes&lt;br /&gt;5. Nice texture, not too thick, not too runny.&lt;br /&gt;6. Doesn&#x27;t stay white once you rub it in like some other natural sun screens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it is a bit pricy, but look out for a deal and stock up! It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 mo old son. We&#x27;ll be going on a beach vacation and wanted try out a baby safe sunscreen. This sunscreen goes on smoothly. At first, the product will leave a white sheen to the skin but it goes away after 15-20mins.  It does have a typical sunscreen scent which I wish it didn&#x27;t thus one star off he rating. My son did not break out and have not shown any signs of allergy to the product which is great. Overall, a decent product to try.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, gentle for children</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  My husband and I use it on ourselves, too.  It rubs in much more easily than most Zinc based screens and we never get burned.</li>
            <li> Very good one, we were looking for a similar one</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was recommended by a blogger who was writing about a cure for Melasma (dark spots on the face) which I also have. It seems that every summer these spots get worse and worse. She specifically recommended this as her favorite brand of sunscreen to wear daily on the face, because it contains SAFE ingredients and is without carcinogens.  If you&#x27;ve read the recent research about sunscreen, popular brands can actually cause cancer once the chemicals interact with sunlight and seep into your skin. Very concerning! I&#x27;ve used this on my face daily for about two months now. A small amount goes a long way. I put my makeup (either liquid or pressed powder foundation) right over the sunscreen and it does not feel oily or anything. It feels great and I think it has done a great job of preventing my melasma from darkening over the summer months.</li>
            <li> The thinkbaby sunscreens are my favorite natural sunscreens.  For me, they spread much easier than other similar products.  I find that if you put coconut oil on first, let soak in, then apply sunscreen the application is even easier.  Very pleasant, light scent.  It will make you slightly white, but it is what it is.  All natural, no chemical sunscreens are going to do that.  That is how they work.  If you don&#x27;t want to have any white color you will need to stick with a standard chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product does the job, but it&#x27;s thick and not clear.</li>
            <li> Goes on nearly clear(I feel like my body warmth helps it to completely disappear), has a pleasant scent, and has protected my face, tattoo colors and decolletage VERY well.  :)  A little spreads very easily.  Does not feel oily, or chalky, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially interested because of online reviews, and looked up the EWG&#x27;s rating of &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; for this product, which means it&#x27;s rated as low hazard and high efficacy. http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/567747/thinkbaby_sunscreen%2C_SPF_50%2B/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO glad to have found this. It&#x27;s my favorite sunscreen of all time.</li>
            <li> From all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve used (probably 6-8) that are ranked low on the ewg website, this is by far my favorite. My fair skinned kids used it all summer and didn&#x27;t burn, not once. It goes on very smooth and fairly clear compared to the others I&#x27;ve tried that take some serious work in order to get all the way rubbed in.  Will continue to buy again and again....it&#x27;s one of those products that I will be so lost if it gets discontinued or amazon stops carrying it.</li>
            <li> love the smell. my daughter said it dont burn her face, and of all the sunscreen she had, this one is the one that she love. would give 5 star if it didnt make my face oilier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other baby sunscreens and they can be quite sticky and hard to apply. This one goes on relatively well</li>
            <li> Love the sunscreen but do not buy online. The tubes that were sent were complete liquid. Sent back without even opening!</li>
            <li> I used my husband&#x27;s account to purchase 3 Think baby Sunscreen.the expiration is stamped for August 2016.&lt;br /&gt;All of the tubes have disintegrated into a watery mess.I can only assume that Lot #4H32 expiration 08/16 is a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to  Thinksport Livestrong Sunscreen SPF 50+.</li>
            <li> I used the Honest Company sunscreen last year, but tried this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase, this sunscreen rubs in so much easier than Honest and is way less greasy. It almost feels like a non-natural sunscreen. It still leaves a bit more of a white residue than say Coppertone, but not nearly as noticeable as some other natural brands. My 2 year old is very fair and wore this all summer without getting a sunburn! The only drawback is the price, but a little goes a long way! I will be buying this again next year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply as it spreads well and absorbs quickly, no white residue either.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler, and I like it WAY better than the Badger Baby sunscreen, which is VERY difficult to spread and doesn&#x27;t sink in due to its paste-like consistency.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock for my toddler! I even used it when he was 3 months old and he had no bad reaction to it. I love the scent too. Taking 1 star off as it doesn&#x27;t spread clear so he looks like he has white patches on his face. Not a bad thing per say unless you are going to an outdoor wedding or something like that. Be sure you apply 20 min before sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to bother his eyes. And helps style his front bangs. :) can work like a gel and keep my baby&#x27;s bangs out of his eyes which is a bonus ;)</li>
            <li> I did not like this sunscreen. When I squeezed it the first thing that came out was water .  It smelled awful. I am not sure if it was a bad batch but there was no way I could use it. I will never purchase this sunscreen again.</li>
            <li> Great product and it was good on baby&#x27;s skin. He&#x27;s been using it when he goes out for swims and it applies well. Works as barrier between the sun and his supple skin.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again!</li>
            <li> One of the best safer less chemical-filled sunscreens I have used!  Goes on smoothly, no chalky residue, smells nice &amp; works really well - no one has been sunburned!  Everyone uses it in our family (infant, toddler &amp; adults).</li>
            <li> Love the smell! No problems and I will order again next year</li>
            <li> Works great on newborn!</li>
            <li> I used this all summer long and it worked great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> No issues, smells great and no burns... not that we hangout in the sun. Feels good knowing that we&#x27;re using a safe product!</li>
            <li> I put this the first time on my baby and a couple of hours later she had a rash on her arms; I tried a second time just to make sure it wasnt something else but again she got a rash on her arms. It might be okay for other babies but this bottle I will probably have to use it myself</li>
            <li> Good ratings in EWG database. Not too thick like other sunblocks. Easier to apply and blend.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve come to the point that I could be 100% confident to say that I know this product very well by now. I am a father of 5 year-old and 3 year-old boys and I&#x27;ve used it for them for more than a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t feel thick. It feels cool and leaves shiny, thin layer of the sunscreen on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. EWG Rating of 1, which is really good because this product doesn&#x27;t use harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;3. Very water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... that&#x27;s all about it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE and the price is not stable. The prices range between 8 to 17 USD per 3 ounces bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2. TOO OILY. That shiny, thin layer doesn&#x27;t go away no matter what. It will make your face shine for a good number of hours. Not only that this doesn&#x27;t fade away easily due to its strong water resistance.&lt;br /&gt;3. TOO PAINFUL to eyes. I have to take extra care to apply it to my sons&#x27; faces. This gets very tricky especially if you have active boys like me. Even more than 8 hours of applying it, it hurts my eyes so bad when I take shower.&lt;br /&gt;4. DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM GETTING SUN BURN and/or TAN. No matter how many times and how much you apply, you will end up with nice brown tan. Even applying generous amount of this sunscreen with frequent application, it did not help me or my children avoid getting tan or sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not so much considerate of getting 100% SUNSCREEN, which in fact it is made for initially, and you&#x27;re more concerned about environment and your/your baby&#x27;s health, get this. BUT be careful not to get this into your loved one&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get maximum sun-blocking feature as well as environmentally and dermatologically safe product that does not hurt you or your baby&#x27;s eyes, please look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am researching again and found Adorable Baby product more appealing. Please suggest me if you found anything better. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of non-chemical sunblock for my toddler (the first was Badger Baby). I like this product so much better and will continue to order this one. The smell is pleasant, it spreads easily, and there is only a minimal amount of white residue. I will even switch to this product for myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reviewing a lot of sunscreens for my 6 month old and now she and I use this exclusively. It rubs in really quickly compared to other non-nano sunscreens (like honest company) and smells really nice unlike some others (honest company). Neither of us have had any burns, I don&#x27;t feel like it washes off very easily in the bath/shower so you do have to sort of work at it, but that being said, it holds up well in the pool.</li>
            <li> Works well, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands of sunscreen for my toddler, and I think this is my favorite so far.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it rubs in fairly well compared to other brands...although it still takes a little work to rub it in on his face well.</li>
            <li> This is the best non-toxic sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to find. It smells great, rubs in well (it can still be a little white, but nothing like some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried), and it gets a 1 on the Skin Deep website. We love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It in initially goes on thick but rubs in well and you can tell it has a healthy coat on the skin to prevent a burn on my little one! It smells fabulous like tangerines. I highly recommend this one and the sport variety!</li>
            <li> After having two kids, I am suddenly allergic to pretty much all sunscreen, including those &#x27;gentle&#x27; ones for babies. I&#x27;ve tried a number of sunscreens available from the grocery and pharmacy, but broke out in hives with each within hours of applying. Given that I live in Florida, going without sunscreen isn&#x27;t an option. I tried this three times over the last two day, and no allergic reaction. It does leave a bit of a white hue on the skin, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as the Neutrogena or Coppertone Baby ones I&#x27;ve used on my kids. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. Great product-I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> Worked great. Gentle on baby</li>
            <li> Easily rubs in, which is always the battle with mineral sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything GREAT about this  sunscreen. I don&#x27;t use it daily, mostly when I&#x27;m out at the beach or hiking. The ingredients are great and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It&#x27;s smells wonderful and works great</li>
            <li> I like it so much. It looks white but if you use it correctly, you won&#x27;t notice it, not greasy at all. And my face is clear all day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately item was spilled all oveer the inside of the package when we received it. Sent it back for a refund</li>
            <li> it is in running liquid form like water! So it is hard to apply it without dripping some of the precious fluid on the ground or clothing. Should have the applicator head like that of glue or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not sure how effective it is. It appears to be not lasting very long during normal non-water sports usage - didn&#x27;t do a scientific testing but just feel like it</li>
            <li> Nice product.. Worked fine for my baby and its delicate on skin. When applied it&#x27;s very cakey but I guess all the sunscreens are like that</li>
            <li> Goes on with no white residue. Offers great sun protection. Safe for skin and babies!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it seems to work well.  Easy to rub in with wiggly little kids and not as sticky as a lot of mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Smells great, rubs in easily, not too thick.  Better than Babo, Babyganics, and Honest sunscreens!</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on easily, and doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it!</li>
            <li> best zinc baby sunscreen i have found.  it rubs in and smells good. score</li>
            <li> safe according to EWG.  it smells so good my little one, for the first time, stuck out her tongue and tried to lick the smell...it was pretty funny!</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens I have used for my child and I have tried many. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. Seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite sunscreen.  It is made with safe ingredients like 20% zinc oxide, Vitamin C and Vitamin E.  Some dermatologists say that vitamin c (in the form of ascorbic acid) and vitamin e in your sunscreen can help to prevent sun damage, and of course zinc oxide is much safer than chemical sunscreens.  What I like is that it goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t have to rub it in very hard for the white to disappear.  It also smells kind of refreshing.  I think some people think it&#x27;s kind of expensive, but since I only use it on my face, it is actually a lot cheaper than the Shiseido sunscreen that I usually buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking &amp;#34;yes! This will suit my grown-up sensitive acne-prone skin!&amp;#34;.  WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is basically like water, so as you can imagine it is EXTREMELY difficult to apply, and runs through your fingers wasting half of the bottle in the process.  I apply it to my face, and it stings like crazy.  AND when I decide to put up with all of that, thinking it&#x27;s just a loveable quirk, I end up getting sunburnt.  PLUS this stuff is too expensive.  Basically, it wasn&#x27;t worth my money and I regret ever buying it sadly.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years now and it works really well I like it because it absorbs niceKu and doesn&#x27;t show and yet protects well. I just ordered another one from Amazon today and hopefully this order will be as good as the other set I have purchased</li>
            <li> I am allergic to something in this sunscreen but I&#x27;m not saying that it is not right for others.</li>
            <li> but  unfortunately my son got a rash from it:-( Smells nice and spreads much better than most of the other ones we have tried.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this zero stars.  My baby kept getting burnt and I thought it was because we weren&#x27;t reapplying in a timely manner.  But it just simply doesn&#x27;t work.  Crappy product, learned the hard way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Thinkbaby now for a whie and I find it a wonderful product at a very affordable price. Who could as for more?</li>
            <li> Not messy, great sunscreen for my 5 month old baby and for myself!</li>
            <li> causes rash on my daughter&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Easy to spread and smells really nice. (i ended up using it too)</li>
            <li> Has a yummy, but not overpowering smell, kind of like oranges. Difficult to rub in, but that&#x27;s to be expected with zinc formulas.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this brand by someone who works at whole foods. I&#x27;m a triathlete and always looking for the right formula. Very happy with the performance of this product so far. It goes on white but after rubbing it in it virtually disappears.</li>
            <li> The best natural sunscreen my family has ever used.  Absorbs easily and protects very well.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s not chemically. I spend long periods in the California sun and it works well though I do re-apply often.  It&#x27;s a little greasy at first but fine once it absorbs a little.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t take too much to rub into my 2 year old&#x27;s skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky, greasy residue either.  I am now on my 3rd tube of it!</li>
            <li> Chose this one because of its EWG safety rating. The last two times I used this on my fair skinned 10 month old he burned. I applied liberally as instructed and at least a half hr before sun exposure (expiration date 1/17). He was only outside for 40 minutes and his poor little legs are so red. All this mom wants is a safe AND EFFECTIVE sunscreen and this one isn&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen lotion I have found that my daughter can tolerate without breaking out. She has light eczema and this works great.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and isn&#x27;t greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased thinkbaby for the first time.  I was looking for a larger tube and less expensive than the sunblock we currently use which is Mustela.  We found that thinkbaby does not work as well as the mustela.  With the mustela, my kids never get any hint of red, but with the thinkbaby they did.  They are fair, blue eyes and light hair.  They swim in our pool alot and we reapply ever two hours.  They wear rash guards, so we decided to stick with the mustela on their faces and hands, and use the thinkbaby on their legs.  It works well, just not as well as what we are used to.</li>
            <li> Got a good review on EWG. Tried it and really likely with no whitening face. Easy to apply with good smell. No reaction on the kids either. However, it seems to use up fast. Will need another one soon.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing sunscreen. I use it daily year round as a daily moisturizer. It is all natural, contains high concentration of zinc oxide and yet does not leave a white cast even though in does not use nano technology which I want to avoid.</li>
            <li> Have tried other sunscreens looking for a great one that is easy to spread, protects my son, and isn&#x27;t filled with bad ingredients.  This is by far my favorite so far.  It&#x27;s spreads easily and really protects from sunburn.  Tried another highly rated sunscreen that is also very popular with those looking for a healthier alternative to chemical filled sunscreens, but my son burned.  I was really surprised.  I can put this on him, let him go to camp including swimming for the day, and he&#x27;s protected.  Awesome sunscreen, look no further!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen out there for babies!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my dog, and for myself. She (my dog) has very thin ears and burns easily in the sun. So far no burning for me or her! The sunscreen also has a very pleasant sweet smell to it. After applying the sunscreen to my skin, it feels very light and like you have no sunscreen on at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen for my kids. I like everything about it (scent, texture, how it rubs in, etc.) except the price. I have 3 children and this would last me about a week in the AZ summer. I use this on their faces and went with Blue Lizard for the rest of their bodies -- it is a very nice sunscreen at a much more affordable price (and comparable hefty 8.75 ounce bottle).</li>
            <li> First, squeeze out 90% of the water from the tube. The sunscreen remaining will be easy to apply. From my experience, it looks great on and smells like 70% oranges mixed with 30% chocolate. I bought 2 multiple-pack tubes at once and took a risk. It turned out good. The size is small, like a tube of toothpaste, but I can tolerate it bc I can see one tube lasting at least 3 weeks, so that&#x27;s fine. It also makes the skin look 30% better, so that&#x27;s quality over there.</li>
            <li> good sunscreen and smells good too. my daughter used this on my 3 and 5 year old grandchildren at the beach and they did not blister but tanned well</li>
            <li> I bought this because my other sunscreen stained my shirts when I would wipe my face with my arm sleeves.  This does the job, however, will leave you with a bit of the &amp;#34;ghost face&amp;#34;, especially if you put too much on.</li>
            <li> My current favorite sunscreen for the face. I have melasma so I use this product every day and wear a hat (socal sun is brutal on melasma!) Even thought it&#x27;s non-nano, it&#x27;s not as white as other high zinc screens and is easy to disguise with a little powder/bronzer (I skip the powder most of the time unless I need to look put together). It doesn&#x27;t make me break out either. So glad I found this product! Works great and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite sunscreen. Smells great. Goes on smooth (not so thick and hard to spread on like CA Baby). High ratings on EWG. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works really well.  I recently vacationed to the Eastern Caribbean with my husband and 2 year old daughter.  We all have fair skin and usually will sunburn at the beginning of the season, even with sunscreen.  We were all pasty white because it is the middle of the winter where we are from.  Not one of us got burned being outside in the sun for over a week straight.  This sunscreen went on kind of thick and white, but quickly rubbed in.  It did not leave the bluish hue you sometimes get from sunscreens.  It also did not leave any of our skin feeling overly greasy or heavy. The smell of it is sweet and not too overpowering.  My only complaint is the price of the product. It works great, it is just very pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> We had good results with this sunblock in dry conditions but when we used it at the pool it came off completely in water. We only swam for a hour or two, we reapplied it during the day and we sat in the shade constantly unless we were in the water. We all got sun burned. It was like we had no sunblock on the moment we entered the water. The upside is that this sunblock doesn&#x27;t contain the toxic chemicals (Google it) contained in most sunblocks, however it didn&#x27;t protect us from sunburn like my old &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunblock. We went back to our regular Banana Boat Tear Free sunblock to protect us from sunburn, despite the chemicals. I can&#x27;t have sunburned kids or we all suffer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Burn Anyone :) So theres that.</li>
            <li> This is the same product as the ThinkSport sunscreen and I love both. As a marathoner, I have tested out dozens of different sunscreens with mixed feelings. The ThinkBaby and ThinkSport go on smoothly, rub in (admittedly with a little more work than sunscreens with microparticles) and in my opinion, smells great - not like most other sunscreens. For baby, it&#x27;s gentle and knowing that it&#x27;s just Zinc Oxide and no other weird chemicals that can get into baby&#x27;s bloodstream is a big relief especially for first-time moms. Cannot recommend this product enough to both adults and kids.</li>
            <li> I chose this sunscreen because of the good reviews and the ingredients list. It worked nicely for me and my family - spread well and protected from sunburn. I would recommend it and will buy it again when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Doesn&#x27;t rub in that great but these products rarely do</li>
            <li> Pretty good. easy to apply, no sun burns while using this. It stays on pretty well. Smells delicious :)&lt;br /&gt;One of the top rated baby sunscreens, so whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been poring over information and reviews about the most natural, non-toxic sunscreen available, without breaking the bank.  This looked like one of the best options as far as reviews and $ went.  I still wish more came in the bottle ;) however, here are the pros:  1. It has a nice smell, slightly citrus-y and maybe a hint of coconut, but light and nice.  2. It didn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy (highly annoying).  This means it&#x27;ll last a bit longer because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.  3. It did not cake on white (which I have experienced from other natural options - such as Mercola&#x27;s).  When you rub it in, it leaves you the same color as you started, and not sticky.  4. Though it isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy, it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin (like some other natural options have).  For the more sun intense work days I have (living in Africa) this should do nicely.  For everything else, I&#x27;ll be fine with good old coconut oil.  Thanks Livestrong for making a great product - I hope in time it can get a bit more affordable too!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens. I buy this one (and one other sunscreen) because it has good ratings on the EWG. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with looking &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;. But my husband who is of a darker brown skin tone does. However, if he rubs it in more while he is first applying it he can get good coverage and avoid the ashy look.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is about as chemical free as sunscreen comes.  My husband has always had problems with using sunscreen around his eyes, but this does not cause him any problems.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face real shiny.  It has a wonderful, mild citrus scent to it.  Since finding this, we haven&#x27;t used any other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> No sunburn here on our 4 week old baby and she did great this 4th of July. We put this on her even though she was not in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> It does go on pretty thick and leaves you white if you aren&#x27;t careful. It is a safer product than some nationally known brands, so I will live with it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> This protects my toddler well from the sun.  Goes on easy, rubs in clear.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or her skin chalky or oily.  This is my second season using it.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different sunscreens from EWG&#x27;s skin deep 1 rating, and this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve liked so far.  It&#x27;s strong enough that I don&#x27;t burn and rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t feel too gross after applying.  We use this for the baby, the kids, and ourselves!</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen for myself (I&#x27;m an adult) and really like the citrus smell.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t leave lots of white.  Love the thin packing-great for a purse.</li>
            <li> After plenty of research on the safest sunscreen for baby, this was my choice. We spent 10 days in Hawaii with our 8 month old baby and with this sunscreen he never got a tanline, no burns, it worked great. It&#x27;s easy to rub on, it is thick but I like that, you can see where you missed and it feels really good.</li>
            <li> As noticed by other reviewers on first using this sunscreen, I did notice a watery liquid coming out of the tube and was afraid I had ended up with a bad tube, however upon a thorough shake-down, we did manage to get creamy/ lotion-like sunscreen and have been using with consistent results ever since (for the last couple of weeks, multiple frequent uses). It seems to me an initial occurrence when the tube is opened and if this is frequent the company should note as such, as that would likely assuage customers&#x27; fears that they have received a bad product. Otherwise an excellent product-much easier to apply than other sunscreens I have used, accompanied by a mild sweet fragrance. Overall a good product, but company should address issues related to the watery stuff coming out of tube or note that this is a normal occurrence and not related to quality of the product nor the protection it provides.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens I have used for my kids.  One of them has sensitive skin and did not have any reaction to this.  It is not greasy though it does rub on kind of thick, does not leave significant white cast on fair skin.</li>
            <li> very easy to rub in. smells great. I was expecting more of a white residue but there isn&#x27;t much of one!</li>
            <li> The tube I received in Orange/Blue, not Orange/Yellow as Amazon picture. Purchased on August 2014, exp date was 07/16 (printed on top), Made in USA. Its texture blends in perfectly, didnt leave white cast or oily residue and very comfortable to wear. It has light citrus scent, but dont worry the scent isnt overpowering at all and gone in minutes. I like that this suncreen doesnt dry out  my skin yet still protects it well. About the ingredients, I&#x27;ve emailed the company for the difference between THINKSPORT &amp; THINKBABY. They responsed that both have the same ingredients, but one used currant and one used papaya just to mask Zinc oxide smell. The only cons for me is the price for just a little amount, and it does run out really fast !!</li>
            <li> It is pretty much a physical sunblock -- goes on white, and kinda keeps you ghostly! I got some &amp;#34;compliments&amp;#34; of how white I&#x27;m looking recently -- I&#x27;m Asian American so &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; is a compliment in Asia...</li>
            <li> Does the job, and I really appreciate the faint yet pleasant smell.  It reminds me of an orange creamsicle.  My son doesn&#x27;t complain, so I guess he&#x27;s a happy customer too!  I just wish they would come out with a continuous spray for us moms to use while swimming laps.</li>
            <li> Applies well and works great. I like the smell too.  Whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I really love this sunscreen. It has an EWG rating of 1, goes on nice and smooth, not too thick, and I really like the light orange smell (and I tend to be sensitive to smells).</li>
            <li> Not greasy or sticky and goes on smooth. Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my kids and it works. They still have that white look but the sunscreen is not heavy and thick like Badger&#x27;s. I am even able to use it on my hands and legs with no problem. It is still looks white but not as heavy and it does not feel unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen.  Used it daily on my 16 month old for 2 weeks at the beach.  She never got sunburn or even pink for that matter.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and it rubs in easily.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is no very good for a person who lives in South Florida...the humidity here is super high, it is summer time and this sunscreen is so GREASY!!! my skin type is dry I&#x27;m in my middle age, even like that this sunscreen is feeling so oily on my skin, the smell is soft and nice but the feeling of oily greasy sensation on my skin is very bad, sorry but I won&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend specially to a person with oily skin problem.</li>
            <li> This is the second year we&#x27;ve used this sun screen on my daughter. She&#x27;s outside everyday during the summer and she&#x27;s never gotten burned. I also love the smell, it&#x27;s like a creamsicle.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, works wonderful, healthy wonderful!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.  I bought this sunscreen for my daughter who was 9 months at the time.  We vacationed in the Keys for a week.  I used this on my daughter and myself the whole week.  Not only did we not get a sunburn but we didn&#x27;t even get a tan!  We&#x27;re both very fair skinned.  This sunscreen was perfect.  It didn&#x27;t cause any skin issues and kept her protected the entire trip.  The only thing tip is you have to shake the tube until it doesn&#x27;t sound like its full of liquid.  If you don&#x27;t use it for a while, you&#x27;ll need to shake it again as well.  But, this stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> Protects very well and slightly easier to wash off than regular thinksport sunblock.  My family has sensitive skin and develop rash after using other products, but Thinksport is one I found not to have any issues with their skin.  Bit pricier than big name brand sunblocks but I definitely worth the spending extra knowing it&#x27;s safer for you skin.</li>
            <li> We used this sunscreen on our 13 month old for a trip to Mexico and she didn&#x27;t get a single spot of pink.  It applies easily, rubs in well, and has a very slight and pleasant smell.  We reapplied constantly and went through a little over 1 tube for a week of use.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it is effective and I feel comfortable with putting it on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the separation of ingredients, when I opened the tube, there was clear watery liquid coming my out first and then white creamy lotion. This is expected for a more natural product where there are no bad chemicals. Good sun protection, no skin irritation, perfect for babies and expectant moms.</li>
            <li> liked it so much that I bought extras to give as gifts to my aunts and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that I don&#x27;t become all &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; after walking under the sun for an hr or so.&lt;br /&gt;other sunblocks I&#x27;ve used made me &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; pretty bad, especially my arms.&lt;br /&gt;I walk everyday for over an hr and haven&#x27;t gotten &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; yet, so I would say this thing works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sun! I have been tanning for years without sunscreen. Tanning without sunscreen can take a toll on your face, so be sure to use a sunscreen. The best that I have found is Thinkbaby Safe Sunscreen, it blocks the harmful rays of the sun – and it is goes on light and clean on your face. Also, make sure that you use a good moisturizer. I use this incredibly hydrating moisturizer [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]], it hydrates your skin and makes it soft and smooth, while reversing the signs of sun damage! Thank you, thank you, thank you for these great products! Please use your sunscreen to prevent sun damage!</li>
            <li> Works great--high 20% zinc oxide content unlike Honest Company&#x27;s horrible disaster. Pricey, but effective. I use this on myself and not a baby, but so far has been good. Scent smells like cake....pleasant and non-invasive. I recommend trying this or Tom&#x27;s of Maine depending on which is a better value at your time of shopping for sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this isn&#x27;t lotion texture. It smears around a bit before rubbing in because it&#x27;s a thicker compound. However, it does rub into the skin. Stays on in the water (chlorine pool) for me ~30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wore this swimming (applied 20 minutes before going outside) and after 2 hours in the pool I was burnt. I tried it a second day being careful to apply it thickly, under straps and made sure to rub it in well and waited 30 minutes before going outside. Again after 2 hours in the pool I was burnt. I was excited to find a sunscreen without the harmful chemicals in it, but no sun protection pretty much makes it useless.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  Goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Provides great sun protection and it smells great, too!</li>
            <li> We recently tried this sunscreen. I love that it has less chemicals. It does go on super white, but it has rubbed in fairly easily for us if we don&#x27;t use too much (toddlers help too.much sometimes ). My boys absolutely love the smell of it. That makes it so much easier to get them ready!! I also like that I don&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky. It is a bit of a process to wash it off in the shower,  but that is a minor issue. I can also verify that it works well. We accidentally missed a small section of my back in the mayhem of getting ready. That small spot burned badly, but all surrounding area wasn&#x27;t even pink!</li>
            <li> This was our sunscreen of choice this past summer. My children are ridiculously pale, and Badger Balm sunscreen failed us last summer. So, I switched to this think baby sunscreen. Zero burns. All summer. On super pale, freckled kids ranging from 8 years old to 1 year old. It is thick and takes a little time to apply. But we had zero sensitivity issues and zero burns. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> favorite kind of sunscreen to get. people ask me if im wearing foundation or make up. nope! the trick is sunscreen every day every time you go outside. ive tried tons of natural sunscreens and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> Very thick application.  Feel secure from sunrays with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for our twin granddaughters!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite baby sunscreen, easy to spread and seems to work.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. I use it for my children and have never had any burns. It also rubs in well for a zinc sunscreen.</li>
            <li> my baby&#x27;s eyes were irritated by wearing it on his face but did prevent sunburn</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. A light citrus-y smell. It blends in very well. I use this mainly on my daughter, I&#x27;m afraid to use it on my husband or me, just because of the price. Perfect for small kids though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for work, running errands, but sweats off in intense humidity and physical activity. I got pink on a 2-hour hike, applying before and during that hike, but never had any problems with it up until then. I like the scent and the fact I can wear it under make-up without smelling like the beach. While there&#x27;s a place for it in my life, I had hoped it would consolidate the various sunscreens I have around the house (Cotz, California Baby, Neutrogena Baby), and it just won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Good ratings for safety.  It&#x27;s thick and reasonably easy to apply, but it leaves the baby smelling like cake.  Maybe a little too much like cake.</li>
            <li> The best natural sunscreen for children that I have found. I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to scrub my hands after using it, it absorbed pretty well, and left my children without a sunburn. Just make sure to reapply when you&#x27;re supposed to and it should work just fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after much research and debate for our little guy and I love it.  I can&#x27;t wear sunscreen because I break our bad.  Putting it on someone else even makes me break out but not with this product.  I ended up purchasing 2 more tubes because I loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It rubs in really well. It smells nice. And it&#x27;s not bad for my kids. After trying all kinds of natural sunscreens this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST sunscreen I have ever used. It goes on easily, smells great and works wonderfully! I stock up on it each year!!!</li>
            <li> This is a quite good baby sunscreen and the most important thing it is safe to use. It&#x60;s is not like a body lotion so it is harder to apply but you can manage it without leaving the skin completely white. We were out for about an hour and there were tan lines on my baby but nothing close to sunburn. It smells a bit like lemon, I find it pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE SELLER:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers this cream with free shipping with a possible 1-2 weeks waiting time. I wanted to get it as soon as possible so I ordered from A2Z Emporium. They charged $5 for shipping, item was in stock. They said they shipped the item on the 23rd of the month estimated delivery was the 17th next month with no shipping number. I received the cream on the 9th and the real shipping date was the 4th on the package.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself $5 on shipping choose another seller!</li>
            <li> I am on a quest to try safe, non-chemical, physical, moisturizing sunscreen with good ingredients. I like this one because the white film disappears (although not all the way), is oil based and not water based, so it seals in moisture. It does not irritate the eyes. It smells good enough to eat! I wish it had more sun blocking capabilities, but maybe physical sunscreens will never perform as well as chemical ones. I use my freckles as determination. They will get darker if the sun is not blocked well.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best so far that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face with Hydresia SPF 40 - leaves a whitish film, just too noticeable. My friend said I looked like a Geisha&lt;br /&gt;Keys Solar RX Therapeutic Sunblock SPF 30 - very moisturizing, transparent, non-irritating to the eyes, but does not block the sun enough&lt;br /&gt;Devita Solar Body Block 30 w/Shea Butter 7 Ounces - not moisturizing, transparent, irritates eyes, does not block the sun enough&lt;br /&gt;DeVita Professional Skin Care - Ultra Solar 50 - not moisturizing, transparent, irritates eyes, does not block the sun enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. There is another seller on Amazon that sells this for cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Thinkbaby-Sunscreen-Benefiting-LIVESTRONG-Ounces/dp/B007U7QR26/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top</li>
            <li> So far it works quite well on my very fair skinned, bald 15 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> used it during our vacation to Florida. Our son did not get one red spot</li>
            <li> After trying many different sunscreens, we always go back to Think Baby. It&#x27;s safe, mineral based, and relatively non-greasy compared to other brands. My husband and I use it too every time we take our daughter to the park!</li>
            <li> In a constant frustration to find a good all around sunscreen, I am very impressed with thinkbaby brand.  I have the world&#x27;s most sensitive skin - it came out in a white cream which quickly absorbed into my skin.  No telltale white areas.  Although it has a light and pleasant fragrance, I did not have any allergy issues.  As I like to say to others - if I can wear and use it - anyone can.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen protection I had ever bought. It really protects your skin from the Sun&#x27;s rays. Wish they would sell it in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Thinkbaby for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I bought the Thinkbaby SPF50, the Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen and  Neutrogena Sunscreen Ultra Sheer Stick SPF 70 to compare.  I wanted something I could use on my face when outside that had a high SPF, but could also use on other parts of my body without smelling like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinkbaby SPF 50+ The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;It does not seem to clog my pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinkbaby SPF 50+ The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too thick and dries too quickly like the other one, so you need more&lt;br /&gt;It does not blend well with face cream or other lotions&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too expensive&lt;br /&gt;It could be a higher SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Stick SPF 70 The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very very light, so if that is what you are going after it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice scent that is neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br /&gt;It did not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;It has an SPF of 70.&lt;br /&gt;It will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Stick SPF The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too hard and does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; well because it is made like an underarm deodorant&lt;br /&gt;The cap is poorly designed and you have to make sure that you roll it back down into the applicator or the lid will not go on.&lt;br /&gt;It is too sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neotrogena Age Shield  SPF 110 The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an SPF 110&lt;br /&gt;You can see where you put it&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be effective&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;It blends well with face cream, which makes it go on better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neotrogena Age Shield  SPF 110 The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something for you face, it is very very thick&lt;br /&gt;It is very white and you have to really blend it&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly while you are blending it, so it doesn&#x27;t spread very far and you need more&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin shiny; but if you are wearing it under makeup and powder, you won&#x27;t notice.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clog my pores and break me out a little&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive for how much you get; it will not last long&lt;br /&gt;You really need to dilute it will a little face cream, but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to purchase any of these again.  I would get the Neutrogena SPF 110 and just dilute it a little with my face cream for my face and a little body lotion for other areas. But, I think I will keep looking.r /&gt;You really need to dilute it will a little face cream, but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to purchase any of these again.

            <li> Bought this sunscreen on the recommendation of a friend, I was not disappointed!!  I used this for the first time on my baby when we went to the beach.  It smells great and spreads really easily.  Most importantly, it protected my child from getting a sunburn and it didn&#x27;t break out his sensitive skin.  It gets a great EWG rating.  I will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Effective and easy to apply without leaving my face ghostly. Best for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight white residue, but it&#x27;s still one of better organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I know ThinkBaby is a good product and I have used it. But this time, the product is terribly bad. Not sure whether its a bad batch or something. The tubes were fully liquid. I didnt have to open it, just by shaking we could makeout that it has liquid in it. Amazon submitted Replacement for me thrice and all the three times I ended up getting tubes with Liquid.&lt;br /&gt;I called up Amazon and asked to Process my refund. Luckily they are good at it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this regard.</li>
            <li> Love thinkbaby sunscreen! Smells good, rubs in easily, effective.</li>
            <li> Spreads easily, no sunburns.</li>
            <li> Good protection but other mineral products blend on skin better.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a little thick to apply, like most natural ones.  It does work well and a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used many sunscreens throughout my life, being a swimmer. Thinkbaby was amazing. Not too oily or messy. Thick cream, perfect protection when it came to my little one. After 9 days in Hawaii, I am out unfortunately since it is a little on the pricier side but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> when I got this product the product inside got separated so it wasn&#x27;t a paste anymore it was a watery product with some white spots</li>
            <li> This was the first sunscreen that I purchased for my infant - I liked that it went on evenly and was easy to rub into her skin - didn&#x27;t leave too much of a white sheen on her. After this, I purchased green goddess and that was a nightmare to rub in - she looked like a ghost. I also tried California Baby - that also worked well, but was pricey. I would use this again!</li>
            <li> I understand all the great reviews- this product is great! It goes on easily, blends well, prevents burns and smells great. I use it myself and ony little guy! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Went on vacation to Key West when our baby was only 2.5 months old and this worked real well!</li>
            <li> Rubs in well. Low toxicity rating on EWG Skindeep Database. I use it on my face and all over my 6 month old baby.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! Safe for babies and smells great!</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby is a great safe sunscreen with a good scent. It goes on thick and provides good protection. I am happy I found it.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen; it offers great protection and has a nice scent. I would highly recommend this product?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Sat under an umbrella all day and went out in the sun for a short while and ended up with sunburn. My husband doesn&#x27;t like to waste products so he used it the next day and ended up with a burn too.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far, but like pretty much any product, there are trade-offs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Healthy ingredients (EWG rating &#x3D; 1)&lt;br /&gt;* Great UVA/UVB protection&lt;br /&gt;* Great sweat resistance (claims to be 80-minutes water resistant as well but I haven&#x27;t verified myself)&lt;br /&gt;* Not oily (may be a con depending on your skin type, but definitely a pro for me)&lt;br /&gt;* Possibly the cheapest in its class&lt;br /&gt;* Proceeds go to a good cause (despite a certain disgraced former spokesperson)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Could be easier to apply and wash off&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves behind a faint white film</li>
            <li> We bought this sunscreen after tons of research on the best product for an infant. We were told numerous times to keep our 5 month baby covered and in the shade for our trip to Hawaii, but we still needed a product for the top of his hands &amp; feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This went on white and rubbed in clear very easily. He did not burn while he was in his stroller for our daily walks. It was also pretty easy to wash off, we just wet a towel and rubbed him down before his bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was comfortable putting a minimal amount of this on him because after lots of research, it&#x27;s much more natural than the other sunscreens which was something I was concerned about since his hands &amp; feet are always in his mouth! My husband and I also put this on our hands since we didn&#x27;t want him munching on our fingers after we&#x27;d applied some chemically sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend! The best site for information was: SafeMama.com/cheatsheets - under sunscreen</li>
            <li> A 50+ sunscreen for less than the 30+ we used to purchase. I feel comfortable putting this on my child&#x27;s skin and appreciate that the company continues their mission of making safer products.</li>
            <li> Note:  This is a copy of my review for Thinksport sunscreen.  After receiving the product, we discovered that the ingredients and the products are the same.  Make sure you shop both to get the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to physical sunscreens a few years ago and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since. This is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very effective. I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.) since using this brand.&lt;br /&gt;-Good water resistance. This brand lasts as well, if not better, then the chemical brands I used to use that claimed to be waterproof. Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens. When rubbed in, I didn&#x27;t notice the white cast that is common with physical brands at all. To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy. This is a big problem I have with a lot of physical sunscreens. The texture of this stuff is very thick but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes, car, belongings, etc&lt;br /&gt;-Non-nano zinc. This may or may not mean something. Nano particles are much, much smaller than non-nano particles. There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body. There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed. (I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.) Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not good on dry skin. I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this. The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch. I mixed in a little moisturizer and that helped, but it still looked a little gross and scaly after application.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell. There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-Really burns eyes.  Make sure you wash hands carefully and thoroughly after application because this stuff really burns if it gets into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-The price. This is one of the more expensive physical sunscreen brands we&#x27;ve tried. It is worth it and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size. Also price Thinksport sunscreen before you buy. We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same. Now, we just buy whichever is cheaper at the time of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in, but still time consuming. As I stated, this brand is the easiest to rub in of all physical sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried but, still, don&#x27;t expect miracles. If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product. There is still room for improvement but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.patch.

            <li> this is has a high safety rating for sunscreens on EWG website. It is great for my toddlers. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, not greasy, rubs in well. works well. great for adults too, although the thinksport is the adult version which is cheaper, almost identical ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highest rating for safety on a completely unbiased website!  Has protected a snowwhite little angel baby from any sunburn, or harm!  Applies so very easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used sunscreen since I was a teenager.  Am now, am 64 and NO ONE has EVER guessed my age!!!  My other sunscreen products didn&#x27;t score anywhere near as highly in safety factors, as did this item, but I KNOW, for a FACT, that sunscreen works for aging &amp;, I believe, skin cancer!  I will be switching to this brand and product, for myself, also, for the unseen safety features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only wish price were a little less, but still VERY MUCH worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen! I&#x27;ve been trying out a few different mineral sunscreens and this one is my favorite so far. I use it on my fair skinned toddler who has sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin and it protects her well in the sun. It has a very light scent and smells good. It goes on a little white like most mineral sunscreens but it is very easy to rub in and it doesn&#x27;t leave her looking ghostly white. It makes her hair a little greasy since I use it on her face/ears but I don&#x27;t mind it because it&#x27;s such a great sunscreen with good ingredients! I tried The Honest Co mineral sunscreen and it was SUPER greasy and made her break out in a rash and it didn&#x27;t smell good at all! I returned The Honest Company sunscreen and will be sticking with Thinkbaby sunscreen from now on! Im glad I found a great chemical free sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is good for baby because has good, unharmful ingredients. Also sunscreen does not have any smell and leaves no residue.I will definitely  recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love how this sunscreen smells.  Tropical and summery.  It&#x27;s pretty thick but I know it&#x27;s safe and effective!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too sunscreen-y and goes on non-greasy. It actually goes on pretty dry and pulls on skin when you don&#x27;t use enough. Small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I would love if they had a 9oz with a equal or less price per oz.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome.  It smells like oranges (not chemicals) and is rated highly by EWG.  Well worth the (somewhat) high pricetag.  Not to mention that my one-year old occasionally (ie: always) has his hands in his mouth - and I can rest easy knowing that there isn&#x27;t toxic lotion all over him. :)</li>
            <li> Took this on my honeymoon, worked great. Isn&#x27;t quite as easy to apply as a standard sunscreen, but that isn&#x27;t to say it is bad. The benefits far outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s not super thick or greasy like other brands of chemical free sunscreen. It has a nice smell too. Will be buying this for my child from now on.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this sunscreen, but after applying a thick layer to my 2 year old&#x27;s body, he still got a burn. He was in the sun for about 40 minutes, and he&#x27;s definitely red. I have to try something else.</li>
            <li> best ever, no strong smell, not greasy, easy to spread</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or if the sunscreen got too hot during shipping but the two tubes I ordered smelled awful! I love this sunscreen when I buy it from a store; it has a lovely scent. The tubes I got from amazon smelled like plastic! I wasn&#x27;t about to put that on my. Myself or my kids so I returned both tubes.</li>
            <li> Great product, love that it is natural. Great in my 18 month olds sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. My toddler kept getting a red rash with other sunscreens. I believe titanium dioxide is the problem. This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have that ingredient and it has worked great for her!</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good sunscreen for the last few years...tried many expensive ones...never happy when I read the ingredients and the white streaks BUT THIS, I&#x27;m totally happy with it- goes on smoothly and if rubbed in well, there is no white residue. And the big bonus is that it has been reviewed by EWG and comes with a (1) rating...so yes I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> the sunscreen is thick so it makes me feel like it&#x27;s good quality, but it&#x27;s easy to rub in. You won&#x27;t see any white spots after a little rubbing.</li>
            <li> i have been looking for a mineral-based spf for years.  i have finally found it.  i have tried so many brands (costing sooooo many dollars since they&#x27;re basically thrown away when they fail) but this one has what i was looking for!  just zinc oxide - and non-nano sized!  and a healthy percentage of it at that (20%).  other ingredients are fairly well known to me - no endless list of dodgy chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is VERY creamy!  i feel like i&#x27;m getting a great moisturizer &amp; sun protection in one.  my skin is so soft after applying it &amp; stays that way the vast majority of the day, if not all day.  i am in my early 60s - which has shocked more than a few dermatologists when they initially meet me - which may account a tad for my skin loving the richness of this formulation.  it does NOT need a lot of rubbing to get rid of the white cream (aren&#x27;t ALL sunscreens white?)  non-existent aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no parabens, phthalates, bpa, petroleum or toxic chemicals.  and its 3 oz tube is tsa airport-approved sized.  you don&#x27;t use much at all - i can see this tube lasting almost a year.  2016 expiration date too - not &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; when you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i fell back into using neutrogena pure &amp; free baby when i couldn&#x27;t find a good natural sunscreen as it was zinc &amp; titanium dioxide based with no oxybenzone and no parabens BUT recently i noticed that the first listed ingredient was alumina, a form of aluminum, which i don&#x27;t want on my skin &amp; particularly my face for ongoing well-known dementia concerns.  and they market it for BABIES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t say enough about thinkbaby!  it is my forever sunscreen now.  FINALLY!  love it, love it, love it...  (btw - i am NOT associated in any way with this company &amp; a rarely do reviews on amazon - even though my ups driver is here constantly due to them - but when a product is this good, i take the time)</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are supposedly very safe, but there&#x27;s some ingredient that causes my eyes to water (I don&#x27;t apply it too close) and the smell is stronger than I expected for something supposedly unscented. It goes on much more smoothly than Badger brand, the one we used before, but Badger didn&#x27;t smell as strongly nor did it irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid of the sun. In fact I send my kids out in it without sunblock all the time. However I try to send them out before 10 or after 3. When they need to be in the sun for an extended period of time between those hours we do use sunblock so they don&#x27;t get burned. I always try to find sunblocks that are on the &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; more natural side. I received an unexpected box of sample products that included a couple bottles of this sunscreen so we have been using it during swim lessons. It works well. I use it on my face without any issues.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen is one of the best ones I have purchased for my kids and it is on the safe list. it goes on so easily and is not sticky or thick like a lot of the other safer ones. it smells nice too and the boys don&#x27;t mind getting it put on. i will order this again for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s baby sunscreen... It does its job and that all I need to say. There hasn&#x27;t been any issues.</li>
            <li> I love this suncscreen, one of the top rated on the ewg site for safety and it smells so good! It also applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you ghostly white.</li>
            <li> I found it a little more difficult to spread this out since it&#x27;s a lotion, and I&#x27;m used to using more runny/thin sunscreens. It did seem to work  though. It leaves a bit of a white cast, but it isn&#x27;t so bad that I&#x27;d avoid using it. The one thing that makes me not want to use it again is that it left big white marks all over my black bathing suit. I was very careful to avoid getting it on the suit during application, and I waited about 15 minutes before putting on my (long sleeved) cover-up. Once at the pool, however, it started getting on my suit. I had white marks all up and down the sides from where it was rubbing off of my arms. I also had it all around the neckline, and I had been so careful to avoid getting it there when applying. It was really noticeable while at the pool so I only used this one day before switching to another physical sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave marks. Happily it did wash out, but I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the bottle on my kids or while doing yard work.</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby sunscreen is one of the safest and effective sunscreens in the market for babies and anyone! :)  I bought 5 more tubes for my family.</li>
            <li> So far this sunscreen has served me well.  Of course if you put any sunscreen on and sit in the sun for hours, you will still burn (unless you have miracle skin).  I apply this liberally and go out for moderate amounts of time (often over an hour) to my garden in direct sun and it doesn&#x27;t let me burn.  I have tanned a bit but that is also to be expected since you can&#x27;t get 100% coverage really from any normal sunscreen, you will still get a few UV rays here and there but at least with this I&#x27;m seemingly well-protected and haven&#x27;t burned at all when I&#x27;ve been wearing it.  It smells great and it does not leave me feeling greasy.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to block pores on my face- no pimples so far!  It also doesn&#x27;t turn you completely white, just a very hint of white depending on the amount applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only *minor* complaint is that this can be difficult to take off, but that&#x27;s the same problem I&#x27;ve had with ALL natural sunscreens- it takes a little extra effort.  For this, I use a wash cloth and put cool water on it, then I rub down the areas I applied sunscreen to.. you can see the white sunscreen being removed if you use a colored wash cloth.  This can seem like a hassle, but honestly it&#x27;s the best way to get any natural sunscreen off you if you don&#x27;t want to be covered all day (I kind of have a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; for not feeling thick sunscreen/lotion/etc. on my skin- it bothers me when I don&#x27;t *need* to be wearing it, so I always take off sunscreen when I come inside so my skin can breathe!).  It&#x27;s really quick and easy to remove once you use a wash cloth.  :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, EWG pick, low toxicity.  Great feel and protection.  No breakouts on face, works great under makeup.  No reason to look further.</li>
            <li> Spreads easy, safe for baby and gives great sun protection. Wish it was available in more local stores but easy enough to order here.</li>
            <li> Best safe sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT!).  I sent one brand back because I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled, and put up with looking white from other brands, not knowing there was a better one out there. This one does not leave you white, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and smells GREAT (it is a citrus-ey scent).  From what I understand from the company website, the Thinkbaby, Thinksport Kids, Thinksport, and Thinksport Livestrong are all the same stuff, just different scents (check this out for yourself, though as I&#x27;m not 100%). I have tried them all. None of them smell bad, and the Thinksport and Thinksport Livestrong have very little scent at all, so my husband likes those.  My daughter has VERY sensitive skin and she didn&#x27;t have any reaction. There is an ingredient in some sunscreens that makes me break out on my face, but this one I can use every day and not break out, and it doesn&#x27;t make me look oily.  Fantastic product. Highly Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Use this with swimming kids...works fantastic, doesn&#x27;t burn eyes as bad as some do...at all. It dries nicely. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product Smells great, and it goes on smooth. There is no residue after applying unlike other zinc based sunscreans i have used</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Not greasy. Rubs in very well! I&#x27;ll continue to buy over and over. I recommend to anyone looking for a zinc based sunscreen. Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> This came as expected for our family vacation. The sunscreen seems fine, goes on a little thick but I&#x27;m glad I have something to protect my 10 month old. The one downside is the price for what you get. The bottle is really small, and only lasted one vacation. Definitely overpriced for sunscreen, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> just went on a cruise and bought a number of sunscreens prior to try out. this one is great, never got burned, rubs in quite well and is white at first then clear, slight film left on skin but its fine and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens and this one is the best yet in terms of safety, application, and effectiveness. There are many natural mineral sunscreens that pill (roll off). This one absorbs well and although it goes on white, it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a sheen. It has a good consistency, and a very light, natural scent. It&#x27;s also moisturizing without being greasy. I highly recommend this sunscreen for everyday use for adults and children. It is also not as toxic to marine life as the chemical sunscreens you see sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> This purchase was solely based on ewg.org ratings (the best website, you should put it in your favorites!).&lt;br /&gt;I used zinc oxide sunscreens before and this one is the best so far because I can spread it on my skin much easier. The other ones were VERY thick, and left a white layer on my skin. This one, however, is great. It does go on white but you can barely see it. It is much smoother and creamier. I put it on my face and body when I leave the house. I haven&#x27;t had any sunburns but I also haven&#x27;t been exposed to strong and direct sun lately even while living in Florida. I will update this review after a trip to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am highly satisfied with this product. And, it smells SO GOOD!!</li>
            <li> This sunblock is great. A little goes a long ways. It goes on white, but rubs in very well. I use this on my son&#x27;s face &amp; arms every morning before he goes to daycare. We get a lot of sun here &amp; they play outside a lot in the summer. It seems to protect him quite well. I reduce one star for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This is a little thick but I like that I can see where I&#x27;ve put it.  I also feel it blocks better &amp; more waterproof because of thickness.</li>
            <li> Bought this and returned when I found that it has vitamin E. A new study shows that vitamin E actually increases skin cancer when applied topically. Imagine putting that on your baby? Check out Environmental Working Group sunscreen review to see toxicty in most sunscreens. Too bad, otherwise this seemed like a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 1 &amp; 4 year olds. It got great ratings on EWG&#x27;s website so I decided to try it out after reading other reviews on Amazon. The product rubs in very nicely &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a thick white coating like so many other zinc based products. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I know that EWG says that anything over 30 is misleading but I feel like I&#x27;ve seen a difference between factor 30 &amp; factor 50 so I&#x27;ll keep buying higher factor sunscreen. I would give it 5 stars but I think it&#x27;s pretty expensive. I actually misplaced my first bottle of it &amp; was so frustrated that I had just spent $17 on sunscreen &amp; then lost it. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve never been so upset about losing sunscreen before! I still came back &amp; bought more though so I am happy with the product &amp; trust it.</li>
            <li> new formula ( with the blue banner) is poorly emulsified. therefore, it requires shaking if you don&#x27;t want pure water to come out. The old formula had an offensive, sweet smell that i didn&#x27;t like. This formula has a less offensive smell but it&#x27;s so poorly emulsified. It was the perfect sun screen (with exception of the smell). Now it&#x27;s just embarrassingly bad. i&#x27;m on the hunt for a new zinc sunblock.</li>
            <li> Very smooth as a moisturiser and does not make skin white after application. I use it along with baby and have referred to my friends about it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our most recent trip to Disney World for my 1 year old who is VERY fair skinned and has sensitive skin in addition.  We have used other sunscreens from Badger and other highly recommended brands and this is the best we have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly, which has been an issue with other sunscreens we have bought that are very &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; and do not spread well.  This works into the skin very evenly and as someone who hates the feel of any type of lotion on my skin, I was able to tolerate the feel of it very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say my daughter came home from our trip just as pale as when we left and it was due to this product performing JUST as advertised.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> A good price for baby sunscreen, not too thick, but still a little smeary and hard to apply to a baby that doesn&#x27;t like to be rubbed all over.  However, it&#x27;s still easier to apply than the Baby Neutrogena sunscreen, so I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers, I have researched on EGW website to find the least toxic sunscreens for my eczema baby. This purchase is my fourth or fifth one.  Compared to California Baby, Thinkbaby&#x27;s sunscreen is much more manageable. Whiteness goes away after few minutes. In regards to fragrance, I was worried because it would irritate eczema skin, and I have a sensitive nose.  But it did not bother my baby&#x27;s eczema or my nose. (I have also purchased Honest Company&#x27;s from Costco but I returned it after reading reviews about its oiliness on Amazon and Nordstrom websites.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good daily sunscreen, but your baby does get suntan in swimming pool.  I have been taking my two year old daughter to a swimming pool.  We only stay there for 30 minutes, but her suntan was noticeable after one swimming.  She did not get burned, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a bad batch before (see my question above), but I think it was due to the improper storage issues. I don&#x27;t think people should use those tubes full of liquid.  That separation of oil and other ingredients is a sign of &amp;#34;expiration&amp;#34; and defectiveness in all cosmetic products. In my two previous orders, I have received tubes full of liquid, but I kept returning them until I got the product in tact. I took the star out for an inadequate product management. I hope the company/seller will solve this issue soon.</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby&#x27;s sunscreen sets a very high quality standard in terms of safe ingredients. This goes on smoothly and rubs in so that it&#x27;s clear and non-staining. It also does a great job of protecting my toddler&#x27;s delicate skin (its most important role!). We&#x27;ve been outside at the beach, pool, etc. all summer, and he&#x27;s been 100% protected. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this sunscreen uses a strong artificial scent.  It&#x27;s almost like a creamsicle.  I find the smell to be very annoying when applying.  My 10 year old daughter won&#x27;t use it because of the scent. I like the price,  formulation and protection but the scent kills it for me.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was great.  It was easy to apply to my kids (some natural sunscreens can be runny--this one was not).  We made it through the MN summer with 2 tubes, and that is with application every single day as we live outside when it is nice out!  I love that I can give my kids protection from the sun knowing that I am not rubbing a bunch of chemicals on them.</li>
            <li> Does the trick, but I wish it was gentler on eyes. I love that this is safer than most sunblock, but some almost always ends up in my little one&#x27;s eyes from her sweating, or rubbing her eyes. It&#x27;s not as harsh as most sunblock and doesn&#x27;t sting from my experience, but it does irritate her eyes.</li>
            <li> 100% love this sunblock for my kids.  It doesn&#x27;t leave them looking like a ghost and the smell is very pleasant.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but feel safe to apply on my kids who have sensitive skin.  Although there are higher scored sunscreen in the EWG site, I purchase it based on the it being one of the best among SPF50+, and without coconut or cocoa oil (kids slightly allergic to).  Due to the Zinc oxide, you will expect the whitish paste, but overall very smooth and easy to apply and blend.  Thinkbaby, thinkkids and thinksport etc seem to have the same ingredient.  I choose this to use for myself because a lot more review for this one indicating more people buy this so batches may be fresher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching around for that best sun block that has no irritable ingredients and finally landed on this one. The irritable ingredients you should avoid are: Oxybenzone, Retinyl Palmitate, parabens, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, etc... My skin is more acne prone so I carefully pick out products that won&#x27;t irritate my skin. Thinkbaby sunscreen have nice citrus scent, it rubs on easily, made mineral base so that it won&#x27;t cause acne to flare up, it has non nano zinc oxide, and contains no other skin irritable or health hazardous ingredients/toxic chemicals. I use it every time I go out and it&#x27;s a good size I can fit in my bag. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Works great! Good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have just one word.....awesome. My little girl has sensitive skin but wears this regularly and it keeps her from burning . Good consistency and applies easily. I like to wear it too now too. Only downside is the price tag. Anyway, I hope they never change this or discontiue it as it&#x27;s an HG product</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well and doesn&#x27;t feel too thick like many other baby/kid sunscreens available.</li>
            <li> I have used the Honest Company Sunscreen previously for my little ones, and Thinkbaby is better because it has 20% zinc oxide. Honest Company reduced the amount of zinc oxide in their sunscreens from 20% to 9%.  I love this product because I have the piece of mind knowing that the hormone disruptors are not in this product, and it will protect my little ones from the damaging sun and is water proof!  It goes on smooth and rubs in easy, so they don&#x27;t have the white haze some other products leave behind on their skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice sunscreen! We use it for the whole family now. It is easy to spread, does not leave too much residue, does not smell and protects great. I feel weird using baby sunscreen on myself and my husband, but it is better than anything else I could find.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my face as an alternative to all the junk I have used in the past. Keeps my face sunburn free and my body chemical free.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this product, and i use it everyday under my make up...great for baby or adults. best part, does not burn my eyes like most i have tried.</li>
            <li> I thank my wife for finding this product.  She did a lot of research for safe sunscreen for our 6 month old daughter.  If you look into the chemicals on a lot of the major brands you will see how harmful some of those products can be.  This is the safest stuff we could find, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as &#x27;Burn Out&#x27; kids sunscreen BEFORE it changed formulas (it had to for FDA shelf stability compliance). This is WHITE and pasty and harder to spread. My kids looked like ghosts the whole vacation. Smells good, though. Not thrilled that I bought two of these...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a substitute when  Burn Out changed its formula.  Unfortunately, though I do find that it seems to work (if one reapplies after 2-3 hours), it is thick (not as thick as some of the other &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; formulas) and it really, really, dries out my skin.  There is no moisturizing element to this one at all.  Still looking for a replacement for Burn Out. :(</li>
            <li> Great product, fast prompt shipping. The sunblock spreads on very well. Other similar products leave a very white film, not this one though!</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff, the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without making my face break out.  It also acts as an excellent moisturizer and works well under makeup without looking greasy or cakey.  It&#x27;s now my go-to sunscreen for sure!</li>
            <li> Feels great after application. Not like some of other brands. I live in Vegas and this Sunscreen has helped me avoid getting sunburn and skin discomfort. It also doesn&#x27;t smell girly which I liked a lot. Anyways, a great little thing you need to carry around with you if you live in place like Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> What can i say, i finally found the natural sunscreen for our family. It smells really good, not like regular sunscreen. It is natural and a physical sunscreen with zinc oxide and does not rub in all the way. But it does rub in mostly and goes on very smoothly. It&#x27;s not too thick and does not get chunky. And of course it protects from the sun sufficiently. Even though it is only 3 oz, it is so worth it to spend a little more for this stuff.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research for sunscreen for my 4 year old this summer, and am happy with my decision to use this product. Goes on pretty easily without too much rubbing in. Definitely provides nice protection from the sun. Has a pleasant smell. Seems to last all day (not in a pool, just outdoor playing).  Would need to reapply if you swim. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The reviews all said this was a light sunscreen (both in scent and texture).  I have found it to be exact opposite.  It has a very strong coconut smell (that attracts every bug in a 5 mile radius to you), and it is a bit greasy.  It does have good ingredients and meet the criteria given to me by my dermatologist.  It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me even whiter than I already am.  Overall I don&#x27;t hate it and will finish off the bottle.  Probably wont buy it again though. Not a terrible price.</li>
            <li> I will never use another sunscreen on my daughter again- this is the best!</li>
            <li> This goes on a little white, and is a little oily, but overall it rubs in, works well and is rated very highly by [...] as being very safe and non-toxic. Thinkbaby and Thinksport are some of the few that are rated as having very few health or toxic concerns, that have an SPF of 50+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also very mild. I can&#x27;t quite pin down what it is, but it&#x27;s soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen gets the best rating from the Environmental Working Group ([...]) but is still easy to apply, unlike other products that receive the same rating.</li>
            <li> This and the Thinksport livestrong sunscreen are the best physical blockers on the market.  Smooth, not white, and smells great.  Best available.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I thought to use this on myself before ever trusting it on my 3 month old baby. On her first day of daycare (today) a friend wanted to keep me busy (I was a sad mommy) so off to the beach we went (since I started her a week before I have to go to work)! I applied this before leaving and the first thing I noticed was it does not spread nicely but instead soaks in rather quickly, so seems to take a lot of product to get your skin covered. We spent 2 hours at the beach and I am FRIED- very unevenly fried, too. Blotchy. I used MY normal SPF 15 lotion from another company on my face and the only thing that got slightly burnt was my nose (because I sweat there the most) and my ears (because I completely forgot to put ANYTHING on them). This is no good and I am grateful this didn&#x27;t happen to my sweet baby! I think child services would be called on me! Sheesh!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  We keep a steady supply coming in.  Great ingredients - so much safer than other products out there.  Most importantly, IT WORKS.  Just with a one-time application, swimming all day, this stuff still works.  I tend to reapply after about 4 hours in the pool for my super fair-skinned daughter, but for everybody else, once in the morning and we are good for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> Very greasy can not use on my face. It caused a rash and pimples on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is one of the top rated natural/organic type sunscreens (active ingredient: Zinc oxide).  Also, very cost-friendly compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Like oranges, not like your typical sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;SPF: 50! You really only need about 30. It doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference past that. For all sunscreens, the key is reapplication. (every 2 hours or so) Whatever the label might say, you need to reapply it every 2 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;Spread: It&#x27;s easy to spread and not have your baby look like a snowman/woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, ascorbic acid (vitamin c), capric caprylic triglycerides, cranberry seed oil, dimethicone, hyaluronic acid made from vegetables, hydrogenated castor oil, jojoba oil, magnesium sulfate (epsom salt), methyl abietate (pine wood resin), papaya olive oil, polyglercerol-10 laruate (vegetable glycerin), raspberry seed oil, sorbitan stearate (coconut based), sunflower oil, tocopherols (vitamin E), purified water</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this sunscreen for my 18month old daughter, but upon opening the tube and squeezing gently, watery liquid squirted out (as several other reviewers have experienced). Even after shaking and massaging the tube a bit, hoping to re-incorporate the ingredients, the liquid was still separated from the cream. When I closed the tube and shook it, it sounded like water gushing around - which I would not expect for an SPF 50 sunscreen. Hopefully it was just a bad batch - good luck to everyone trying it!</li>
            <li> We love this product!  It is safe and very effective!  I use it on my six month old baby and three year old.</li>
            <li> Smells like an orange dreamsicle!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t greasy and smells nice. My son doesn&#x27;t mind when I put this on him. He hates other sunscreens that I have bought.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, and assumed I would because of all of the great reviews. Unfortunately, it makes my face breakout when using and I find that I don&#x27;t reach for it very often. I&#x27;m not usually super sensitive to smells, but this sunscreen has a terrible cloying smell that I also just don&#x27;t like. I would, however, use it on my face anyway if it didn&#x27;t make my face breakout. It is fine to use on arms and other areas of the body for me, despite the smell. One nice thing about it is that it rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky white residue. It is a bit heavy feeling and doesn&#x27;t melt into your skin like some other sunscreens, but all in all as a body sunscreen, it isn&#x27;t terrible. I&#x27;m still looking, however, for something better.</li>
            <li> I first like this sunscreen. But then after a couple weeks the lotion inside starts to separate, and pale yellow liquid shoots out when I tried to squeeze some out for use. At first it was only a little liquid, maybe half a teaspoon. I can shake the tube to mix and it would not be so liquidy. But this morning there must be at least 2 tbsp of liquid squirting out!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and we really like it.  It has a light scent that I really like and is also very creamy.  Honestly, I like to see where I&#x27;ve already put sunscreen so I know the kids have full coverage and no missed spots and this provides that.  After a few minutes of putting it on, I can&#x27;t really feel it except on my hands.  I use it on myself too, especially my face.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! It&#x27;s safe and works great! We recently went on a vacation to Tybee Island, GA with a bunch of family. My girls were one of the few kids that didn&#x27;t get sunburned as we are at the beach every day for 5 days. This is the sunscreen that I used and it worked great. I also like that it registers as low in toxins on the EWG website.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t need to be reapplied so frequently. I use it in our backyard and that&#x27;s fine but not sure it would hold up at the beach.</li>
            <li> I researched online for sunscreen for my 1 year old, this brand was rated as being natural yet effective.  Although I cannot comment on it&#x27;s true effectiveness as when I used it my son was in a stroller with an spf shade on, I do like the smell and the consistency of this along with the price.  It is thick but not pasty.  Overall, I would repurchase tis again as I prefer to use natural products.</li>
            <li> Two mornings at the beach done with no burning!  I was trying to find a healthier sunscreen and several sources I read mentioned this brand as a good alternative.  I have very fair skin that burns easily, but after putting a thin layer of this on the first day (it&#x27;s pricey, so I was being cheap by putting on a thin layer...) my legs, arms, and back were still as pale as before and I had only the tiniest little bit of pink on my shoulders--if I had been less cheap I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even had that :D  To be fair, sunscreen was only part of my skin-saving routine, I went in the morning to avoid the harshest UV rays (9:30am) and was only out for two hours.  I&#x27;m not sure how this sunscreen would fair in all-day-at-the-beach sort of conditions (and I don&#x27;t plan to test it!).  However, for fair people who want to protect their skin and don&#x27;t plan to cook all day, this is PERFECT!  Plus it smells GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this too from amazon and just used it today.  Water came out when I squeezed some out.  Very disappointing.  I had purchased one before from a different online retailer and it was fine.  Amazon, please check your stock on this sunscreen.  I checked the expiration date and it is not expired yet.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, but causes me and my kids to have dry flaky skin after using it. The dryness persists for a few days even when we moisturize. Weird. It smells like orangey vanilla creamsicle though so its ok for us to use once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE : One Year Later - DONT USE THIS IF ITS BEEN SITTING AROUND FOR A WHILE. I bought this in 2014. It is currently 2015. My tube has an expiration date of 2016, so I thought I would be ok to use the rest of it up this year. Within a day of applying this to my son, he broke out in very itchy contact dermatitis. Something may happen to this stuff when it sits around for a while, even though the place I stored it was temperature controlled. Very weird, I&#x27;m throwing the rest of this tube out.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and ultimately bought for the ratings on Skin Deep.&lt;br /&gt;My 7 month old wore this all day out in the Florida sunshine and didn&#x27;t even think about turning pink!!! If you want a product that is safe and also effective, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> My 2-year-old son has developed some kind of allergic reaction to an ingredient in sunscreen. We tried a variety of sunscreens (Target brand, Coppertone Water Babies, Banana Boat Natural, etc.). I would apply in the morning, spend the day outside, and by dinnertime, he would begin to break out in a red, splotchy rash wherever it was applied. The rash was clearly itchy and only a couple doses of Benedryl would clear it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My niece had a similar problem at a young age, so my sister took her to an allergist. She was subjected to many tests, none conclusive. In the end, they told her to stay away from any sunscreen with PABA in it. That has worked for them. So, I tried the same tactic. He still developed the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His pediatrician didn&#x27;t have an immediate answer, and I hoped to avoid the testing. With a little bit of online research, I learned that it is very rare to have an allergy to zinc oxide. This is where I learned about physical suncreens. But when I began to look for one to buy, it seemed the reviews weren&#x27;t very good for many of them - they are thick and hard to apply without the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; coating left on skin, they are greasy, etc. And some can be incredibly expensive (who wants to pay $39.95 for a 3 oz tube??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on previous reviews, I decided to try Thinkbaby. We have been successfully using it for almost a month. My son has not had any type of reaction to it. I find it to be very easy to rub in, leaving no white behind, and no more greasy than any other sunscreen I have used. Plus, it smells great - fresh and citrus-like.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve found Thinkbaby to be the next best thing to the old formulation of Burn out, which was hands-down my favorite natural/safe sunblock. But they decided to change the formula for the worst. After reading extensive reviews on other sunblock baby products, and looking them up on the EWG database I went with Thinkbaby. It received a 1 on EWG. Well, I&#x27;m on my second tube of this stuff. It rubs into the skin pretty well, but not as good as the old formulation of Burn out did, doesn&#x27;t leave a pastie whiteness like other mineral sunblock, and I can use it on my face without getting pimples, which is huge for me. I&#x27;m considering trying some of the other Think sunblock. I just wish it came in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> After trying more than 10 &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens over the course of the summer, this is the only one that my sensitive-skinned 3-yr-old son can tolerate.  Bonus is that it rubs in completely, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Shipping was great and on time.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the product probably because it had so many good reviews.  It was pasty and felt heavy on my skin.  I had to really rub it in for the white film to go away.  It definitely wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.  Since it was a low cost compared to other similar products and I like the fact that the SPF is so high, I&#x27;m giving this a 3 as there&#x27;s value to it.</li>
            <li> Blends well, works but don&#x27;t forget to reapply!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  Spreads easily, little to no white residue, works WONDERFULLY well, lasts long, not overly expensive</li>
            <li> Great stuff, protects very well.  I like it better on my skin than my other favorite - Blue Lizard.  Protects just as well but not as thick.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin and no rashes so far.</li>
            <li> Smells great, spreads easily, and i didn&#x27;t even get tanned. The only con with this sunscreen is if you sweat you turn really white.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen, it is a little less chalky than some other sunscreens we&#x27;ve used, there is no fragrance and it works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick but I have peace of mind knowing that my kids are not putting toxins onto their skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I am a bit crazy about sunscreens that only contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as active ingredients.  This one goes on perfectly and is a lot cheaper than Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It goes on smoother than Badger and smells a lot nicer. This is my new go to!  Not a single burn this summer and a faint faint tan after about four hours a day at the pool. Some days I did not even reapply at the two hour mark.  The whole family uses it. Great product!</li>
            <li> Best sunblock.  I have tried numerous and this is the best quality.</li>
            <li> This works great for our little one. Rubs on and absorbs just fine leaving only a slight white cast. We spend hours in the sun every week as we live in Hawaii and little one has never burned. This will be my go to sunblock from now on.</li>
            <li> Works well, soaks in well. Do keep in mind that there&#x27;s a time limit on how long it&#x27;s effective. DON&#x27;T IGNORE the 90 minutes. Do re-apply, and you won&#x27;t burn. Don&#x27;t re-apply, and you&#x27;ll be cooked. Goes on white and pasty looking, but rubs right in and soaks in after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that this was one of the most highly rated baby sunscreens. We bought it because of the reviews, and it was simply awful. It protected well enough from the sun, but the amount of fragrance was insane. I would never again use such a highly perfumed product on my baby. When we put it on him, it of course ended up in his eyes because he is 6 months old. He would rub a part of his body then touch his face/eyes. He cried for an hour while we tried desperately to rinse his eyes out with saline.</li>
            <li> We love this! It smells so good! Found it through EWG Skin Deep when we were trying to find a safe, non toxic sunscreen for my baby. It&#x27;s rated a 1 on EWG.</li>
            <li> Has a slight fragrance, would have preferred unscented. Seems to work fine on my baby daughter. First few times a bit too liquid/separated.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t shake it enough?</li>
            <li> Finally found a sunblock for my son that doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin. Works great on face and body and smells so good. Whole fam used it.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever! Keeps me from getting burned and it&#x27;s not loaded with harsh chemicals either. One of the few brands with a high concentration of zinc.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite baby sunscreen yet. He has never gotten burned when he&#x27;s had it on. It isn&#x27;t as thick and pasty as some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen! It has clean ingredients and a very low rating on the EWG Skin Deep Database (low ratings are safest). We have tried a number of natural kid-friendly sunscreens and this is by far, the favorite. It doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue that many natural sunscreens leave. It holds when the kiddos get wet. And it has a nice, citrus smell to it. I cannot say enough about how well it works and how safe it is. My husband and I use it on ourselves too. I highly recommend this sunscreen to any parent looking for a natural, safe, and effective sunscreen for your kids!</li>
            <li> Kept my baby&#x27;s skin safe through hours of playing at the beach and amusement park! Works great!</li>
            <li> Went on smoothly and easily. Just wish it were cheaper!</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING! Works like a charm and without all the harmful chemicals. I am an afult woman, but I will use this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for a month, but it&#x27;s been great. I wanted a physical sunscreen for my face each day. I&#x27;m 27 and figured now is the time to start... although I should have started MUCH earlier. I haven&#x27;t had any serious burns or freckles yet this Summer... and it&#x27;s been a scorcher so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear sunscreen and take care of your skin!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have used yet!  I live in a warm humid climate so I prefer a drier sunscreen.  This one is great!  Goes on without leaving your skin greasy and white!  Smells great too, and most importantly, it muscle tests better than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! I would order again!</li>
            <li> Easy application… Great coverage… Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen works well. It does require some rubbing to apply so as to blend into skin, but that&#x27;s because it has good protection. It is highly rated by ewg.org, the environmental working group.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is EXCELLENT!! Provides the coverage you need, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and smells great! Will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a ingredient friendly sunscreen and found this. It&#x27;s okay; a little too white to wear as a facial sunscreen. My skin tone is the lightest foundation color in the Lancome line and you could still see the harsh color underneath the foundation. It smells great! Almost like a mango, so it&#x27;s something that I would wear on my body during the summer.</li>
            <li> EWG approved.  It&#x27;s a thick one &amp; will stay on during exercise fairly well.  Cost less than ten moniez on sale.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but too creamy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;Expected to be lighter, not as heavy. Hard to rub in. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a white residue once applied, but it disappears in a few minutes. To make it short- it serves its purpose, has pleasant smell, and does not irritate my eyes like some sunscreens do</li>
            <li> This has done its job- not my daughter nor myself have been burned while wearing it. It has a good consistency, rubs in well, and smell quite nice. BUT, it burns like no other if you get it anywhere near your eyes. I wore the baby one as well just because it&#x27;s handy and I&#x27;m glad I did because I rubbed my eyes by accident and instantly regretted it. Immediate shower for myself and the little one to get it off of ourselves. Not ire how to avoid this in sunscreen and I still use it, I just put it on our bodies and use hats and hope that my little one doesn&#x27;t manage to get it in her eyes :/</li>
            <li> Do not buy!  Dangerous to skin.  I used this on all 3 kids and all 3 kids had damaged skin after use.  It was almost like the sunscreen ate they layer of skin that it was on.  My son&#x27;s face is still healing up after using this product 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This is a safe product unlike many other sunscreens. It is easy to use, goes on well &amp; lasts.</li>
            <li> Great product! My 22 month old has sensitive skin and experiences breakouts easily. No breakouts or concerns with Thinkbaby! Smells lovely and protects my little man well!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen! I&#x27;m sorry I did not know about Thinkbaby sooner than this. It goes on smooth and light, it really works hard to block the harmful rays of the sun, and it is so gentle. I love this product! It is like wearing nothing at all for protection, and yet the protection it offers is awesome. I&#x27;m going to be using this sunscreen from now on. I&#x27;ve already ordered more. For people with sensitive skin this sunscreen is gentle enough for a baby, but offers all the protection anyone could ever need. I highly recommend it. Buy Thinkbaby, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have 1 year old twins who love being outside, it&#x27;s only August and we are on our 6th tube.  We apply this multiple times a day and they have never burned.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the texture and spreadability but the protection cannot be beat which is the most important thing when buying sunscreen.  I tried Aveeno because we ran out and I needed to get something from the store quick and one of my twins&#x27; eyes puffed up and his skin broke out.  I wont be using anything other than ThinkBaby for them in the future!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Have been using this product for several years. Ingredients have been tested and are safe.</li>
            <li> My nephew hated it whenever my sister had to put it on his face. I tried it twice, and both times it made my face itchy and red...</li>
            <li> Love it for baby and I also started using it myself!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all. Its definitely safe around eyes and does work! We were at the beach so I did have to reapply it often. Also, it does leave a bit of a white residue, but I haven&#x27;t found a mineral based sunscreen that hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> We have used this sunscreen for a few years now, and have no complaints. Goes on well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> We were concerned with cancer-causing chemicals in our sunscreens (crazy, huh?). We did some research and found that this was a brand that didn&#x27;t have a lot of &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; in it. It smells very pleasant, isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and definitely blocks the sun out! Our fair skinned toddler hasn&#x27;t had a single line or burn yet this summer, and it&#x27;s all thanks to this sunscreen. We will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I loved all the of safety ratings and health conscious aspects of this sunscreen. I read lots of reviews for some of the &amp;#34;more natural/organic&amp;#34; sunscreens, and chose this one.  So far, all of my expectations have been met.  It does rub in quite well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling on her skin, and it has a nice scent.  Nothing overpowering, just a light citrus note.  I always have problems with sunscreens making my face have a burning sensation....so mommy might be trying this one out as well. It seemed so good on our first two uses, I&#x27;ve already bought more to last through the summer.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen! Smells awesome, covers great, smooth consistency, protects well, and as natural as you can get!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a sunscreen that would not burn here eyes and make her nose run. This product was just what she needed. Only downside is that you really have to blend into the skin because it&#x27;s a heavier creme than what she is used too. She has had several instances where it looks like she just put it on. Maybe she is using too much however.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and my son doesn&#x27;t complain that it burns his face.</li>
            <li> i am so disappointed with this product, it becomes so watery. when i squeeze it out from the tube, all the water started to come out. i immediately checked the expiration date, it wasn&#x27;t it. the sunscreen still has up to a year until it expires!! also checked the other unopened tube, same thing occurs, water inside. don&#x27;t know what is wrong with it?? will need to buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> Love it! The consistency of it if great for an all natural sunscreen. Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;and rubs in well.</li>
            <li> Blends in without leaving a white mask; smells fresh without being overly fragrant; keeps my kids&#x27; sensitive skin rash- and eczema-free.  We do subscribe and save on this item because we fly through it so quickly.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the baby. We&#x27;ve never gotten a sunburn. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love EWG rating of 1. Could be a little less creamy. Smells nice, not sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells good and is not super thick or greasy. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> It smells great. Blocks the sun well. Goes on easy...a little oily till it soaks in. The worst part is that it attracts bees. My daughter got stung. Do not buy if you will use in any outdoor areas with bees present. The bees came straight for us.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  A little difficult to rub on a child that is excited to jump in the water. It&#x27;s thick so will leave a white residue if you don&#x27;t rub in well.  I would still buy it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived really early, a week earlier than expected, which is great. Great product doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry or irritated, unlike other zinc oxide sunscreen, love the ingredients, smells like cream biscuit. Goes on my olive skin white - fades a little but there is a white cast, hence can&#x27;t be used on face. It&#x27;s a little thick, I found it hard to rub it into my skin, but not as hard as some others, its not oily however. Works well in water, the water beads together, and I didn&#x27;t get burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product for the body, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do,  i.e. water resistant and protects you from getting burnt. Not so great for the face however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about sunscreen for myself, so I was even more critical about choosing a sunscreen for my very pale baby. This sunscreen was perfect! It wasn&#x27;t super greasy and had a very light fragrance. We were in the hot LA sun all day, and even though I reapplied often, I was sure he was going to show a little sun exposure. I was thrilled to see that he didn&#x27;t! The sunscreen did an excellent job of protecting him, and I felt better using something that didn&#x27;t use a ton of harmful chemicals. Definitely recommend for your little one!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! It is the best sunscreen and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a safer sunscreen to use. When I was in the market of trying new sunscreens I ordered this and Babo Botanicals 30 SPF Clear Zinc Sunscreen at the same time. Thinkbaby wins hands down! It rubs in very easily, smells nice, and you don&#x27;t have any white residue leftover. Babo Botanicals was HORRIBLE - chalky, had to rub it in till your skin felt raw and sticky, and left you with that white glow. Thinkbaby is our favorite brand now for sunscreen. For safety measures I always followed the directions for when to reapply and never had any issues with burning. I was initially looking for something safe for my baby, but now my whole family uses this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for chemical free sunscreen for my little one,finally I found one, there are many sunscreen but those are with chemicals. I hope this is good product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the sports brand from the same company.  I have also noticed that the  contents seem to have separated into a liquid and pasty portion and must be shaken before use to re-mix.&lt;br /&gt;The sports brand does not seem to have this problem, and it lasts longer which is important as reapplying sunscreen constantly is tough going with active babies.&lt;br /&gt;As for content, the Thinkbaby brand seems to make a solid non-chemical sun-screen.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good sunscreen without harmful chemicals and also one that didn&#x27;t make me look like a zombie from the zinc oxide.  Think Baby fits the bill.  It is absorbed smoothly and completely into my skin and does the job.</li>
