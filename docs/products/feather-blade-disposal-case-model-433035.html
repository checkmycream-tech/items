            <li>It has room for many blades.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s free.</li>

            <li>A nice, sturdy plastic case to safely dispose used double edge razor blades in.</li>
            <li>Clean, does its job and does not take up a ton of space.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine it won&#x27;t be full for years.</li>
            <li>I use an empty screw top medicine container and that works just fine</li>
            <li>On the positive side I received the case quickly and it appears that it will hold a large amount of used blades.</li>
            <li>I just bought my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>You simply drop your used razor blades in the top.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is made for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious how many razors will fit in before I have to buy a new one, but so far it&#x27;s been a month</li>
            <li>Simple cheap and what I needed.</li>
            <li>But oh well... and honestly, it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal - can&#x27;t even remember what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, yoyou simply drop the old blade in the slot.</li>
            <li>top and bottom do come apart to empty out,&lt;br /&gt;the old blades</li>
            <li>If you use double edged razors, and you want to dispose of them safely (you do), having one of these is essential.</li>
            <li>Bought this mainly for my son-in-law to keep his blades in and out of reach of my grandchildren.  </li>
            <li>That was worth 4$ extra for me...    </li>
            <li>Love it... much bigger than expected but should hold a ton of used blades.</li>
            <li>I actually needed this thing it makes blade disposal much easier when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have googled the model number for a complete description.</li>
            <li>Branded as \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; but naturally will work with any brand of DE blade that you choose.    </li>
            <li>Works as expected, small nice looking and yet holds a lot of used blades.</li>
            <li>Provides peace of mind for double-edge shavers, especially those of us who have young children at home.</li>
            <li>Came in a few days and is exactly what I needed.</li>

            <li> A nice, sturdy plastic case to safely dispose used double edge razor blades in. Easy to use, yoyou simply drop the old blade in the slot. Though seemingly pricey, these hold many used blades before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Perfect for its purpose.</li>
            <li> It works as it should.</li>
            <li> Does the job neatly. Glad I have one.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, small nice looking and yet holds a lot of used blades. This is plastic for those hoping to smash closed with a hammer later. I will probably  dump everything inside a sealable can and reuse the container, since it can be opened.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Only &amp;#34;gripe&amp;#34; would be that it&#x27;s a simple container, and the cost could be a buck or two less. But oh well... and honestly, it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal - can&#x27;t even remember what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, a great solution for blade disposal, and it holds A LOT of blades. So I do recommend this for any DE shaver out there!</li>
            <li> well made&lt;br /&gt;thick plastic, not cheap&lt;br /&gt;will hold many many used safety razor blades&lt;br /&gt;reusable&lt;br /&gt;the top and bottom do come apart to empty out,&lt;br /&gt;the old blades</li>
            <li> Holds old used blades perfectly and safely.</li>
            <li> Safer with the grandkids in the house</li>
            <li> I thought i was purchasing a box of feather blades. Instead it was feather blade disposal box. I just bought my first DE safety razor. Guess what I found out I actually needed this thing it makes blade disposal much easier when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> Love it... much bigger than expected but should hold a ton of used blades.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve begun using a safety razor I&#x27;ve wanted a way to dispose of the used razor blades. I&#x27;d read about the Feather blade case and how one could hammer it shut and recycle the entire case. Well this one is plastic. I guess I should have googled the model number for a complete description. On the positive side I received the case quickly and it appears that it will hold a large amount of used blades.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose, but is pricey..a used metal Bandais box would have been a good solution</li>
            <li> It is a hard plastic container that will hold a lot of razor blades. It has a solid construction and you can pop it open if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are basically no cons on this item. I am pretty satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> What is there to say? It&#x27;s a very simple device. You simply drop your used razor blades in the top. It&#x27;s a bit larger than I imagined and should hold a ton of blades. I&#x27;d imagine it won&#x27;t be full for years.</li>
            <li> If you use double edged razors, and you want to dispose of them safely (you do), having one of these is essential.</li>
            <li> Good product , but a piggy bank at the 1$ store  is cheaper</li>
            <li> This blade bank works perfectly and is inexpensive.  It fits great on the shelf of my medicine cabinet and is made of strong plastic so I don&#x27;t need wot worry about rust.  The slit is very thin, there is no way a blade could fall out even if it drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know however, that all Feather brand razor blade packages do have a, &amp;#34;blade bank&amp;#34; built into the the bottom of each package.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer the smaller white metal &amp;#34;Blade Bank&amp;#34; that I filled,&lt;br /&gt;but I don&#x27;t want to pay 3 times the price PLUS shipping.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for holding all my used razor blades! Great for the price and very nice size, easy to keep out of the way.</li>
            <li> This is a very good blade disposal solution. Sure there may be DIY methods out there, but this is superior in my opinion. It has room for many blades. The other thing is that it is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my double-edge razors (which I use with a Merkur 38C). I have twin toddlers and don&#x27;t want them getting used razors from the garbage or anywhere. This disposal case also protects animals that might happen upon these razors at a garbage dump. I&#x27;m curious how many razors will fit in before I have to buy a new one, but so far it&#x27;s been a month and I&#x27;m hoping I get close to a year out of this.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in perfect condition. Great case for blades and I can tell it will take a long time to fill. Will reorder again!</li>
            <li> What is it:  \\&quot;Blade bank\\&quot; for used DE razor blades.    What I liked:  Excellent product for it&#x27;s intended purpose, will hold a large quantity of used DE razor blades and keep them out of curious hands (kids), pets, and so on.    Branded as \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; but naturally will work with any brand of DE blade that you choose.    I find it much easier/better than any homemade contraptions, and it&#x27;s more attractive on the countertop of my bathroom.    What I didn&#x27;t like:   The price is a touch steep for what you get, especially as you can occasionally find this for a very low price (1$) at local shops - but, that avoids the convenience factor of shopping at home and having it delivered. That was worth 4$ extra for me...    Would I buy it again/recommend it?  Yes, good product, serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> Crazy scary dealing with real cutting devices, like a bare DE razor blade. Perfect solution for razor blade disposal!</li>
            <li> I needed a way to dispose of my used blades and this is an excellent solution.</li>
            <li> Came in a few days and is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Nothing too complicated here. A big enough box with a slot large enough to accept blades but small enough to prevent them from coming out. Nothing opens, so the blades are kept secure. Holds a lot of used blades.  Provides peace of mind for double-edge shavers, especially those of us who have young children at home.</li>
            <li> works great.  delivered on time</li>
            <li> Clean, does its job and does not take up a ton of space.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to and seems to be well made.  Would be nice if it were made of metal but I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Good quality. I bought two, should last for awhile.</li>
            <li> It is a box, it hold blades, not much to add.</li>
            <li> This works as intended and allows me to safely dispose of used blades without anyone being injured in the disposal.</li>
            <li> Bought this mainly for my son-in-law to keep his blades in and out of reach of my grandchildren.  I use an empty screw top medicine container and that works just fine and it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is made for.</li>
            <li> Simple cheap and what I needed.</li>
