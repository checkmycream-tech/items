            <li>I thought this felt very nice when putting it on, it went on very smooth and felt moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was unfamiliar with the brand, but I&#x27;m very glad</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and great for avoiding feathering which often happens with lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!!!!!</li>
            <li>also like using this with darker colored lipsticks to lighten the shade a bit with a nice shine that lasts.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered three tubes, and will be ordering more, I am sure.</li>
            <li>And it does those jobs better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.   </li>
            <li>I have tryed many products, and</li>
            <li>I found this product many years ago and have been using it since.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and hope that the item is never discontinued.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use it, I have a lot of feathering with my lipstick, so I&#x27;m pleased to have found it.</li>
            <li>I think there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>She was very excited when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This one is inexpensive, easy to apply, and does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a coconut scent, but it&#x27;s too sweet smelling for my taste.</li>
            <li>Came on time,,works as i expected,,use it several times, every day, the texture is good, itbhelps to keep the top lip color vibrant</li>
            <li>And since I&#x27;ve gotten older, the creases are more defined and still no bleeding.  </li>
            <li>really keeps lipstick from \\&quot;bleeding\\&quot; into those fine lines around the mouth ...</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than a clear lipstick.</li>
            <li>I use lip liner and the product allows the liner to glide right on.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it locally any more, so</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s close to a year but not the whole cigar!   </li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and performed exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how well it really works!</li>
            <li>At a certain stage in life many women find that their lipstick &amp;#34;bleeds&amp;#34; in unattractive lines outward from their lips, especially after eating a meal.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why stores don&#x27;t carry it any more, at least I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li>My mom wears lipstick every single day, so kudos to this product for lasting so long and being so awesome.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for when my lips are dry.</li>
            <li>If you outline your lips with this you look as it you have just been eating very greasy food and forgotten to wipe your mouth!Lipstick also just slides of it too.</li>
            <li>and I received it in a very timely order and now have a lifetime (ha) supply.</li>
            <li>really missed it because I believe it does keep my lipstick :&amp;</li>
            <li>So much she asked for another tube this year.</li>
            <li>I never thought I had a real problem</li>
            <li>It is also very moisturizing, so sometimes I just use it like a chapstick.</li>
            <li>really greasy</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels smooth and not greasy and actually keeps lipstick and glosses from feathering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and one tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten, um, older, my skin has become much dryer; in addition, I live in a high-altitude area where dryness is a given.  </li>
            <li>As a former smoker, I have many creases above and below my lips that lipstick &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; into.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I have been able to wear dark lipstick colors with absolutely no feathering, which is something I have not been able to do in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 yrs old, I have the wrinkle line around my mouth.</li>
            <li>It does work if you&#x27;re looking for a soft chapstick-like product</li>
            <li>My 80+ year old mom has been looking for a product like this for years.  </li>
            <li>I am 79 years old with lots of wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel it did anything as far as for a primer&lt;br /&gt;for lip color</li>
            <li>Irene Gari Anti Feather Lip Base is the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of greasy and when you apply your lipstick it slides around and looks sloppy.</li>
            <li>When I was down to my last tube I went to buy more only to find out that it was no longer carried and the saleswoman had no idea what I was talking about.  </li>
            <li>I love red lipstick, but have always had feathering even with a clear lip liner and pencil underneath, this stopped the feathering dead in its tracks!!</li>
            <li>You can find other products advertised to do the same thing that are harder to apply and cost more.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately this is just a very greasy salve and so not at all suitable for invisibly lining the outside of the lips in order to stop lipstick bleeding.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I had hoped for because it really looks bad when your lipstick does not have a fine line and seeps above and below your lips!</li>

            <li> It is exactly what I had hoped for because it really looks bad when your lipstick does not have a fine line and seeps above and below your lips!</li>
            <li> It absolutely prevents lipstick from bleeding into those small creases above the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> This product performs well and does not dry out lips, as opposed to other more expensive anti-feathering  lip products I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> I wish I hadnt bought several of these as it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years young and have trouble with lipstick featheing.</li>
            <li> In addition, it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had known about this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to moisturize my dry chapped lips for a while</li>
            <li> My lips felt too wet to have my lipstick not run.  </li>
            <li> You have to be really careful.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically the same product, but now there is a scent to it that I&#x27;m not thrilled about.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find the Irene Gari Anti Feather Lip Base again.  </li>
            <li> When I put on my lipstick however it slightly distorted the color, making it come out lighter and slightly pinker.</li>
            <li> I first discovered Irene Gari Lip Base locally several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this lip base as I have in the past, but it seemed a lot more moisturizing</li>
            <li> If you apply this product--a little beyond your lips all around--before you apply lipstick, it does not bleed.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product &amp; it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip moisturizer for a few months</li>
            <li> This lipstick base is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Further disappointment: if anything, my lips feel even dryer than before I began using the product.</li>
            <li> I was down to my last lip base and my supplier quit selling this</li>
            <li> My lips are not clearly defined so it is a haphazard process.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> My mom is a TOUGH critic.</li>
            <li> I wear a deep shade of blue/pink and it used to bleed before using Irene Gari Anti-Feathering Lip Base.  </li>
            <li> This lip base definitely reduces the bleeding and feathering of lipstick.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again, my lipstick looked sloppy after an hour and the color bled.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see this ever being used as a base - much less one that is anti-feathering.</li>
            <li> try it - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After all of the rave reviews of this \\&quot;Anti-Feather\\&quot; lip base, I am greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This looks like the waxy lipstick base that Boots no7 used to make and has annoyingly been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for anti-feather lip base everywhere, and could not find it.</li>
            <li> This lip base is lightweight and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have loved it. I use lip liner and the product allows the liner to glide right on. It also prevents feathering or bleeding, which is why I started using the product in the fist place. I don&#x27;t know why stores don&#x27;t carry it any more, at least I haven&#x27;t been able to find it. So I decided to check on line and there it was. It&#x27;s basically the same product, but now there is a scent to it that I&#x27;m not thrilled about. It&#x27;s like a coconut scent, but it&#x27;s too sweet smelling for my taste. However I feel the product glides on even smoother then before so I&#x27;m still a fan.</li>
            <li> I have found that this product works well to prevent your lipstick from seeping up the cracks of your lips when applied before your lipstick.  It is exactly what I had hoped for because it really looks bad when your lipstick does not have a fine line and seeps above and below your lips!</li>
            <li> What can I say about a standard cosmetic product?  My wife was very happy with it, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> This looks like the waxy lipstick base that Boots no7 used to make and has annoyingly been discontinued. Unfortunately this is just a very greasy salve and so not at all suitable for invisibly lining the outside of the lips in order to stop lipstick bleeding. If you outline your lips with this you look as it you have just been eating very greasy food and forgotten to wipe your mouth!Lipstick also just slides of it too. I wish I hadnt bought several of these as it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it under my regular lipstick-keeps from running. from lip outline /&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on time--and now I know where to get my supplis.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it everyday.  I was purchasing it at Sally&#x27;s, but they discontinued it.  I had searched for months before I found it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I was down to my last lip base and my supplier quit selling this so was very pleased to find it on Amazon and I received it in a very timely order and now have a lifetime (ha) supply.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and great for avoiding feathering which often happens with lipstick.  It goes on like lipstick</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered this!  My only regret is I didn&#x27;t find it sooner.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 yrs old, I have the wrinkle line around my mouth. when I use lipstick, it feathers &amp; gets in the wrinkles. I ordered this product &amp; it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> This product performs well and does not dry out lips, as opposed to other more expensive anti-feathering  lip products I&#x27;ve purchased.  Would recommend - it does the job!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for anti-feather lip base everywhere, and could not find it. I finally thought to look online and there it was. I am 67 years young and have trouble with lipstick featheing. This stuff works great and feels so good  on my lips. I ordered three tubes, and will be ordering more, I am sure. Thanks for a great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this felt very nice when putting it on, it went on very smooth and felt moisturizing. When I put on my lipstick however it slightly distorted the color, making it come out lighter and slightly pinker. Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and would buy it in my local beauty supply store.  When I was down to my last tube I went to buy more only to find out that it was no longer carried and the saleswoman had no idea what I was talking about.  I tried several \\&quot;on line\\&quot; places with no luck and Amazon was a last ditch effort.&lt;br /&gt;It really keeps lipstick from \\&quot;bleeding\\&quot; into those fine lines around the mouth ... try it - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find the Irene Gari Anti Feather Lip Base again.  The store where I used to purchase it didn&#x27;t carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I really missed it because I believe it does keep my lipstick :&amp;#34;in line&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I first discovered Irene Gari Lip Base locally several years ago.  I was unfamiliar with the brand, but I&#x27;m very glad I gave it a try.  As I&#x27;ve gotten, um, older, my skin has become much dryer; in addition, I live in a high-altitude area where dryness is a given.  I&#x27;ve found that this product is the best to use with lipstick or lip gloss.  It keeps the lipstick from bleeding and also provides needed moisturizing help.  And it does those jobs better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.   I can&#x27;t find it locally any more, so I&#x27;m counting on Amazon to keep me supplied!</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than a clear lipstick. In fact, neither my lip-liner or lipstick will adhere if I use this. It does work if you&#x27;re looking for a soft chapstick-like product but I can&#x27;t see this ever being used as a base - much less one that is anti-feathering.</li>
            <li> As a former smoker, I have many creases above and below my lips that lipstick &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; into.  This product stops that.</li>
            <li> At a certain stage in life many women find that their lipstick &amp;#34;bleeds&amp;#34; in unattractive lines outward from their lips, especially after eating a meal.  If you apply this product--a little beyond your lips all around--before you apply lipstick, it does not bleed.  You can find other products advertised to do the same thing that are harder to apply and cost more.  This one is inexpensive, easy to apply, and does the job.</li>
            <li> So much she asked for another tube this year. I&#x27;m getting her 2, because she said each tube lasts about 9 months. That&#x27;s close to a year but not the whole cigar!   My mom wears lipstick every single day, so kudos to this product for lasting so long and being so awesome. My mom is a TOUGH critic.</li>
            <li> I love red lipstick, but have always had feathering even with a clear lip liner and pencil underneath, this stopped the feathering dead in its tracks!! I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This product prevents lip-feathering and keeps lips moist.  I recommend it highly. It goes on easily and one tube lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve used other brands and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip moisturizer for a few months and I LOVE it! I use it mostly for when my lips are dry. It works better than Chapstick! I use it under my lipstick too.I&#x27;ve been looking for something to moisturize my dry chapped lips for a while and now I found it with this! Love it! I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it works quite well for the price. I would buy it again &amp; I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the very best.  I have tryed many products, and nothing worked. Irene Gari Anti Feather Lip Base is the best.  My lipstick doesn&#x27;t run!!!!!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I found this product many years ago and have been using it since.  It moisturizes your lips and is a great base for lipstick.  It absolutely prevents lipstick from bleeding into those small creases above the upper lip.  I wear a deep shade of blue/pink and it used to bleed before using Irene Gari Anti-Feathering Lip Base.  And since I&#x27;ve gotten older, the creases are more defined and still no bleeding.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and hope that the item is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend. But it came with no instructions. When I use it, I put it on like lipstick and then put the lipstick over it. My lips are not clearly defined so it is a haphazard process. Does it work? I don&#x27;t know. I never thought I had a real problem so I still don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After all of the rave reviews of this \\&quot;Anti-Feather\\&quot; lip base, I am greatly disappointed. Since it hasn&#x27;t stopped my lipstick from bleeding/feathering, I thought I&#x27;d just use it as a moisturizing balm, like ChapStik. Further disappointment: if anything, my lips feel even dryer than before I began using the product.</li>
            <li> Came on time,,works as i expected,,use it several times, every day, the texture is good, itbhelps to keep the top lip color vibrant</li>
            <li> I purchase this lip base as I have in the past, but it seemed a lot more moisturizing and it did not control the feathering.  My lips felt too wet to have my lipstick not run.  I would not buy this again, my lipstick looked sloppy after an hour and the color bled.  Not a good look.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  It arrived promptly and performed exactly as described.  It  met all my expectations.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My 80+ year old mom has been looking for a product like this for years.  She was very excited when I found it on Amazon.  She thinks it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> FINALLY found a product that works and is inexpensive!  I have been able to wear dark lipstick colors with absolutely no feathering, which is something I have not been able to do in a very long time.  In addition, it lasts all day long.  Because it works so great, I ordered 5 of them.  Wish I had known about this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old with lots of wrinkles around my mouth. This lip base definitely reduces the bleeding and feathering of lipstick. I will buy i again.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to everyone I have used this product for several years and it does the job</li>
            <li> This lipstick base is fantastic.  It makes my lipstick stay on for hours longer than it would without.  It is also very moisturizing, so sometimes I just use it like a chapstick.</li>
            <li> I like this as a moiusturizer&lt;br /&gt;its really greasy&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel it did anything as far as for a primer&lt;br /&gt;for lip color I guess i&#x27;ll try it again</li>
            <li> This lip base is lightweight and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It feels smooth and not greasy and actually keeps lipstick and glosses from feathering.&lt;br /&gt;I do like using this with matte lipsticks, it helps to keep matte lipsticks from drying out your lips like they tend to do.&lt;br /&gt;I also like using this with darker colored lipsticks to lighten the shade a bit with a nice shine that lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost a year and I can&#x27;t believe how well it really works! If I don&#x27;t use it, I have a lot of feathering with my lipstick, so I&#x27;m pleased to have found it. Will order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a so-so product, not one I would purchase again. It&#x27;s kind of greasy and when you apply your lipstick it slides around and looks sloppy. You have to be really careful. I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in the staying power of my lipstick either. I think there are better products out there.</li>
