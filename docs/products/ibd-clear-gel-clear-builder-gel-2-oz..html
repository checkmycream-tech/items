            <li>I use this as a top coat over my crystal nails and it places a hard finish and a beautiful clear shine.  </li>

            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just been so long, but it seems a lot thinner than I recall???</li>
            <li> Be careful not to put on too much as it thickens the nail, if you like your nails thin like I do.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about ordering from amazon what I normally order from professional catalogs and companies</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick enough to use and it doesn&#x27;t lift.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been a nail tech for over 15 years.  I was very skeptical about ordering from amazon what I normally order from professional catalogs and companies but I thought I would give it a try because the pricing and shipping was cheaper.  I am glad to say the product was packed well, arrived promptly and was the same high quality I had been ordering from other sources.  Thank you Amazon for saving me more of my hard working dollars in this hard economy.</li>
            <li> The gel is good. Bubbles a bit but you can get around it. The thing I have a problem with is the packaging... Doesn&#x27;t travel well at all.. the moment you open it, you better keep it upright it leaks like crazy! I didn&#x27;t even travel with it or anything.. I just had it in a box and it tipped a bit (mind you that I closed it tightly! I checked even after the leak!) , next day bye bye box and all the sticky brushes in it..</li>
            <li> I use this for my own nails and it takes some practice.  You really need to work with it to not have to file alot.</li>
            <li> This Gel is used every time I do my nails.  The salons charge an extra charge for putting it on and since I found it here, I am a loyal buyer.  It works excellent, dries perfectly, doesn&#x27;t run.  Be careful not to put on too much as it thickens the nail, if you like your nails thin like I do.  The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat over my crystal nails and it places a hard finish and a beautiful clear shine.  It also keeps your nail polish from chipping!  This is just one step in applying a gel to your nails, need other items, ie uv light for drying in order to use this.  Great product.  Fast shipping and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its the only gel that stays shiny,keeps my nails from splitting,peeling,and cracking. No lifting,and keeps the polish on for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I am new to gel nails and bought this product to do a simple overlay over my natural nail. I must admit that you really have to practice using this product but it is easy to apply and a little difficult to smooth and even out.</li>
            <li> this is great builder - smooth, durable, self leveling, long lasting. sets well with my light - love it!</li>
            <li> Great buy, easy to use!</li>
            <li> So I learned to do gel nails because i have arthritus and want to make sure my hands can do it before i spend the money on school. This is the only product i will ever use on nails.</li>
            <li> This came in perfect condition. I love this product. Will definitely buy again and again. It had the seal still in tact.</li>
            <li> The product was full and untouched! A wonderful professional builder gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to have nail technicians to put on my nails as no one in my area seems to do UV Gel nails? Maybe it&#x27;s just been so long, but it seems a lot thinner than I recall???</li>
            <li> i love this gel, it s realla good product and clients come after a month and a half for fill ins , because its so rsesistend , is the 3d time  i buy and will go on with it 1 happy happy happy</li>
            <li> I was out of UV gel, and this came just in time. Delivery was quick and the jar was sealed with a silver foil which was big plus for me as I know for sure it hasn&#x27;t been contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase from this seller again, and the price is right and the delivery is even better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it my fingers get really sore and they itch. I think I might be allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  For the price and the amount of builder gel you receive it&#x27;s a win win situation!  I will continue to buy and use this as I have completed to sets of gel tips with the builder gel and it works great!</li>
            <li> I buy this every time and will continue to buy it.  it&#x27;s thick enough to use and it doesn&#x27;t lift.</li>
            <li> The original IBD from USA. Perfectly packed!</li>
            <li> I got advise from my friend. She is professional nail stilist. The product working perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I love my friend, I love my nails.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought online and the product does not adhere to my nails. I would not buy again</li>
            <li> I love this gel I am a beginner at doing nails but this gel works fine for what I need.</li>
