            <li>and it works great even though the price is a bit high for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>This cream is super greasy!  </li>
            <li>It is a fine and smooth lotion, but it does nothing else.  </li>
            <li>It is light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light weight cream, that asorbs into the skin (around the eye area).</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and with continued use, you will achieve the results that your searching for.</li>
            <li>I have been using it day and night and its  light and creamy and my eyes feel refreshed and hydrating after applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all natural product which is what I Love!</li>
            <li>I have been using this great product since a month and everyone have noticed that my dark circles are fading away.  </li>
            <li>Now, I did see an great improvement in the dark circles under my eyes in that week</li>
            <li>but I can see a little bit of results, which makes me happy</li>
            <li>I love that it all natural.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try</li>
            <li>tried using it on just my right eye, to see the deference.</li>
            <li>I used this consistently for over a month</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I tried it out for the first week.  </li>
            <li>I could see positive affect as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li>I have some other changes I need to do as well such as a better sleep schedule and better water drinking habits.</li>
            <li>Thanks alot for your product.</li>
            <li>This eye cream works very well.  </li>
            <li>This does NOT work, my eyes were very blurry and irritated with this product.</li>
            <li>But for the money I can&#x27;t really see anything to complain about ..</li>
            <li>I just love the natural ingredients in this under eye cream, but, after using it for two weeks, I haven&#x27;t yet seen a reduction in my dark under-eye circles.  </li>
            <li>I am going to use it again and strongly recommend for anyone who has dark circles.</li>
            <li>I like this so much better than more expensive items I&#x27;ve bought before, I highly recommend you buying it if you are looking for a similar product!!</li>
            <li>very creamy and sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>so far anyway.</li>
            <li>natural.</li>
            <li>and once I stopped using it, my skin under my eyes went completely back to normal.</li>
            <li>then goes translucent then brightens and smooths and straightens the wrinkles and lifts the eyes in general and without irritation!</li>
            <li>so far, I need to be sincere, there&#x27;s not extreme improvement in my black eyes, but I am also not using it everyday.</li>
            <li>and you only need to use a tiny bit to cover completely.</li>

            <li> after about three day it was considerable worse, it makes the circles under your eye darker and more noticeable, total waste of money</li>
            <li> It also stings my eyes and makes them water, even though I am VERY careful not to get any of the product too near or in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but so far no dramatic results, but my eyes haven&#x27;t gotten any worse like</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that I would like the Biotique Almond Under Eye Cream For Dark Circles &amp; Puffiness would work for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t take my eyes itching and watering all day long when I&#x27;m trying to work.  </li>
            <li> The jar is bigger than I expected so that was a plus too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long yet</li>
            <li> I used it for a long time and it did nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount per application.</li>
            <li> then other sites.and</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has dark circles or puffiness around the eye area.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help with puffiness, it makes it worse, and I won&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it does anything for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it helps with dark circles but definitely keeps the skin around my eyes well hydrated, so no fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has been a little less than a month</li>
            <li> totally waste of money</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a few weeks, I never saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Just started using this, not sure if it makes my eyes less puffy or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bottled in a small package, so if your also traveling you can pack this in your travel case.</li>
            <li> I mean I see a little  change but not much&lt;br</li>
            <li> ..still not sure what to think</li>
            <li> and I can feel that it is strengthening my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the negative stuff is about.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick cream</li>
            <li> Very small jar.</li>
            <li> made the dark circles under my eyes worse!</li>
            <li> While this eye cream was very in expensive, I really do not see a difference in reducing the  puffiness in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It was very thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very thick.  </li>
            <li> Just as the title states it made my eyes flaky/crusty, and people were commenting on how tired I looked.</li>
            <li> It made my eyes just look so tired</li>
            <li> It feels like cold cream and smells like Noxema.  </li>
            <li> It also made my eyes burn really bad.</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing ever.</li>

            <li> Excellent product to have. I will order again in the future. Thanks alot for your product. It is very good.</li>
            <li> This cream is super greasy!  It leaves a greasy/oily look under my eyes that lasts all day, even after I try wiping it off.  It also stings my eyes and makes them water, even though I am VERY careful not to get any of the product too near or in my eyes.  I am going to quit using this product!</li>
            <li> Just got this and love it!! This is the best eye cream by far that I have used. I would recommend it to anyone who has need of it. It brightens the area under the eyes instantly. It is a thick cream and you only need to use a tiny bit to cover completely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this great product since a month and everyone have noticed that my dark circles are fading away.  Even though I didn&#x27;t like the smell or look of it, I love it because it is working and is organic. It is light and I can feel that it is strengthening my delicate eye area. I am going to use it again and strongly recommend for anyone who has dark circles.</li>
            <li> I just love the natural ingredients in this under eye cream, but, after using it for two weeks, I haven&#x27;t yet seen a reduction in my dark under-eye circles.  Perhaps it takes more time, so I&#x27;ll continue using it for a while longer.</li>
            <li> This creme does the job, love it and will order again, I use this every day before going to work,great moisturizer</li>
            <li> This cream actually made my eyes puffier.  It was very thick and greasy.  I used it in the morning and in the evening for about 2 weeks.  I had to stop using it.  When I woke up, both my under eye and upper lids were swollen from using it.</li>
            <li> I like this so much better than more expensive items I&#x27;ve bought before, I highly recommend you buying it if you are looking for a similar product!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has dark circles or puffiness around the eye area. It&#x27;s an all natural product which is what I Love!

The bottle can fit into the plam of your hand! Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and with continued use, you will achieve the results that your searching for. Also, for the price that Amazon is selling it for, what more can you ask for(?) I choose standard shipping and it was delivered within 3 days of the purchase date. This product has earned 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Very small jar. Picture was misleading. Just started using this, not sure if it makes my eyes less puffy or not.</li>
            <li> so far, I need to be sincere, there&#x27;s not extreme improvement in my black eyes, but I am also not using it everyday. but I can see a little bit of results, which makes me happy and I am sure if I can get to use it as directed, over time it will work. happy for what I purchased, and I would suggest it to my friends</li>
            <li> This eye cream works very well.  You only need a small amount per application. It&#x27;s a great deal for price!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing.  It is a fine and smooth lotion, but it does nothing else.  totally waste of money</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing ever. it doesn&#x27;t do anything for your skin. I used it for a long time and it did nothing for my dark circles.</li>

            <li> This does NOT work, my eyes were very blurry and irritated with this product. I would not recommend if you have sensitive eyes. I did not finish using it I just threw away.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Yes, it has a Pinesol smell but after one use - it totally made the lines around my eyes softer.  I keep this at my bedside and would use it around my eyes, between my forehead and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very creamy and sinks right in.  You can feel it moisturizing your eyes.  Definitely will get another one.</li>
            <li> While this eye cream was very in expensive, I really do not see a difference in reducing the  puffiness in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It has been a little less than a month and I have been using twice a day... I&#x27;m using the product...but so far no dramatic results, but my eyes haven&#x27;t gotten any worse like somebody else said I just laughed at that one! Lol. I mean I see a little  change but not much&lt;br /&gt;..still not sure what to think but I will update you when it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
            <li> This cream is hydrating! I love that it all natural. I am not sure if it helps with dark circles but definitely keeps the skin around my eyes well hydrated, so no fine lines. I could see the difference in the winter months as I had stopped using this cream for a month so this is a must for all those living in colder climates.</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle. The best thing I&#x27;v ever had and at a fantastic price. I&#x27;ll take all you&#x27;ve got!</li>
            <li> I got this product in a timely fashion so that was great. I used the product twice a day and it works great even though the price is a bit high for the amount you get. I def would big the product again because it does work.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently for over a month and I did not see any improvement. It may work for others but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> For price, its a wonderful , soft soothing eye cream. It has a nice scent to it also! It has nautral ingredients too which is nice.</li>
            <li> i like the cream.it works good.product is better price then other sites.and the product do met my expectation.love the sit</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long yet but I just love how hydrating this cream is. I have been using it day and night and its  light and creamy and my eyes feel refreshed and hydrating after applying. The jar is bigger than I expected so that was a plus too! I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with the darkness yet but I understand it takes time and its not a miracle I have some other changes I need to do as well such as a better sleep schedule and better water drinking habits. Overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that I would like the Biotique Almond Under Eye Cream For Dark Circles &amp; Puffiness would work for my dark circles.  I tried it out for the first week.  I put it on at night and in the morning like the bottle says, but my eyes would itch and water all throughout the day.  I decided to just put it on at night and see how that went.  Same thing.  I then put it on at night and in the morning I washed it off but still no change in my eyes.  I then took a week off from the product seeing if there was a change the next week but to no avail.  Now, I did see an great improvement in the dark circles under my eyes in that week but I just couldn&#x27;t take my eyes itching and watering all day long when I&#x27;m trying to work.  It must be an allergic reaction for me but maybe it will be a different experience for you!!</li>
            <li> I just bought my second jar of this under eye cream.  It works well for reducing puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Just as the title states it made my eyes flaky/crusty, and people were commenting on how tired I looked. I used this for 2 weeks religiously and saw no improvement at all. It made my eyes just look so tired and once I stopped using it, my skin under my eyes went completely back to normal. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a few weeks, I never saw a difference. It also made my eyes burn really bad. It was worth a try but I wont be using it again.</li>
            <li> Have now started to use the product and it seems to be working good, can&#x27;t tell right away of the results cause as you know I will have to use for awhile before knowing the results</li>
            <li> In good condition, just as the picture shows. It&#x27;s a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;Effective ,as the reviews say. Good choice of gift to girl friends.</li>
            <li> ... as I am still using another product that is almost gone.  But for the money I can&#x27;t really see anything to complain about .. so far anyway.</li>
            <li> The product and service are very good. The best UNDER EYE CREAM .All natural. I could see positive affect as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li> made the dark circles under my eyes worse! tried using it on just my right eye, to see the deference. after about three day it was considerable worse, it makes the circles under your eye darker and more noticeable, total waste of money</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! I don&#x27;t know what all the negative stuff is about.  It smells like heaven...&lt;br /&gt;that healthy ayurvedic clean very pleasant aroma. The cream has this delectable texture that melts into the skin around these eyes and there is a noticeable clean bright look after it dries. This company definitely makes one of the best...well no, theee best eye cream I have ever used. I love the way it goes on creamy then goes translucent then brightens and smooths and straightens the wrinkles and lifts the eyes in general and without irritation! I will definitely reorder. This is definitely a keeper!!</li>
