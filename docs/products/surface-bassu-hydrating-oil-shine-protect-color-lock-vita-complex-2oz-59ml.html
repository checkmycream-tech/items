            <li>This oil provides the shine, smooth appearance, and control</li>
            <li>There are lower priced items available, but with this one, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The smell is unlike most hair products you may be familiar with, but I&#x27;ve really grown to love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Great for a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and love that it keeps my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!Awesome deal!</li>
            <li>I like the company so if you are interested it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>Expensive but best of any products I have ever used</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair product, my stylist first introduced me to it several months ago.</li>
            <li>This arrived on time and was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of extremely fine shoulder length hair and this product does not weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>It really helps control frizzy hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily look or feel.  </li>
            <li>It really protects, nourishes, and moisturizes my hair to keep the color from fading or the heat from frying my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found to make my frizzy ends look smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product is very new</li>
            <li>before I blow dry my hair, it helps with keeping the look smooth...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I normally purchase this from my hair stylist.</li>
            <li>In short - this product makes my hair appear/feel soft and healthy - and not greasy (which similar products have - after 8 hours or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so light and disolves quickly in hair and skin without any filmy, sticky or thick residue.</li>
            <li>I finally found the right product.  </li>
            <li>Bassu Hydrating Oil is a new product I have just tried</li>
            <li>It gives an immediate shine, but it doesn&#x27;t really impart moisture, so an hour later my hair looks just as it did before applying it.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that there appears to be something mixed in with the original product.</li>
            <li>The seller did state that they weren&#x27;t aware of this and offered me a partial discount.</li>
            <li>I usually have difficulties with other products getting gummy on my hair, this leaves your hair smooth and VERY manageable.</li>
            <li>Does what I expected, but have learned not to use too much as your hair can get a greasy look.</li>
            <li>The two bottles look the same, the contents smell/appear the same, and no moisture in the new bottle.</li>
            <li>I have tried other ones that really suck.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly the same and costs slightly less.  </li>
            <li>The seller had, in fact put tape over the tip of the bottle (appreciated, as oils may seep when shipped) - so my bottle arrived in a bubble wrap bag (which yes will be recycled), dry as can be (wish I could say the same for similar purchases from different vendors!!!).</li>

            <li> Generally I apply this to damp hair, but dry hair works just as well.</li>
            <li> I use it after flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> Started using this product when my hairdresser recommended it - more expensive than what I typically spend on such a product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t open it until my other one ran out therefore</li>
            <li> The key is gently massaging a few drops in at time and letting the skin absorb it slowly; and it&#x27;s scent-free.</li>
            <li> I can see this product lasting a long time beings that I need to use so little.</li>
            <li> Only have to use a little on hands and rub thru hair and then comb or brush.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> A little Baba oil goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp and this product really helps keeps my skin hydrated, especially in the cold outdoor temperatures during winter.</li>
            <li> Will order it again thru Amazon, plus other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could see that water or some other liquid had been added because of the oil/water bubbles.  </li>
            <li> FYI a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Something I don&#x27;t typically see with other brands of styling</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using a very small amount, possibly the size of a dime or a nickel.</li>
            <li> - I saw this offered on Amazon - for $5 less than what I paid in shop</li>
            <li> (odd moisture in bottle) -</li>
            <li> not leave hair stiff like sprays do and does not have a build up.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it I realized that the wrong product was in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Wary after reading a reviewer who found her purchase to be inferior</li>

Thanks...</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me by my hairdresser and I fell in love. It not greasy or over oily but leaves your hair shiny and healthy</li>
            <li> If you have hair that tends to frizz after washing...then this is the oil for you.  It hydrates your hair without leaving it greasy or oily.  It is a great oil for hair that is colored, or if you use a blow dryer or iron on your hair.  The smell is lovely....not overpowering at all.  This is the best hydrating oil I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Puts a wonderful shine to the hair without looking oily.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product</li>
            <li> Best ever.  Highly recommend it</li>

            <li> It is not the best smoother or shiner product but works ok, better than nothing. I have tried other ones that really suck. I m happy with this one! i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> awesome product and fast delivery .&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Love this hydrating oil!  I normally purchase this from my hair stylist. Since I didn&#x27;t have an upcoming appointment, I ordered on Amazon.  Product is exactly the same and costs slightly less.  I use it after flat ironing my hair.  It really helps control frizzy hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily look or feel.  I even use it for my hands and face as a moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that there appears to be something mixed in with the original product. I have a bottle that I bought in a salon, and when I use it, my hair is completely different from when I use the product in this bottle. This one makes my hair greasy, like I&#x27;ve put baby oil in it or something.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great price too</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, what else do I need to say?  It smells great and I put it in my hair as well to give it some hold and shine.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I alternate between this product and another oil product for your hair. It did take me a few times to learn how much I really needed...FYI a little goes a long way!! And it is always easier to add more...I use this before I blow dry my hair, it helps with keeping the look smooth...It is also great for the dry winter air, so you can control static head!!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this.  It gives an immediate shine, but it doesn&#x27;t really impart moisture, so an hour later my hair looks just as it did before applying it.  What&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> This is the only oil I use for my color treated, curly (frizzy) hair. It really protects, nourishes, and moisturizes my hair to keep the color from fading or the heat from frying my hair. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp and this product really helps keeps my skin hydrated, especially in the cold outdoor temperatures during winter. The number one thing about this oil product is that it is \\&quot;mineral oil-free.\\&quot;  Bonus uses also include: great use on cuticles or on baby&#x27;s fresh washed skin right after bathing. A little Baba oil goes a long way.  The key is gently massaging a few drops in at time and letting the skin absorb it slowly; and it&#x27;s scent-free.</li>
            <li> Any product from surface is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair product, my stylist first introduced me to it several months ago. I have a full head of extremely fine shoulder length hair and this product does not weigh it down at all. I usually have difficulties with other products getting gummy on my hair, this leaves your hair smooth and VERY manageable.

I hope the continue to make this for years to come!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!Awesome deal! This is the best magic potion for dry color treated hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and liked it, so I ordered more.  When I opened it I realized that the wrong product was in the bottle.  I could see that water or some other liquid had been added because of the oil/water bubbles.  I didn&#x27;t open it until my other one ran out therefore, I couldn&#x27;t return it because of the time lapse per seller&#x27;s policy.  The seller did state that they weren&#x27;t aware of this and offered me a partial discount.</li>
            <li> Bassu Hydrating Oil is a new product I have just tried and I&#x27;m finding it does everything it advertises it will do. Great product~</li>
            <li> I was told by my hairdresser this can be used on your face. Anybody else using it that way and how do you like it?</li>
            <li> Does what I expected, but have learned not to use too much as your hair can get a greasy look.</li>
            <li> Started using this product when my hairdresser recommended it - more expensive than what I typically spend on such a product.  Yet - I am just now buying second bottle from 2+ cuts ago (still have a bit left too!!).  I love how this product returns the shine and softness to my hair that coloring had removed from it. Same goes for when I use \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoo - this product returns the shine and softness.  In short - this product makes my hair appear/feel soft and healthy - and not greasy (which similar products have - after 8 hours or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living rural - I saw this offered on Amazon - for $5 less than what I paid in shop (plus gas saved on driving to shop) - so I ordered it. Wary after reading a reviewer who found her purchase to be inferior (odd moisture in bottle) - I compared the bottle that arrived with the bottle that still has contents in it.  The two bottles look the same, the contents smell/appear the same, and no moisture in the new bottle. The seller had, in fact put tape over the tip of the bottle (appreciated, as oils may seep when shipped) - so my bottle arrived in a bubble wrap bag (which yes will be recycled), dry as can be (wish I could say the same for similar purchases from different vendors!!!).</li>
            <li> This is liquid gold.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found to make my frizzy ends look smooth.  I can reuse during the day because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I finally found the right product.  Often smoothing products leave my hair looking greasy and make me want to start over.  This oil provides the shine, smooth appearance, and control I&#x27;ve been looking for.  One bottle lasts me for months.  There are lower priced items available, but with this one, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and love that it keeps my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have another bottle of Surface Bassu from a salon and it looks clearer and cleaner than this bottle from BeautyAnd which looks like something is mixed in; it has bubbles.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without weighing down my hair.  Smooths away fly away while leaving my hair soft and shiny.  Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Adds shine, decreases frizz and protects from sun.  Needs just a tiny bit required before curling.  I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and its cheap enuf and travel size. This arrived on time and was exactly how it was described. This product is very new and i love it, u can use it on ur hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Nice Hair Oil.  I still am in love with CHI Brilliance or even Bio Silk Serum.  I like the company so if you are interested it is worth trying.</li>
