            <li>I am very happy.</li>
            <li>As it seems that Q-Tip has discontinued making wood stick swabs, this product is an excellent alternative.[[ASIN:</li>

            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought as many as I did because this brand is not so good!</li>
            <li>okay and 2 for the price is great for me,</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find the wood stick swabs on your site.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice for ear clearance.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that so many manufactureres are skimping on the cotton swab.  </li>
            <li>Too many of them break.  </li>
            <li>More times than not these break as I am using them -</li>
            <li>these are an ok substitute, the wood connector part cracks</li>
            <li>These are okay</li>
            <li>but many of the wood sticks break in the process of using.  </li>
            <li>Most</li>
            <li>I like wood quips so much better than the cardboard one.  </li>
            <li>I searched around to see who was selling what and relied mostly on reviews.</li>
            <li>I love wood sticks--they are really much more functional.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>I really love this wood stick.</li>
            <li>Wish the shafts were more robust and they used more cotton on the tips.</li>
            <li>these could have more cotton on the sticks  like swisspers brand is better, but</li>
            <li>Love them Love them Love them.  </li>
            <li>there ok  they break easily</li>
            <li>Love the wood sticks as opposed to the flexi ones, easy to use and they hold up with makeup well.</li>
            <li>I can actually clean my ears without the swab bending on me all the time!</li>
            <li>They refused to refund my full charge, even though the shipping error was theirs!  </li>
            <li>I will not order this brand of wood stick cotton swabs again because the sticks break so easily.  </li>
            <li>They break so easily.</li>
            <li>Some of the sticks are a bit more fragile than others, but for the price it was a great deal.  </li>
            <li>They are of good quality altho not as good as the long ago discontinued original Q-tip brand.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the original wood stick Q-tip, but it has just enough cotton on the swabe to be effective and not immdediately irritate the ear.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fine.</li>
            <li>These are a more than worthy substitute.</li>
            <li>Great wooden Q-tip type swabs.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I am happy that I could find the wooden sticks.</li>
            <li>Using them was a welcome memory - my biggest issue with Drugstore.com brand was the lack of cotton and not necessarily the quality of the wood sticks (although QTip brands had stronger sticks).</li>
            <li>Since Q-tips got rid of the wooden swabs, I&#x27;m happy these are on the market.</li>
            <li>more than pleased with these sturdy sticks that don&#x27;t bend so much.</li>
            <li>but overall, I&#x27;m happy with them as a replacement for the original QTip brand.</li>
            <li>how do you use cotton swabs to clean the ears</li>
            <li>If anyone finds a source for good quality wooden cotton swabs please let me know.</li>
            <li>It was good to find the wooden ones again.</li>
            <li>The price was much more reasonable than any others I have found.  </li>
            <li>Anyway - other than these defective problems, I do think these are great.  </li>
            <li>Other then that, they were a great find.</li>
            <li>but luckily I felt it in my fingers).  </li>
            <li>I do not know why someone cannot make an exact duplicate of the original.</li>
            <li>Of all the (limited and affordable) choices, this is the best I&#x27;ve found and would recommend them if you want wood stick swabs for personal use.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when he reported that he was totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reasonable cost and worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These may not be as sturdy as the old Q-tips with wood sticks, but they work so much better than anything else being offered right now.</li>
            <li>Other brands (and there aren&#x27;t many) are much better.</li>
            <li>I like the swabs with a wooden stick, but they break very easily</li>
            <li>The wood swabs are my favorite, hard to find but glad they were available here.</li>
            <li>First, I have rarely used one when the stick did not break.  </li>
            <li>Hubby loved the old wooden QTips, but they went out of production almost 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>It is very much inferior to the Q-Tip brand.  </li>
            <li>I stocked up because I am sure the Government will make them illegal in order to protect me from poking my own brain with them (which you can do just as easily with a cardboard one.)</li>
            <li>A little shorter but good padding.</li>
            <li>Definitely would love to see these on Amazon Prime versus pay more for shipping than the actual product!</li>
            <li>I would have rated these higher but the sticks seem to break a lot when using them.  </li>
            <li>Although they are priced significantly higher, I will opt for a &amp;#34;medical</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about time for me to order several more boxes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon Cox</li>
            <li>They were quick to rectify their error and the product was actually better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Thought I might get lucky and get the same kind of product that Johnson &amp; Johnson delivers with its wooden Q-Tips.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend and I love these - very soft and yet durable at the same time.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Royal Cotton Swabs for continuing to offer us a choice.  </li>
            <li>Where are real Q-tips when you need them?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the plastic or cardboard sticks, they bend too much.</li>
            <li>Who wants paper or plastic sticks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem with these swabs, the sticks are too light and break a lot.</li>
            <li>This is the very thing I am looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>grade&amp;#34; swab in the future, rather than these cheap things that do not deliver the quality and service that I need.</li>
            <li>For some reason, most American manufacturers have abandoned wood sticks except for medical applications.  </li>
            <li>The wood sticks are very thin and brake off easily, but they are better than the paper stick.</li>
            <li>The cotton swabs are as described in the advertising, and the price is very reasonable, especially when you consider the quantity and the price.  </li>
            <li>a little easy sometimes in your ear</li>
            <li>Second, if that doesn&#x27;t happen, there is not enough cotton on the sticks, but the easy breakage is enough for a one star.  </li>
            <li>it was early</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any of the old Q-tips left to compare to, but these definitely have a LOT more cotton than the past couple of wood-stick brands we have tried.</li>
            <li>My husband is VERY picky about his cotton swabs, after having used only the wooden Q-tip brand for years and years.</li>
            <li>An e-mail to the company was quickly answered and the missing products were received in two days time.  </li>
            <li>My order was quick to arrive but it only contained half of the products I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not for children&#x27;s use, and barely for adult use.</li>
            <li>Apparently Q-tips doesn&#x27;t make them anymore.  </li>
            <li>I also almost put one in my ear that didn&#x27;t have any cotton at all on one end - just bare, unbroken wood.  </li>
            <li>Now that you can no longer get wooden &amp;#34;Q-Tips&amp;#34; the others are too soft for the jobs I use them for.</li>
            <li>Miss the old wooden Q-tips.</li>
            <li>Hard to find wook cotton swabs that are strong enough.  </li>
            <li>These are preety good, but, I think the sticks are a little too thin, they seem to break while using them.</li>
            <li>Wooden Q-Tips are the best and when I found this brand less expensive than the Q-Tip Brand, I should have reasoned the quality would be less.  </li>
            <li>The sticks are a little shorter than typical, but the real problem is that there isn&#x27;t much cotton.  </li>

            <li> The sticks are a little shorter than typical, but the real problem is that there isn&#x27;t much cotton.  </li>
            <li> The sticks are stiff enough and the cotton is soft enough.</li>
            <li> The sticks are rough, full of splinters and wood shavings, and have multiple weak points where they often break during use.</li>
            <li> More than a few have broken close to tip, leaving a problem with recovery of the tip, often in close quarters.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands of wood stick cotton swabs that do not have such fragile, breakable wood.</li>
            <li> Only one in about ten doesn&#x27;t snap in half with only the gentlest of pressure.</li>
            <li> Hate the plastic/paper stick swabs that provide no leverage to get in there and do some good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break evenly, with a sharp edge, which is a worry about a possible injury.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty awful and you can actually tell that they are a cheap generic knock off.</li>
            <li> Serve the purpose, but the cotton tip could be fuller and the wood is pretty thin.</li>

            <li> My order was quick to arrive but it only contained half of the products I ordered.  An e-mail to the company was quickly answered and the missing products were received in two days time.  They were quick to rectify their error and the product was actually better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Cotton Swabs with wood sticks are hard to find.  Apparently Q-tips doesn&#x27;t make them anymore.  The flimsy plastic or cardboard sticks just don&#x27;t work as well as wood.  So.  Thanks to Royal Cotton Swabs for continuing to offer us a choice.  These may not be as sturdy as the old Q-tips with wood sticks, but they work so much better than anything else being offered right now. By the way, don&#x27;t buy them from Discount Cosmetic Outlet.  Their customer service is non-existent.  They shipped my order to the wrong address, then claimed I had moved, or else had no mailbox.  (Not true.)  I never received the order.  They refused to refund my full charge, even though the shipping error was theirs!  I reordered from Kendal&#x27;s Kloset (KT Treasures).  That&#x27;s the way to go!</li>
            <li> ....as the discontinued Q-tips wooden sticks. They&#x27;re not quiiite as padded...and a bit shorter...but they work...and I guess that&#x27;s all one can ask.  All in all, it&#x27;s a good product...and they were shipped in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001TY3EKO Royal Wood Stick Cotton Swabs 1 Box - 300 Count]]</li>
            <li> Great wooden Q-tip type swabs. I&#x27;m not very picky, just anything other the plastic Q-tips that tickle and leave ones ear in dire need of scratching. CVS was the last brick &#x27;n&#x27; mortal establishments to carry the wooden type. I picked up two packs of these and will not have to order any for years...</li>
            <li> Not very strong.  Too many of them break.  Need to improve on quality.  Would like to see stronger wood.  Delivery was fine.</li>
            <li> I like the swabs with a wooden stick, but they break very easily so you haveto be careful if you are cleaning your ears.</li>
            <li> I like these cotton swabs. The wood swabs are my favorite, hard to find but glad they were available here.</li>
            <li> Hate the plastic/paper stick swabs that provide no leverage to get in there and do some good cleaning.  Since Q-tips dropped their wood stick swabs and CVS quit carrying their house brand, finding these has been a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Thought I might get lucky and get the same kind of product that Johnson &amp; Johnson delivers with its wooden Q-Tips. I did not. More times than not these break as I am using them - IN MY EAR - so you need to be REALLY careful using these. I just can&#x27;t seem to find the J&amp;J ones anymore so I keep looking. I would not recommend these. They are pretty awful and you can actually tell that they are a cheap generic knock off. If anyone finds a source for good quality wooden cotton swabs please let me know.</li>
            <li> Try to find a wooden q-tip these days.  Virtually impossible!  If you prefer them (and I do) you may want to give these a try.</li>
            <li> i use to get the wooden swabs from CVS until they stopped selling them for some reason...these are an ok substitute, the wood connector part cracks a little easy sometimes in your ear...i have never hurt my ear...this will do until cvs gets it back as a product...</li>
            <li> Wooden Q-Tips are the best and when I found this brand less expensive than the Q-Tip Brand, I should have reasoned the quality would be less.  It is very much inferior to the Q-Tip brand.  The stick itself is skinnier and therefore not as strong but the biggest disappointment is the noticeably smaller tip with much less cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the few extra dollars on the Q-Tip brand if you want a quality product.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the original wood stick Q-tip, but it has just enough cotton on the swabe to be effective and not immdediately irritate the ear.  It is amazing that so many manufactureres are skimping on the cotton swab.  I do not know why someone cannot make an exact duplicate of the original.</li>
            <li> My husband is VERY picky about his cotton swabs, after having used only the wooden Q-tip brand for years and years. I was pleasantly surprised when he reported that he was totally satisfied with this product. The sticks are stiff enough and the cotton is soft enough. I don&#x27;t have any of the old Q-tips left to compare to, but these definitely have a LOT more cotton than the past couple of wood-stick brands we have tried. He&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy... and I am going to stock up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still give this product 3 stars on the assumption that I must have got a bad batch, considering the rest of the reviews are so positive.  I got these because I hate the \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; Q-tips that are so common now, but I&#x27;ve had at least 10 of these break with very light pressure.  Two broke off while in my ear (and I&#x27;m extremely delicate/careful with hardly any pressure at all), and one was deep enough that I couldn&#x27;t get it out.  My wife had to remove it with tweezers.  Yikes!  I also almost put one in my ear that didn&#x27;t have any cotton at all on one end - just bare, unbroken wood.  it was early and I was in a hurry, but luckily I felt it in my fingers).  Anyway - other than these defective problems, I do think these are great.  I&#x27;ll just be optimistic and assume I got a bad batch.  If you do buy them, though, be really careful if you use them for your ears!</li>
            <li> Yea wood!!! I can actually clean my ears without the swab bending on me all the time! These are wonderful. I stocked up because I am sure the Government will make them illegal in order to protect me from poking my own brain with them (which you can do just as easily with a cardboard one.) I am very happy. They are just a little brittle though.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product.  The wooden sticks are too thin and often break when used. Definitely not for children&#x27;s use, and barely for adult use. Where are real Q-tips when you need them? I WILL NOT be ordering these again!!!!</li>
            <li> I will not order this brand of wood stick cotton swabs again because the sticks break so easily.  I have used other brands of wood stick cotton swabs that do not have such fragile, breakable wood.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the wood stick swabs on your site. Hate!!!!! the ones with cardboard or plastic sticks.</li>
            <li> As it seems that Q-Tip has discontinued making wood stick swabs, this product is an excellent alternative.[[ASIN:B001TY3EKO Royal Wood Stick Cotton Swabs , 300 count]]</li>
            <li> you drive us nuts how do you use cotton swabs to clean the ears stop badering us enough is enough</li>
            <li> Hubby loved the old wooden QTips, but they went out of production almost 15 years ago. These are a more than worthy substitute.</li>
            <li> The cotton swabs are as described in the advertising, and the price is very reasonable, especially when you consider the quantity and the price.  Will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Hard to find wook cotton swabs that are strong enough.  These are okay but many of the wood sticks break in the process of using.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I searched for \\&quot;Q tips\\&quot; with wooden sticks. I don&#x27;t like the plastic or cardboard sticks, they bend too much. These are preety good, but, I think the sticks are a little too thin, they seem to break while using them. With that being said, I am happy that I could find the wooden sticks.</li>
            <li> Definitely would love to see these on Amazon Prime versus pay more for shipping than the actual product! My girlfriend and I love these - very soft and yet durable at the same time. Only complaint is occasionally you&#x27;ll get 2-3 per package that are weakened or broken in half.</li>
            <li> These are the great wood stick variety you remember. Who wants paper or plastic sticks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable cost and worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Cannot get this product anywhere in any drugstore that I&#x27;ve tried.  They are good.  Other Q-tips bend and do not answer the need.</li>
            <li> Serve the purpose, but the cotton tip could be fuller and the wood is pretty thin. Extra care must be taken to keep them from breaking.</li>
            <li> Had just about given up finding the wood-stick cotton swabs.  Most&lt;br /&gt;drug stores don&#x27;t carry anything but the plastic sticks.  Everyone will&lt;br /&gt;be more than pleased with these sturdy sticks that don&#x27;t bend so much.</li>
            <li> The wood sticks are very thin and brake off easily, but they are better than the paper stick.</li>
            <li> Very little cotton on the tip and thin sticks.  Other brands (and there aren&#x27;t many) are much better.</li>
            <li> You cannot find wooden stick qtips anywhere but finally found them here.  They are great.  Not flimsy like others have commented.</li>
            <li> I used to get these from Q-tips, then learned they were discontinued. I hate the plastic sticks. They break so easily. It was good to find the wooden ones again.</li>
            <li> Great product. The sticks are kinda weak sometimes and end up in a dreadful mid ear cleaning snap of the stick which I must say is alarming.</li>
            <li> This was a good find.  I only use WOOD stick Q-tips. The price was much more reasonable than any others I have found.  They are of good quality altho not as good as the long ago discontinued original Q-tip brand.</li>
            <li> Now that you can no longer get wooden &amp;#34;Q-Tips&amp;#34; the others are too soft for the jobs I use them for. The only problem with these swabs, the sticks are too light and break a lot. But the off set, if they used thick wood, the cost would be prohibitive. I will continue to use these, as they are the best on the market at a great price.</li>
            <li> I bemoan the fact that Q Tip stopped making the wood stick q tips.  If you are reading this review, you are a fan of the wood sticks, and understand that nothing else would do!  I was happy to find these, but what a disappointment!  First, I have rarely used one when the stick did not break.  It doesn&#x27;t break evenly, with a sharp edge, which is a worry about a possible injury.  Second, if that doesn&#x27;t happen, there is not enough cotton on the sticks, but the easy breakage is enough for a one star.  I won&#x27;t buy again.  The quest continues!</li>
            <li> I like wood quips so much better than the cardboard one.  I would have rated these higher but the sticks seem to break a lot when using them.  Sticks need to be stronger.</li>
            <li> The cotton tips are not attached some of the time.  They come off without warning.  The wood sticks are shorter than standard swabs.  The sticks are rough, full of splinters and wood shavings, and have multiple weak points where they often break during use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when QTips stopped selling wood-stick variety. I bought 10 boxes from Drugstore.com (their brand and it was a special) and was also disappointed with them, but it took years to use them up. Surprise! I reached the bottom of the pile and discovered I had hidden a box of Qtip BRAND at the bottom. Using them was a welcome memory - my biggest issue with Drugstore.com brand was the lack of cotton and not necessarily the quality of the wood sticks (although QTip brands had stronger sticks). I searched around to see who was selling what and relied mostly on reviews. This brand, Royal Cotton Swabs, Wood Sticks, are a welcome choice. No, the wood sticks aren&#x27;t as thick but I haven&#x27;t broken one since I started using them. There is slightly less cotton than the QTip brand (I wish they&#x27;re improve that!) but overall, I&#x27;m happy with them as a replacement for the original QTip brand. Of all the (limited and affordable) choices, this is the best I&#x27;ve found and would recommend them if you want wood stick swabs for personal use.</li>
            <li> Since Q-tips got rid of the wooden swabs, I&#x27;m happy these are on the market.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these. Only one in about ten doesn&#x27;t snap in half with only the gentlest of pressure. I thought it may have been a bad batch but both packs are of the same quality. Try drugstore.com for their brand.</li>
            <li> there ok  they break easily</li>
            <li> The sticks are a little shorter than typical, but the real problem is that there isn&#x27;t much cotton.  I love wood sticks--they are really much more functional.  But without sufficient cotton...  I wish Q-Tip was still making wood stick swabs.  Theirs were excellent.  I stocked up on these, and I&#x27;m very sorry I did.  I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> These are terrible! They break ALL THE TIME. I &amp;#60;mistakenly&amp;#62; purchased TWO packs, and now I am suffering through 600 uses. Seriously, buy something else.</li>
            <li> I really love this wood stick. This is the very thing I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice for ear clearance. I will buy it again no matter how expensive it will be.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. I assumed that the sticks were made in the USA or Canada.&lt;br /&gt;The sticks are sometimes cracked and splintered. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Miss the old wooden Q-tips. These are close alternative. Wish the shafts were more robust and they used more cotton on the tips. Other then that, they were a great find.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought as many as I did because this brand is not so good! They break constantly! I think they use inferior wood!</li>
            <li> received with both packages opened and swabs spread all over the packing box. Swabs not useable and thrown away.</li>
            <li> Love the wood sticks as opposed to the flexi ones, easy to use and they hold up with makeup well. these could have more cotton on the sticks  like swisspers brand is better, but okay and 2 for the price is great for me,</li>
            <li> I have used this type product for years and years but &#x27;Big Brother&#x27; has decided that I am not qualified to use a swab, with a wooden stick to do anything with!!!  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Product is very weak and wooden sticks tend to break. Order it if you want a wooden stick Q-tip but do not mistake it for a Q-tip product.</li>
            <li> sticks are thin as are the swabs.  However, good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I prefer stability provided by wooden sticks over plastic tubes or paper sticks.  These were way worse, about 50% of the sticks break with ordinary pressure that wouldn&#x27;t affect a paper stick.  More than a few have broken close to tip, leaving a problem with recovery of the tip, often in close quarters.  Also there does seem to be less cotton on the tips than other swabs, so they don&#x27;t hold the same amount of paint, glue or cleaner as the regular swabs. For some reason, most American manufacturers have abandoned wood sticks except for medical applications.  Although they are priced significantly higher, I will opt for a &amp;#34;medical grade&amp;#34; swab in the future, rather than these cheap things that do not deliver the quality and service that I need.</li>
            <li> I like the wooden handle cotton swabs, hard to find these days.  Some of the sticks are a bit more fragile than others, but for the price it was a great deal.  Shipped to me in a timely manner, no problems with the order.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found the wooden cotton swab sticks.  I grew up using the wooden ones and slowly they became harder and harder to find, till one day I couldn&#x27;t find them at all.  I just went crazy when I found these.  I bought some for my mother, my sister, my girlfriend, and my daughters.  Love them Love them Love them.  Please don&#x27;t quit making them cause it&#x27;s about time for me to order several more boxes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon Cox</li>
            <li> These swabs are just as good ad the originals. A little shorter but good padding. Don&#x27;t bend...just do their job</li>
