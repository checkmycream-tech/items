            <li>I waited to review this product in an effort to really test how well it bonds.  </li>
            <li>my skills are not up to par, however I&#x27;ve really been trying to stay away from the nail salons, which were costing me a bundle.  </li>
            <li>Im happy with this product its not the bootleg ones that smell like viniger if u are looking for a nail primer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not a good primer. Have to use alot and it burns</li>
            <li> Works great. Nails stay on for 2 weeks some even longer!</li>
            <li> A must have item, when it is applied. Nails will never lift. I have been a nail tech for over 20 years. It is well worth the money</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003B6K01O No Lift Nail Primer .75oz]]I had been using primer from Sallys and the acrylic would start lifting the next day, so far, after using no lift nail primer, They still have not lifted after w week!!!</li>
            <li> Love this primer along with Tammy taylor. Works about the same</li>
            <li> love it! helps my kiss acrylic (i dont use fake nails just overlay my nails with acrylic) not lift at all!</li>
            <li> Received it within shipping time frame, applied it but had lifting within two days, just started doing my own acrylics so I got what was paid for, happy it&#x27;s available to ship to APO addresses though.</li>
            <li> Ive only been able to use this twice. Im not sure it&#x27;s the same product I used 5 years ago. I love No Lift but I think they may have changed their formula a bit. It just doesnt seem to hold the way it used to. Nonetheless, I am still a faithful No Lift customer! :-D</li>
            <li> I Live in a small town in Utah where it is difficult to get the great item I know will work without difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;This is the number one primer  choose every time. Great delivery speed, great packaging. No trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of this product for quite some time and have found that it is easy to use and works the same each time.  I will continue to use the No Lift brand, and the primer is a must for the nail product.</li>
            <li> Does not actually prevent, or even seem to inhibit, lifting. I used this product with gel polish applied to natural nails and acrylic nails applied to natural nails, and it did have any discernible affect. I think it actually performed worse than the standard primers available at drug stores.</li>
            <li> i love this primer workers great and the price was half of what they will charge u in the stores. It got to my house fast .i will buy this item again from here when needed.</li>
            <li> good primer,i still have some lifting though but less than I do with most ..I will keep purchasing this,will use again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Like.. I watched videos on this product and the reviews seemed to be okay so I ordered. I followed all directions and still got lifting within 3 days. I sent it back and went to Sally and bought another brand.</li>
            <li> to get strong and no lift patch on your nail1 ecellent primer for a strong and marvellouse manicure that last!</li>
            <li> I use the quality acrylic powder and seen good reviews about this primer but my nails only adhered for about a week..</li>
            <li> This stuff sure stinks but it works great!!</li>
            <li> G-Damn! This is good stuff. it&#x27;ll burn your eyes off if you get too close to it - don&#x27;t inhale unless you&#x27;re into that sort of thing. Excellent product, #1 if non-lifting nail applications is your game.</li>
            <li> This stuff is &amp;#34;Awesome&amp;#34; !. My nails were always lifting and my job is very hard on them. Since using &amp;#34;no-lift&amp;#34; no more problems!</li>

It&#x27;s a little pricey, but suffice it to say that this primer is worth every penny.  I have had absolutely NO LIFTING and I&#x27;ve had my acrylic nails on for four weeks!  I am really tough on my nails, banging on my computer keys, washing the dog, not to mention the numerous polish changes, so I&#x27;ve really put this primer through the ringer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer smells really strong, so be prepared.  I was not confident about putting this product on my nails, but I did my homework, and found that this was the best primer for me.  It really works!</li>
            <li> i am a nail tech and this didnt have luck with this product at all. i was disappointed at how quickly there was lifting on my clients nails...less than a week!</li>
            <li> Im happy with this product its not the bootleg ones that smell like viniger if u are looking for a nail primer this is the one</li>
            <li> This is my old standby primer.  Always works. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR AMATEURS TO USE</li>
            <li> smelly but it dries the surface of the nail.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work pretty well but it has an awful stench. A tiny little bottle makes the entire upstairs of my house smell foul. And it lingers.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it under my gelish polish, it extended my wear an extra week! It works really great. Highly recommend. And although it seems a little spendy, it will last forever!</li>
            <li> Works great. No complaints. Product as advertised.  Came in timely manner and works wonderfully.  I like the little brush that it comes with - It helps you be sure that just the right amount of primer is applied.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great investment!  The smell is not too strong and the name speaks for itself!  One useful tip is apply 1 coat let it dry then apply 2nd coat and then ur acrylic it gel while 2nd coat of primer is still wet</li>
            <li> this nail primer didn&#x27;t do its job. the formula seems to be different because this once was some good stuff. however my nail began to lift around the edges and It was not a pretty sight. Also this is lifting that I experienced immediately not due to needing a fill in.</li>
            <li> This is an ok nail primer for acrylic nails. Following prep I still noticed a tiny bit of lifting, this will burn your skin, so be cautious when applying it. I prefer Organic Nails Protein Bonder.</li>
