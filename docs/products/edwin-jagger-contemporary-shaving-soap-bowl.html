            <li>Love it, its perfect cup to build up a good lather with by best badger, Not a big fan of the Edwins brushes but I&#x27;am of this bowl.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s size perfect as it fits in the palm of your hand perfectly, and offers a robust bottom for easy lathering.</li>
            <li>Nice looking item but</li>
            <li>so it sits nice on the sink cabinet when I work up lather.</li>
            <li>It lathered well and kept the lather really warm.</li>
            <li>It is a nice bowl.</li>
            <li>Lmao.</li>
            <li>I had an Edwin Jagger porcelain shaving bowl that I very much liked.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the seller would give dimensions in the listing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Nice looking bowl, matches my chrome shaving stand and Edwin Jagger razor.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice bowl.  </li>
            <li>I suppose everyone has their own preferences.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that everything I love about this bowl could be reason for others to dislike it, but it is a wonderfully made product that serves its purpose precisely.  </li>
            <li>That said, it is a nice looking piece of work.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaving bowl, though it couldbe .5&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Honestly, I feel like this should be one star.  </li>
            <li>Well made and has a nice weight</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks nice when not in use, though you could just use a coffee mug...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any problem whipping up a nice lather in this bowl.</li>
            <li>Since its metal, I can warm it up in the sink so my shaving cream is warm.  </li>
            <li>The bowl is nice looking and works well in creating a lather for shaving.</li>
            <li>Nice looking shave bowl</li>
            <li>It was a really nice piece that I added to my shave collection.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice piece</li>
            <li>As with all Edwin Jagger products the fit and finish are impeccable.</li>
            <li>, if you want a beautiful chromed metallic bowl for your shaving soap, you&#x27;ve come to the right place, but, if like me, you want a lathering bowl, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it looks good and is easy to cradle in one hand.  </li>
            <li>The lather slips out of the bowl very easily.</li>
            <li>, I was able to make very good lather in this bowl without the lather spilling over the sides too much.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I am able to build good lather quickly and neatly.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful and high quality item.</li>
            <li>I do like this shave bowl, more so than a ceramic mug because I don&#x27;t feel like I will chip my tile if I drop it.    </li>
            <li>I have usedit for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li>I just love the way it looks and just incredible&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>But there are way more nicer containers out there for ur shaving cream or SOAP to go in.</li>
            <li>After I dropped it and broke it, I decided I should replace it with something more durable.    </li>
            <li>I am pleased with my shaving bowl selection.  </li>
            <li>I love the compact size.  </li>
            <li>Men love SMOs (shiny metal</li>
            <li>A luxury for sure</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the perfect size for creating a lather that I use for 4 applications of later.</li>
            <li>Once my technique got better</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many months.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the chrome finish adds an elegant, timeless touch to your shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>Not too much more to say.  </li>
            <li>I actually love the bowl and it complements my chrome DE89L</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The metal construct is also more robust to drops than porcelain alternatives.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to pick this bowl up from Amazon with the [[ASIN:B000G647Y8</li>
            <li>But I think it could have been better priced.</li>
            <li>someone who makes more than one pass, suggest getting a deeper bowl.</li>
            <li>More than 6 months and</li>
            <li>It does require a bit more practice to make sure lather doesn&#x27;t go all over the place.</li>
            <li>but I can tell for sure that it does NOT match the color and finish of my Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
            <li>This bowl is the perfect size for smaller shave soaps - say about the size of a silver dollar.</li>
            <li>Nice bowl and the smaller size was good for me!</li>
            <li>Very good quality, should last forever.</li>
            <li>, container fits perfectly into the bowel and takes minimal space on the shower shelf.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly in the palm of my hand and offers just enough space to get a good shave cream lather.  </li>
            <li>The bowl is the perfect size for me, allowing me to hold it in the palm of one hand and use the shaving brush with the other hand.</li>
            <li>Cool!</li>
            <li>The lather goes over the edge fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>It holds my [insert shaving brush name here] without tipping over, and I can build lather very quickly in it.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li>I am still very happy right size to fit next to my sink with my badger brush.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s fine, but if you have a full-sized badger brush, you&#x27;ll find the soap going over the rim</li>
            <li>I use Proraso shaving cream from the tube, and it foams easily and comfortably in this bowl.  </li>
            <li>I found this shaving bowl to be the perfect companion for my Jack Black shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, is easy to hold in your palm and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It is the right size and being stainless cleans up easily and stays bright.</li>
            <li>This would also make an excellent travel bowl, as it is light, and takes up little room in a toiletries bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before you make this purchase consider purchasing a stainless steal cat drinking bowl (they have a nice shine).</li>
            <li>Great, durable metal bowl that&#x27;s made to last.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Now a few months in, this bowl can best be explained as a \\&quot;palette\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Attractive and sturdy, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean though.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome...&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a great site for further shaving tips:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This bowl was not intended for puck style soaps--they just don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I received it today and it&#x27;s very well made with a nice finish.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice bowl if only one could find a shaving soap that would fit in it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, right size.</li>
            <li>Bowl looks very nice, and seems like it will last forever.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>It is small but fits just perfect in my hand.</li>
            <li>Plus, its a nice chrome so cleans very nicely and soap scum doesn&#x27;t build up on it.</li>
            <li>Gave it away, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Bowl is a little smaller than anticipated, but still looks great and work great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to fill the whole sink though and need something more.</li>
            <li>It does the job and looks cool.  </li>
            <li>the chrome finish shrugs off water so it looks just as good 3 months later as it did the day</li>
            <li>Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li>But not bad works for now</li>
            <li>I like the shape and size of this bowl, perfect for my use, though it is a pretty small bowl.  </li>
            <li>This bowl is sharp and looks very nice in our bathroom.</li>
            <li>It would be even more useful if it were a touch larger, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>the shape is the main thing I don&#x27;t like, it wants to tip over very easily.</li>
            <li>Small but beautiful.</li>
            <li>This bole is nice, size is enough for my EJ brush.</li>
            <li>I use a standard size brush, which is able to sit in the bowl without tipping it, which is important to me as well.  </li>
            <li>bowl feels solid, ideally weighted and overall</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to keep it for any future shaving soaps I have, as I feel it would come in handy.</li>
            <li>Nice solid metal bowl.</li>
            <li>This bowl looks nice next to my shaving stand.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product for a more modern yet classically inclined shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is something which i bought just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li>(right amount of soap, water and wetness of the brush)</li>
            <li>Just the right size for a shave soap bar.</li>
            <li>It is definitely smaller than most traditional shaving mugs, but it is more than adequate to mix a luscious lather to start your manly day!  </li>
            <li>It has a great chrome luster on the outside, and a fine brushed stainless pattern on the inside.</li>
            <li>It has nothing special on its construction, to be honest y paid for the logo on the bowls to match with mi other shaving pieces.</li>
            <li>Fit and Finish is great, however, the bowl is smaller than I expected and what the picture depicts.</li>
            <li>Too small to use with a full size brush and get a good lather.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice looking, well crafted small bowl.  </li>
            <li>Be sure and read all of the other fine reviews for safety razor shaving items on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The shaving cream I use by Lab Series doesn&#x27;t lather up like I want, but I&#x27;m sure other soap will do fine.  </li>
            <li>A good 80% of any lather created will just roll out of the bowl and create a ginormous mess.</li>
            <li>Good little bowl that fits in the palm of my hands and</li>
            <li>If ur wealthy n can afford to ridiculous amounts of $$ on products not worth it than this is perfect for u.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also finding myself always getting more shave cream on the rim of the bowl; so I have to constantly scrap it back into the bottom to get more lather.</li>
            <li>I like to soak my brush in with my soap in STEAMY HOT water for 15 or 30 seconds before I work up my lather.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking of purchasing it and returning it if does not suit your needs be aware that Amazon will not accept returns on this item since it is a health and hygiene item.</li>
            <li>This shaving bowl from Edwin Jagger is pretty much exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will purchase one that is more like a mug</li>
            <li>i wouldnt pay $5 for what this thing really looks like when you get it!</li>
            <li>I float it in hot water as I prepare my blade so as to heat the lather produced within.  </li>
            <li>but, it looks nice on the counter with my other items.</li>
            <li>Nice if you don&#x27;t need a ton of lather and so far it suits me but definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li>Overall, solid bowl, good materials</li>
            <li>This chrome-finished bowl by EJ allows a wet shaver to mix an awesome lather while minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency.  </li>
            <li>I saw other reviews complaining that they couldn&#x27;t fit their soap pucks in it, but for cream it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I made a mistake, I bought this because I was mesmerized by the photo and the positive reviews, but this is not what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I hope to be able to use this for long time</li>
            <li>It is a handsome shaving soap bowl, but it is a bit small to lather my badger brush comfortably.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to the neat, quick lather building it offers me.</li>
            <li>A centimeter wider and a centimeter deeper would certainly help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid bowl and works fine, but with my brush it is always getting stuff around the edges and slopping out when I try to build up a lather.  </li>
            <li>it does seems a little small at first, but it works perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li>Use it every time I shave really like it</li>
            <li>Looks like the real deal with my stainless steal set.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this bowl.  </li>
            <li>You really have to experiment with your soaps, creams, and or brushes to build the lather.</li>
            <li>it and plus the price is reasonable as well</li>
            <li>The bowl needs to be deeper and/or have a much wider rim in order to hold the lather.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very practical, so much so that I have now switched to using it daily rather than a larger bowl from Parker that I also own:</li>
            <li>; I can have heated soap ready for when I shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I can really test out this bowl.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and will not take up much room in your luggage.</li>
            <li>well it will spill over if you lather too much.</li>
            <li>not wasting much space in my counter.</li>
            <li>The bowl is beautifully crafted but it is impossibly small; about the size of my palm and 1.5\\&quot; deep.</li>
            <li>I have no problem whipping up enough lather for a three-pass shave in this bowl, it fits nicely in the palm of the hand, and I would probably give it a five-star rating if only it were perhaps a quarter to a half-inch deeper.  </li>
            <li>Good, but in a cold environment I think that pottery would hold the warmth better.</li>
            <li>My first brush is apparently just the right size for it.</li>
            <li>That must be worth ten bucks right there /(sarc)...</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other options out there that are both better designed and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Not sure why I paid so much for a small stainles steal bowl, but it fits perfectly in my hand when making up lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a sharp looking bowl! : )</li>
            <li>Very dissapointing considering this is brand new.</li>
            <li>Jagger Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl</li>
            <li>They work just the same as a shave bowl if you have a round soap bar, fits perfect for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Note many reviewers complained about this, but larger shave soaps are meant to be transferred to the bowl for mixing, or cut and melted to fit.</li>
            <li>This bowl isn&#x27;t deep enough for my brush to get thoroughly soaked (and warm in the middle).    </li>
            <li>If it were a few bucks cheaper this would be 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>Nice thick nickel-stainless.</li>
            <li>You will easily pay double for a bowl a fraction larger.</li>
            <li>Nice bowl, just wish it were a little bigger.</li>
            <li>Will be getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li>Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New...</li>
            <li>The chrome job seems dull sitting next to my shaving stand but still good looking.</li>
            <li>Very classy look on the counter as well.  </li>
            <li>as MANY have said, it&#x27;s a bit small.</li>
            <li>Many people said this bowl was small, which they are correct to say, but it still gets the job done and with style.</li>
            <li>but this bowl is a great shape but just a little small (doesnt seem to accomodate all my lather while</li>
            <li>I have read that some shaving soap bowls have little grooves or notches to help mix up the soap, and while this EJ lacks the grooves, it still seems to do a fine job.  </li>
            <li>For those of you worried about the dimensions, it measures about 3 and a half inches from the inside lip of the top, and is about two inches deep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4 out of 5 Stars... A little larger works better.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in the quality of the item, and this will definently influence me to avoid this company when possible.</li>
            <li>well, the chrome has not worn off and it does not stain thus far.</li>
            <li>I can work (carefully) with it or use it in the shower without worries (on the rare occasion that I shave in the shower), but</li>
            <li>Other reviews state the item is small, but for the price the size is just right and to my experience I am able to lather easily using shaving creams (maybe the bowl is too small if using soaps).</li>
            <li>This is a fine, small bowl for building lather with a natural shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>At first I feared it was a bit small, but after the first use I was hooked on it.  </li>
            <li>Sweet little bowl.</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge&lt;br /&gt;Proraso</li>
            <li>A wonderfully useful little bowl.</li>
            <li>My main complaints are that the bowl is tiny, just tiny.  </li>
            <li>As it is now, you do need to exercise some restraint in whipping up your lather lest you whip it right over the lip of the bowl and make a mess.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice but is a little small.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid this bowl might be too small, but I find it&#x27;s a perfect size for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s shiny, and it&#x27;s small enough to be portable, but still usable.</li>
            <li>Light, solid, unbreakeble, small.</li>
            <li>BUT, as far as shave bowls/mugs go, I definitely know now that I prefer a deeper bowl.  </li>
            <li>I ended up going back to an old mug of mine.</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to get the foam right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you want the Jagger name in little text on the outside of your bowl that&#x27;s cool big money.</li>
            <li>Small and compact to fit into a travel case (toiletry bag), only makes enough foam for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is advertised as being 4\\&quot; in diameter but the widest interior dimension is less than 3.5\\&quot;, which makes it just too small for my favourite soap and most others that I have seen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough that you can really work the brush into the soap, but small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the sink.</li>
            <li>The bowl IS WAY TOO SMALL to be useful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>&#x27;s go over the good &amp; bad points:&lt;br</li>

            <li> Good feeling in hands, nicely crafted, enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Love it, its perfect cup to build up a good lather with by best badger, Not a big fan of the Edwins brushes but I&#x27;am of this bowl.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s size perfect as it fits in the palm of your hand perfectly, and offers a robust bottom for easy lathering.</li>
            <li> Nice looking item but</li>
            <li> so it sits nice on the sink cabinet when I work up lather.</li>
            <li> It lathered well and kept the lather really warm.</li>
            <li> It is a nice bowl.</li>
            <li> Lmao.</li>
            <li> I had an Edwin Jagger porcelain shaving bowl that I very much liked.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if the seller would give dimensions in the listing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Nice looking bowl, matches my chrome shaving stand and Edwin Jagger razor.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice bowl.  </li>
            <li> I suppose everyone has their own preferences.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that everything I love about this bowl could be reason for others to dislike it, but it is a wonderfully made product that serves its purpose precisely.  </li>
            <li> That said, it is a nice looking piece of work.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaving bowl, though it couldbe .5&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Honestly, I feel like this should be one star.  </li>
            <li> Well made and has a nice weight</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks nice when not in use, though you could just use a coffee mug...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problem whipping up a nice lather in this bowl.</li>
            <li> Since its metal, I can warm it up in the sink so my shaving cream is warm.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is nice looking and works well in creating a lather for shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice looking shave bowl</li>
            <li> It was a really nice piece that I added to my shave collection.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice piece</li>
            <li> As with all Edwin Jagger products the fit and finish are impeccable.</li>
            <li> , if you want a beautiful chromed metallic bowl for your shaving soap, you&#x27;ve come to the right place, but, if like me, you want a lathering bowl, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it looks good and is easy to cradle in one hand.  </li>
            <li> The lather slips out of the bowl very easily.</li>
            <li> , I was able to make very good lather in this bowl without the lather spilling over the sides too much.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am able to build good lather quickly and neatly.  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and high quality item.</li>
            <li> I do like this shave bowl, more so than a ceramic mug because I don&#x27;t feel like I will chip my tile if I drop it.    </li>
            <li> I have usedit for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it looks and just incredible&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> But there are way more nicer containers out there for ur shaving cream or SOAP to go in.</li>
            <li> After I dropped it and broke it, I decided I should replace it with something more durable.    </li>
            <li> I am pleased with my shaving bowl selection.  </li>
            <li> I love the compact size.  </li>
            <li> Men love SMOs (shiny metal</li>
            <li> A luxury for sure</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the perfect size for creating a lather that I use for 4 applications of later.</li>
            <li> Once my technique got better</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many months.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the chrome finish adds an elegant, timeless touch to your shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> Not too much more to say.  </li>
            <li> I actually love the bowl and it complements my chrome DE89L</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The metal construct is also more robust to drops than porcelain alternatives.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to pick this bowl up from Amazon with the [[ASIN:B000G647Y8</li>
            <li> But I think it could have been better priced.</li>
            <li> someone who makes more than one pass, suggest getting a deeper bowl.</li>
            <li> More than 6 months and</li>
            <li> It does require a bit more practice to make sure lather doesn&#x27;t go all over the place.</li>
            <li> but I can tell for sure that it does NOT match the color and finish of my Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
            <li> This bowl is the perfect size for smaller shave soaps - say about the size of a silver dollar.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl and the smaller size was good for me!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, should last forever.</li>
            <li> , container fits perfectly into the bowel and takes minimal space on the shower shelf.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly in the palm of my hand and offers just enough space to get a good shave cream lather.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is the perfect size for me, allowing me to hold it in the palm of one hand and use the shaving brush with the other hand.</li>
            <li> Cool!</li>
            <li> The lather goes over the edge fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> It holds my [insert shaving brush name here] without tipping over, and I can build lather very quickly in it.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li> I am still very happy right size to fit next to my sink with my badger brush.</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s fine, but if you have a full-sized badger brush, you&#x27;ll find the soap going over the rim</li>
            <li> I use Proraso shaving cream from the tube, and it foams easily and comfortably in this bowl.  </li>
            <li> I found this shaving bowl to be the perfect companion for my Jack Black shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, is easy to hold in your palm and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It is the right size and being stainless cleans up easily and stays bright.</li>
            <li> This would also make an excellent travel bowl, as it is light, and takes up little room in a toiletries bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before you make this purchase consider purchasing a stainless steal cat drinking bowl (they have a nice shine).</li>
            <li> Great, durable metal bowl that&#x27;s made to last.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Now a few months in, this bowl can best be explained as a \\&quot;palette\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Attractive and sturdy, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean though.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome...&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a great site for further shaving tips:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This bowl was not intended for puck style soaps--they just don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I received it today and it&#x27;s very well made with a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice bowl if only one could find a shaving soap that would fit in it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, right size.</li>
            <li> Bowl looks very nice, and seems like it will last forever.  </li>
            <li> I was excited when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> It is small but fits just perfect in my hand.</li>
            <li> Plus, its a nice chrome so cleans very nicely and soap scum doesn&#x27;t build up on it.</li>
            <li> Gave it away, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Bowl is a little smaller than anticipated, but still looks great and work great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to fill the whole sink though and need something more.</li>
            <li> It does the job and looks cool.  </li>
            <li> the chrome finish shrugs off water so it looks just as good 3 months later as it did the day</li>
            <li> Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li> But not bad works for now</li>
            <li> I like the shape and size of this bowl, perfect for my use, though it is a pretty small bowl.  </li>
            <li> This bowl is sharp and looks very nice in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> It would be even more useful if it were a touch larger, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> the shape is the main thing I don&#x27;t like, it wants to tip over very easily.</li>
            <li> Small but beautiful.</li>
            <li> This bole is nice, size is enough for my EJ brush.</li>
            <li> I use a standard size brush, which is able to sit in the bowl without tipping it, which is important to me as well.  </li>
            <li> bowl feels solid, ideally weighted and overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to keep it for any future shaving soaps I have, as I feel it would come in handy.</li>
            <li> Nice solid metal bowl.</li>
            <li> This bowl looks nice next to my shaving stand.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product for a more modern yet classically inclined shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is something which i bought just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li> (right amount of soap, water and wetness of the brush)</li>
            <li> Just the right size for a shave soap bar.</li>
            <li> It is definitely smaller than most traditional shaving mugs, but it is more than adequate to mix a luscious lather to start your manly day!  </li>
            <li> It has a great chrome luster on the outside, and a fine brushed stainless pattern on the inside.</li>
            <li> It has nothing special on its construction, to be honest y paid for the logo on the bowls to match with mi other shaving pieces.</li>
            <li> Fit and Finish is great, however, the bowl is smaller than I expected and what the picture depicts.</li>
            <li> Too small to use with a full size brush and get a good lather.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking, well crafted small bowl.  </li>
            <li> Be sure and read all of the other fine reviews for safety razor shaving items on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream I use by Lab Series doesn&#x27;t lather up like I want, but I&#x27;m sure other soap will do fine.  </li>
            <li> A good 80% of any lather created will just roll out of the bowl and create a ginormous mess.</li>
            <li> Good little bowl that fits in the palm of my hands and</li>
            <li> If ur wealthy n can afford to ridiculous amounts of $$ on products not worth it than this is perfect for u.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also finding myself always getting more shave cream on the rim of the bowl; so I have to constantly scrap it back into the bottom to get more lather.</li>
            <li> I like to soak my brush in with my soap in STEAMY HOT water for 15 or 30 seconds before I work up my lather.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing it and returning it if does not suit your needs be aware that Amazon will not accept returns on this item since it is a health and hygiene item.</li>
            <li> This shaving bowl from Edwin Jagger is pretty much exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will purchase one that is more like a mug</li>
            <li> i wouldnt pay $5 for what this thing really looks like when you get it!</li>
            <li> I float it in hot water as I prepare my blade so as to heat the lather produced within.  </li>
            <li> but, it looks nice on the counter with my other items.</li>
            <li> Nice if you don&#x27;t need a ton of lather and so far it suits me but definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Overall, solid bowl, good materials</li>
            <li> This chrome-finished bowl by EJ allows a wet shaver to mix an awesome lather while minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency.  </li>
            <li> I saw other reviews complaining that they couldn&#x27;t fit their soap pucks in it, but for cream it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I made a mistake, I bought this because I was mesmerized by the photo and the positive reviews, but this is not what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I hope to be able to use this for long time</li>
            <li> It is a handsome shaving soap bowl, but it is a bit small to lather my badger brush comfortably.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to the neat, quick lather building it offers me.</li>
            <li> A centimeter wider and a centimeter deeper would certainly help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid bowl and works fine, but with my brush it is always getting stuff around the edges and slopping out when I try to build up a lather.  </li>
            <li> it does seems a little small at first, but it works perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li> Use it every time I shave really like it</li>
            <li> Looks like the real deal with my stainless steal set.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this bowl.  </li>
            <li> You really have to experiment with your soaps, creams, and or brushes to build the lather.</li>
            <li> it and plus the price is reasonable as well</li>
            <li> The bowl needs to be deeper and/or have a much wider rim in order to hold the lather.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very practical, so much so that I have now switched to using it daily rather than a larger bowl from Parker that I also own:</li>
            <li> ; I can have heated soap ready for when I shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I can really test out this bowl.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and will not take up much room in your luggage.</li>
            <li> well it will spill over if you lather too much.</li>
            <li> not wasting much space in my counter.</li>
            <li> The bowl is beautifully crafted but it is impossibly small; about the size of my palm and 1.5\\&quot; deep.</li>
            <li> I have no problem whipping up enough lather for a three-pass shave in this bowl, it fits nicely in the palm of the hand, and I would probably give it a five-star rating if only it were perhaps a quarter to a half-inch deeper.  </li>
            <li> Good, but in a cold environment I think that pottery would hold the warmth better.</li>
            <li> My first brush is apparently just the right size for it.</li>
            <li> That must be worth ten bucks right there /(sarc)...</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other options out there that are both better designed and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I paid so much for a small stainles steal bowl, but it fits perfectly in my hand when making up lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a sharp looking bowl! : )</li>
            <li> Very dissapointing considering this is brand new.</li>
            <li> Jagger Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl</li>
            <li> They work just the same as a shave bowl if you have a round soap bar, fits perfect for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note many reviewers complained about this, but larger shave soaps are meant to be transferred to the bowl for mixing, or cut and melted to fit.</li>
            <li> This bowl isn&#x27;t deep enough for my brush to get thoroughly soaked (and warm in the middle).    </li>
            <li> If it were a few bucks cheaper this would be 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> Nice thick nickel-stainless.</li>
            <li> You will easily pay double for a bowl a fraction larger.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, just wish it were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Will be getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li> Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New...</li>
            <li> The chrome job seems dull sitting next to my shaving stand but still good looking.</li>
            <li> Very classy look on the counter as well.  </li>
            <li> as MANY have said, it&#x27;s a bit small.</li>
            <li> Many people said this bowl was small, which they are correct to say, but it still gets the job done and with style.</li>
            <li> but this bowl is a great shape but just a little small (doesnt seem to accomodate all my lather while</li>
            <li> I have read that some shaving soap bowls have little grooves or notches to help mix up the soap, and while this EJ lacks the grooves, it still seems to do a fine job.  </li>
            <li> For those of you worried about the dimensions, it measures about 3 and a half inches from the inside lip of the top, and is about two inches deep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 out of 5 Stars... A little larger works better.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in the quality of the item, and this will definently influence me to avoid this company when possible.</li>
            <li> well, the chrome has not worn off and it does not stain thus far.</li>
            <li> I can work (carefully) with it or use it in the shower without worries (on the rare occasion that I shave in the shower), but</li>
            <li> Other reviews state the item is small, but for the price the size is just right and to my experience I am able to lather easily using shaving creams (maybe the bowl is too small if using soaps).</li>
            <li> This is a fine, small bowl for building lather with a natural shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> At first I feared it was a bit small, but after the first use I was hooked on it.  </li>
            <li> Sweet little bowl.</li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge&lt;br /&gt;Proraso</li>
            <li> A wonderfully useful little bowl.</li>
            <li> My main complaints are that the bowl is tiny, just tiny.  </li>
            <li> As it is now, you do need to exercise some restraint in whipping up your lather lest you whip it right over the lip of the bowl and make a mess.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice but is a little small.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid this bowl might be too small, but I find it&#x27;s a perfect size for my purpose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s shiny, and it&#x27;s small enough to be portable, but still usable.</li>
            <li> Light, solid, unbreakeble, small.</li>
            <li> BUT, as far as shave bowls/mugs go, I definitely know now that I prefer a deeper bowl.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going back to an old mug of mine.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get the foam right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you want the Jagger name in little text on the outside of your bowl that&#x27;s cool big money.</li>
            <li> Small and compact to fit into a travel case (toiletry bag), only makes enough foam for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is advertised as being 4\\&quot; in diameter but the widest interior dimension is less than 3.5\\&quot;, which makes it just too small for my favourite soap and most others that I have seen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough that you can really work the brush into the soap, but small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the sink.</li>
            <li> The bowl IS WAY TOO SMALL to be useful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> &#x27;s go over the good &amp; bad points:&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I feel the price is a little too high for the size.  </li>
            <li> My only qualm with it is the fact it is far too shallow to create any sort of decent lather.</li>
            <li> ; h, and not counting the lip on the bowl its only 3.25&amp;#34; w. Too small for a decent shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> I personally like how well it cleans up with a dry cloth.</li>
            <li> May Vary... as you&#x27;ve seen on countless wet shaving forums regarding various products.</li>
            <li> The description says that it is 4\\&quot; wide but it is only 3 3/4 inches OUTSIDE diameter including the lip.</li>
            <li> The price is way to high, its just small cup with Edwin Jagger printed on it.</li>
            <li> The bowl is 3-3/4\\&quot; wide and 1-1/2\\&quot; deep.</li>
            <li> The lip is only 1/4\\&quot; wide.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected,</li>
            <li> I expected the chrome plating to be the same quality</li>
            <li> I am not certain that this is actually chrome plated</li>
            <li> It is very thin walled and light.  </li>
            <li> if you really like to whip up a serious lather...</li>
            <li> After i opened the box, I was really surprised on how small the bowl was.  </li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that it is a tiny bit smaller than you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with the bowl, it looks like it kinda changed tint after I first used it.</li>
            <li> This is a small bowl, as you can see from the pictures, but it is big enough for its intended use.  </li>
            <li> a few times it&#x27;s really too small.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
            <li> Not much room to work with.  </li>
            <li> Bowl is as expected.  </li>
            <li> As a few others have stated, the bowl is just a bit on the small side for my preferences, using a normal sized badger brush and Proraso in a tube it tends to bubble over the edges a bit.</li>
            <li> I lather directly to the face now for thick lather.  </li>
            <li> Bowl is too small for properly preparing shaving soap, the lather would leak over the sides rather than stay contained in the bowl.</li>
            <li> Rating four stars because it is pretty expensive for what it is, I would have went with something cheaper</li>
            <li> The sides are too low, the bowl is too small and it is metal, so it cools quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am seeking out other shatterproof vessels to try.</li>
            <li> It is small and has a low profile to it</li>
            <li> Its pretty much useless because of its size.</li>
            <li> You can use a cup, but I dont want people to mistake my shaving bowl for anything else other than what it is when its on the sink.</li>
            <li> It will be to small for larger soaps however.</li>
            <li> This piece of tin is not worth 20.00.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $16 I paid for.  </li>
            <li> I could see if you have a much wider brush how it could be difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, not worth my time to iniate an exchange.</li>
            <li> low rating is only because the dimensions are wrong.</li>
            <li> It will accomodate soap no more than 3-1/4\\&quot; wide.  </li>
            <li> It just makes a mess.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with it is that it&#x27;s a little on the small side.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little deeper to work with and hold on to</li>
            <li> I use a Parker brush and it does make things a little messy.</li>
            <li> A few swirls</li>
            <li> Foam escapes and gets messy.</li>
            <li> The bowl has a round bottom, so it does not work well with \\&quot;mug\\&quot; type shaving soap (like Williams).</li>
            <li> Its thin enough so that when I place it on my &amp;#34;Mr.</li>
            <li> It is fairly heavy for it&#x27;s size and</li>
            <li> A little bit on the small side, but that also means that it takes up less room on the counter.</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviews have stated, this is a small bowl.</li>
            <li> I found this bowl to small to use without making a mess of things.</li>
            <li> This shaving bowl is a little small.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Edwin Jagger bowl despite reviews of it being a little  too small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the small side though.</li>
            <li> A little too small.</li>
            <li> But, as the other reviewers have stated, this is a very small bowl.</li>
            <li> If you are using a small brush and puck style soap it may work for you.</li>
            <li> : As stated, the bowl is surprisingly small.  </li>
            <li> This bowl is way too small.  </li>
            <li> This bowl is small but prefect for what I need.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said this bowl was way too small, but I just figured these were people who were used to shaving mugs.  </li>
            <li> Expensive and too small for standard size shaving soap rounds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hand sized bowl, so some may complain that it&#x27;s too small.  </li>
            <li> But not sure why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Size was not too small.</li>
            <li> The bowl is small and fits in the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I do think almost $20 is a bit excessive for what you are getting, but it does say \\&quot;Edwin Jagger\\&quot; on it.  </li>
            <li> Its compact design fits well in small cabinets.</li>
            <li> Too small for practical use.  </li>
            <li> Small no-frills shaving bowl that fits in the palm of your hand and will not break in travel.  </li>
            <li> I tried using this to create a lather one time, it is way too small.  </li>
            <li> i chose this rating, because this bowl is almost completely useless, it is smaller than an ash tray!</li>
            <li> The bowl is a bit small for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the small size.</li>
            <li> Though it is quite small, it works for me.</li>
            <li> A lot of people are saying that this bowl is small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have complained that it is too small.</li>
            <li> Hard to hold as it slips.  </li>
            <li> Holds heat well at least.</li>
            <li> I have a tough time getting my brush to move around the bowl because it is too small for the brush.</li>
            <li> Not a good bowl for developing foam/cream for shaving from shaving soap</li>
            <li> The metal is rather thin, so this bowl does not hold heat as well as I&#x27;d like-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to resort to using a metal bowl from the kitchen to create my shaving lather now, which is rather silly</li>
            <li> Guess $20 isn&#x27;t that bad if I keep it for 10+ years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use it every time I shave really like it</li>
            <li> Small but beautiful. Nice if you don&#x27;t need a ton of lather and so far it suits me but definitely not for everyone. If you palm later this should do the trick. As with all Edwin Jagger products the fit and finish are impeccable.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, just wish it were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The bowl is the perfect size for me, allowing me to hold it in the palm of one hand and use the shaving brush with the other hand. It works wonderfully for lathering with shaving cream and is a great product.</li>
            <li> The bowl is beautifully crafted but it is impossibly small; about the size of my palm and 1.5\\&quot; deep. If you are using a small brush and puck style soap it may work for you. If you have anything larger than a medium size brush and use cream the lather will roll out of the bowl.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bowl and really nice looking with my Edwin Jagger safety razor. The only complaint I have with it is that it&#x27;s a little on the small side. I have a tough time getting my brush to move around the bowl because it is too small for the brush. I&#x27;m also finding myself always getting more shave cream on the rim of the bowl; so I have to constantly scrap it back into the bottom to get more lather.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl and the smaller size was good for me! Quality made and seller shipped promptly!</li>
            <li> I do like this shave bowl, more so than a ceramic mug because I don&#x27;t feel like I will chip my tile if I drop it.    BUT, as far as shave bowls/mugs go, I definitely know now that I prefer a deeper bowl.  I like to soak my brush in with my soap in STEAMY HOT water for 15 or 30 seconds before I work up my lather.  This bowl isn&#x27;t deep enough for my brush to get thoroughly soaked (and warm in the middle).    If you soak your brush in the sink, then go for it, this is a great bowl.  I don&#x27;t like to fill the whole sink though and need something more.</li>
            <li> Well built, elegant and perfect size shaving bowl</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and high quality item. Unfortunately, it is MUCH smaller than the picture implies. This is no way any fault of the manufacturer Edwin Jagger. Amazon does not list size dimensions (only weight) for the bowl in the listing. If you are thinking of purchasing it and returning it if does not suit your needs be aware that Amazon will not accept returns on this item since it is a health and hygiene item.</li>
            <li> I found this bowl to small to use without making a mess of things. The price is way to high, its just small cup with Edwin Jagger printed on it. I ended up going back to an old mug of mine.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
            <li> I bring this on the road with me. I have usedit for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li> This piece of tin is not worth 20.00. I been had</li>
            <li> Nice looking item but the price is rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you make this purchase consider purchasing a stainless steal cat drinking bowl (they have a nice shine). I picked one up at my local grocery store for about $3-4. Looks like the real deal with my stainless steal set. Plus, it has rubber grip at the bottom so it sits nice on the sink cabinet when I work up lather. They work just the same as a shave bowl if you have a round soap bar, fits perfect for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want the Jagger name in little text on the outside of your bowl that&#x27;s cool big money. It is a sharp looking bowl! : )</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this bowl.  I was excited when it arrived.  After i opened the box, I was really surprised on how small the bowl was.  Especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s go over the good &amp; bad points:&lt;br /&gt;PROS: This bowl is well made.  Great, durable metal bowl that&#x27;s made to last.  Great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: As stated, the bowl is surprisingly small.  Not much room to work with.  Not worth the $16 I paid for.  Had I known this, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this.  You really have to experiment with your soaps, creams, and or brushes to build the lather. To your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good quality bowl.  The bowl could&#x27;ve beed bigger( especially for $16).  I just paid for the name at the end.</li>
            <li> This bowl is way too small.  A few swirls and I have lather spilling all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself time and money and just grab a coffee mug!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping! Works great for creating a good lather for shaving.</li>
            <li> This shaving bowl is a little small.  The lather goes over the edge fairly easy.  The finish is nice and looks good but I would rather have a larger one.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it looks and just incredible&lt;br /&gt;love it and plus the price is reasonable as well</li>
            <li> This bowl is small but prefect for what I need. It lathered well and kept the lather really warm.</li>
            <li> It is a handsome shaving soap bowl, but it is a bit small to lather my badger brush comfortably. Foam escapes and gets messy. I think next time I will be going with the mug instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it is better than using a random glass you have to lather.</li>
            <li> It is a nice bowl. But $20!!!! O heeeelllll no! I feel like I should hug it n squeeze it like its my lil baby bowl!  Awwww. Lmao. I got bowls in my kitchen like this that r 2-10Xs as big n cost pennies to this. If ur wealthy n can afford to ridiculous amounts of $$ on products not worth it than this is perfect for u. But there are way more nicer containers out there for ur shaving cream or SOAP to go in.</li>
            <li> I had an Edwin Jagger porcelain shaving bowl that I very much liked.  After I dropped it and broke it, I decided I should replace it with something more durable.    Some reviewers said this bowl was way too small, but I just figured these were people who were used to shaving mugs.  Since I trusted the Jagger brand, I went ahead and ordered it anyway - big mistake.  The bowl IS WAY TOO SMALL to be useful.  The bowl needs to be deeper and/or have a much wider rim in order to hold the lather.  It would be nice if the seller would give dimensions in the listing.  The bowl is 3-3/4\\&quot; wide and 1-1/2\\&quot; deep. The lip is only 1/4\\&quot; wide. It will accomodate soap no more than 3-1/4\\&quot; wide.  The bowl has a round bottom, so it does not work well with \\&quot;mug\\&quot; type shaving soap (like Williams). Fair warning.</li>
            <li> Bowl is too small for properly preparing shaving soap, the lather would leak over the sides rather than stay contained in the bowl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, well made, and definitely have a purpose.</li>
            <li> Good little bowl that fits in the palm of my hands and the chrome gives my exhaust pipes a run for the money.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my shaving bowl selection.  At first I feared it was a bit small, but after the first use I was hooked on it.  I love the compact size.  It fit perfectly in the palm of my hand and offers just enough space to get a good shave cream lather.  Finally, it&#x27;s chrome.  Men love SMOs (shiny metal objects).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a shaving cream that comes in a toothpaste size tube.  I apply a bead to my shave brush an work the brush in the bowl for a good lather.  If you are looking for a shave bowl to keep a shave soap bar in, you&#x27;ll probably need something larger.</li>
            <li> Expensive and too small for standard size shaving soap rounds.</li>
            <li> I use soap from Taylor... and it&#x27;s nice. This became just a mixing bowl for the brush. It&#x27;s overpriced, but shiny. A luxury for sure, my only complaint is that it is a tiny bit smaller than you want. It works, it&#x27;s fine, but if you have a full-sized badger brush, you&#x27;ll find the soap going over the rim often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Now a few months in, this bowl can best be explained as a \\&quot;palette\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Fit and Finish is great, however, the bowl is smaller than I expected and what the picture depicts. Overall, solid bowl, good materials I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> At the time of writing, I&#x27;ve been using this for somewhere between one and two months. I think it&#x27;s the perfect size for creating a lather that I use for 4 applications of later. It&#x27;s big enough that you can really work the brush into the soap, but small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the sink.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this bowl might be too small, but I find it&#x27;s a perfect size for my purpose.  Attractive and sturdy, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bowl does not hold heat will. The lather is cooled to room temperature before you can get it in your face.  Easy to clean though. Regret the purchase. Will be getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li> A little bit on the small side, but that also means that it takes up less room on the counter. I saw other reviews complaining that they couldn&#x27;t fit their soap pucks in it, but for cream it works just fine. Rating four stars because it is pretty expensive for what it is, I would have went with something cheaper but I like how this one looks.</li>
            <li> Looks nice but is a little small.  I wish it was a little deeper to work with and hold on to but, it looks nice on the counter with my other items.</li>
            <li> Nice looking bowl, matches my chrome shaving stand and Edwin Jagger razor.  It&#x27;s a hand sized bowl, so some may complain that it&#x27;s too small.  Once my technique got better (right amount of soap, water and wetness of the brush), I was able to make very good lather in this bowl without the lather spilling over the sides too much.  Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this bowl to replace a Merkkur glass bowl that I dropped and broke.  I like the shape and size of this bowl, perfect for my use, though it is a pretty small bowl.  Good quality, good weight to the bowl.</li>
            <li> A wonderfully useful little bowl. It would be even more useful if it were a touch larger, but I still love it. It&#x27;s very practical, so much so that I have now switched to using it daily rather than a larger bowl from Parker that I also own: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L82KKXQ/ref&#x3D;sr_ph?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435251673&amp;sr&#x3D;1&amp;keywords&#x3D;parker+shaving+bowl</li>
            <li> Sweet little bowl. Fits right in my hand and does it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
            <li> This bole is nice, size is enough for my EJ brush. It has nothing special on its construction, to be honest y paid for the logo on the bowls to match with mi other shaving pieces.</li>
            <li> This is a small bowl, as you can see from the pictures, but it is big enough for its intended use.  Very classy look on the counter as well.  4 stars because I feel the price is a little too high for the size.  If it were a few bucks cheaper this would be 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bowl for about two months now and I&#x27;m happy with it. Its thin enough so that when I place it on my &amp;#34;Mr. Coffee&amp;#34; I can have heated soap ready for when I shave. Plus, its a nice chrome so cleans very nicely and soap scum doesn&#x27;t build up on it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice bowl.  But not sure why I bought it.  $20 seems like a lot to mix soap in.  Oh well.  It does the job and looks cool.  Guess $20 isn&#x27;t that bad if I keep it for 10+ years.</li>
            <li> This shaving bowl from Edwin Jagger is pretty much exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s a silvery chrome plated soap bowl that you fill with shaving soap and use with a beaver fur brush.  I have read that some shaving soap bowls have little grooves or notches to help mix up the soap, and while this EJ lacks the grooves, it still seems to do a fine job.  I personally like how well it cleans up with a dry cloth.</li>
            <li> Bowl looks very nice, and seems like it will last forever.  As a few others have stated, the bowl is just a bit on the small side for my preferences, using a normal sized badger brush and Proraso in a tube it tends to bubble over the edges a bit.</li>
            <li> Be sure and read all of the other fine reviews for safety razor shaving items on Amazon. I did and followed their advice.

            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving but I wanted something that matched my stand and razor. This Chrome plated bowl definitely matched the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have complained that it is too small. My first brush is apparently just the right size for it. I could see if you have a much wider brush how it could be difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many months. Size was not too small. Nice thick nickel-stainless. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Meets my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> This chrome-finished bowl by EJ allows a wet shaver to mix an awesome lather while minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency.  It is definitely smaller than most traditional shaving mugs, but it is more than adequate to mix a luscious lather to start your manly day!  Additionally, the chrome finish adds an elegant, timeless touch to your shaving kit.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, good size for it&#x27;s intended purpose. It holds my [insert shaving brush name here] without tipping over, and I can build lather very quickly in it.  it looks good and is easy to cradle in one hand.  It cleans up easily.  Honestly, a touch pricy, but it is a welcome addition to my shaving collection.</li>
            <li> Bowl is a little smaller than anticipated, but still looks great and work great. Some oxidation on the rim of the bowl along with on the sides. Very dissapointing considering this is brand new. Nonetheless, not worth my time to iniate an exchange. Very dissapointed in the quality of the item, and this will definently influence me to avoid this company when possible. Bought this item specifically so I can display all my safety razor/old fashion shaving tools on the counter. If you don&#x27;t care about something like this, simply stick to a regular ceramic bowl from your house. No need to spend extra $</li>
            <li> Not too much more to say.  The bowl is compact and just big enough to use a regular size brush and work up a lather.  It is fairly heavy for it&#x27;s size and the chrome finish shrugs off water so it looks just as good 3 months later as it did the day I bought it.  It&#x27;s definitely a step up from a coffee cup.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected. Too small to use with a full size brush and get a good lather. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I suppose everyone has their own preferences.  For me this bowl is the perfect size.  I use Proraso shaving cream from the tube, and it foams easily and comfortably in this bowl.  The bowl is small and fits in the palm of my hand.  I use a standard size brush, which is able to sit in the bowl without tipping it, which is important to me as well.  It is very thin walled and light.  I am sure that everything I love about this bowl could be reason for others to dislike it, but it is a wonderfully made product that serves its purpose precisely.  In addition, I consider it a value priced.  Thank you Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking, well crafted small bowl.  I use it daily to lather up some TOBS cream, using an Escali brush.  I have no problem whipping up enough lather for a three-pass shave in this bowl, it fits nicely in the palm of the hand, and I would probably give it a five-star rating if only it were perhaps a quarter to a half-inch deeper.  As it is now, you do need to exercise some restraint in whipping up your lather lest you whip it right over the lip of the bowl and make a mess.  That said, it is a nice looking piece of work.  I do think almost $20 is a bit excessive for what you are getting, but it does say \\&quot;Edwin Jagger\\&quot; on it.  That must be worth ten bucks right there /(sarc)...</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviews have stated, this is a small bowl. However, it is just perfect for the right situation. This bowl was not intended for puck style soaps--they just don&#x27;t fit. Nevertheless, shave creams work wonderfully and build a great lather. Its compact design fits well in small cabinets.</li>
            <li> I found this shaving bowl to be the perfect companion for my Jack Black shaving soap. I just purchased a second one for use when I feel like shaving with a cream instead of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl feels solid, ideally weighted and overall feels like a quality product.</li>
            <li> Too small for practical use.  Hard to hold as it slips.  The cream spills over the edge. I lather directly to the face now for thick lather.  Don&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li> Nice shaving bowl, though it couldbe .5&amp;#34; larger in diameter...</li>
            <li> This item complements my shaving experience every day. It is the right size and being stainless cleans up easily and stays bright.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I feel like this should be one star.  However, the bowl is very nicely made and will hold up well I believe.  My main complaints are that the bowl is tiny, just tiny.  For my purposes, using a bowl for develop the lather, this bowl is woefully insufficient.  The sides are too low, the bowl is too small and it is metal, so it cools quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Attractive&lt;br /&gt;- Well made and has a nice weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Small&lt;br /&gt;- Not a good bowl for developing foam/cream for shaving from shaving soap</li>
            <li> This is a well made bowl that matched my shaving set perfectly.  Just the right size for a shave soap bar.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Edwin Jagger bowl despite reviews of it being a little  too small. I use gels and a standard badger brush it does seems a little small at first, but it works perfectly for my needs. No problems. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger shaving bowl size is convenient and allows you to make a good lather for shaving. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Actual dimensions are 3.75&amp;#34; w x 1.375&amp;#34; h, and not counting the lip on the bowl its only 3.25&amp;#34; w. Too small for a decent shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether its how I build lather but this bowl is a great shape but just a little small (doesnt seem to accomodate all my lather while im building the lather -- some spills out) fits in my palm perfectly. The chrome job seems dull sitting next to my shaving stand but still good looking. And steel won&#x27;t shatter all over when i knock it off my tiny sink and the bowl hits the tile floor. But not bad works for now but I am seeking out other shatterproof vessels to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s shiny, and it&#x27;s small enough to be portable, but still usable. I approve, and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Very nice lovely thing, a pleasure to handle it! Good feeling in hands, nicely crafted, enjoyable! I like it and recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> Bowl is as expected.  Not sure why I paid so much for a small stainles steal bowl, but it fits perfectly in my hand when making up lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice when not in use, though you could just use a coffee mug...</li>
            <li> I like this bowl a lot. It is small and has a low profile to it so I use it for traveling. I don&#x27;t have any problem whipping up a nice lather in this bowl. It looks nice, is easy to hold in your palm and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Its a bowl that helps me lather up my shaving cream.  The shaving cream I use by Lab Series doesn&#x27;t lather up like I want, but I&#x27;m sure other soap will do fine.  I&#x27;m almost finished with the Lab Series so I can really test out this bowl.  Since its metal, I can warm it up in the sink so my shaving cream is warm.  It fits in my palm and its shiny.</li>
            <li> Good, but in a cold environment I think that pottery would hold the warmth better.</li>
            <li> The bowl is nice looking and works well in creating a lather for shaving. It&#x27;s a little on the small side though.</li>
            <li> Small no-frills shaving bowl that fits in the palm of your hand and will not break in travel.  Lightweight and will not take up much room in your luggage.</li>
            <li> This bowl is sharp and looks very nice in our bathroom. My boyfriend loves it as part of his shaving accessories gift.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, should last forever.</li>
            <li> Looks great performed well</li>
            <li> I tried using this to create a lather one time, it is way too small.  I turned it into a soap holder instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with the bowl, it looks like it kinda changed tint after I first used it. the shape is the main thing I don&#x27;t like, it wants to tip over very easily. Next time I will purchase one that is more like a mug</li>
            <li> Your Mileage May Vary... as you&#x27;ve seen on countless wet shaving forums regarding various products. I actually love the bowl and it complements my chrome DE89L razor and stand, but as MANY have said, it&#x27;s a bit small. I can work (carefully) with it or use it in the shower without worries (on the rare occasion that I shave in the shower), but if you really like to whip up a serious lather... you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Nice looking shave bowl but like mentioned here a few times it&#x27;s really too small.  Specifically it&#x27;s not tall (or deep) enough and shaving cream instantly comes over the sides as soon as you begin lathering it up.  It just makes a mess.  There are plenty of other options out there that are both better designed and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I received it today and it&#x27;s very well made with a nice finish. However, if does not hold the foam well it will spill over if you lather too much. I am still very happy right size to fit next to my sink with my badger brush.</li>
            <li> Love it, its perfect cup to build up a good lather with by best badger, Not a big fan of the Edwins brushes but I&#x27;am of this bowl.</li>
            <li> I repent buying this bowl. Its pretty much useless because of its size. Its a misfit in my shaving kit. Also, it slips from the hand. I guess I should have known that.</li>
            <li> Perfect size of you already have shave cream and want to whip up a good lather</li>
            <li> i chose this rating, because this bowl is almost completely useless, it is smaller than an ash tray! i wouldnt pay $5 for what this thing really looks like when you get it! i dont normaly review the stuff i buy, but this one has it coming!</li>
            <li> Many people said this bowl was small, which they are correct to say, but it still gets the job done and with style. It was a really nice piece that I added to my shave collection. It has a great chrome luster on the outside, and a fine brushed stainless pattern on the inside. Overall, this is a great product, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a fine, small bowl for building lather with a natural shaving brush.  Smaller than I expected, but I appreciate the size now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it- it fits neatly in the palm of the hand.  I am able to build good lather quickly and neatly.  The metal is rather thin, so this bowl does not hold heat as well as I&#x27;d like- I float it in hot water as I prepare my blade so as to heat the lather produced within.  For the price, I think you could argue this guy is a bit of a luxury, especially for someone used to building lather on the face or in the hand- but it&#x27;s a nice piece and I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to the neat, quick lather building it offers me.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is small but fits just perfect in my hand. Takes a little practice to get the foam right. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> The bowl is a bit small for my tastes.  It&#x27;s a solid bowl and works fine, but with my brush it is always getting stuff around the edges and slopping out when I try to build up a lather.  Holds heat well at least.</li>
            <li> The bowl looks gorgeous. My only qualm with it is the fact it is far too shallow to create any sort of decent lather. A good 80% of any lather created will just roll out of the bowl and create a ginormous mess. I&#x27;ve decided to keep it for any future shaving soaps I have, as I feel it would come in handy. If not for that, I&#x27;d have returned it. I&#x27;ve had to resort to using a metal bowl from the kitchen to create my shaving lather now, which is rather silly but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice solid metal bowl. Great for travelling... Light, solid, unbreakeble, small. A little too small. Shaving foam tend to collect outside the bowl when you are vigorously working your brush in it. I&#x27;d say... A centimeter wider and a centimeter deeper would certainly help. Overall, a good buy. If you don&#x27;t mind the small size. (Maybe, I need a smaller brush? Hmm....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 5 Stars... A little larger works better.</li>
            <li> This bowl looks nice next to my shaving stand. And I have to admit that it does the work, I can lather the soap using this bowl. But, as the other reviewers have stated, this is a very small bowl. I use a Parker brush and it does make things a little messy. The lather slips out of the bowl very easily.</li>
            <li> Other reviews state the item is small, but for the price the size is just right and to my experience I am able to lather easily using shaving creams (maybe the bowl is too small if using soaps). You will easily pay double for a bowl a fraction larger. The metal construct is also more robust to drops than porcelain alternatives. Overall this is a great product for a more modern yet classically inclined shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to pick this bowl up from Amazon with the [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] and [[ASIN:B00764EF6I Colonel Conk No.176 Acrylic Brush Stand]] as an Amazon add-on item  for under $40, a bargain for a great setup!</li>
            <li> I love this product, right size. not wasting much space in my counter. I like it and I hope to be able to use this for long time</li>
            <li> It completes a shaving kit. You can use a cup, but I dont want people to mistake my shaving bowl for anything else other than what it is when its on the sink. So it does that job well, the chrome has not worn off and it does not stain thus far. But I think it could have been better priced.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I made a mistake, I bought this because I was mesmerized by the photo and the positive reviews, but this is not what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a Lathering bowl, and this is a soap bowl. I never returned the product because it is beautiful... holds the soap just perfect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want a beautiful chromed metallic bowl for your shaving soap, you&#x27;ve come to the right place, but, if like me, you want a lathering bowl, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m keeping this beautiful bowl...</li>
            <li> so for this has not rusted in the shower.  my husband had a ceramic dish and ofcourse it broke but this one looks indestructable</li>
            <li> Small and compact to fit into a travel case (toiletry bag), only makes enough foam for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who makes more than one pass, suggest getting a deeper bowl.</li>
            <li> This is something which i bought just for the fun of it. Looks good. Works great. More than 6 months and still the shine is there! Cool!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice bowl if only one could find a shaving soap that would fit in it.  It is advertised as being 4\\&quot; in diameter but the widest interior dimension is less than 3.5\\&quot;, which makes it just too small for my favourite soap and most others that I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low rating is only because the dimensions are wrong.</li>
            <li> Though it is quite small, it works for me. It does require a bit more practice to make sure lather doesn&#x27;t go all over the place. It its a perfect fit with \\&quot;Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml)\\&quot;, container fits perfectly into the bowel and takes minimal space on the shower shelf. I like it!</li>
            <li> A lot of people are saying that this bowl is small. The description says that it is 4\\&quot; wide but it is only 3 3/4 inches OUTSIDE diameter including the lip. The description is inaccurate and should be corrected. Also I it is described as chrome plated. I am not certain that this is actually chrome plated but I can tell for sure that it does NOT match the color and finish of my Edwin Jagger razor. I expected the chrome plating to be the same quality but it is not.</li>
            <li> Gave it away, nothing special.</li>
            <li> This bowl is the perfect size for smaller shave soaps - say about the size of a silver dollar. It will be to small for larger soaps however. Note many reviewers complained about this, but larger shave soaps are meant to be transferred to the bowl for mixing, or cut and melted to fit. I find it&#x27;s size perfect as it fits in the palm of your hand perfectly, and offers a robust bottom for easy lathering. This would also make an excellent travel bowl, as it is light, and takes up little room in a toiletries bag. For those of you worried about the dimensions, it measures about 3 and a half inches from the inside lip of the top, and is about two inches deep. Like all Edwin Jagger products, it comes in a beautiful box, making it a perfect gift as well.</li>
