            <li> Pic is not what it seems. It&#x27;s very short!</li>
            <li> Beautiful vest! Price was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly and looks exactly like the picture. Will wear it with dresses, tanks and all. I am 5&#x27;4 123 pounds. Bust size 34A so I normally wear a small and this fits me fairly loose and pretty.</li>
            <li> beautiful but sizes are very small...luckily my daughter can wear it!</li>
            <li> Not at all the picture! Different size and design. Still is pretty just not what i thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Nice but sized small, small, small</li>
            <li> To small for a XL it does not even begin to fit, the wait was not worth it.Would not buy again from this company</li>
            <li> These are very beautiful, very very poorly made. Also they run very small. They are also listed as 1 size fits all, but they&#x27;re not. When I contacted the company about a refund, they told me I could keep them and they would refund 1/2 my money, or send them back to China and pay shipping, and then wait for my refund. What would you do?</li>
            <li> The sizing must be for little kids. NOT TRUE TO SIZE. I should&#x27;ve ordered 2 sizes bigger but even then it might have been too small.</li>
            <li> beautiful vest that could dress up just about anything. get lots of complements  when I use it , very pleased with prouduct</li>
            <li> It was too small I gave it away as a gift the person I gave it just loves it</li>
            <li> I got a size large and it maybe fits my 10 year old brother.  Do not buy this unless you are super super tiny or want it to look like a vest. P.S. the sleeves are waaaay shorter than in the photo.</li>
            <li> i love this cover up! super cute with a cami or crop top underneath!</li>
            <li> Small.  But very pretty</li>

            <li> I wear long sleeves and my jacket and it keeps me very warm. I like that I have 2 jackets.</li>
            <li> The fabric is kind of stiff and it smelled like dye when I got it, but it&#x27;s pretty and after a washing was fine!</li>

            <li> Bought the black and off white! These are perfect and very versatile! The price is wonderful. So many compliments, actually gave away the black one because she just loved it so much!  Will be buying another to take it&#x27;s place.  Great prices!</li>
