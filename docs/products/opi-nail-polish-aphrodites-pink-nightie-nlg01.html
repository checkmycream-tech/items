            <li>The shop no longer had it, so I was happy it was available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>OPI tends to give their colors rather unique names, and this one is just a bit goofy, but it&#x27;s a great color</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and goes on quickly and flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and obviously OPI is a great quality polish.  </li>

            <li>Favorite color.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite color for over 4 years.</li>
            <li>My favorite nail polish color ever</li>
            <li>If it had more of the shine, I would wear this color exclusively.</li>
            <li>OPI is my favorite nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Love OPI and this pink is perfect for the summer.</li>
            <li>If you want the perfect pink for your nails, this is the one!!  </li>
            <li>beautiful medium pink.</li>
            <li>Love this color and it came really fast!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly too.</li>
            <li>Nice pink color, goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I had bought this color at a local beauty supply shop and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Best pink polish for skin with blue undertones.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Pinks don&#x27;t usually look good on me</li>
            <li>Not in your face, just a nice pink, a little metallic, a great look for dress up or daily wear.</li>
            <li>Very feminine.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, thanks</li>
            <li>This nail polish is a nice soft pink.</li>
            <li>Very feminine and classic.</li>
            <li>I love the soft pink color but wish that it had more of a shimmer like Royal Flush Blush (a peachy pink).  </li>
            <li>So, if you are wanting a soft pearl - type pink, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>It lasts much longer than other drug store polishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost impossible to find the perfect pink!!!!</li>
