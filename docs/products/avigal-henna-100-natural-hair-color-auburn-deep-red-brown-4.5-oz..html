    <ol>
            <li>So I am happy with the product and will buy it again!</li>
            <li>The best part for me is no roots.  </li>
            <li>perfect transaction for a great product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have this beautiful hair anymore.</li>
            <li>Very Pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, but they&#x27;ve never provided the consistently great results that Avigail does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried with just boiled water and another time with water and lemon, both worked great and gives a reddish brownish color.</li>
            <li>So happy to say that I found it here and that it still works just as well as it always did.  </li>
            <li>and the color is amazing!</li>
            <li>Just as good a product as Hennalucent Sunset Glo.</li>
            <li>Product is good.</li>
            <li>Jamila, Mehandi, and Henna Hut are way better hennas to use and give me great results.    </li>
            <li>Healthy for your hair, and non-toxic,  henna is fantastic and this brand is the best.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions are gladly welcomed!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My hair feels much softer and healthier and it has a wonderful shine.</li>
            <li>The color is great if you are a true Auburn hair colored person.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brunette and love the effect copper and auburn have.</li>
            <li>Most hennas want you to add lemon juice, some olive oil, leave sitting overnight</li>
            <li>, IT IS UTTER CRAPOLA (I can&#x27;t say what I want to say, lol!)    </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>A word of caution, you can bleach over many henna colors.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the red color better!!!</li>
            <li>The indigo was a bit grittier and smelled more strongly (like musky grass) than just henna did.</li>
            <li>Mixes easily, yes -- henna is messy but it is very easy to clean up -- best  of all it did the trick and took away diswater hir and gave me healthy color and sparkle!</li>
            <li>I thought this henna would be a great idea because it is natural and didn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of the box dyes in the stores, but I didn&#x27;t see the results that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Avigal Henna to color my hair for years and am glad to see it is available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with warm water, put it on my hair, wrapped my hair in saran wrap and a towel to keep it warm for an hour -- and got hair with a great color and soft texture.  </li>
            <li>U can use henna as much as you want,  more you using , more richness of the color you will have.</li>
            <li>I was coloring my hair with henna, my hair had shine ,rich color and was feeling like I had lot of hair, but I moved to America .I</li>
            <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red henna is too bright for me -- it covers the gray, but makes those hairs almost fluorescent red.</li>
            <li>My hair grows FAST, yet I don&#x27;t have to redo this for 2 months or more.</li>
            <li>I found this true with Copper and Brown.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, it covers the gray in interesting ways.</li>
            <li>Auburn looks much more natural on graying mousy brown hair.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments about my hair color, and most people think it is my natural color.  </li>
            <li>figured this would be the case since you need indigo to achieve brown with henna, but the labeling should be more clear</li>
            <li>Wish I could find this in more stores instead of only online anymore.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used this brand.  </li>
            <li>The results were exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>The red color from salon dyes &amp;#34;slipped&amp;#34; off my hair within two weeks, whereas most hennas are basically permanent.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but plan to leave out the Reddish Gold and add more indigo next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I mix this with dark brown to get some nice reddish highlights that cover my gray.</li>
            <li>I really like this henna color</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions with the package and it did absolutely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li>Have tried different ones and so far this item is one of my favorite hennas.</li>
            <li>I am extra sure because when the dye washed out it looked greenish blue in the shower.</li>
            <li>I reccommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Chemical hair coloring was ruining my fine hair and I am not ready to go gray.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted something a little more brown.</li>
            <li>You do have to keep your hair covered and WARM for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>The process is not as simple as box hair dye, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I made a mix with this henna, olive oil, water, strong tea for acidity and a little leftover Reddish Gold henna and applied it for two hours.</li>
            <li>(I have dark brown hair with some gray hair as well, and I like better how the red color dyes my gray hair)</li>
            <li>I have heard that the pigment does not last as long, leaving your hair more red than brown, but I hope this won&#x27;t be a problem if I redo my hair every month or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair definitely changed to a slightly deeper, more auburn shade.</li>
            <li>Contains no mixture of chemicals or food dye, only pure henna&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and has that hint of color that I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of gray now and it covered it completely.</li>
            <li>Using henna is like making mud pies -- messy, but worth it!</li>
            <li>My hair is dark to light brown, sort of ombre, and it took some of the ombre effect away but with in a week it went back to how it was before I used the henna.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been living in the US again for the past couple of years and recently decided to see if I could find my favorite henna online.</li>
            <li>While I believe it&#x27;s all natural, the mix clearly contains indigo dye (also a plant dye, but not henna-henna is always red).</li>
            <li>Not only does the color stay in, but it is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>And it was much messier than my other hennas.    </li>
            <li>Another major bonus is it doesn&#x27;t damage hair and actually makes mine healthier and adds a bit of thickness/body.  </li>
            <li>It is not smooth or sifted at all and is very very grainy.</li>
            <li>It was really messy, mostly just hard to get it rinsed out in the shower</li>
    </ol>

            <li> forgot to mention that I am african american with natural dark brown hair.....</li>
            <li> I naturally have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This is good for people who are afraid of a big change because the change is very slight.</li>
            <li> The product was extremely messy - when it dried, it became very grainy and I ended up with this sand-like substance everywhere!  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I have tried other brands of henna on occasion and none compare to the results I get with Avigal.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t take too long putting it on either or it will dry up on you!  </li>
            <li> But some have colors contain a component of blue, when bleached can leave blue or green tones in your hair.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the ingredient list says &amp;#34;100% Blend of Natural Hennas.</li>
            <li> The color is a dark reddish brown indoors and a very red shade in sunlight.</li>
            <li> I still have half the product left</li>
            <li> Followed the instruction, yet, even after a few hours later, her hair came as is, the dye didn&#x27;t work for her hair at all.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to at least see some red in the sun, but just a bit darker is all I saw.</li>
            <li> ; I probably won&#x27;t use the rest and chalk this up as a loss and utter failure......    </li>
            <li> It did  darken my hair slightly, but it didn&#x27;t add any auburn at all.</li>
            <li> I had used the Avigail Reddish Gold (copper) color previously</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time</li>
            <li> I did this a month ago, and the color has faded very little.  </li>
            <li> When I tried another brand of henna formulated to cover gray, my gray hairs turned emerald green!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s all, my hair weak now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why the other review had bad (no) results.</li>
            <li> I just hate this crap with such a passion and I&#x27;m mad at myself for buying two 4.5oz canisters of this mess.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;henna\\&quot; is weird in that it looks like and smells like grass.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I can mix it with something else if I get desperate</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I will get that desperate</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this product for my daughter, she has brown hair.  Followed the instruction, yet, even after a few hours later, her hair came as is, the dye didn&#x27;t work for her hair at all.  What a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avigal henna for over 30 years. Now that I&#x27;m older, it covers the gray in interesting ways. I&#x27;m a brunette and love the effect copper and auburn have. My hair grows FAST, yet I don&#x27;t have to redo this for 2 months or more. I don&#x27;t want to use anything else. Don&#x27;t understand why the other review had bad (no) results. You do have to keep your hair covered and WARM for at least an hour. Wish I could find this in more stores instead of only online anymore.</li>
            <li> perfect transaction for a great product. Mixes easily, yes -- henna is messy but it is very easy to clean up -- best  of all it did the trick and took away diswater hir and gave me healthy color and sparkle! thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This henna is so not like the henna I&#x27;m used to: add water, stir, apply and keep on for 1 hr???    Most hennas want you to add lemon juice, some olive oil, leave sitting overnight so the dye can release and then apply next day and leave on hair for about 4 hrs. And I have gotten pleasing results from these hennas!  Don&#x27;t ask me why I changed!    This \\&quot;henna\\&quot; is weird in that it looks like and smells like grass.  It is not smooth or sifted at all and is very very grainy. And don&#x27;t take too long putting it on either or it will dry up on you!  And it was much messier than my other hennas.    I just hate this crap with such a passion and I&#x27;m mad at myself for buying two 4.5oz canisters of this mess.  Maybe I can mix it with something else if I get desperate but I don&#x27;t think I will get that desperate; I probably won&#x27;t use the rest and chalk this up as a loss and utter failure......    Jamila, Mehandi, and Henna Hut are way better hennas to use and give me great results.    DO NOT BUY THIS HENNA, IT IS UTTER CRAPOLA (I can&#x27;t say what I want to say, lol!)    Hope this helps someone...forgot to mention that I am african american with natural dark brown hair.....ummmm, no auburn here.    Smooches!</li>
            <li> I was coloring my hair with henna, my hair had shine ,rich color and was feeling like I had lot of hair, but I moved to America .I start coloring  my hair with just regular hair dye, for a week I had shine , that&#x27;s all, my hair weak now and I don&#x27;t have this beautiful hair anymore. I am going back to henna . U can use henna as much as you want,  more you using , more richness of the color you will have.</li>
            <li> The product was extremely messy - when it dried, it became very grainy and I ended up with this sand-like substance everywhere!  It too forever to wash out of my hair, and in the end, it did mpt even cover my gray hair.</li>
            <li> Did not come with instructions on how to use it. Had to look that part online.</li>
            <li> Chemical hair coloring was ruining my fine hair and I am not ready to go gray.  I had looked, but could not find henna in stores -- it seems to have disappeared from shelves.  So when I finally realized I could probably find it online, I found this.  I mixed it with warm water, put it on my hair, wrapped my hair in saran wrap and a towel to keep it warm for an hour -- and got hair with a great color and soft texture.  I did this a month ago, and the color has faded very little.  So I am happy with the product and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I am an african american and I dont use any chemicals in my hair.  I have 4B textured hair .  I really like this henna color but it doesn&#x27;t seem to take in my hair.  I have followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; (with no luck) and have left it in for HOURS (almost an entire day) and even sat under the dryer for an hour with it in my hair, but as soon as I wash my hair, out goes the color. :-(  Any suggestions are gladly welcomed!</li>
            <li> Using henna is like making mud pies -- messy, but worth it! This is the Avigal henna I remember from years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red henna is too bright for me -- it covers the gray, but makes those hairs almost fluorescent red. Auburn looks much more natural on graying mousy brown hair. When I tried another brand of henna formulated to cover gray, my gray hairs turned emerald green!</li>
            <li> Just as good a product as Hennalucent Sunset Glo. Very Pleased with the results! I reccommend it highly. Deff. going to be reordering. The color is great if you are a true Auburn hair colored person.</li>
            <li> Avigail is the brand I trust. Their information is so helpful and it works well every time. I&#x27;ve tried others, but they&#x27;ve never provided the consistently great results that Avigail does.</li>
            <li> I thought this henna would be a great idea because it is natural and didn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of the box dyes in the stores, but I didn&#x27;t see the results that I was expecting. It did  darken my hair slightly, but it didn&#x27;t add any auburn at all. I was expecting to at least see some red in the sun, but just a bit darker is all I saw. I still have half the product left so I will try it again and leave it on longer. I left it on the length of time it recommended (1hour) so maybe I will try 2 hours next time.  My hair is dark to light brown, sort of ombre, and it took some of the ombre effect away but with in a week it went back to how it was before I used the henna. It was really messy, mostly just hard to get it rinsed out in the shower (USE A LOT OF CONDITIONER TO GET IT OUT)  Next time I think I will try the burgundy or just leave on the auburn for a longer period of time. This is good for people who are afraid of a big change because the change is very slight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like how the color ended up in my hair... I prefer the red color better!!! (I have dark brown hair with some gray hair as well, and I like better how the red color dyes my gray hair)</li>
            <li> Product is good. Have tried different ones and so far this item is one of my favorite hennas. I&#x27;ve tried with just boiled water and another time with water and lemon, both worked great and gives a reddish brownish color. I naturally have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This was the first time I used this brand.  The results were exactly what I was expecting.  My hair is soft, shiny, and has that hint of color that I wanted.  The best part for me is no roots.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The color did not take to m hair. I considered that i might be the length of time, but I let it sit for 3 hours and nothing changed. I colored it saturday and there is still grit from the henna in my hair 5 days later. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avigal Henna to color my hair for years and am glad to see it is available on Amazon.  I started using henna because I wanted my hair to be red.  The red color from salon dyes &amp;#34;slipped&amp;#34; off my hair within two weeks, whereas most hennas are basically permanent.  I have used Red, Auburn, Strawberry Blond, Copper, and Brown colors over the years, often mixing the colors for variation.  The process is not as simple as box hair dye, but well worth it.  Not only does the color stay in, but it is very natural looking.  I always get compliments about my hair color, and most people think it is my natural color.  Another major bonus is it doesn&#x27;t damage hair and actually makes mine healthier and adds a bit of thickness/body.  A word of caution, you can bleach over many henna colors.  But some have colors contain a component of blue, when bleached can leave blue or green tones in your hair.  I found this true with Copper and Brown.  You can color over these shades, but bleaching would be out. Lastly, I have tried other brands of henna on occasion and none compare to the results I get with Avigal.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I mix this with dark brown to get some nice reddish highlights that cover my gray.</li>
            <li> Healthy for your hair, and non-toxic,  henna is fantastic and this brand is the best.</li>
            <li> I had used the Avigail Reddish Gold (copper) color previously and I wanted something a little more brown. I made a mix with this henna, olive oil, water, strong tea for acidity and a little leftover Reddish Gold henna and applied it for two hours. My hair definitely changed to a slightly deeper, more auburn shade. It also feels softer and looks shiny. The color is a dark reddish brown indoors and a very red shade in sunlight. I like it, but plan to leave out the Reddish Gold and add more indigo next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the ingredient list says &amp;#34;100% Blend of Natural Hennas. Contains no mixture of chemicals or food dye, only pure henna&amp;#34;. While I believe it&#x27;s all natural, the mix clearly contains indigo dye (also a plant dye, but not henna-henna is always red). I am extra sure because when the dye washed out it looked greenish blue in the shower. The indigo was a bit grittier and smelled more strongly (like musky grass) than just henna did. I have heard that the pigment does not last as long, leaving your hair more red than brown, but I hope this won&#x27;t be a problem if I redo my hair every month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured this would be the case since you need indigo to achieve brown with henna, but the labeling should be more clear</li>
            <li> I used Avigal henna for years when I was younger and then I moved to Germany and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I&#x27;ve been living in the US again for the past couple of years and recently decided to see if I could find my favorite henna online. So happy to say that I found it here and that it still works just as well as it always did.  I mixed one quarter RED and three quarters AUBURN and the color is amazing! I have lots of gray now and it covered it completely. My hair feels much softer and healthier and it has a wonderful shine.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. Followed the instructions with the package and it did absolutely nothing to my hair. Waste of money and time</li>
