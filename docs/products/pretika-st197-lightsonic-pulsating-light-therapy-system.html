    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>I have nodular(cystic)acne and this wand is great!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for fibromyalgia patients who have tender points that cannot take massage.  </li>
            <li>but I can say Pretika is a great company with excelent customer service!  </li>
            <li>Best wishes for your beauty, health and happiness whatever you decide to do!</li>
            <li>The lightsonic is great to reduce inflammation--I suffer from cystic acne and it has helped with those issues.  </li>
            <li>People tell me all the time my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>The service I received when I ordered this was great</li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing; the wrinkles are greatly reduced, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Well, it worked for a good 3 minutes, and then died.  </li>
            <li>My daughter in law says it got rid of the wrinkles in her neck and my face is looking good</li>
            <li>For me, spa and beauty treatments need to be both pleasant and effective and this just wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Great price and good customer service, but my advice is to save up money and splurge on a better product.  </li>
            <li>Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System]]This is a really great product if you just take the time to read the directions and be patient.  </li>
            <li>, neck got really nice.</li>
            <li>so I could gauge the results honestly.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is it takes some time and for the price it is worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I so enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Best of all, in only 2 weeks I can see the difference.</li>
            <li>So, if I can forewarn others, so be it. :)</li>
            <li>They also sent me a free gift which was their dermabrasion kit!  </li>
            <li>I shall wait once ive used this product for over 8 weeks to see if there will be better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually the Pretika as the 4th one I used and the best.</li>
            <li>Write to me if you have more questions, I don&#x27;t mind   </li>
            <li>&quot; love the light it does work....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and if it does make my skin look younger in the long run, great.</li>
            <li>Medication, massage, infrared light thereapy, ultra sound, and a continual stretching and light exercise program to maintain movement.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Pretika light about three months ago.</li>
            <li>so I knew about the light therapy.</li>
            <li>The pulsing light therapy has been proven to aid in toning skin.</li>
            <li>smooth cheeks,</li>
            <li>I;ve use this for 6 months but stop , because i&#x27;m pregnant, and i dont know is it safe or not for pregnant woman.</li>
            <li>And so far, its looking pretty good.</li>
            <li>I had questions about the product and they responded quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this wand; I will probably buy the new model</li>
            <li>great product for less.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to do much of anything for the price, but now my fine lines are diminishing...</li>
            <li>I have not seen any real results with is light therapy</li>
            <li>For now, the acne killing aspect alone is worth the price all by itself.</li>
            <li>then its got to be worth something.</li>
            <li>then its got to be worth something.</li>
            <li>But still useful.</li>
            <li>You should see about a 2\\&quot; circle on your face, it takes practice, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>Whether its before my period or just right after.</li>
            <li>It really reduces swelling quickly.</li>
            <li>I top it all off with skin cream with 30 SPF each day, and a wrinkle reducing moisturizer such as ROC at night.     </li>
            <li>I love it, it lasts about one month following the directions.</li>
            <li>(yes i still get pimples even if im over 40) on my chin, in 2 EXACT spots.</li>
            <li>Every month, no fail.</li>
            <li>I changed the batteries daily, to make sure it was ready and raring to go.  </li>
            <li>This is not a good product, but a great one.  </li>
            <li>Within the first five days I noticed much smoother, glowing skin.  </li>
            <li>A large age spot on my eyebrow disappearing.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, my investments in the aforementioned products, all purchased from Amazon for my new routine work even better.</li>
            <li>I think if I were to give light therapy a try again in the future, I would invest in one of those screen shaped LED machines that you just sit in front of and have your whole face treated at once.  </li>
            <li>This treatment has really helped with my acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>have very stubborn acne, and this wand doesn&#x27;t cure it.  </li>
            <li>I have had, and used, the Pretika ST197 Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System daily for 7 days.  </li>
            <li>it runs the whole cycle of growing, popping and draining, and flattening out.</li>
            <li>Ive read that its the BLUE light that prevents acne</li>
            <li>but somehow, I have to believe that this product must really work at some level because it prevented my monthly pimple to start up.</li>
            <li>So if its works on preventing pimples, then it must really somehow be getting thru the layers of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do not, as the device  just gently vibrates like a massager.  </li>
            <li>i really like this</li>
            <li>have lasted the whole time ive been using it.</li>
            <li>I use a digital timer for accuracy and fit it in while I&#x27;m surfing the web or watching TV.  </li>
            <li>Any ideas where I can purchase this product at a very resonable price?  </li>
            <li>I need red light, with no heat and this product was recommended for my problem.  </li>
            <li>The scrub felt too harsh (on my hand) and the lotion too greasy for my face, but I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and its a nice purse size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It DID however, dry up my husband&#x27;s poison ivy after leaving the light on it for 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Of course, those cost 10 times more than the Pretika (but considerably less than spa visits).  </li>
            <li>Facial fullness is actually better for those of us over 40 because it makes us look younger.</li>
            <li>While I really, really like the Pretika face brush, the lightsonic light therapy is pretty much a waste of your money.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use the Petrika LightSonic as often as I can, usually while reading, and also give my face a good cleaning with the Petrika sonic dermabrasion facial brush about three or four times a week because I also use the Skin Laboratory&#x27;s 35% hydrolic acid gel peel in between the dermabrasions -- about once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>The magic rule is to be patiient, use everyday, and practice at keeping that 1\\&quot; (should see a 2\\&quot; circle on your face)from your face.  </li>
            <li>Pretika is the essence of the start of a new life.</li>
            <li>Well, on day seven (today) I went to use it, put new batteries in, and turned it on to use it...  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m still using the same Energizer Ultimate Lithium AAs in it and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product - very surprised.</li>
            <li>I even had my neighborhood store owner mistake me for my 22 year old daughter!  </li>
            <li>i had a fine line or maybe it was a slight scar line but its almost dissapeared.</li>
            <li>(I use Alpha Hydrox as an alpha hydroxy acid and Olay Regenerist for the peptides, pretty basic).  </li>
            <li>(Not completely, but better than I would&#x27;ve expected.)</li>
            <li>Now I have 4 sore large deep cytsts around my mouth</li>
            <li>I ordered this producand went to a Med-Spa before I used it for a professional microdermabrasion treatment.  </li>
            <li>My face is much firmer after only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It really needs an internal timer as well.  </li>
            <li>- Don&#x27;t use products if you are sensitive to this type of acne.</li>
            <li>My under eye area is FIRM and the light crows feet are disappearing.  </li>
            <li>It works if you have patient, the very first night will work, you see result the second morning, it is not dramatic, but you can tell a little.  </li>
            <li>But it makes my skin nicer overall, and it doesn&#x27;t appear as spotty because I have fewer red marks from old bumps.</li>
            <li>I just wish it wouldnt do that noise so my husband dont get annoyed, and the instruction manual should be more specific.</li>
            <li>It really help fade some of my black spot before.</li>
            <li>It helps to slough off the top layer of skin, gently, and flattens acne cysts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever gave this product a bad review, didn&#x27;t give it time to work.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell whether or not it makes my skin younger, but it kills the cystic acne I&#x27;ve been fighting, by drying the lesions.</li>
            <li> dried out normal acne and brown spots gone.</li>
            <li> Too aggravated for pretika to \\&quot;dry</li>
            <li> I sure was optimisic, but ultimately I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I might as well have lit the $40 I spent on this, on fire.  </li>
            <li> I bought rechargable batteries and change every other day.</li>
            <li> Plus its not as pricey as the other products out there.diet or skin care routine)</li>
            <li> Plus its not as pricey as the other products out there.</li>
            <li> The red marks left behind by bumps fade faster, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And a sort-of whitish scar in between my eyebrows (from an unfortunate Retin-A/waxing incident 3 years ago) looks a much healthier pink.  </li>
            <li> I then used the light (for a week now) and am SHOCKED at the results.  </li>
            <li> The face products included contained some good ingredients but the smell was terrible</li>
            <li> This product had improve my skin texture and tone, nasolabial folds are less noticeable after a month.</li>
            <li> my skin looks a bit tighter and my cheeks are less sunken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep track of how long you are treating without a timer.</li>
            <li> Can I just say the Pretika ST197 Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System is the biggest disappointment since the AMC Pacer!  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday for about 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Dried up cyctic acne UNTIL I used the products.</li>
            <li> For erupting spots, it doesn&#x27;t stop the bump from coming up, but it really helps with the painful swelling.  </li>
            <li> Im too lazy to do this 2x a day</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this a few years ago!  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight enough that my hand doesn&#x27;t get tired from holding it, however, the constant vibrating does get a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> It needs at least 3 days to improve your complex, then it will be visible.</li>
            <li> Whether i cut down on chocolates and oily foods..that annoying pimple just keeps coming back in just one or 2 spots on my chin.</li>
            <li> and there are some nights im too lazy or tired to do this routine</li>
            <li> It is loud and vibrates in your hand annoyingly.  </li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed in this item as I thought the LEDs would  actually pulsate with i.e. &#x27;frequency&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I got this because i know that once youre over 40, collagen decreases, thus making our skin look thin, saggy and without fullness or firmness.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few weeks because it was unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> This unit is very small and unpleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what the abbreviation for \\&quot;centimeter\\&quot; is, then I imagine any instructions will be difficult for you,</li>

            <li> and im quite shocked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing..every month, i get this really annoying acne</li>
            <li> If I get a really nasty spot, I&#x27;ll just carry it around with me all day and use it whenever I think about.</li>

            <li> I use the Petrika LightSonic as often as I can, usually while reading, and also give my face a good cleaning with the Petrika sonic dermabrasion facial brush about three or four times a week because I also use the Skin Laboratory&#x27;s 35% hydrolic acid gel peel in between the dermabrasions -- about once or twice a week. I top it all off with skin cream with 30 SPF each day, and a wrinkle reducing moisturizer such as ROC at night.     When I lost my job, I was upset I could no longer afford the facials and skin care I so enjoyed. As it turns out, my investments in the aforementioned products, all purchased from Amazon for my new routine work even better. My skin looks amazing; the wrinkles are greatly reduced, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I;ve use this for 6 months but stop , because i&#x27;m pregnant, and i dont know is it safe or not for pregnant woman. But i will start to use it again. I like it. It really help fade some of my black spot before. So i will start it again soon.</li>
            <li> This treatment has really helped with my acne breakouts.  If I get a really nasty spot, I&#x27;ll just carry it around with me all day and use it whenever I think about. It really reduces swelling quickly.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this product.  You can feel it working.  Best of all, in only 2 weeks I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this. I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for over a month and see no change in skin tone or texture.  It DID however, dry up my husband&#x27;s poison ivy after leaving the light on it for 15 minutes.  (Not completely, but better than I would&#x27;ve expected.) So I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars for that.</li>
            <li> This product had improve my skin texture and tone, nasolabial folds are less noticeable after a month. I used it while watching TV.I dont need for eye protection. I just wish it wouldnt do that noise so my husband dont get annoyed, and the instruction manual should be more specific. I am very happy with the results and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> It works if you have patient, the very first night will work, you see result the second morning, it is not dramatic, but you can tell a little.  It needs at least 3 days to improve your complex, then it will be visible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell whether or not it makes my skin younger, but it kills the cystic acne I&#x27;ve been fighting, by drying the lesions. It helps to slough off the top layer of skin, gently, and flattens acne cysts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever gave this product a bad review, didn&#x27;t give it time to work. If you don&#x27;t know what the abbreviation for \\&quot;centimeter\\&quot; is, then I imagine any instructions will be difficult for you, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and if it does make my skin look younger in the long run, great. For now, the acne killing aspect alone is worth the price all by itself.</li>
            <li> I have nodular(cystic)acne and this wand is great! With existing spots, I can see an immediate reduction in size.  For erupting spots, it doesn&#x27;t stop the bump from coming up, but it really helps with the painful swelling.  For spots without nodules, redness is reduced after a minute or so.  The red marks left behind by bumps fade faster, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very stubborn acne, and this wand doesn&#x27;t cure it.  But it makes my skin nicer overall, and it doesn&#x27;t appear as spotty because I have fewer red marks from old bumps. It also soothes the pain of big nodules.  I love this wand; I will probably buy the new model just so I have an extra one in case mine ever dies.</li>
            <li> While I really, really like the Pretika face brush, the lightsonic light therapy is pretty much a waste of your money.  It is $$ that I didn&#x27;t need to spend.  So, if I can forewarn others, so be it. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fibromyalgia patients who have tender points that cannot take massage.  Pretika help to sooth tender points over 3-6 weeks if used on a daily basis for 15 minutes on a tender point.  Get a hold of your fibromyalgia and manage it, do not let it manage you.  Medication, massage, infrared light thereapy, ultra sound, and a continual stretching and light exercise program to maintain movement.  Pretika is the essence of the start of a new life.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any real results with is light therapy but I can say Pretika is a great company with excelent customer service!  I had questions about the product and they responded quickly.  They also sent me a free gift which was their dermabrasion kit!  The lightsonic is great to reduce inflammation--I suffer from cystic acne and it has helped with those issues.  I dont see any difference in anything else. The fact that this product has helped me with inflammation is enough for me.</li>
            <li> I bought a Pretika light about three months ago. My friend owns a spa so I knew about the light therapy.I love it, it lasts about one month following the directions. It does take time so to do while watching t.v or reading.I bought rechargable batteries and change every other day. I&#x27;m on my Pretika #2. For the price it is worth it!!!! My skin looks great,toned and freckles and age spots have gone away.People tell me all the time my skin looks great. I do not see my friend she charges 60.00 a visit and on #5 setting about the same as the Pretika.The bottom line is it takes some time and for the price it is worth it!!!</li>
            <li> The service I received when I ordered this was great but I&#x27;m not impressed with the machine.  I don&#x27;t feel it accomplishes what it says it will.  I was going to return it but I tried the cream included and didn&#x27;t think they would take it back like that.    Frances</li>
            <li> The pulsing light therapy has been proven to aid in toning skin. The only thing is if you plan to use this tool, buy an egg timer. It&#x27;s hard to keep track of how long you are treating without a timer.</li>
            <li> Can I just say the Pretika ST197 Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System is the biggest disappointment since the AMC Pacer!  I have had, and used, the Pretika ST197 Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System daily for 7 days.  I changed the batteries daily, to make sure it was ready and raring to go.  Well, on day seven (today) I went to use it, put new batteries in, and turned it on to use it...  Well, it worked for a good 3 minutes, and then died.  I even changed the batteries, AGAIN, and NOTHING.  This thing is a piece of junk, and that is an understatement.  I might as well have lit the $40 I spent on this, on fire.  Save your money for something that actually works, and lasts.</li>
            <li> I got this because i know that once youre over 40, collagen decreases, thus making our skin look thin, saggy and without fullness or firmness. Facial fullness is actually better for those of us over 40 because it makes us look younger. Ive been using this for around 3 weeks now and i must say it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing..every month, i get this really annoying acne (yes i still get pimples even if im over 40) on my chin, in 2 EXACT spots. Every month, no fail. Whether its before my period or just right after. Whether i cut down on chocolates and oily foods..that annoying pimple just keeps coming back in just one or 2 spots on my chin. it runs the whole cycle of growing, popping and draining, and flattening out. Ive also had it injected by my dermatologist with steroids when it shows up. but believe me, it just keeps coming back! but eversince i started with pretika, it hasnt come.absolutely nothing and im quite shocked. (which is what motivated me to write this review because ive had this monthly acne problem for YEARS) Ive read that its the BLUE light that prevents acne but somehow, I have to believe that this product must really work at some level because it prevented my monthly pimple to start up. So if its works on preventing pimples, then it must really somehow be getting thru the layers of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second thing..though its only been around 3 weeks and there are some nights im too lazy or tired to do this routine, i have been seeing some fullness in my skin. Youre supposed to use this product 2x a day for collagen renewal, for about 2 minutes per area. Im too lazy to do this 2x a day so i jack it up by just doing this once a day but at 5-10 min per area. I do this while watching tv. And so far, its looking pretty good. my skin looks a bit tighter and my cheeks are less sunken. I shall wait once ive used this product for over 8 weeks to see if there will be better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like i said, it must work. For it to prevent my chin acne (and i havent changed my diet or skin care routine) then its got to be worth something. Plus its not as pricey as the other products out there.diet or skin care routine) then its got to be worth something. Plus its not as pricey as the other products out there.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed in this item as I thought the LEDs would  actually pulsate with i.e. &#x27;frequency&#x27;.  They do not, as the device  just gently vibrates like a massager.  But still useful.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this a few years ago!  I am 43 and have gotten the wrinkles around my eyes and lips (ex-smoker).  I ordered this producand went to a Med-Spa before I used it for a professional microdermabrasion treatment.  I then used the light (for a week now) and am SHOCKED at the results.  I did not expect it to do much of anything for the price, but now my fine lines are diminishing...couple of facial cysts diminishing...under eyes are filling out again...AND my lips are getting fuller like they were 20 years ago.  I even had my neighborhood store owner mistake me for my 22 year old daughter!  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000F5EGFA Pretika ST197 Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System]]This is a really great product if you just take the time to read the directions and be patient.  I was spending $1000 a session to get infrared treatments in my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  I decided I could save a lot of money and do this myself at home.  Actually the Pretika as the 4th one I used and the best. It is simple, use the pulsating button only and hold it about 1\\&quot; from you skin.  You should see about a 2\\&quot; circle on your face, it takes practice, but it is worth it.  I use it everyday for about 15-20 minutes.  My face is much firmer after only 2 weeks.  The magic rule is to be patiient, use everyday, and practice at keeping that 1\\&quot; (should see a 2\\&quot; circle on your face)from your face.  This is not a good product, but a great one.  It works for me, it will work for me.  Write to me if you have more questions, I don&#x27;t mind   Eileen</li>
            <li> Great price and good customer service, but my advice is to save up money and splurge on a better product.  This unit is very small and unpleasant to use.  It is loud and vibrates in your hand annoyingly.  I stopped using it after a few weeks because it was unpleasant.  It really needs an internal timer as well.  Stopping and restarting my timer each time I moved to a different area of my face was bothersome.  The face products included contained some good ingredients but the smell was terrible and so I discontinued using those as well.  I haven&#x27;t seen results but I also haven&#x27;t stuck with the program.  For me, spa and beauty treatments need to be both pleasant and effective and this just wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  I think if I were to give light therapy a try again in the future, I would invest in one of those screen shaped LED machines that you just sit in front of and have your whole face treated at once.  Of course, those cost 10 times more than the Pretika (but considerably less than spa visits).  Oh well, I knew the product was a gamble.  I sure was optimisic, but ultimately I was disappointed.  Well, hope that helped.  Best wishes for your beauty, health and happiness whatever you decide to do!</li>
            <li> This item works well.  It seems to take about 30 days after you use it (not 30 times but once or twice) until you see the result.  I&#x27;ve heard, but am no expert that it takes about 20 to 30 days to start producing collagen again after your body stops producing it.  My daughter in law says it got rid of the wrinkles in her neck and my face is looking good, neck got really nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product - very surprised. A large age spot on my eyebrow disappearing. Dried up cyctic acne UNTIL I used the products. Now I have 4 sore large deep cytsts around my mouth - Don&#x27;t use products if you are sensitive to this type of acne. Too aggravated for pretika to \\&quot;dry out\\&quot; love the light it does work....smooth cheeks, dried out normal acne and brown spots gone.</li>
            <li> i really like this, my face looks and feels younger and ive only been using it a week. i cant wait to see what a month looks like. i had a fine line or maybe it was a slight scar line but its almost dissapeared. my sun sopts are lightened too. def. worth the money. great product for less. you have to put 2 batteries in them and mine have lasted the whole time ive been using it. it feels like a vibrator in your hand but you can hold like your shirt or something around it so your hand dont feel the buzzing. i highly recommend this product. i like the cream that came with it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Prekita Lightsonic for two weeks today.  I did skip one day of treatment, otherwise I have used it each day for the recommended two minutes over each area.  It is lightweight enough that my hand doesn&#x27;t get tired from holding it, however, the constant vibrating does get a little annoying.  But not enough to deter me from the results.  So far I&#x27;m still using the same Energizer Ultimate Lithium AAs in it and it is still going strong. I use a digital timer for accuracy and fit it in while I&#x27;m surfing the web or watching TV.  It&#x27;s really simple.  I haven&#x27;t changed my skin care routine so I could gauge the results honestly.  (I use Alpha Hydrox as an alpha hydroxy acid and Olay Regenerist for the peptides, pretty basic).  I have NOT used the skin care items that came with it.  The scrub felt too harsh (on my hand) and the lotion too greasy for my face, but I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and its a nice purse size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, onto the results!  Within the first five days I noticed much smoother, glowing skin.  Especially on my cheeks and in the eye area.  I&#x27;m turning 39 this week, so I notice every line and wrinkle that is creeping up, and my face looks younger than it did two weeks ago.  The pores on each side of my nose are much smaller and tighter.  My under eye area is FIRM and the light crows feet are disappearing.  And a sort-of whitish scar in between my eyebrows (from an unfortunate Retin-A/waxing incident 3 years ago) looks a much healthier pink.  For the price, I think this machine is a bargain.  And I intend to use (and buy another if I need to) until I stop seeing results.  Sometime I may upgrade to a pricer, much more expensive machine.  But as a starter at home LED treatment machine, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Would like to purchase this product to help with my Lymphedemia.  Seems to be unavailable.  Any ideas where I can purchase this product at a very resonable price?  I need red light, with no heat and this product was recommended for my problem.  Please help.</li>
