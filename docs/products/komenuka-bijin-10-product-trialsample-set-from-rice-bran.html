            <li>The products themselves are &#x27;pretty good&#x27;.</li>
            <li>very glad I ordered the sample pack instead of jumping right in and ordering the stuff.  </li>

            <li>After the moisturizer sank into my skin and was absorbed, I noticed that my skin looked brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li>It also makes my makeup go on really smooth.</li>

            <li>I love how calm they make me feel.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is light and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic buy.  </li>
            <li>Most of the ones I got were things I wasn&#x27;t interested in.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a weekend vacation or as larger sample sizes, the natural products will make your skin feel moisturized and pampered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have a sample before I spend the kind of money for a big size.</li>
            <li>I am currently trying out the samples and so far they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>And just cant belive its made alll naturally from rice :) !</li>
            <li>This and the 10 piece HABA sample bag were such a pleasant and sweet package to receive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say go for it - it&#x27;s fun to have and pretty cheap!</li>
            <li>After the use of the shampoo and conditioner I bought the full size products.</li>
            <li>Now it is on to the full size products.</li>
            <li>Overall, the products from this line are of good quality</li>
            <li>No bad oder, no stickyness, no irritation.</li>
            <li>The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience.</li>
            <li>If the toner is not included, they normally include the NS-K Special Toner with even more healing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is applied before the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture Cream Silver - Super hydration with aloe, vitamin E and Rice Bran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cream Silver - Super hydration with aloe, vitamin E and Rice Bran.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get exactly what it looks like what they are displaying in the promo image, but I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>tried the facial cleanser, and it is really nice.</li>
            <li>It was nice that they included a 25% off coupon for my next purchase.  </li>
            <li>but I believe well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I want to continue to purchase the individual ones and make sure that it does fit my needs</li>
            <li>And, as someone who is addicted to trying to find the &#x27;perfect&#x27; skin products, this seemed like a no-brainer to try.     </li>
            <li>I was quickly attracted to this product because of its claims of being all-natural, because it was using a new &#x27;miracle ingrediant&#x27; (rice, amongst others), and because I fell for the whole \\&quot;It sounds exotic</li>
            <li>these personal touches were nice surprises and very much like in Asia.</li>
            <li>and in sizes where you can actually see a full application some samples more than one application.</li>
            <li>First, this is a really fun gift for someone who likes samples.</li>
            <li>but I will be experimenting more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that they shipped this with other samples like food samples or cosmetic samples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be buying the foaming face wash which was amazing, but everything else was just average.</li>
            <li>This would probably be better for someone who has very dry skin maybe who could possibly have a better chance at absorbing the lotions.</li>
            <li>you are looking for an easy way to try out the skincare system or you just want to take these products with you wherever you go (they are addictive)</li>
            <li>you are looking for an easy way to try out the skincare system or you just want to take these products with you wherever you go (they are addictive)</li>
            <li>The bag is fairly large and can be used again.</li>
            <li>but it was only good for 1 use for me because I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li>The face lotion made my face almost sticky after applying it and probably lasted a good hour to two hours after, plus it made me shiney and made my make-up not last very long.  </li>
            <li>Its more creamy and when you rinse and pat dry, your face is really moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is such a great sampler set, I was curious to see how some Asian skincare products work without wanting to invest heavily in full size products.</li>

            <li>After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Skin Care Cream - A body cream that is very healing with jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very tangled and knotted after using it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, works well with my hair</li>
            <li>The samples I received was really to try out the shampoo and conditioner .</li>
            <li>The conditioner did not not detangle like I expected and with the sample I was able to use it about 3 times .</li>
            <li>&quot; claims that it \\&quot;will absorb readily, leaving no oily residue to block the pores.\\&quot;     ...</li>
            <li>I say its pretty decent and good for your money since these skincare are expensive in full size.</li>
            <li>Sure wish the samples I received were in line with each other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would order though because I may try to make my own serum from DIY recipes I found online.</li>
            <li>The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil.</li>
            <li>, then I can highly recommend this and any of the Komenuka products.</li>
            <li>, then I can highly recommend this and any of the Komenuka products.</li>
            <li>I very nearly fell for the product claims and reviews enough to just get the full sizes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo really clarifies and the conditioner makes your locks really soft.</li>
            <li>I have normal to combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Normally I use the rice collection at Bath and Body Works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used store brnd products that were better than these items (and cost a heck of a lot less!).  </li>
            <li>The bag contains several toners of different kinds, moisturizer, eye cream, tea bag, facial cleanser, a melon gummy :) I forgot what else.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they included a few more samples (tea, gummies) that were not expected.</li>
            <li>This one was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>At first the shampoo and conditioner made my hair dirty looking but after about a couple of weeks of continued use I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and the lotion minimized the pores and made it really soft.</li>
            <li>Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging.</li>
            <li>Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging.</li>
            <li>The eye gel, the different toners and moisterizers work really well also.</li>
            <li>They also gave me some unexpected samples like candies</li>
            <li>Its not like these were free or even at least 2 use sized samples.</li>
            <li>I ordered the samples of this product because I was interested in trying the sulphate free shampoo, which is expensive.</li>
            <li>I would have spent way too much money on a product that doesn&#x27;t help my skin or hair at all.  </li>
            <li>It cleansed my fine/ thin curly hair well but did not strip all the moisture that most shampoos do.</li>
            <li>I have used other high end products</li>
            <li>It was light, but very thick.  </li>

            <li> but it was only good for 1 use for me because I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> The face lotion made my face almost sticky after applying it and probably lasted a good hour to two hours after, plus it made me shiney and made my make-up not last very long.  </li>
            <li> Its more creamy and when you rinse and pat dry, your face is really moisturized afterwards.</li>

            <li> First, this is a really fun gift for someone who likes samples. The packets are great for travel. The downside is that nothing on these sample packets is in english - you have to refer to an insert which somewhat &amp;#34;translates&amp;#34; the products into what they&#x27;re used for. I didn&#x27;t get exactly what it looks like what they are displaying in the promo image, but I was not disappointed. Plus, they included a few more samples (tea, gummies) that were not expected. The bag is fairly large and can be used again. I&#x27;d say go for it - it&#x27;s fun to have and pretty cheap!</li>
            <li> Please do notn waste your money on this. I regret having purchased it. These are tiny samples that should have been included with my larger order of this company&#x27;s products. I purchased both as a gift for someone who loves their hair care products. This one was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> I came across this product after reading about how great rice bran was for the skin. I wanted to try the product line, but I thought it was a little pricy and I didn&#x27;t want to buy it and have the money go to waste if I didn&#x27;t like it.  &lt;br /&gt;I tried the facial cleanser, and it is really nice. It is not like other foaming clensers out there. Its more creamy and when you rinse and pat dry, your face is really moisturized afterwards. I then tried the facial lotion and that lotion is perfect for my skin. I have oily skin and the lotion minimized the pores and made it really soft. After the moisturizer sank into my skin and was absorbed, I noticed that my skin looked brighter and more radiant. It also makes my makeup go on really smooth. &lt;br /&gt;The eye jell is excellent also. It really moisturizes your delicate eye area without being too greasy. &lt;br /&gt;I also like the skin care cream. Its really thick and creamy but not oily. It sinks into your skin and makes it soft and supple.  &lt;br /&gt;The shampoo really clarifies and the conditioner makes your locks really soft. &lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try the other products because its ard to figure out which is which. Some of the packets are not labeled in English so its hard to figure out what it is but I will be experimenting more in the future. The set also comes with an instruction pamplet and a little gift. (A bag of green tea). All in all, a great product.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this sample set is a good way to test the products to see which ones you like.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of samples. Everything came in time, &amp; I was very pleased. The seller even included a ton of free extras too, which I was very happy about :]. The products themselves are &#x27;pretty good&#x27;. I recommend the shampoo/conditioner &amp; the foaming face wash [my favorite]. Overall, a very good seller. I&#x27;ll probably be buying the foaming face wash which was amazing, but everything else was just average. The eye moister jell was also very good too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a weekend vacation or as larger sample sizes, the natural products will make your skin feel moisturized and pampered. Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water. The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion. If the toner is not included, they normally include the NS-K Special Toner with even more healing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Eye Moisture Jell - Also contains apple acid, lemon, seaweed and loquat leaf. Smooths the delicate eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Two Cleansing Powder Packets - Deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The UV Cream is slightly tinted and waterproof. This sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. The cream is easy to apply and absorbs easily into the skin. You can apply this on its own or after the moisture cream and skin essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Skin Care Cream - A body cream that is very healing with jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 &amp; 10. Hair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an easy way to try out the skincare system or you just want to take these products with you wherever you go (they are addictive), then I can highly recommend this and any of the Komenuka products.

            <li> Very small packets of random samples.  There was a shampoo and conditioner packet but it was only good for 1 use for me because I have very long hair.  The bag contains several toners of different kinds, moisturizer, eye cream, tea bag, facial cleanser, a melon gummy :) I forgot what else.  I wanted to try the komenuka whitening essence and I&#x27;m glad I received that too.  Used it on my face over the hada labo lotion and it seems to work great together. It was nice that they included a 25% off coupon for my next purchase.  I&#x27;m not sure I would order though because I may try to make my own serum from DIY recipes I found online. If my experimentation does not turn out well I definitely will try a bottle of the komenuka bijin essence.</li>
            <li> This pack comes with a wide variety of products.  It is a great introduction to the Komenuka line.  I really enjoyed how clean my skin felt after using the cleanser.  The moisturizer is light and not at all greasy.  I would recommend this line to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it leaves my skin. No bad oder, no stickyness, no irritation. It does what it says. And just cant belive its made alll naturally from rice :) !</li>
            <li> I have normal to combination skin.  Normally I use the rice collection at Bath and Body Works but they&#x27;re no longer making it and I thought from the discription, it would be a perfect replacement. &lt;br /&gt;The cleanser was nice, but my face never felt clean after using it.  The face lotion made my face almost sticky after applying it and probably lasted a good hour to two hours after, plus it made me shiney and made my make-up not last very long.  The eye gel was even worse.  My skin couldn&#x27;t absorb it.  It was light, but very thick.  I couldn&#x27;t put my make-up on after using it, guess it&#x27;s supposed to be just for at night? &lt;br /&gt;The hair items, did nothing for my hair.  My hair was very tangled and knotted after using it.  Didn&#x27;t help my hair at all.  My hair was still and thin and limp after using it as it was before I did unlike the store brand hair products that cost a lot less. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I ordered the sample pack instead of jumping right in and ordering the stuff.  I would have spent way too much money on a product that doesn&#x27;t help my skin or hair at all.  I&#x27;ve used store brnd products that were better than these items (and cost a heck of a lot less!).  Buyer beware if you have my skin type.  This would probably be better for someone who has very dry skin maybe who could possibly have a better chance at absorbing the lotions.</li>
            <li> I have bought a couple of these packets of the different products offered by this company. After the use of the shampoo and conditioner I bought the full size products. At first the shampoo and conditioner made my hair dirty looking but after about a couple of weeks of continued use I am very pleased with it. I believe the products might have been interacting with the products I used before. Now my hair lays nicely and I get a lot of compliments about how it looks and feels. I have used the rice cleansing powder and it really makes my face feel and look really good. It has a tightening affect! The eye gel, the different toners and moisterizers work really well also. I have used other high end products but I am amazed and hooked on this product. It is expensive but I believe well worth it. The packet gave me an idea of what the products would do. Now it is on to the full size products.</li>
            <li> They always ship very quickly. They have products you can&#x27;t buy in just any store. I really liked that they sold sample packages they made great stocking stuffers and all the product samples were a hit.</li>
            <li> Sure wish the samples I received were in line with each other. I received 2 shampoos and a conditioner. For the skincare, I received no cleansers. This is weird because cleansing is the most important step and makes the rest of the sample practically useless because the point is to see how the products work together for your skin. Its not like these were free or even at least 2 use sized samples.</li>
            <li> I say its pretty decent and good for your money since these skincare are expensive in full size. Yes I do believe these samples are small but I think of it as a treat to my skin once in a while. Hadn&#x27;t used all the samples yet but as they say, a little bit goes a long way.  It&#x27;s also nice that they shipped this with other samples like food samples or cosmetic samples. These will also make great gifts or treat for a friend.</li>
            <li> Thanks, works well with my hair</li>
            <li> Item was wonderful and arrived on time!</li>
            <li> I ordered the samples of this product because I was interested in trying the sulphate free shampoo, which is expensive. The samples are REALLY random, so you may not get ones you actually wanted to try. Most of the ones I got were things I wasn&#x27;t interested in. And I didn&#x27;t get the shampoo sample. They say you can return it for a refund, less shipping and handling, but the shipping and handling were double the cost of the product itself.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time, and I love it.  It&#x27;s a good brand and I want to continue to purchase the individual ones and make sure that it does fit my needs and it&#x27;s working. The sample size was a perfect size - good enough to give you the glimpse of what would happen if you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> These product samples are amazingly fine products.  I&#x27;m glad to have a sample before I spend the kind of money for a big size.</li>
            <li> The samples I received was really to try out the shampoo and conditioner . I have not used the samples of the other products.&lt;br /&gt;Ill start out by saying the shipping was quick and packed perfectly. The shampoo I loved and will be purchasing. It cleansed my fine/ thin curly hair well but did not strip all the moisture that most shampoos do. The conditioner did not not detangle like I expected and with the sample I was able to use it about 3 times . This is the only reason why I gave the 4 stars .</li>
            <li> This is such a great sampler set, I was curious to see how some Asian skincare products work without wanting to invest heavily in full size products. This set was perfect it is such a varied assortment of samples like moisturizer, toner, cleanser etc. and in sizes where you can actually see a full application some samples more than one application. The company is also great and sent some free extras with the order, I will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> Awesome samples to try. Buy extra to share with your friends...they&#x27;ll be sure to love them ♥♡♥</li>
            <li> I was quickly attracted to this product because of its claims of being all-natural, because it was using a new &#x27;miracle ingrediant&#x27; (rice, amongst others), and because I fell for the whole \\&quot;It sounds exotic, therefore it must work!\\&quot; thing. And, as someone who is addicted to trying to find the &#x27;perfect&#x27; skin products, this seemed like a no-brainer to try.     Before I review this though, here&#x27;s what showed up at my place when I ordered it:   1) Cleansing Foam  2) \\&quot;Special\\&quot; Cream  3) UV Base Cream  4) Eye Moisture \\&quot;Jell\\&quot; (I know how to spell Gel. But they don&#x27;t?)  5) Skin Care Cream  6) Hair Shampoo  7) Hair Treatment (Conditioner)  8) Moisturizer  9) Moisture Cream Silver  10)Toner    From the list, perhaps you can tell how ambiguous this product line is.  What am I supposed to do with all of these products? Do I need all of them to get the benefits of the product claims?     This seems like another product line that assumes that the placebo effect of WANTING it to work will actually CAUSE it to work.  (Hey, maybe if we make our products expensive, people will manage to justify their money splurge by seeing actual results!) For example, the direction for the \\&quot;Cleansing Foam\\&quot; begins \\&quot;You will not experience the dryness that often accompanies other products.  You may notice a slightly pink glow to your skin...\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Moisture Cream\\&quot; claims that it \\&quot;will absorb readily, leaving no oily residue to block the pores.\\&quot;     ...So what happens if my skin DOES become dry, and the cream DOES make me oily? Because that&#x27;s what happened.     Perhaps I should not expect results after having had only used the line once...but hey, they&#x27;re the ones who sent me teeny-tiny sample sizes that can ONLY be used once...so it seems like they think I should be impressed enough to buy more, based on these samples.     If the price seems low to you, it&#x27;s because the samples are really, really, small. And you should DEFINITELY buy the samples before buying one of the full-sized products.  I very nearly fell for the product claims and reviews enough to just get the full sizes.  \\&quot;Hey, if it comes even close to being that good, I&#x27;ll be happy!\\&quot;    Don&#x27;t. Resist the urge. Buy some samples. Maybe this works for some skin types, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately even though the shampoo has natural ingredients, it stripped my hair color :(</li>
            <li> A lots of things in the bag , and a little bag for the every thing .I can&#x27;t feel which one is good .</li>
            <li> Fantastic buy.  I am currently trying out the samples and so far they are wonderful. They also gave me some unexpected samples like candies and I got to say that I am hooked!!</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift with some other samples.  It looked very interesting.  llk</li>
            <li> This and the 10 piece HABA sample bag were such a pleasant and sweet package to receive. I ordered this months ago, but I still haven&#x27;t used all the samples so I can only write for a few. Overall, the products from this line are of good quality and I&#x27;ve enjoyed the ones I&#x27;ve tried. My favorites were the toner and serum, they felt very smooth and light on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot read Japanese, the instructions and information about each product are translated on a sheet included with your package. There was also a tea sample and a gummy candy sent...these personal touches were nice surprises and very much like in Asia.</li>

            <li> love it and will buy again if you dont raise price</li>
