            <li>and I like this one better</li>
            <li>it  could be a better chance it would stay in place.</li>
            <li>i love taking a shower after having gel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about forever now, many, many years.  </li>
            <li>and I think it dries out your scalp a lot, but it&#x27;s still my favorite for price and workability.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and comes with a lot of it, great size and takes not all that much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure its fine for hair gel</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see it and hair likes it by showing how nice it setups and smile at people.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Now a person like me has baby fine hair that never grew up.  </li>
            <li>HUGE amount</li>
            <li>It really make my curls nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it holds.  </li>
            <li>Just about as cheap as an add-on item here at Amazon, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with...</li>
            <li>Fabulous bargain.</li>
            <li>Once style is obtained, just a light mist of hairspray for any loosy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t tell you if its great on straight hair or not because i really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>My hair still looked good, but I noticed a white line on the top of my hair were</li>
            <li>My hair likes it, seems to be chemical friendly with no allergic reactions, rashes etc.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s scent was fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It looked like white flakes or maybe dandruff, which was no shock to me because I don&#x27;t think its  possible to find a perfect gel, But for the price and the hours that it worked without leaving flakes</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with L.A</li>
            <li>One of the main ingredients is water, which is good for natural hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to flake like many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and it holds up fairly well to wind, weather, and time.</li>
            <li>Like come on its big and CHEAP!!</li>
            <li>It was what i expected good product</li>
            <li>I think wax does a better job at keeping hair spiked and bundled together as it is sensitive to sweat.  </li>
            <li>And for a couple bucks it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, it works as advertised, good product, holds well.</li>
            <li>Just like any gel when it hardens if you brush your hair or whatever right after you put gel of course</li>
            <li>This gel is great for my super thick curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m ready to graduate to something a bit more professional, though.</li>
            <li>Works as well as any professional salon product and is incredibly cheap.  </li>
            <li>It was my first experience..</li>
            <li>streach other kind of gels and mousse</li>
            <li>Buy one and try it and keep it as a back up if you think you need something not so strong or flakey problems bug you .</li>
            <li>and this really works for my 2B hair.</li>
            <li>I expected more out of it.  </li>
            <li>This holds a curl very well and adds shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff holds really well.</li>
            <li>What i loved the most is that it kept my crazy curly hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very flakey once dried, but styles hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it performs decently, it gets really flaky.  </li>
            <li>So most of the days I put it up in a pony tail or leave it down, to save me aggravation and frustration.</li>
            <li>I have not found decent alternative yet.</li>
            <li>the money, it&#x27;s a decent product.  </li>
            <li>This particular day I wanted to see if the gel would hold the style I chose.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend it for wavy/curly hair people.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this gel.</li>
            <li>I tried many higher priced mousses and gels, my hair ends up frizzy and dull.</li>
            <li>Once dried in the back position, even if brushed through, the hair does a pretty good job of &amp;#34;remembering&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>idk why i never use anything for my hair only the gel, i was scared and stop right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that this gel works better on my natural hair than exspensive gels with mineral oil, such as Jam which tends to dry out my natural hair.     </li>
            <li>, I opened the yellow clear plastic bottle and squeezed a very large amount onto my hand.</li>
            <li>It was originally launched in 1987 by a local southern California hair company.</li>
            <li>Even though it did do just that as well as it smells good, but it left my hair super hard after it had dried.</li>
            <li>but since for the last year i been wearing my straight</li>
            <li>I use to use this in my teens now i am in my early 30s</li>
            <li>This gel does help to hold my ponytail in place which is natural (wavy/curly).</li>
            <li>I will suggest that you buy a big bottle so you can apply as much as you need for the style you choose.</li>
            <li>This way I could see how it worked on the top as if my hair was up in a pony tail, and down as if it was completely loose.</li>
            <li>My grandson has fine hair and likes to wear it a little on the linger side with the sides combed back.  </li>
            <li>The sizes range from 2 oz through 40 oz and you can buy it at any major retail store.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an inexpensive quality product that will hold your hair in place for at least 12 hours flake free, this will be it.</li>
            <li>When I went to the counter I was surprised to see it was only $2.99.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Just add to damp towel dried hair two or three marbles worth and act like washing hair with it.  </li>
            <li>Once dry a few hour later you can brush it out and have a great looking styled hair without the gel hard shell look.  </li>
            <li>While it dries almost unpleasantly plastically if you aren&#x27;t very careful with it, it&#x27;s a very good product overall.</li>

            <li> I waited until it dried and noticed the top of my hair was flat as if straightened and the bottom that was left loose waseven curlier than usual.</li>
            <li> This product is significantly cheaper in price then other hair gels and produces the same effect if not a better effect!  </li>
            <li> What can I say, just a sucker for pretty face looking back at me in the mirror</li>
            <li> then the normal 10+ blue sport i usually get.</li>
            <li> It is a little crispy when your hair first dries but a little scrunching</li>
            <li> Now it has be about half a year, and my hair only a tiny bit falls out in the hair,</li>
            <li> where you wanted it due to the added body, but requires occasional brushing to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold in place and made it look dry and</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different products such as Got 2 B Glued which left my hair sticky and felling as hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Then brush, or comb to style or blow dry for different affect, but then you may as well use hair spray and less gel.  </li>
            <li> I could just put some on wet hair or even dry hair.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get 18 hours out of it, but you&#x27;ll get a solid 8-10 before things start looking less put</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t shower that night or next day in morning, and scratch your head like I do a lot for some reason alone at my comp, it&#x27;s like Christmas snow at my desk on my black glass table</li>
            <li> Second day hair requires a little spritzing with a water</li>
            <li> Every other day I wash my hair and brush it while I still have conditioner in, then I towel dry, scrunch LA.</li>
            <li> then...it gave my hair that wet look</li>
            <li> It doesnt give my hair the wet look anymore.</li>
            <li> My hair looked wet and styled.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to over do it</li>
            <li> I have try other product like Marc Anthony</li>
            <li> I chose the L.A Looks for curly hair extreme hold.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake like some other gels may do when you run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> It would be worth a try since at this cost, if you really hated it you could throw it out and not be out much money -- but I am betting you will keep using it once you have tried it.  </li>
            <li> Just a dab on wet hair, it&#x27;s not to stiff or gooey.</li>
            <li> started the CG Method a week and a half ago</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and thick, which is very hard to control and keep in its place.</li>
            <li> It was not sticky or dried out.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed this product being used at a few of the places I have gotten my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Just like any other gel, it hardens like duh.</li>
            <li> The stiff part is weaker.</li>
            <li> sometimes i use gel plainly without anything else.  </li>
            <li> so it dries stiff.  </li>
            <li> when i use gel i usually saturate my hair in conditioner, or i might add a heavy hair creme or pomade to thoroughly condition my scalp and hair-</li>

            <li> I have curly hair I been using this gel for years and is great. but since for the last year i been wearing my straight i didn&#x27;t have to use it. Now i back wearing my hair curly I have try other product like Marc Anthony streach other kind of gels and mousse nothing works better than this get. I have to say this is the best gel i ever use. It really make my curls nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product is significantly cheaper in price then other hair gels and produces the same effect if not a better effect!  Always keeps my curls looking their best :)</li>
            <li> It was what i expected good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this since I&#x27;ve started gelling my hair in middle school.  I think wax does a better job at keeping hair spiked and bundled together as it is sensitive to sweat.  For the price and what it does, I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> I use to use this in my teens now i am in my early 30s and it seems different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back then...it gave my hair that wet look like i just washed my hair and the smell was great. I could just put some on wet hair or even dry hair. The only bad thing was my hair would be stiff so theres no way you would want to run a comb on that hair again until the gel is washed out. What i loved the most is that it kept my crazy curly hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now...it still smells good but the smell is weaker. It doesnt give my hair the wet look anymore. The stiff part is weaker. What i dont like is that it gets white like i have dandruff issues. Worse if i scratch my head. It makes my hair look dirty. Not a good look at all. Does not hold my curls in place anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this in my beach bag. Just to keep my hair smelling good. I dislike the fishy scent the beach water has at times. It goes in my hair and makes my stomach turn. Once i get out the water and just before i lay back on sand i reapply this while still at beach. Its like a my suncreen never leave home without this when heading to the beach.</li>
            <li> my hair s very thick and curly, and when i need it to look slick i use gel.  all gels aren&#x27;t equal let me say, but i like the no alcohol- in this gel as alcohol flakes off looking like dandruff-yuck.  also, this gel softens my hair after it wears off.  when i use gel i usually saturate my hair in conditioner, or i might add a heavy hair creme or pomade to thoroughly condition my scalp and hair- and id add gel on top.  sometimes i use gel plainly without anything else.  this gel works either way and i highly recommend it for wavy/curly hair people.  i can&#x27;t tell you if its great on straight hair or not because i really don&#x27;t know.  but it helps keep your style so its a go for me.</li>
            <li> My grandson has fine hair and likes to wear it a little on the linger side with the sides combed back.  This product works best if you add the product and just finger pick it so it dries stiff.  But if you want a softer look, you can wait till it dries and brush through it so it adds nice body.  Once dried in the back position, even if brushed through, the hair does a pretty good job of &amp;#34;remembering&amp;#34; where you wanted it due to the added body, but requires occasional brushing to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> When my hair was curly when I was younger I used this gel to define the naturallness of my curls. Even though it did do just that as well as it smells good, but it left my hair super hard after it had dried.</li>
            <li> I heard all types of comments about this gel flash back from the 80&#x27;s and decided to try it. For $1.97 at my Walmart, why not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is awesome. I do NOT get the flakes that people mentioned.  I also don&#x27;t think it makes hard hard. It is a little crispy when your hair first dries but a little scrunching and it leaves you with defined waves and curls.  Second day hair requires a little spritzing with a water bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started the CG Method a week and a half ago and this really works for my 2B hair. No flakes, scalp is enjoying it and I plan on buying more.  And for a couple bucks it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this band is a local store so I grabbed it here, good price for the product and I like this one better then the normal 10+ blue sport i usually get.</li>
            <li> This so thick that my hair was glued</li>
            <li> This gel does help to hold my ponytail in place which is natural (wavy/curly). One of the main ingredients is water, which is good for natural hair. After saturating my hair with water, leave in conditioner, I use LA Looks gel to help stretch my hair. Sometimes I even rub some extra to extend my ponytail until I receive the desired look. It also helps with shine, moisture. I use  it sparingly though. I&#x27;ve noticed that this gel works better on my natural hair than exspensive gels with mineral oil, such as Jam which tends to dry out my natural hair.     Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This gel is great for my super thick curly/wavy hair. Every other day I wash my hair and brush it while I still have conditioner in, then I towel dry, scrunch LA. Looks in with a T-shirt or towel. When I am done my hair is looking like Shakira&#x27;s hair. People always compliment it and ask what I use. I tried many higher priced mousses and gels, my hair ends up frizzy and dull. I highly recommend this gel. Whenever a store is out of stock, I always fear they are discontinued and I have bad hair days without it. I just hope this gel sticks around forever. I have not found decent alternative yet. This is my number one beauty product of all time, and the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this hair gel for years at Walmart.  It&#x27;s cheap and it holds.  Just about as cheap as an add-on item here at Amazon, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with... The People of Walmart. \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it performs decently, it gets really flaky.  If you get any in your sideburns you&#x27;ll regret it for the rest of the day and will be picking out chucks or scraping off your ears which is gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, it&#x27;s a decent product.  I think I&#x27;m ready to graduate to something a bit more professional, though.</li>
            <li> I expected more out of it.  Still didn&#x27;t hold the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and thick, which is very hard to control and keep in its place. It is difficult and expensive for me to straighten my hair. So most of the days I put it up in a pony tail or leave it down, to save me aggravation and frustration. I have used a lot of different products such as Got 2 B Glued which left my hair sticky and felling as hard as a rock. I have also tried Gorilla gel which had the same effects as Got 2 B, but with a lot of white flakes. Lastly, I tried La Bella styling gel which didn&#x27;t work at all. It didn&#x27;t hold in place and made it look dry and unruly.&lt;br /&gt; I asked one of my friends  what she used on her hair since we have the same type of hair. She told me about L.A Looks styling gel. L.A Looks styling gel is made and distributed by the Dial Corporation in Irvine, CA. It was originally launched in 1987 by a local southern California hair company. I decided to give it a try so I went to my local Walgreens store. I noticed there was a variety for different types of hair. I chose the L.A Looks for curly hair extreme hold. When I went to the counter I was surprised to see it was only $2.99.&lt;br /&gt;When I arrived at my house I washed my hair, I then combed it until all my hair was untangled, I opened the yellow clear plastic bottle and squeezed a very large amount onto my hand. It felt sticky and gooey. I took a sniff, it&#x27;s scent was fresh and clean. I then continued to apply it from the root to the tip of my hair. I believe that if you apply gel to every part of your hair it  could be a better chance it would stay in place. This particular day I wanted to see if the gel would hold the style I chose. So I decided to put my hair halfway up and the rest down.&lt;br /&gt; This way I could see how it worked on the top as if my hair was up in a pony tail, and down as if it was completely loose. My hair looked wet and styled. I waited until it dried and noticed the top of my hair was flat as if straightened and the bottom that was left loose waseven curlier than usual. Amazingly my hair still looked as if I just had did it.  I was impressed! It was not sticky or dried out.&lt;br /&gt; I went on with my daily activities. After about 12 hours I came home and looked in the mirror. My hair still looked good, but I noticed a white line on the top of my hair were it was pulled back. It looked like white flakes or maybe dandruff, which was no shock to me because I don&#x27;t think its  possible to find a perfect gel, But for the price and the hours that it worked without leaving flakes it&#x27;s worth it. Overall I am very satisfied with L.A Looks styling gel. If you are looking for an inexpensive quality product that will hold your hair in place for at least 12 hours flake free, this will be it. I will suggest that you buy a big bottle so you can apply as much as you need for the style you choose. The sizes range from 2 oz through 40 oz and you can buy it at any major retail store. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. Perez</li>
            <li> No flakes or anything. I like this product...I think I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and I still have about 25% of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Leave white filter on hair, cant use it on my brown hair</li>
            <li> This holds a curl very well and adds shine to the hair.  Works as well as any professional salon product and is incredibly cheap.  It would be worth a try since at this cost, if you really hated it you could throw it out and not be out much money -- but I am betting you will keep using it once you have tried it.  Fabulous bargain.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it works as advertised, good product, holds well. If you have thick hair you&#x27;ll like this item. Easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> Now a person like me has baby fine hair that never grew up.  What&#x27;s a guy to do?  Along comes Mega Mega Hold Styling Gel to save the day,  I use it after washing my hair, just a bit will do.  My hair likes it, seems to be chemical friendly with no allergic reactions, rashes etc. Can&#x27;t see it and hair likes it by showing how nice it setups and smile at people.  What can I say, just a sucker for pretty face looking back at me in the mirror LOL!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my curly hair! I put it in then diffuse and the look stays for a couple of days</li>
            <li> While it dries almost unpleasantly plastically if you aren&#x27;t very careful with it, it&#x27;s a very good product overall. It doesn&#x27;t seem to flake like many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and it holds up fairly well to wind, weather, and time. You won&#x27;t get 18 hours out of it, but you&#x27;ll get a solid 8-10 before things start looking less put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed this product being used at a few of the places I have gotten my hair cut. It seems to be something that professionals (at least those that I can afford to see, in the $15-25 haircut range) trust to some degree, if that means anything.</li>
            <li> Just like any other gel, it hardens like duh. But i&#x27;ve seen people complain saying it looks like dandruff like.. no. Just like any gel when it hardens if you brush your hair or whatever right after you put gel of course it starts to break. I like the way it makes my hair shine and it smells great! Like come on its big and CHEAP!! p.s i love taking a shower after having gel in my hair it makes it feel smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-updated-&lt;br /&gt;i stop using the gel after acouple weeks went by, i soon notice my hair would fall off in the shower HUGE amount idk why i never use anything for my hair only the gel, i was scared and stop right away. Now it has be about half a year, and my hair only a tiny bit falls out in the hair, idk if any of this happened to anyone</li>
            <li> my CVS stopped stocking it, but it works the best of all the brands I have tried. Just a dab on wet hair, it&#x27;s not to stiff or gooey.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the strength rated 10 model but I got this for $2 as an add on from Amazon. Works nearly as well as the 10 and was an awesome price. I use it to spike the front of my hair and it holds well. It doesn&#x27;t flake like some other gels may do when you run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> we have used this styling gel for years.  It has always done the job.  Great for those late-risers who need to get out the door in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds really well. I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years and it seems to be the same formula. You just have to be careful not to over do it or you end up with crunchy hair. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> LA Looks makes me look RAD.</li>
            <li> To  be fair I bought it to replace a more expensive brow gel to hold the pencil color but it didn&#x27;t work as well.  I&#x27;m sure its fine for hair gel</li>
            <li> camed taped and cracked</li>
            <li> i received this product on time... very good. Excellent..It was my first experience..but really awesome. I would advice my friends to buy too..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about forever now, many, many years.  It is cheap and comes with a lot of it, great size and takes not all that much.  I agree with the one review though, it&#x27;s very flakey once dried, but styles hair nicely.  Just add to damp towel dried hair two or three marbles worth and act like washing hair with it.  Then brush, or comb to style or blow dry for different affect, but then you may as well use hair spray and less gel.  Once style is obtained, just a light mist of hairspray for any loosy&#x27;s.  Once dry a few hour later you can brush it out and have a great looking styled hair without the gel hard shell look.  But if you don&#x27;t shower that night or next day in morning, and scratch your head like I do a lot for some reason alone at my comp, it&#x27;s like Christmas snow at my desk on my black glass table and it&#x27;s really gross.  So if you don&#x27;t mind a dadruff looking head and I think it dries out your scalp a lot, but it&#x27;s still my favorite for price and workability.  Buy one and try it and keep it as a back up if you think you need something not so strong or flakey problems bug you .</li>
