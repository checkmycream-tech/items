            <li>They are very wispy and cute though-</li>
            <li>#523 are my absolute favorites, I also love #82.</li>
            <li>there was an issue w/ shipping, but the reseller replied quickly and re-sent my lashes in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>These are so soft and light you don&#x27;t even feel like they&#x27;re there!</li>

            <li>so pretty.</li>

            <li>Pretty much and Provide comfort to the eye</li>
            <li>fast shipping and the quality of lashes is good.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>These are a great pair of eyelashes for beginners because the band is clear, thin, and flexible.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love red cherry lashes, 100% human hair, easy to apply, don&#x27;t feel heavy on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I just peeled off the glue from the band and they looked just as new as when I took them out of the package.</li>
            <li>for me, i like dramatic lashes, but these are still noticeable and charming.</li>
            <li>This is the first and last I&#x27;ll buy this product.</li>
            <li>These look natural enough but also make you look like you have long, thick beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>I love these eyelashes for everyday use, not so much &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking because they are a bit long..</li>
            <li>I used the clear DUO lash adhesive</li>
            <li>It looks really natural, and I wear them up to 4 times for a pair.</li>
            <li>came early.</li>
            <li>The look is natural but is dense enough to bold-up a nude-y look.</li>

These are a great pair of eyelashes for beginners because the band is clear, thin, and flexible. I used the clear DUO lash adhesive and they stuck on all day. Very easy to apply and it curved perfectly to my eyes. At the end of the day, I just peeled off the glue from the band and they looked just as new as when I took them out of the package.</li>

            <li> This style is longer than the usual pair I wear #48 at first I didn&#x27;t think they would look good on  me or that I probably had to cut them but I&#x27;m very pleased with the outcome they fit like a glove I actually prefer my #523 than my #48 only because they look very natural&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying bigger bundles</li>

            <li> awesome price. came early. great quality!</li>
            <li> Great long lashes without over doing ir</li>
            <li> These are not natural-looking lashes BECAUSE they are so long. They are very wispy and cute though- not chunky are cartoon-like.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the quality of lashes is good.&lt;br /&gt;The style of the lashes matches what I was looking for.  The photo on shown is samll and it looks greenish.  The lashes are black and not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> these lashes or a bit longer than I expected. I did not realize that when I order them however the quality is great</li>
            <li> I love red cherry lashes, 100% human hair, easy to apply, don&#x27;t feel heavy on your eyelids. These look natural enough but also make you look like you have long, thick beautiful lashes. #523 are my absolute favorites, I also love #82. #43 are great, but I like these better. Kim Kardashian loves red cherry lashes :) plus the price is wonderful and you get at least 3 pair at a time. They also have bigger packages. Even if not Amazon prime, they always arrive very quick. Packed well and cute :) I order them often, and in different styles. Highly highly recommend these to anyone who loves to have gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li> This is okay. It&#x27;s like a two times wear. I bought a better product from a company through AMAZON that lasts up to 8 times the wear with proper care. This is the first and last I&#x27;ll buy this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty much and Provide comfort to the eye</li>
