            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t make me feel fresh and clean after my showers.  </li>
            <li>When using this body wash i feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t over powering, simply a clean fresh smell.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s also quick to lather.</li>
            <li>the inside wash stuff comes out too quick.</li>
            <li>This actually feels like a better quality than most.</li>
            <li>Super bubbly and creamy</li>
            <li>It foams up super well when I apply it to my bath poof.</li>

            <li>I love how it lathers, rinses clean and my skin is very soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be more like lotion than body wash, and it&#x27;s also very slippery (if that&#x27;s the right word).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it since Olay first made it available on the market -- years now.</li>

            <li>Very creamy, but has a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li>this has a strong cheap-smelling perfume odor, which i don&#x27;t care much for.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>They are worth the money and leave your skin feeling clean, supple, soft, and healthy.  </li>

            <li>Smells nice and able to store upside down</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells and keeps your skin soft!</li>
            <li>Using continuously, improved the overall health and nourishment of my skin even more!</li>
            <li>It leaves my sensitive skin feeling very smooth and pampered.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle yet fresh and soothing, and the body wash makes a nice amount of suds to make you feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more for my $, but the convenience was nice.</li>
            <li>The bottle has an easy open top and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li>it even leaves an amazing scent on the skin that last for hours</li>
            <li>So smooth and creamy, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and helps keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>But honestly I did not discern any lasting effects.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it lives my skin soft</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money 💵.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Shea  butter and this lotion leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li>I love the smell and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>and wow, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the most moisturizing body wash that I&#x27;ve tried, and I have tried a LOT of them.  </li>
            <li>love how it leaves my skin soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Love the product, it just helps rejuvenate my skin to keep it young looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it both morning and night to stay really fresh all day..</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month of using it I rarely need body lotion.</li>
            <li>how soft and smooth it feels as it cleans and moisturizes you from head to toe!</li>
            <li>This product was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li>Still need lotion after use but nice overall.</li>
            <li>I love how silky soft I feel after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and made my skin soft.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a gamble buying scented things you haven&#x27;t actually smelled, but I took a chance on this one because I&#x27;ve generally liked the stuff Olay puts out.  </li>
            <li>They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!!</li>
            <li>Good, but a very small size similar to a sample size Great product.</li>
            <li>It works really well, and always leave my skin smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I loved St. Ives Vanilla but they have reformulated and combined some other ingredients</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t think this one smells as good as other Olay washes.  </li>
            <li>Not overly &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; with just the right amount of lather.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it is right because I dont need  to moisturize right after the shower...</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>My first time trying this Olay Ultra Body Wash.  So far, I love the smell and</li>
            <li>After the first use, you can already feel the difference - soft and smooth skin!</li>
            <li>good product left my skin clean and smooth not looking dry, truly does mooisturizes.</li>
            <li>Scent is not overpoweringly feminine and the moisturising action is welcome in dry conditions -</li>
            <li>It really provides a good lather, and I didn&#x27;t feel too dry after using it, but I still needed to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have used several different body washes over the years, and Olay Ultra Moisture is the BEST product if you want soft skin.  </li>
            <li>It has always smelled so good and left my skin soft!</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel so very smooth, it is not irritating to my sensitive skin and the scent is like music to my nostrils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other varieties but this one works best on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This body wash cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing body wash for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>For example it is selling for $5.35 currently yet with getting the great deal as I explained above</li>
            <li>I have tried so many body washes, trying to find something that did not dry my skin out and without having to use lotions or skin moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Olay with moisture has a nice smell cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very loud and cheap smelling.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smell is overly strong and bottle seemed to be only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Really satisfied with this moisturizer, I have been using a small dabble a day and it keeps the wonderful coconut scent all day long along with keeping my skin being incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>You can certainly tell it leaves your skin soft &amp; clean!</li>
            <li>this is my first body wash since that change</li>
            <li>Feeling pretty foolish...</li>
            <li>my favorite overall body wash</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>AND MY BODY FEELS SO SMOOTH AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>

            <li>Although it does cleanse well and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>personally I like aveeno body wash better.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, though, turned around my whole experience!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several body washes, but this one is one of my top 5 I like to use in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skins feels pampered though, so I do really like it!</li>
            <li>This seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and found it cleaned my skin and left it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the scent and have ordered it several times through Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>- this is a real treat in the shower!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>This product is great for shaving because it is so thick.</li>
            <li>I thought at first it&#x27;s a lotion</li>
            <li>then I really am!</li>
            <li>It has a light creamy feel and leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing bodywash!</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth that I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion after showering if I choose not to.</li>
            <li>I love that I can smell it an hour later when I go to bed.</li>
            <li>have recently subscribed to this bodywash subscription but have been using this brand since many years.</li>
            <li>Totally my mistake but make sure  </li>
            <li>My grandson wants some for his house!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it moisturizes my skin exactly, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture either.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely continue purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>much lather!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth as well.</li>
            <li>It really made me appreciate my Olay!</li>
            <li>I love all Olay body wash and this is no different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to body wash.  </li>
            <li>This allows you to skip the step of lotion later while feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed by the size as I can read, it clearly states 13.5 Oz in the freaking title.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for something with a mild scent since most of my other washes are fruity or vanilla scented.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I come out of the shower feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Olay keeps my skin moisturized, clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Most of the times, I get this at Amazon much cheaper than I can buy in my local supermarket.</li>
            <li>hate to use lotion so this body wash is perfect to nourish my skin :)</li>
            <li>Very good body wash, can&#x27;t go wrong, I definitely prefer this to most others.</li>
            <li>POSITIVELY NOURISHING® HYDRATING BODY WASH</li>
            <li>I have always liked body washes and I really like this one coming from a 14 year old female.</li>
            <li>is very well suited with it&#x27;s whole line of shower items!</li>
            <li>I have to say this one has been my favorite for quite a long time now.</li>
            <li>My seven year old also loves to use this body wash because of the sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Good for dried skin~!</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling good after a long hot shower.  </li>
            <li>I have had good experience in the past with Olay products, but not this one.</li>
            <li>This product is good as usual for Olay.</li>

            <li>This did help with my dry, itchy, winter skin alot better than dove did.</li>
            <li>however, the odor doesn&#x27;t last long and the moisturizing is good.  </li>
            <li>I just bought 3 large bottles at Sam&#x27;s for $11.88</li>

            <li>my skin is very dry in the winter/cold; I have used and love the Oil of Olay Ribbons body washes, but I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and creamy and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li>and I think I can get the huge bottle at walmart for the same price.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>What a smooth feeling left on My skin ...</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The body wash is silky smooth, lathers well and really does leave my sensitive skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>like the smell much either</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like the feel of moisturizers on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is so much nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It leaves my entire body feeling silky smooth and smells</li>
            <li>It foams up very well on the loofah as well.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li>I really like all the products from Olay.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really moisturized.  </li>
            <li>And the tub floor becomes very sticky.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of an elderly woman who doesn&#x27;t realize she has used to much perfume.</li>
            <li>The consistency is not too &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; like the Dove its a lil thicker but not too much.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I signed up for the subscribe and save program which mails me this body wash every month so that I am never without it.</li>
            <li>So I am very picky when it comes to my body wash.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i really wish i hadn&#x27;t gotten this scent, though -</li>
            <li>This body wash is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>This product truly helps so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this body wash!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing product and</li>
            <li>The shea butter really does make your skin softer.</li>
            <li>It has just absolutely enhanced my showering experience.</li>
            <li>but it was packaged and bagged very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizing body wash.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is moderate in the shower but light soon after you leave that area.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t make much of a stink then this will work for you.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin is the key.</li>
            <li>(you do not even have to apply lotion after) and the mixture stays on the whole day.  </li>
            <li>You get so much lather from about a dime size.</li>
            <li>Also, it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>Absolute must have.</li>
            <li>but it is very flowery and is displeasing.</li>
            <li>It is very overpowering this fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my hands really oily and sticky feeling</li>
            <li>Leaves too much of a film on skin.</li>
            <li>so i know that it really works on my skin.</li>
            <li>I would give it 4 stars but the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li>Very sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb I to skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and so I chose Olay for its&#x27; reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash</li>
            <li>and i feel like it moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll fee like you&#x27;re washing with lotion, but it really cleans well and is everything you&#x27;d want in a moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot to get your whole body</li>
            <li>Keeps it much softer, I&#x27;m not itchy, etc.</li>
            <li>I dont have to use as much lotion as before.</li>
            <li>and I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and is very creamy,</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>This is just really too much.</li>
            <li>use it a few times a wk and a cheapo kind the rest of the week.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it makes my skin SO soft that I can still see it the next day and</li>
            <li>and I love how soft this makes my skin especially since this winter has been so ruff on the skin!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now back to enjoying long, very hot steamy shower with no difficulty.</li>
            <li>Really leaves my skin feeling moisturizer much more than other body washes or bar soap.  </li>
            <li>Use it daily my skins soft and I feel clean!</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great body wash that I will continue using year round!</li>
            <li>i felt clean and moisturized at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I only have one issue with this body wash, it doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>The deal breaker for me is the overpowering flower scent, it is extremely strong, which would be okay if I liked the scent, I hate the scent.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and actually moisturizes my skin (that is usually extremely dry) as promised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Olay products lately, having discovered a face wash via Amazon as well.</li>
            <li>nice scent and did well moisturizing my skin this past winter</li>
            <li>The small is really nice</li>
            <li>i will use the full bottle, but i will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li>Not in an overly sweet, cloying way but enough to linger for maybe an hour after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought it smelled like an old grandma.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how soft and nourished my skin felt afterward for the whole day!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make a lot of suds and was kind of slick..</li>
            <li>And hands down favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>It suds a little more than the Dove but not as much as Id like.</li>
            <li>This is one body wash that has always been consistent, even for my sensitive skin, therefore, I will definitely purchase more in the future!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, I can still feel silky smooth hours after the shower.</li>
            <li>it was a decent product.</li>
            <li>I like the primary fragrance of it, and it lathers up nice, but as I rinse, there is a weird smell that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and smooth, and my beard feels nicer too</li>
            <li>this has a nice light scent to it, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay brand.  </li>
            <li>I think I will pay a little more for a better product next time...which I think will actually be a better overall &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; (using less).</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing...leaves skin soft!</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>It is very  moisturizing  writing and feels soft on my body!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>

            <li>but this stunk to high heaven.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much because it does go on so smoothly that it&#x27;s easy to use a little and make it go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these, can&#x27;t really say that it&#x27;s moisturizing for me personally because I have really , really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will say that the price in this product fluctuates wildly!!</li>
            <li>and you have sensitive skin, treat your skin and try it!!</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin so soft and moisturized!!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling extra clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Body Wash, hands down!  </li>
            <li>I really like how soft this make my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great body product, you can not go wrong with this moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li>It smells like old ladies, but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this product instead of my normal soap for a while now.  </li>
            <li>The normal size is about 24oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the heavy lather...</li>
            <li>This was well worth it, especially at its price of 3$ !!!!</li>
            <li>I used to think of it as an old lady brand from the famous pink face lotion (which I much like, especially the scent), but I&#x27;m a modern convert.</li>
            <li>Oh it suds like normal too.</li>
            <li>My mother has psoriasis and this is pretty much the only body wash she will use even!</li>
            <li>Most of it was wasted out</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizing lotion that I found after a lot of false promises .Great price!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the subtle and clean scent.</li>
            <li>My entire family loves this creamy, moisturizing body wash-not oily, just enough lather that rinses off easily--</li>
            <li>It actually looks like lotion, but lathers right up with water.</li>
            <li>I had quick shipping with this, never had to wait long.</li>
            <li>Also it latters great, which is a big thing for me since if a body wash doesn&#x27;t latter I usually don&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
            <li>Olay is a brand I can trust to live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>What can I say about Olay products, new?  </li>
            <li>Now I have to buy this on s&amp;s because my Lady cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>Never really felt clean using a body wash until i tried this one.</li>
            <li>If your skin is super dry</li>
            <li>Because I left a genuine 4-star review, I was not compensated my additional ten dollars.</li>
            <li>My gorlfriend loves when I give jet a foot fub with this and it leaves her legs very soft.</li>
            <li>I am VERY sensitive to smells so that is always a concern for me.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with how creamy this is.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 and it makes me feel like an very old person.</li>
            <li>However, it is rated a 5 on EWG.org&#x27;s skin deep guide which is slightly higher than I would like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually like the scent of Shea Butter in anything because it&#x27;s almost always too potent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s non-irritating for my skin, yet keeps it soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft when I use this!</li>
            <li>I prefer this over the dove sensitive skin body wash!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>As someone who normally can&#x27;t be bothered to put on lotion, this keeps my skin soft without thinking about it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have a chance to buy it in a small size bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavily fragranced, but it does have a nice, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>,it makes my face complexion beautiful,glowing soft and skin looks brand new</li>
            <li>It is very thick and creamy and I love it!</li>
            <li>She likes using it, but I think it has an odd scent that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy.</li>
            <li>As expected; quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have been pretty loyal to Dove Body Wash for about the past 10 years, but Amazon has a killer deal on this stuff</li>
            <li>The smell can be too strong for some people, but I personally love it because smells like an expensive french fragrance!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m currently suffering from very severe dry skin right now for some reason.</li>
            <li>, so I use a little extra sometimes to get more foamy bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have used Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash With Shea Butter for years and really like the product, but be aware that this is the small bottle and not the large (23.6 oz) bottle.</li>
            <li>We have used Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash With Shea Butter for years and really like the product, but be aware that this is the small bottle and not the large (23.6 oz) bottle.</li>
            <li>If you are fragrance sensitive, this is not the product for you.  </li>

            <li>After a week, my skin had transformed into soft, supple looking skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>This body wash is very soothing, as it contain an entire container of moisturizer.</li>

            <li>, I feel soft.</li>
            <li>It was always thought to be for old people (which is who I always saw using it when I myself was a teenager.)</li>
            <li>Well I suppose I&#x27;m one of those old people now because I bought this</li>

            <li>But leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Lots of soft lather with this product.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>can really recommend it.. definitely to tackle the dryness, dunno</li>
            <li>It only takes a quarter sized dollop (and that&#x27;s still a bit much) to lather up and use all over.  </li>
            <li>leaves body so so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>but saw the Sensitive formula and thought I&#x27;d give it</li>
            <li>One squirt of this on my loofah last the whole shower.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I melted some 100% Natural Shea Butter that I purchased on Amazon and poured it in the body wash.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I no longer smell like a old moldy cucumber dipped in sewage.</li>
            <li>It was always thought to be for old people (which is who I always saw using it when I myself was a teenager.)</li>
            <li>Well I suppose I&#x27;m one of those old people now because I bought this</li>
            <li>leaving my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose or skin.</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t want to waste it you have to mix in 1:1 ratio of water and shake it before every use , enough for 2-3 more weeks.</li>
            <li>I do not know why Amazon has poor prices for such a good product.</li>
            <li>This smells like my great aunt took a bath with a perfumed &amp;#34;bath bomb&amp;#34; and then rolled around in a mixture of old lady perfume before dressing and spritzing herself with more terrible smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>If you plan it right, you can get this high quality body wash for less than $2 here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely dry location and require body soaps that are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or make you break out (like some rich face wash) either.</li>
            <li>them soaps are very harsh andbto strong for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for everyday use and it&#x27;s such a treat as it leaves my normally very dry skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>AS I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE A SMALL AMOUNT</li>
            <li>Body wash is important to me because we live in a hot climate, and sudsing up is necessary at the end of every day, at least if I want to maintain all my relationships!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and using this in my shower gives my skin a little bit more moisture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this particular item does not produce as much foam and soapiness as other brands</li>
            <li>No other bodywash can compare to this brand!</li>
            <li>Fragrance was very nice, not overwhelming as with some bar soaps, a plus because of my husband&#x27;s delicate nose.</li>
            <li>This is smaller than a normal bottle</li>
            <li>I think other reviewers are exaggerating slightly when they say it can replace the post-shower lotion, but maybe I&#x27;m more demanding when it comes to skin hydration.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding this specific scent in Olay body wash though, and was pleased to find it here on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer from extremely dry skin and this stuff has really helped a lot.</li>
            <li>the product comes out of is quite large, so I&#x27;ve gone through almost an entire bottle in about 2 weeks, whereas a bottle of Nivea extra sensitive may last 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>This is ok but the bottle is real small.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a major smell.  </li>
            <li>have skin problems and is very dry this although it doesnt lather that much its because it overcompensates with the butter.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t leave my body feeling tight which is important since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I used to use Nivea extra sensitive body wash, and then would need to apply lotion after my shower.</li>
            <li>but it turns out that my old body wash wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all and was actually drying my skin out!</li>
            <li>This version of Olay is Moisturizing, so it helps put some moisture back on your body as you&#x27;re washing your natural oils away.  </li>
            <li>Was smaller bottle than I thought, was surprised when it came.</li>
            <li>Skin soft with a quiet fragrance.</li>
            <li>i will be purchasing it in the near future.</li>
            <li>But I smell like an old spanish lady after I use it.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive here, though.</li>
            <li>The texture is thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>After a shower it leaves a faint nice smell.</li>
            <li>It has a strong perfume type fragrance, which surprised me due to the rather plain looking bottle.</li>
            <li>It came out to about the price of hand soap on sale, yet this is so much richer, it doesn&#x27;t dry as much as regular soap.</li>
            <li>i am not a super model, in fact i am not attractive, but the cream makes me feel good</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive body but am able to use this daily (or multiple times a day in the summer) without breaking out, over drying, or it changing my pH causing disasters that other soaps have caused me in the past.</li>
            <li>I have to say normally my skin would be visibly dry</li>
            <li>I usually like shea butter items because it has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no dry skin here!</li>
            <li>I use a special scrubber towel with this, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>No other product works, including the generic versions of this body wash.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily tiny, but It&#x27;s not as large as other Olay body moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Not too strong or weak.</li>
            <li>-- I now simply and consistently every day without fail use the full bevy of my Olay products; from Olay Regenerist at night when I sleep and this Olay shea butter body wash every morning when I shower or soak in the bath.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and helps keep it soft</li>
            <li>I swim frequently so my skin does get dry</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for your Black Friday sale.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super crazy about the scent, but it works well and was a great price with coupon and sub &amp; save.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive and dry skin, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and I don&#x27;t feel soapy or dry after showering!</li>
            <li>it moisturizes just right, the shea butter smells strong, and i can say my skin is a little less dry than usual</li>
            <li>I get very dry skin in the winter, with frequent itching and cracking</li>
            <li>It feels lovely on my skin and is very thick!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest buying other scents or not buying new scents from online.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells divine, a little goes a long way, and it is absolutely moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I had come from a bad experience from buying a dove body soap, which seemed like liquified bar soap, not in a good way.</li>

            <li> This is, by far, the most moisturizing body wash that I&#x27;ve tried, and I have tried a LOT of them.  </li>
            <li> love how it leaves my skin soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Love the product, it just helps rejuvenate my skin to keep it young looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it both morning and night to stay really fresh all day..</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of using it I rarely need body lotion.</li>
            <li> how soft and smooth it feels as it cleans and moisturizes you from head to toe!</li>
            <li> This product was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Still need lotion after use but nice overall.</li>
            <li> I love how silky soft I feel after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and made my skin soft.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a gamble buying scented things you haven&#x27;t actually smelled, but I took a chance on this one because I&#x27;ve generally liked the stuff Olay puts out.  </li>
            <li> They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!!</li>
            <li> Good, but a very small size similar to a sample size Great product.</li>
            <li> It works really well, and always leave my skin smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I loved St. Ives Vanilla but they have reformulated and combined some other ingredients</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t think this one smells as good as other Olay washes.  </li>
            <li> Not overly &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; with just the right amount of lather.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it is right because I dont need  to moisturize right after the shower...</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this Olay Ultra Body Wash.  So far, I love the smell and</li>
            <li> After the first use, you can already feel the difference - soft and smooth skin!</li>
            <li> good product left my skin clean and smooth not looking dry, truly does mooisturizes.</li>
            <li> Scent is not overpoweringly feminine and the moisturising action is welcome in dry conditions -</li>
            <li> It really provides a good lather, and I didn&#x27;t feel too dry after using it, but I still needed to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have used several different body washes over the years, and Olay Ultra Moisture is the BEST product if you want soft skin.  </li>
            <li> It has always smelled so good and left my skin soft!</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel so very smooth, it is not irritating to my sensitive skin and the scent is like music to my nostrils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other varieties but this one works best on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This body wash cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing body wash for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> For example it is selling for $5.35 currently yet with getting the great deal as I explained above</li>
            <li> I have tried so many body washes, trying to find something that did not dry my skin out and without having to use lotions or skin moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Olay with moisture has a nice smell cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very loud and cheap smelling.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smell is overly strong and bottle seemed to be only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> Really satisfied with this moisturizer, I have been using a small dabble a day and it keeps the wonderful coconut scent all day long along with keeping my skin being incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> You can certainly tell it leaves your skin soft &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> this is my first body wash since that change</li>
            <li> Feeling pretty foolish...</li>
            <li> my favorite overall body wash</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> AND MY BODY FEELS SO SMOOTH AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> will most definitely keep on buying</li>
            <li> Although it does cleanse well and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After using it, my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> personally I like aveeno body wash better.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> , though, turned around my whole experience!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several body washes, but this one is one of my top 5 I like to use in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skins feels pampered though, so I do really like it!</li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and found it cleaned my skin and left it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the scent and have ordered it several times through Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> - this is a real treat in the shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> This product is great for shaving because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it&#x27;s a lotion</li>
            <li> then I really am!</li>
            <li> It has a light creamy feel and leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing bodywash!</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth that I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion after showering if I choose not to.</li>
            <li> I love that I can smell it an hour later when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> have recently subscribed to this bodywash subscription but have been using this brand since many years.</li>
            <li> Totally my mistake but make sure  </li>
            <li> My grandson wants some for his house!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it moisturizes my skin exactly, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture either.</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely continue purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> much lather!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth as well.</li>
            <li> It really made me appreciate my Olay!</li>
            <li> I love all Olay body wash and this is no different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to body wash.  </li>
            <li> This allows you to skip the step of lotion later while feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed by the size as I can read, it clearly states 13.5 Oz in the freaking title.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something with a mild scent since most of my other washes are fruity or vanilla scented.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I come out of the shower feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Olay keeps my skin moisturized, clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Most of the times, I get this at Amazon much cheaper than I can buy in my local supermarket.</li>
            <li> hate to use lotion so this body wash is perfect to nourish my skin :)</li>
            <li> Very good body wash, can&#x27;t go wrong, I definitely prefer this to most others.</li>
            <li> POSITIVELY NOURISHING® HYDRATING BODY WASH</li>
            <li> I have always liked body washes and I really like this one coming from a 14 year old female.</li>
            <li> is very well suited with it&#x27;s whole line of shower items!</li>
            <li> I have to say this one has been my favorite for quite a long time now.</li>
            <li> My seven year old also loves to use this body wash because of the sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Good for dried skin~!</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling good after a long hot shower.  </li>
            <li> I have had good experience in the past with Olay products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> This product is good as usual for Olay.</li>
            <li> We usually get it at Costco, but this was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love the smoothness of this body wash and it doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This did help with my dry, itchy, winter skin alot better than dove did.</li>
            <li> however, the odor doesn&#x27;t last long and the moisturizing is good.  </li>
            <li> I just bought 3 large bottles at Sam&#x27;s for $11.88</li>
            <li> I just bought 3 large bottles at Sam&#x27;s for $11.88</li>

            <li> I am 65 with very dry skin and after using this product,my skin is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry in the winter/cold; I have used and love the Oil of Olay Ribbons body washes, but I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li> and I think I can get the huge bottle at walmart for the same price.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This stuff really lathers up well.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes well and my skin feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> This body wash is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and i may end up coming back to this one as my primary selection</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel so much softer to the touch .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> What a smooth feeling left on My skin ...</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The body wash is silky smooth, lathers well and really does leave my sensitive skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> like the smell much either</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like the feel of moisturizers on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is so much nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It leaves my entire body feeling silky smooth and smells</li>
            <li> It foams up very well on the loofah as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li> I really like all the products from Olay.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin really moisturized.  </li>
            <li> And the tub floor becomes very sticky.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of an elderly woman who doesn&#x27;t realize she has used to much perfume.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not too &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; like the Dove its a lil thicker but not too much.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I signed up for the subscribe and save program which mails me this body wash every month so that I am never without it.</li>
            <li> So I am very picky when it comes to my body wash.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i really wish i hadn&#x27;t gotten this scent, though -</li>
            <li> This body wash is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> This product truly helps so much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this body wash!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing product and</li>
            <li> The shea butter really does make your skin softer.</li>
            <li> It has just absolutely enhanced my showering experience.</li>
            <li> but it was packaged and bagged very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizing body wash.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is moderate in the shower but light soon after you leave that area.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t make much of a stink then this will work for you.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin is the key.</li>
            <li> (you do not even have to apply lotion after) and the mixture stays on the whole day.  </li>
            <li> You get so much lather from about a dime size.</li>
            <li> Also, it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> Absolute must have.</li>
            <li> but it is very flowery and is displeasing.</li>
            <li> It is very overpowering this fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands really oily and sticky feeling</li>
            <li> Leaves too much of a film on skin.</li>
            <li> so i know that it really works on my skin.</li>
            <li> I would give it 4 stars but the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb I to skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and so I chose Olay for its&#x27; reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash</li>
            <li> and i feel like it moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll fee like you&#x27;re washing with lotion, but it really cleans well and is everything you&#x27;d want in a moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need a lot to get your whole body</li>
            <li> Keeps it much softer, I&#x27;m not itchy, etc.</li>
            <li> I dont have to use as much lotion as before.</li>
            <li> and I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and is very creamy,</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is just really too much.</li>
            <li> use it a few times a wk and a cheapo kind the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it makes my skin SO soft that I can still see it the next day and</li>
            <li> and I love how soft this makes my skin especially since this winter has been so ruff on the skin!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now back to enjoying long, very hot steamy shower with no difficulty.</li>
            <li> Really leaves my skin feeling moisturizer much more than other body washes or bar soap.  </li>
            <li> Use it daily my skins soft and I feel clean!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great body wash that I will continue using year round!</li>
            <li> i felt clean and moisturized at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I only have one issue with this body wash, it doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li> The deal breaker for me is the overpowering flower scent, it is extremely strong, which would be okay if I liked the scent, I hate the scent.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and actually moisturizes my skin (that is usually extremely dry) as promised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Olay products lately, having discovered a face wash via Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> nice scent and did well moisturizing my skin this past winter</li>
            <li> The small is really nice</li>
            <li> i will use the full bottle, but i will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Not in an overly sweet, cloying way but enough to linger for maybe an hour after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought it smelled like an old grandma.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how soft and nourished my skin felt afterward for the whole day!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make a lot of suds and was kind of slick..</li>
            <li> And hands down favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> It suds a little more than the Dove but not as much as Id like.</li>
            <li> This is one body wash that has always been consistent, even for my sensitive skin, therefore, I will definitely purchase more in the future!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, I can still feel silky smooth hours after the shower.</li>
            <li> it was a decent product.</li>
            <li> I like the primary fragrance of it, and it lathers up nice, but as I rinse, there is a weird smell that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and smooth, and my beard feels nicer too</li>
            <li> this has a nice light scent to it, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay brand.  </li>
            <li> I think I will pay a little more for a better product next time...which I think will actually be a better overall &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; (using less).</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing...leaves skin soft!</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> It is very  moisturizing  writing and feels soft on my body!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this and it too will become a product you can&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> but this stunk to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much because it does go on so smoothly that it&#x27;s easy to use a little and make it go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these, can&#x27;t really say that it&#x27;s moisturizing for me personally because I have really , really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will say that the price in this product fluctuates wildly!!</li>
            <li> and you have sensitive skin, treat your skin and try it!!</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin so soft and moisturized!!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling extra clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Body Wash, hands down!  </li>
            <li> I really like how soft this make my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great body product, you can not go wrong with this moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> It smells like old ladies, but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this product instead of my normal soap for a while now.  </li>
            <li> The normal size is about 24oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the heavy lather...</li>
            <li> This was well worth it, especially at its price of 3$ !!!!</li>
            <li> I used to think of it as an old lady brand from the famous pink face lotion (which I much like, especially the scent), but I&#x27;m a modern convert.</li>
            <li> Oh it suds like normal too.</li>
            <li> My mother has psoriasis and this is pretty much the only body wash she will use even!</li>
            <li> Most of it was wasted out</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing lotion that I found after a lot of false promises .Great price!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the subtle and clean scent.</li>
            <li> My entire family loves this creamy, moisturizing body wash-not oily, just enough lather that rinses off easily--</li>
            <li> It actually looks like lotion, but lathers right up with water.</li>
            <li> I had quick shipping with this, never had to wait long.</li>
            <li> Also it latters great, which is a big thing for me since if a body wash doesn&#x27;t latter I usually don&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Olay is a brand I can trust to live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> What can I say about Olay products, new?  </li>
            <li> Now I have to buy this on s&amp;s because my Lady cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> Never really felt clean using a body wash until i tried this one.</li>
            <li> If your skin is super dry</li>
            <li> Because I left a genuine 4-star review, I was not compensated my additional ten dollars.</li>
            <li> My gorlfriend loves when I give jet a foot fub with this and it leaves her legs very soft.</li>
            <li> I am VERY sensitive to smells so that is always a concern for me.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with how creamy this is.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and it makes me feel like an very old person.</li>
            <li> However, it is rated a 5 on EWG.org&#x27;s skin deep guide which is slightly higher than I would like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like the scent of Shea Butter in anything because it&#x27;s almost always too potent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s non-irritating for my skin, yet keeps it soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft when I use this!</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the dove sensitive skin body wash!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> As someone who normally can&#x27;t be bothered to put on lotion, this keeps my skin soft without thinking about it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have a chance to buy it in a small size bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavily fragranced, but it does have a nice, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> ,it makes my face complexion beautiful,glowing soft and skin looks brand new</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy and I love it!</li>
            <li> She likes using it, but I think it has an odd scent that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy.</li>
            <li> As expected; quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been pretty loyal to Dove Body Wash for about the past 10 years, but Amazon has a killer deal on this stuff</li>
            <li> The smell can be too strong for some people, but I personally love it because smells like an expensive french fragrance!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m currently suffering from very severe dry skin right now for some reason.</li>
            <li> , so I use a little extra sometimes to get more foamy bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have used Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash With Shea Butter for years and really like the product, but be aware that this is the small bottle and not the large (23.6 oz) bottle.</li>

            <li> Leaves skin moisturized and soft.</li>

            <li> , I feel soft.</li>
            <li> It was always thought to be for old people (which is who I always saw using it when I myself was a teenager.)</li>
            <li> Well I suppose I&#x27;m one of those old people now because I bought this</li>

            <li> But leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Lots of soft lather with this product.  </li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> can really recommend it.. definitely to tackle the dryness, dunno</li>
            <li> It only takes a quarter sized dollop (and that&#x27;s still a bit much) to lather up and use all over.  </li>
            <li> leaves body so so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> but saw the Sensitive formula and thought I&#x27;d give it</li>
            <li> One squirt of this on my loofah last the whole shower.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I melted some 100% Natural Shea Butter that I purchased on Amazon and poured it in the body wash.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I no longer smell like a old moldy cucumber dipped in sewage.</li>
            <li> It was always thought to be for old people (which is who I always saw using it when I myself was a teenager.)</li>
            <li> Well I suppose I&#x27;m one of those old people now because I bought this</li>
            <li> leaving my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose or skin.</li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t want to waste it you have to mix in 1:1 ratio of water and shake it before every use , enough for 2-3 more weeks.</li>
            <li> I do not know why Amazon has poor prices for such a good product.</li>
            <li> This smells like my great aunt took a bath with a perfumed &amp;#34;bath bomb&amp;#34; and then rolled around in a mixture of old lady perfume before dressing and spritzing herself with more terrible smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> If you plan it right, you can get this high quality body wash for less than $2 here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry location and require body soaps that are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or make you break out (like some rich face wash) either.</li>
            <li> them soaps are very harsh andbto strong for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for everyday use and it&#x27;s such a treat as it leaves my normally very dry skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> AS I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE A SMALL AMOUNT</li>
            <li> Body wash is important to me because we live in a hot climate, and sudsing up is necessary at the end of every day, at least if I want to maintain all my relationships!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and using this in my shower gives my skin a little bit more moisture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this particular item does not produce as much foam and soapiness as other brands</li>
            <li> No other bodywash can compare to this brand!</li>
            <li> Fragrance was very nice, not overwhelming as with some bar soaps, a plus because of my husband&#x27;s delicate nose.</li>
            <li> This is smaller than a normal bottle</li>
            <li> I think other reviewers are exaggerating slightly when they say it can replace the post-shower lotion, but maybe I&#x27;m more demanding when it comes to skin hydration.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this specific scent in Olay body wash though, and was pleased to find it here on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin and this stuff has really helped a lot.</li>
            <li> the product comes out of is quite large, so I&#x27;ve gone through almost an entire bottle in about 2 weeks, whereas a bottle of Nivea extra sensitive may last 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is ok but the bottle is real small.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a major smell.  </li>
            <li> have skin problems and is very dry this although it doesnt lather that much its because it overcompensates with the butter.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leave my body feeling tight which is important since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nivea extra sensitive body wash, and then would need to apply lotion after my shower.</li>
            <li> but it turns out that my old body wash wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all and was actually drying my skin out!</li>
            <li> This version of Olay is Moisturizing, so it helps put some moisture back on your body as you&#x27;re washing your natural oils away.  </li>
            <li> Was smaller bottle than I thought, was surprised when it came.</li>
            <li> Skin soft with a quiet fragrance.</li>
            <li> i will be purchasing it in the near future.</li>
            <li> But I smell like an old spanish lady after I use it.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive here, though.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> After a shower it leaves a faint nice smell.</li>
            <li> It has a strong perfume type fragrance, which surprised me due to the rather plain looking bottle.</li>
            <li> It came out to about the price of hand soap on sale, yet this is so much richer, it doesn&#x27;t dry as much as regular soap.</li>
            <li> i am not a super model, in fact i am not attractive, but the cream makes me feel good</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive body but am able to use this daily (or multiple times a day in the summer) without breaking out, over drying, or it changing my pH causing disasters that other soaps have caused me in the past.</li>
            <li> I have to say normally my skin would be visibly dry</li>
            <li> I usually like shea butter items because it has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no dry skin here!</li>
            <li> I use a special scrubber towel with this, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No other product works, including the generic versions of this body wash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily tiny, but It&#x27;s not as large as other Olay body moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Not too strong or weak.</li>
            <li> -- I now simply and consistently every day without fail use the full bevy of my Olay products; from Olay Regenerist at night when I sleep and this Olay shea butter body wash every morning when I shower or soak in the bath.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and helps keep it soft</li>
            <li> I swim frequently so my skin does get dry</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for your Black Friday sale.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy about the scent, but it works well and was a great price with coupon and sub &amp; save.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive and dry skin, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and I don&#x27;t feel soapy or dry after showering!</li>
            <li> it moisturizes just right, the shea butter smells strong, and i can say my skin is a little less dry than usual</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin in the winter, with frequent itching and cracking</li>
            <li> It feels lovely on my skin and is very thick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest buying other scents or not buying new scents from online.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells divine, a little goes a long way, and it is absolutely moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I had come from a bad experience from buying a dove body soap, which seemed like liquified bar soap, not in a good way.</li>
            <li> Good consistency not too thick or too thin</li>
            <li> No need to re-apply lotion later, my skin would survive a full day without any other lotion application and not in small part because of this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really noticed a difference in my boyfriend&#x27;s skin as he never moisturizes and his skin felt noticeably softer and less dry after using it.</li>
            <li> As far as dry skin, well it&#x27;s not really helping with that.</li>
            <li> A few things I learned was not to shower with hot water, keep my showers short, do not use soap, and do not rub my skin dry (with a towel), rather, pat dry or air dry.  </li>
            <li> The scent is heavenly and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Nothing else keeps my skin as moisturized, especially through the long winter months.</li>
            <li> The thick cream and water separated since I first time use it.</li>
            <li> After using the Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash, my very dry skin felt much softer and less dry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough to people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with dry skin on my lower back even after putting on lotion.</li>
            <li> Some years back, I started getting dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very well and is concentrated so a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like some other body washes do!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used this a little, but so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, I hate this particular sale.</li>
            <li> That is much more than I need at one time, and the bottle is too awkward to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> I work long hours</li>
            <li> Complaining because you expected it to be bigger is not taking responsibility for your actions as a consumer.</li>
            <li> smaller than i expected for the price,</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than what I typically purchase for the same price on sale at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> but it stings my eyes badly if any minute amount gets in, far more than any other shower products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> And I mean really itchy.</li>
            <li> Bottle small for price,smells nice,but don&#x27;t see much difference from other cheaper brands</li>
            <li> I have semi-sensitive skin and sometimes it gets itchy with other washes, that was definitely not the case with this one.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lingers long after showering too!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fragrance is just a little too potent for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that personal opinion, it&#x27;s recommended.</li>
            <li> The only draw back I noticed is that it tends to leave my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased it due to the dryness caused by the winter time (in the northeast, the dry heat is constantly draining the moisture out of the air) and I would say that it has lessened the need for lotion and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a very long time for a body wash that I could use with my super-sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and always have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivity and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Olay product to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or like a film was on it like some soaps can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, or cause any rashes.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a must for dry ashy winter skin.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as dry because of the Olay lotion in it.</li>
            <li> and it is helping my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t have extremely dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I still pat my skin dry</li>
            <li> I always use Oil of Olay&#x27;s body wash as it keeps my skin from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry but in just a weeks time began to get softer.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or like a film was on it like some soaps can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps me from being so itchy with our dry air here</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I have no more dry skin and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> This bottle is tiny and not worth the price</li>
            <li> The soap has a soft scent, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> skins so unbelievable soft..</li>
            <li> Hubby had dry skin and this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before trying this body wash my skin was extremely dry after shower!</li>
            <li> I usually like Olay body washes, but I&#x27;d rather stick to a different version in the future</li>
            <li> I was given ten dollars to purchase the product and told to notify the payee before posting a review of less than five stars.</li>
            <li> I can feel slight difference to regular body wash.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the really big bottle and thought this was it, sadly it is smaller.</li>
            <li> but the bottle is small and go through it too fast...will purchase larger bottles in future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a particular fan of flowery scents</li>
            <li> did a lot of research on the subject and found several ways to lessen my condition.  </li>
            <li> Left residue all over my black leather upholstery.</li>
            <li> but I think I only paid 2 and a half bucks.</li>

            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I always used Dove but noticed my skin was very dry after the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I / wish it came in a bigger bottle although you only need a little I use / this with my exfoliating cloth quarter size amount you can use less</li>
            <li> It also felt very moisturizing, and there was no strong scent (I usually choose scented body washes</li>
            <li> The skin on my shoulders and back didn&#x27;t feel tight and itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old male, and sometimes dry skin in the winter is frustrating, so I figured the moisturizing in this could help.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin was just really dry due to Winter weather</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get dry skin at all, needing reapplication during day as I feel I need with other lotions.  </li>
            <li> My Mother uses this body wash and it helps with her extreme dry skin.  </li>
            <li> other places where I&#x27;m not suffering dry skin</li>
            <li> If you do not live in a desert then you may not require an extreme moisturizing body soap.</li>
            <li> Nothing terrible, nothing great.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because you only need a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> it money well spent.</li>

            <li> Product did not really moisturize.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t expensive and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> soap also does not seem to moisturize as well as I expected, so I will not be repurchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But be careful reading the description.</li>
            <li> However, I will also be careful not to put it on the bottom of my feel because it is slippery.</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy and lathers up to a thick and soft lotion like body wash.</li>
            <li> Has been helping my skin ease out of the winter months and cut down on dry skin.</li>

            <li> A little soap goes a long way with this one.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I always use a moisturizing body wash because my skin is dry, and if I don&#x27;t use one it feels as if my skin is drawn tight when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel slippery like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again and all the other Olay body washes line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel a greasy film after washing like you do with other moisturizing body washes.</li>
            <li> I have used other Olay products.  </li>
            <li> Not like other Olay products.</li>
            <li> i think i&#x27;ll give this one away and try one of the other fragrances, or perhaps the unscented version.</li>
            <li> I just assumed it was the same size since I&#x27;ve never seen this small a bottle in the store.  </li>
            <li> There are other brands that may have fancier chemicals/ingredients, but this does what it is suppose to, plus it is not as oily as other butter infused body wahes at be afterwards.</li>
            <li> need a small amount for a big lather.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a while, just a small amount creates lots of lather, especially when you use a shower loofah.</li>
            <li> you only need a few drops of the cream to create a lot of bubbles!</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and have to be very careful what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> only complaint: the spout/hole</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it at all but not worth to return it.</li>
            <li> One tiny caveat: if you have a slow shower drain (bane of apartment living), the body wash will reconstitute a bit on its way down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a new body wash soon because I hate the smell so much.</li>
            <li> I suggest waiting for price to be on the down swing, use a coupon, subscribe and save it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the only body wash</li>
            <li> just a little of this body wash goes a very long way, and seemingly lasts quite awhile!!!</li>
            <li> Would be 4 stars if it had less fragrance.</li>
            <li> I got this product during a promotion shipped to my house for less than $2.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using Nivea moisturizing body wash but bought this because it was on sale for half of what I pay for Nivea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use lotions or cremes or anything labeled &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; because they leave me feeling a layer/coating on my skin.  </li>
            <li> For some odd reason, it has this...rusty penny smell to it.  </li>
            <li> This product has an odd odor that is not Shea butter odor.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash away with a slight sprinkle from the shower water.</li>
            <li> I even noticed my skin was less itchy and irritated.</li>
            <li> And because this product is so thick, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> and I feel my skin is little softer now.</li>
            <li> I like little to no scent, unless it&#x27;s woody or citrus.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay product in the past and never been so disappointed, I really enjoy products with shea butter in them.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few body washes that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin... Couldn&#x27;t pass up on the price for the body wash.</li>
            <li> Does make your skin feel moisturized rather than dried out after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have used for years since my aging skin dried out.</li>
            <li> So my skin gets easily dried out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> To all the people who read this, please don&#x27;t let the bitterness of a few cloud your judgment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; but that smell is still there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of using skin lotion</li>
            <li> It is slightly thicker than regular shower gel, and I thought it would create less suds, but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> You also need very little soap on your poof.</li>
            <li> even think i have ever seen this small of a bottle</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> Just one small squirt will do wonders.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually give compliments, except for this defective product.</li>
            <li> usually a Dove fan,</li>
            <li> Watery compared to the brands I usually trust (gold bond).</li>
            <li> The Olay products are usually recognized by their quality and this one follows suit.  </li>
            <li> From what I understand, the itch is caused by small invisible cracks in the skin.  </li>
            <li> usually a Dove fan,</li>
            <li> Not sure if the price is a comparable value with &amp;#34;Walmart&amp;#34; or a drug store</li>
            <li> I got this body wash randomly when I saw a daily deal for it.</li>
            <li> Feels creamy when applied in the shower but does not feel weird on your body after you dry off.</li>
            <li> It has really saved me so much grief over the past four or five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which makes it hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely hard time finding soaps and body washes that I can use with these two combined conditions.</li>
            <li> I could hardly bear it.</li>
            <li> This is sad since I have very dry</li>
            <li> The only tip I want to leave is don&#x27;t use it to shave, as it will clog your razor like crazy.</li>
            <li> Then, I always apply lotion or body cream to at least parts of my body after my shower anyway.  </li>
            <li> if i must say that if i could i would purchase at least 6 of these at one time.</li>
            <li> Being 89 years, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t take care of your skin.</li>
            <li> I mean body wash.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even need to put on lotion after getting out of the shower!</li>
            <li> I was tired of the kool-aid-smelling body washes I usually find at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Very shady.</li>
            <li> Not a great price for this small bottle.</li>
            <li> Protects and moisturizes skin and less expensive than soap.</li>
            <li> Not good for the price.  </li>
            <li> Not a good deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed and wouldn&#x27;t buy this again simply for the scent.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> always been a fan of Olay for years, never been disappointed and this item is no different</li>
            <li> But with this wash my skin doesn&#x27;t dry as bad.</li>
            <li> Very thick.  </li>
            <li> This body wash is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Very thick and leaves a residue feeling on skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick and luxurious formula.</li>
            <li> I also hate feeling gross</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also got a thin consistency.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to spend hundreds on expensive skin creams and spa treatments (which I used to do in the folly of my 20s)</li>
            <li> and maybe I had the wrong cloth.  </li>
            <li> Did not like,ordered wrong product</li>
            <li> It is a tad expensive for soap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially addicted to this body wash!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is me, but Olay body wash has a weird after smell.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it burns my eyes and is unpleasant</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about ingredients.</li>
            <li> Usually winter is my worst time of year for it, but this summer is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with any product of Olay!</li>
            <li> it smell ugly like a dead dog really so nasty threw it away</li>
            <li> but I feel it has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Olay just doesn&#x27;t make a bad product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one-</li>
            <li> so disappointed  on everything please reimburse me now</li>
            <li> I got the &#x27;ultra moisture&#x27; and I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I was ordering, I was frightened because it said it had a mixture of Shea butter; I hate that smell.</li>
            <li> AS A MAN I HATE HAVING TO PUT LOTION</li>
            <li> I like the soap and lather but hate the scent.</li>
            <li> and I hate using lotion or having anything on my skin but with this body wash</li>
            <li> Its really bad !</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> and this body wash is nasty</li>
            <li> me bad!!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> Smell is awful and this product leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> However this smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thought it was ok. Wasn&#x27;t Ultra Moisturizing, just ok. Didn&#x27;t care for the scent.. but sometimes I see this on sale on Amazon for under $1.50 and heck, that&#x27;s too good of a deal to pass up on! (And then I give them to my mom.. shhhh!)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t touch it retail for the price especially at BOGO</li>
            <li> This is simply best and got it during clip on coupon which made it much sweeter.. Will buy again</li>
            <li> love the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t leave y skin dry!</li>
            <li> AMAZINGGGGGG!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Planning to re-order some more. Give it a try. The price is more than incredible</li>
            <li> This works nice, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to my olay ribbons.</li>
            <li> I like all the moisture and the scent,</li>
            <li> The Olay body wash is good, but I like Dial better.</li>
            <li> I usually like shea butter items because it has a mild scent. This product has an overpowering scent or perfume smell. The moisturizer isn&#x27;t all that good either. I would avoid this product if scents bother you or you want a milder scent.</li>
            <li> as described with quick delivery.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This stuff really lathers up well. The moisturizing is nice too, not too much. It is a really nice body wash without a strong smell that makes you feel clean without residue. I would buy this again. I recommend.</li>
            <li> great product! love olay&#x27;s body wash i also recommend the pink one they have and their bar soaps its the best!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Meets our needs of cleaning without drying the skin.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the silkiness after showering. Try it as a bubble bath:)</li>
            <li> smells so good! I love it smells fresh smooth lather</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! It goes on so smoothly and smells so good!</li>
            <li> Gm I would like to re order 3 more of these body washes on friday... let me know if i can do so with the same discount prices... thank you</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes well and my skin feels softer and smoother. Although it does not seem to work a whole lot better than the Dove body wash I have always used. Would be 4 stars if it had less fragrance.</li>
            <li> Just as it&#x27;s name says ultra moisturizing! After one wash my skin felt smoother and the dryness from winter was virtually gone. Very nice scent! Arrived as described. Speedy delivery. Well packaged. And...I got it on special sale. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!!!!  Very creamy and leaves my skin feeling great.  I added it to my subscribe and save order.</li>
            <li> Great deal with automatic monthly shipping being free. I have this on the two month delivery. Now I&#x27;ll never run out of a great body wash.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. I am 65 with very dry skin and after using this product,my skin is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I really like how soft this make my skin feel.  WARNING:  If you are fragrance sensitive, this is not the product for you.  It has a strong perfume type fragrance, which surprised me due to the rather plain looking bottle.</li>
            <li> Not to wild about the scent but leaves skin moisturized</li>
            <li> It smells really cheap, like grandma perfume (no offense). I&#x27;m really disappointed and wouldn&#x27;t buy this again simply for the scent. It&#x27;s a shame because it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I used to use Nivea extra sensitive body wash, and then would need to apply lotion after my shower. Now I just use this, and don&#x27;t get all itchy, needing lotion after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint: the spout/hole the product comes out of is quite large, so I&#x27;ve gone through almost an entire bottle in about 2 weeks, whereas a bottle of Nivea extra sensitive may last 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This feels good even as you use it, &amp; it has a fantastic smell - if something can smell soft, this is it.</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry in the winter/cold; I have used and love the Oil of Olay Ribbons body washes, but I decided to try this one. I love how it lathers, rinses clean and my skin is very soft and silky feeling. Oil of Olay is the best!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and a good price.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this Olay Ultra Body Wash.  So far, I love the smell and how soft it makes my skin feel after a shower. I purchased this body wash because of all the great Amazon reviews, and now I can see why it is highly reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely re-purchase this product again when my body wash runs low. I also like the tropical smell it leaves on my body after showering. The scent reminds me of a Hawaiian Plumeria flower. I love it! My seven year old also loves to use this body wash because of the sweet smell. I also like how well it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Good for dried skin~! thx</li>
            <li> This one is great for moisture. Not so great for cleaning. For the price there are better options out there unless you wash first and use this as a in shower lotion.</li>
            <li> Skin felt soft after washed.</li>
            <li> Scent is beautiful, feel so clean, skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive and dry skin, especially during the winter. This body wash is really moisturizing. You can feel the difference in one use. It is slightly thicker than regular shower gel, and I thought it would create less suds, but I was wrong! It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or make you break out (like some rich face wash) either.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and i love it it even leaves an amazing scent on the skin that last for hours 😍😍😍😍.&lt;br /&gt;I have skin problems and is very dry this although it doesnt lather that much its because it overcompensates with the butter.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizing wash! Order it over and over with my prime and just adore it</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, but has a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li> Another fabulous product from Olay.  Little amount makes lots of body wash, smells wonderful and leaves skin feeling so clean and soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> good product left my skin clean and smooth not looking dry, truly does mooisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. Works very well. good product. thank you.</li>
            <li> always good for the bath water. Recommends.</li>
            <li> Very cheap! It&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> a nice dayily wash for all members of the family.  Scent is not overpoweringly feminine and the moisturising action is welcome in dry conditions -</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really soft, smells great too.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> great product - fast shipping - thank you!</li>
            <li> A+ Olay quality. Leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I always been a customer of oil of olay but a big money saver monthly yes I love it more</li>
            <li> Great body wash, great price too!</li>
            <li> So far so good my skin is smooth and smells good I&#x27;m saying goodbye to bar soap this is my first body wash since that change so i will probably be trying different ones but this one&#x27;s great i would say 8.1 and i may end up coming back to this one as my primary selection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure I&#x27;m in love with this product.  It&#x27;s OK.  I think I like Dove Nutrism  (sp? )more.</li>
            <li> Olay body wash is fantastic - have ordered more than once (subscribe and save).</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite body washes!  It makes the skin feel so very smooth, it is not irritating to my sensitive skin and the scent is like music to my nostrils.</li>
            <li> just one word love love love smells great</li>
            <li> Nice product and got a deal with S&amp;S with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I usually love Olay products, this one didn&#x27;t lather well, didn&#x27;t smell very much.  Its ok</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at a discounted rate and am giving my unbiased opinion . I Love this and it makes my skin feel so much softer to the touch . I also enjoy the scent and my skin feels moisturized after I use it . I would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> My husband loves how moisturizing this body wash is. I thought for convenience/price sake, I&#x27;d order online. This product is 10oz SMALLER than the bottle I buy at the store for the same price. Feeling pretty foolish...</li>
            <li> It is great to use. It came at just the right time!</li>
            <li> I have used this product instead of my normal soap for a while now.  It does feel great when I bathed with it.  But honestly I did not discern any lasting effects.  It is very pleasant  to use but soap is cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing. However, it is rated a 5 on EWG.org&#x27;s skin deep guide which is slightly higher than I would like.</li>
            <li> Love this. It makes your skin so soft. Play is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like the body wash. It has a soft feel and smells goos</li>
            <li> I love this shower wash. I should have ordered more. Great price also</li>
            <li> This is ok but the bottle is real small. Not good for the price.  I dont  even think i have ever seen this small of a bottle</li>
            <li> Nice one. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> Smells good and was cheap!</li>
            <li> Awesome for really dry skin.</li>
            <li> nice scent and did well moisturizing my skin this past winter</li>
            <li> olay makes wonderful skin products.</li>
            <li> Olay is a brand you can trust!  I love the way this body wash moisturizes my skin.  Absolutely no dry skin here!</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and smell great! Great buy!</li>
            <li> my favorite overall body wash</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and lather well and doesn&#x27;t smell girly.&lt;br /&gt;And was a good price.Tho you can get cheaper kinds.&lt;br /&gt;I use it a few times a wk and a cheapo kind the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> My mom used to buy this product, it smells nice, and it works fine in winter to keep the skin not drys out</li>
            <li> This product is the best for dry skin,  It hydrates and leaves the skin soft.  The shea butter is non-irritating.  If your skin is super dry it will take a week or two before you see results.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since 3 yrs. Protects and moisturizes skin and less expensive than soap. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week now, and it is so smooth and creamy feeling on my skin, the scent is not overpowering at all, just a light fragrance that is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Fine moisturizing, like the scent.</li>
            <li> I received this through my subscribe and save with a coupon and got it for a super good deal! I&#x27;ve always liked Olay body wash. It makes my skin feel soft and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like some other body washes do!</li>
            <li> Not sure why but it stings my eyes badly if any minute amount gets in, far more than any other shower products I&#x27;ve used.  Nice smell, leaves smooth skin, and provides good cleaning.  Unfortunately it burns my eyes and is unpleasant so I do not expect to buy again.</li>
            <li> What a smooth feeling left on My skin ...totally in Love</li>
            <li> Very thick.  Creamy.  Fragrance not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy and lathers up to a thick and soft lotion like body wash. Despite some of the ingredients (sulfates) this is a great body wash for the price. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing body wash with mild scent.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash!  It&#x27;s VERY rich and moisturizing.  I think other reviewers are exaggerating slightly when they say it can replace the post-shower lotion, but maybe I&#x27;m more demanding when it comes to skin hydration.  Regardless, this is a great body wash and a great value, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash.  It is moisturizing and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than what I typically purchase for the same price on sale at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Paid 1.80 each! $5-6 in the store! Hubby had dry skin and this stuff works wonders! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying this body wash my skin was extremely dry after shower! I had to rush to moisturize each time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I leave the shower nice and smooth! Loving it!</li>
            <li> It is the best on the market. Absolutely the best. I&#x27;ve used it since Olay first made it available on the market -- years now. I am 45 and African-American male, people are consistently complimenting my skin (face &amp; body) and telling me that they think I&#x27;m 29 years of age at most. (lol!) Wow...nope, in 5 more years I&#x27;ll be hitting age 50 God willing. There&#x27;s no need to spend hundreds on expensive skin creams and spa treatments (which I used to do in the folly of my 20s) -- I now simply and consistently every day without fail use the full bevy of my Olay products; from Olay Regenerist at night when I sleep and this Olay shea butter body wash every morning when I shower or soak in the bath. (I occasionally enjoy Dove as well, but Olay is the best per my experience.)  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Leaves my skin feeling soft and I don&#x27;t feel soapy or dry after showering!</li>
            <li> Good value as add on item otherwise Costco sells a 3 pack cheaper per oz.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light smelling body wash. I&#x27;m starting to prefer using Olay over my bath and body works purchases. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, I can still feel silky smooth hours after the shower. Perfect for the dry Fall and Winter months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive wash that works like any body wash should. I like the creaminess and the scent is lovely also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like the scent of Shea Butter in anything because it&#x27;s almost always too potent.  This however, has a lighter, more pleasant smell.  The body wash is silky smooth, lathers well and really does leave my sensitive skin feeling soft.  I have a hard time finding this specific scent in Olay body wash though, and was pleased to find it here on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have always liked body washes and I really like this one coming from a 14 year old female. The small is really nice and I like leaving the bathroom with it having a good smell</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I use it as my primary body wash.  Nothing can compare to it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Works great and has a pleasant smell. My gorlfriend loves when I give jet a foot fub with this and it leaves her legs very soft. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes you smell good for close-encounters :).</li>
            <li> I got this product during a promotion shipped to my house for less than $2. It was a great deal and the product works great. Not only does this have a great scent, but it really does work as advertised. I could feel the difference right away as my skin was softer and smooth from the butter. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel slippery like other products I have tried. I come out of the shower feeling clean and soft. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Smells good! Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and helps keep it soft</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews...I assumed it was the same size as the one I always see in the store. Unfortunately it&#x27;s tiny. The normal size is about 24oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the product. 1 star for the size/price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> I have been useing olay since i was 16 and still use it now today at age 54 and alot of people can&#x27;t believe that i&#x27;m 54 and i&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> I love Olay body wash . I have winter skin, but no problems when I use this.</li>
            <li> Good nothing great.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the smell much either</li>
            <li> This bottle is tiny and not worth the price a bought it at.</li>
            <li> Olay is a brand I can trust to live up to my expectations. The smell is amazing! I love the way my skin feels after my shower, very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash!! Has a great scent and rinses clean. My favorite Play product!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for females only. Even if it does, so what? It&#x27;s just soap for showering. Better smell great than stink. Oh and I like it so far makes my body all smooth and silky :)</li>
            <li> I received the product yesterday. I tried this body wash it last night and this morning. I loved this product. It has a nice smell and lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a soapy residue on your skin. It feels more like a lotion inside soap. My skin feels nice, soft and moisturized. I will buy this product again and all the other Olay body washes line. My skin feel very soft and smooth. Give Olay Ultra Moisturizing Body Wash it money well spent.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells gray and makes your feel even greater</li>
            <li> Love this, scent is good, moisturizes and cleans at same time!!</li>
            <li> This body wash cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and smells amazing.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> buy this all the time in stores .this is a great rice</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling good after a long hot shower.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> smells great and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Love Olay body wash - so silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS ITEM WITHIN ONE WEEK FROM DATE OF PURCHASE.  SINCE RECEIPT I HAVE USED DAILY.  TO DATE USAGE HAVE BEEN FOR 7 DAYS AND MY BODY FEELS SO SMOOTH AND SOFT.  I WILL REORDER THIS ITEM AND RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AS I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE A SMALL AMOUNT TO GET GREET RESULTS. THIS IS A GREAT DEAL, BASED ON TIMELY DELIVERY AND QUANTITY PURCHASED.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizing body wise. The smell is really nice not too strong. Leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Good foaming body wash.  I have extremely dry skin and I was hoping I would be able to avoid using a moisturizer.  No such luck and I really don&#x27;t like the feel of moisturizers on my skin.</li>
            <li> Olay didn&#x27;t disappoint with this, smells wonderful and leaves my skin silky smoothie and fresh. I don&#x27;t feel a greasy film after washing like you do with other moisturizing body washes. The bottle has an easy open top and is very user friendly. The bottle isn&#x27;t too bulky to grab with wet hands in the shower. It is a great product, arrived on time in easy to open packaging and undamaged. Also purchased with subscribe and save so I made a killer deal and had it come.right to my door!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it lives my skin soft</li>
            <li> This smells so good and lathers so well. I am normally a flowery or fruity kind of shower girl. But this feels so good. It is not too harsh on my skin yet cleans really well. I have a very sensitive body but am able to use this daily (or multiple times a day in the summer) without breaking out, over drying, or it changing my pH causing disasters that other soaps have caused me in the past. It will be my body wash for the remainder of my pregnancy and after!</li>
            <li> I was tired of the kool-aid-smelling body washes I usually find at the drug store. Body wash is important to me because we live in a hot climate, and sudsing up is necessary at the end of every day, at least if I want to maintain all my relationships! Amazon had a great deal on this one, so I bought it, sight unseen, scent un-sniffed. I know, I&#x27;m a renegade. This is so much nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. It actually looks like lotion, but lathers right up with water. I only use a dollop about the size of a quarter--that&#x27;s plenty. And what about the scent? It&#x27;s really pleasant and lightly floral, with a slight whiff of honeysuckle, which is very nice for a southern girl like me. One tiny caveat: if you have a slow shower drain (bane of apartment living), the body wash will reconstitute a bit on its way down. So if you find a bit of white soap residue on your drain shield, that&#x27;s what it is. Very easy to clean, not a fault of the body wash itself.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep your skin soft</li>
            <li> So smooth and moisturized. So nice.</li>
            <li> Wow this smells incredible &amp; made taking a bath less of chore &amp; more if a spa day? You can certainly tell it leaves your skin soft &amp; clean! 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Nice deal. Haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and always have dry skin. This product works wonders.</li>
            <li> All time favorite body wash - it smells great and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love it, nice smell and very good  body wash smooth, even my dogs like the smell they lick me.</li>
            <li> Smell is overly strong and bottle seemed to be only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and cleans very well.  Olay just doesn&#x27;t make a bad product.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> What can I say about Olay products, new?  I love them all.  As does my mother, my daughters and granddaughters.</li>
            <li> Good body soap however I find that is it about the same as the Dove Deep Moisture. So I would just get whatever is cheaper. I live in an extremely dry location and require body soaps that are very moisturizing. If you do not live in a desert then you may not require an extreme moisturizing body soap.</li>
            <li> this is a good low cost body wash, i liked it</li>
            <li> I love this soap and use all the time. Found it cheaper on Amazon than in stores</li>
            <li> I use all the oil of olay products that I can. From body wash, face wash, face lotion to body lottions. Love them all!</li>
            <li> This smells Amazing! Ive never been a fan of body wash until I tried this! It leaves my entire body feeling silky smooth and smells oh so nice! Not overly &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; with just the right amount of lather. Nice size bottle and very easy to dispense. This is my all time favorite body wash!</li>
            <li> Smells great, gets you clean and helps soften the skin at the same time.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before.  I have used other Olay products.  I adore the smell and feel of this bath wash.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Olay, Olay, Olay...I love this Shea Butter Ultra Moisture Body Wash for it&#x27;s non-irritating for my skin, yet keeps it soft! I love the heavy lather...just a little of this body wash goes a very long way, and seemingly lasts quite awhile!!! This is one body wash that has always been consistent, even for my sensitive skin, therefore, I will definitely purchase more in the future!!</li>
            <li> I swim frequently so my skin does get dry - I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of using skin lotion so this wash has everything I need! It&#x27;s smooth and buttery in the shower and it smells great, and it leaves your skin feeling nice and soft afterwards. It foams up very well on the loofah as well.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Perfect lather.</li>
            <li> This has a very different smell than what I am used to for body wash. The texture is almost like body lotion. It works really well, and always leave my skin smelling fresh and clean. Very good body wash.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00B22BCJS Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash With Shea Butter, 13.5 oz.]] I got the &#x27;ultra moisture&#x27; and I hate the smell of it. It&#x27;s too strong and smells like the Macy&#x27;s perfume cabinet. I&#x27;d suggest buying other scents or not buying new scents from online.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My skin is so soft when I use this! My favorite kind...moisture rich for sure</li>
            <li> I love Olay body wash! It leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li> This body wash is good. It feels okay going on and as it lathers but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well. I&#x27;ve tried A Lot of body washes and most don&#x27;t really moisturize well. This is no exception. But it does smell good. And I feel clean after using it. Side note: I purchased this product for my daughter,these are all her opinions.</li>
            <li> Great value. Love its smell.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing body wash. I&#x27;ve always used Olay bar soap and this gives more Moisture and great fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Bought over 3 times. Love it. Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells great and makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth to the skin after u use i like it ty</li>
            <li> Love this bodywash. It smells really nice, and is super soft and creamy, and makes my skin smooth. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, I hate this particular sale. It sounds like a good deal, because it is under $3 dollars. But, look at the size! At target, you can get their generic version for about $3-4 dollars, and it is much cheaper per ounce. Walmart even has their own version of it. I do not know why Amazon has poor prices for such a good product. Don&#x27;t buy this, just go to Target and Walmart and get their generic versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product:&lt;br /&gt;1) Moisturizes skin to the point I do not need to use a lotion after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;2) Does not break my body out.&lt;br /&gt;3) A little goes a long way in the shower. It flows like butter all over your body, and rinses easily.&lt;br /&gt;4) Great smell (kind of smells like an old lady, but I actually like it :/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: If you have a Costco Membership, you can purchase the larger size of this body wash in a pack of three for about $9-13 dollars depending on sales. The three pack is also the Olay Brand, not a generic version.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using Nivea moisturizing body wash but bought this because it was on sale for half of what I pay for Nivea. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! I thought my skin was just really dry due to Winter weather but it turns out that my old body wash wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all and was actually drying my skin out! After one use I could tell a difference. The skin on my shoulders and back didn&#x27;t feel tight and itchy. After a week, my skin had transformed into soft, supple looking skin. I never would have imagined that a body wash could make this big of a difference. Glad I figured this out before investing in tons of lotion and creams.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturized it leaves my skin. I also love the smell! It&#x27;s also quick to lather. I have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Aveno doesn&#x27;t come close to this body wash.</li>
            <li> All okay products are 5 Star in my book.  This came on time and at a great discounted price!</li>
            <li> Lathers good, nice scent and leaves my skin moisturized shower after shower. I love Olay and this body wash is very well suited with it&#x27;s whole line of shower items!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very moisturized, more than lotion after my shower.  I didn&#x27;t get dry skin at all, needing reapplication during day as I feel I need with other lotions.  Plus I get up at 5 am, and this if faster than putting on lotion after a shower.  Every minute saved is  sleep time it shortened.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t care for the product. the inside wash stuff comes out too quick. Needs to be a smaller bottle..</li>
            <li> This is amazing !!!!! I never felt so clean. And as for the scent, don&#x27;t get me started. I love this product. The scent is heavenly and it last a long time. It&#x27;s great for it price and it&#x27;s so luxurious. I felt like I was in heaven; I was in the shower for hours. Just one small squirt will do wonders.&lt;br /&gt;When I was ordering, I was frightened because it said it had a mixture of Shea butter; I hate that smell. But this scent was great; it reminded me of a meadow.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturized my skin well so now I don&#x27;t need to worry about adding on lotion indoors.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use bar soap and this was my first time trying a body wash. This was well worth it, especially at its price of 3$ !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely keep on buying</li>
            <li> This product sucks! My skin was irritated. So itchy and inflamed! Maybe it comes with this Sodium Lauryl Sulfate that has been mixed. I have I don&#x27;t give compliments except for this defective product. I don&#x27;t usually give compliments, except for this defective product.</li>
            <li> This body wash is very thick and creamy. I&#x27;m not super crazy about the scent, but it works well and was a great price with coupon and sub &amp; save.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. It seemed to be more like lotion than body wash, and it&#x27;s also very slippery (if that&#x27;s the right word). Which makes it hard to wash off. I usually like Olay body washes, but I&#x27;d rather stick to a different version in the future</li>
            <li> Skins feels nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the dove sensitive skin body wash! The smell can be too strong for some people, but I personally love it because smells like an expensive french fragrance!</li>
            <li> *** EDIT: I was just notified that this company pays for five-star reviews. Very shady. I was given ten dollars to purchase the product and told to notify the payee before posting a review of less than five stars. Because I left a genuine 4-star review, I was not compensated my additional ten dollars. ONE STAR!!! *** This product does its job to moisturize. For the price, it&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;ve certainly used better. I wish the ultra moisture was scented differently.</li>
            <li> great product, easy to use. will buy again.</li>
            <li> the package had a problem, so the product was leaking.</li>
            <li> Lathers up real nice!!</li>
            <li> Expected. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This is really good I highly recommend it it&#x27;s worth the money 💵.</li>
            <li> Works well on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love the fragrance.. Will surely buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Smooth and Healthy!</li>
            <li> This is creamy and smells wonderful.  It does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> this has a strong cheap-smelling perfume odor, which i don&#x27;t care much for.  however, the odor doesn&#x27;t last long and the moisturizing is good.  i will use the full bottle, but i will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent but the moisturizing beads stick to the floor of the shower and will not rinse into the drain with just a splash of water. One must instead give them a good sponging off before they will depart as they should. The end result is that the floor of my shower is now quite slippery. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivity and extremely dry skin. I have an extremely hard time finding soaps and body washes that I can use with these two combined conditions. This body wash moisturizes my skin without drying it out or leaving a film on my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works and smells great!</li>
            <li> This product is so perfect &amp; soft. I prefer Olay than anything else..</li>
            <li> I actually have the body cream, t I use it alone or with 1 of my oils, great price, well worth it!</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.  It smells delicious and leaves my skin feeling very smooth.  Price is very good too.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!! It is great on my sensitive skin. I have ordered this a few different times. I will say that the price in this product fluctuates wildly!! If you are wanting to buy this and don&#x27;t need it immediately I suggest waiting for price to be on the down swing, use a coupon, subscribe and save it and you can get a great deal!! For example it is selling for $5.35 currently yet with getting the great deal as I explained above I only paid $1.41!!</li>
            <li> Have not gotten. My eyebrows color or reimbursed  for it and this body wash is nasty it smell ugly like a dead dog really so nasty threw it away so disappointed  on everything please reimburse me now</li>
            <li> Great scent - creamy body wash....this is a new favorite!</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly,  love the product</li>
            <li> This smells like my great aunt took a bath with a perfumed &amp;#34;bath bomb&amp;#34; and then rolled around in a mixture of old lady perfume before dressing and spritzing herself with more terrible smelling perfume. Gross. Also, when I got the package, it had exploded all over.</li>
            <li> I find the smell off-putting. Can&#x27;t stand it.  Although it does cleanse well and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love using this body wash because it makes me feel fresh and rejuvenated after a nice warm bath. After using it, my skin feels soft and smooth. It&#x27;s rich lather and good scent makes me want to order it again soon!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for the skin as well as making it clean.  Scent is refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> Olay has always been one of my favorites. After bathing in it my skin feels so much better. It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Shea  butter and this lotion leaves my skin soft specially my husband skin since is always in need of moisture.</li>
            <li> i got this for a very good deal. And hands down favorite body wash. It leaves a light clean scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it leaves my skin very smooth! Will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> The BEST! Ordering more!</li>
            <li> I really like all the products from Olay.  This body wash smells so good! It leaves my skin really moisturized.  Got it with a clipped coupon, good deal. Nice size to bring along for traveling.</li>
            <li> Best bodywash I&#x27;ve used in years. No drying out my skin. Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling and makes my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells divine, a little goes a long way, and it is absolutely moisturizing! The only tip I want to leave is don&#x27;t use it to shave, as it will clog your razor like crazy.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizing body wash because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy to me and the scent is very light and it is easy to wash off.  I bought it from Amazon because they had the best price on it.  My skin does feel hydrated and softer after I use it without feeling coated.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes just right, the shea butter smells strong, and i can say my skin is a little less dry than usual</li>
            <li> i love it, smells really good and makes your skin extra soft olay is my favorite brand!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great!</li>
            <li> Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Husband LOVES this so I keep in wish list to add to order to get to $35 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Smells so delicious! And feels great too!</li>
            <li> Great Bargain and Good Product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt that it is a fine body wash, and probably good for the skin. My problem is that I identified it as the culprit to clogging the bathtub drain. And the tub floor becomes very sticky. This stuff is banned from my house.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> great product, feels great after shower</li>
            <li> I love Olay body washes.  They are worth the money and leave your skin feeling clean, supple, soft, and healthy.  No need for extra moisturizer after a shower.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy this on s&amp;s because my Lady cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> again, it it nice to have things shipped right to your door and you don&#x27;[t have to go out to the store</li>
            <li> Use it daily my skins soft and I feel clean!</li>
            <li> Excellent price with coupon... makes good alternative to bar soap for guests.</li>
            <li> Olay always has good stuff this is a deal for the price!</li>
            <li> very moisturizing and lathers very good i will be rebuying</li>
            <li> the cheapest price！nice product，if you use the product in winter，can make your skin smooth.however,if you use it when summer,make you have some acne</li>
            <li> My new favorite....this has a clean but not overpowering smell.  Really leaves my skin feeling moisturizer much more than other body washes or bar soap.  Love it!  Buy it on subscribe and save for a great deal.</li>
            <li> Olay Ultra Moisturizing Body Wash is a really nice feeling body wash.  It gives you a hint of smell without anything overwhelming.  This version of Olay is Moisturizing, so it helps put some moisture back on your body as you&#x27;re washing your natural oils away.  I always use a moisturizing body wash because my skin is dry, and if I don&#x27;t use one it feels as if my skin is drawn tight when I get out of the shower.  I had much rather feel the nice moisturizing feel of a moisturizing body wash like Olay Ultra Moisturizing Body Wash.  Then, I always apply lotion or body cream to at least parts of my body after my shower anyway.  If you&#x27;re looking for a nice all around moisturizing body wash, then I would recommend this product to you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay (or better) considering price, but I expected more from Olay. It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; and creamy as others, e.g. Dove Body Wash. I think I will pay a little more for a better product next time...which I think will actually be a better overall &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; (using less).</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly! It is so moisturizing that I&#x27;ve begun using this as my shave cream for my legs rather than actual shave cream. My skin smells wonderful and feels wonderful. This is the best body wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I do not like the scent at all. Good product, but the smell bugs me bad!!</li>
            <li> Really makes your skin nice and smooth. It smells great and is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I&#x27;m a man and this is better than soaps!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many body washes, trying to find something that did not dry my skin out and without having to use lotions or skin moisturizers.  I saw the used and demonstrated on The Talk, talk show, I decided to try it and wow, am I glad I did. After the first use I could tell the difference in my skin, the smell for me is not too strong, it is just right, it lathers great and you do not have to use alot.  I highly recommend this and will be purchasing it again, this is my body wash from now on, because it works and for healthier skin.  I did see the 3 pack, which I will order from now on, so I never run out. This stuff works!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Olay product in the past and never been so disappointed, I really enjoy products with shea butter in them. I think that the body wash itself is okay I would not call it, ultra. I can feel slight difference to regular body wash. The deal breaker for me is the overpowering flower scent, it is extremely strong, which would be okay if I liked the scent, I hate the scent. It reminds me of an elderly woman who doesn&#x27;t realize she has used to much perfume. I have had good experience in the past with Olay products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> This smells nice and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. She likes using it, but I think it has an odd scent that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy. Looking forward to when it&#x27;s all used up so she can go back to regular, scent-free soap.</li>
            <li> After using the Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash, my very dry skin felt much softer and less dry.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like the scent. Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;But personally I like aveeno body wash better. AVEENO® POSITIVELY NOURISHING® HYDRATING BODY WASH</li>
            <li> Product did not really moisturize.  I also did not care for the smell.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a great item. I watch for it to go on sale on Amazon or if Amazon has a coupon, and I grab it. Most of the times, I get this at Amazon much cheaper than I can buy in my local supermarket. As for the product, I love how it feels. Olay makes a great body wash. This actually feels like a better quality than most. When they say moisturizing they are not kidding. It makes your skin feel soft and smooth. Love it.</li>
            <li> Good and soapy and soft it just needs more of a fragrance like different types and its itch free too</li>
            <li> We bought these body lotions for Christmas presents and we were very pleased with the price and the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> My family loves it. I get it mailed every month</li>
            <li> im still on the hunt for my perfect body wash that is moisturizing and smells great. I loved St. Ives Vanilla but they have reformulated and combined some other ingredients and i dont like it anymore. I gave Dove a try and i dont like that one, I gave this one a try and its so-so. Maybe im just too picky. The consistency is not too &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; like the Dove its a lil thicker but not too much. It suds a little more than the Dove but not as much as Id like. I do feel moisturized so thats good. Try it , it may work for you. I smell nothing. Im on the lookout still and my next stop will be Aveeno</li>
            <li> This is one of the few body washes that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin... Couldn&#x27;t pass up on the price for the body wash.</li>
            <li> The soap has a soft scent, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I am VERY sensitive to smells so that is always a concern for me. It suds up well and leaves my skin feeling clean. I will say that my skin is still dray and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks. I do swim about 3 times a week so that may have something to do with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash. As someone who normally can&#x27;t be bothered to put on lotion, this keeps my skin soft without thinking about it. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Loved the price and the product.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling smooth and it smells great for both genders.</li>
            <li> This is smaller than a normal bottle</li>
            <li> I love okay products I have been using them for years. I really liked this body lotion the smell was great and my skin felt soft and moustrized all day</li>
            <li> Delivery on time.  This product lathers well and is smooth.  I love the moisture of my skin when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> Cheap and didn&#x27;t have to go to Walmart to pick it up.</li>
            <li> I like it but I found a larger size and cheaper price at walmart.</li>
            <li> smells good. Lathers nice, and washed away clean. doesnt leave sticky feeling on skin.</li>
            <li> Super bubbly and creamy</li>
            <li> My family uses the Olay Ultra Moisture Body Wash and it works great with moisturizing and hydrating our bodies. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion. My skin feels moisturized all day. I like it so much that I signed up for the subscribe and save program which mails me this body wash every month so that I am never without it. It is nice to get a product that does everything it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Was smaller bottle than I thought, was surprised when it came. My fault!  Look at size and price! Good product otherwise!</li>
            <li> I used to love this product when I lived in the desert.  It&#x27;s not as great now that I live in a humid wooded area.  It does still moisturize, but then sweat builds up between the moisturized area and my skin and then I get a rash.  Not fun.</li>
            <li> Olay body wash is one of my favorites.. It lathers up real good and it&#x27;s soft &amp; silky and smells good..  You know ur clean when using any of their body wash products.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.  Not like other Olay products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use lotions or cremes or anything labeled &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; because they leave me feeling a layer/coating on my skin.  This is sad since I have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, though, turned around my whole experience!  Smells wonderful, feels wonderful, and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I Love Olay!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love olay body wash. Its our family go to Body Wash. Everyone in the house loves it and it doesnt cause any irritation. If you havent tried this and you have sensitive skin, treat your skin and try it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent smell and helps moisturize as well. Kind of expensive here, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several body washes, but this one is one of my top 5 I like to use in the winter.  Keeps my skin hydrated a bit better than others.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  I recommend this to anyone who want a very nice, refreshing, guaranteed to get clean bath.  Lathers great and smells wonderful.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great Price, Great Product!</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister---It&#x27;s her favorite!</li>
            <li> My Mother uses this body wash and it helps with her extreme dry skin.  She is on dialysis and wants to be clean and feel good about her body.  Being 89 years, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t take care of your skin.</li>
            <li> Loved this body wash. Leaves skin moisturized and soft. Pleasant scent, too.</li>
            <li> very good Product for body wash.</li>
            <li> My favorite Body wash! It smells good and it leaves my skin moisturized and fresh. I love Olay products</li>
            <li> They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!! Love their product, great quality and will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the really big bottle and thought this was it, sadly it is smaller. I will not continue to subscribe.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially in the winter time. So I am very picky when it comes to my body wash. This wash from Olay not only smells amazing, but it keeps my skin hydrated and silky smooth! It lathers up nicely and rinses off clean, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or greasy feeling. Overall this is a great body wash that I will continue using year round!</li>
            <li> This product is good as usual for Olay. Would like it to be in larger quantities for the subscribe and save program though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was such a great deal; but unfortunately, I hate the smell.  For some odd reason, it has this...rusty penny smell to it.  I can&#x27;t quite pin it, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant.  The fragrance doesn&#x27;t make me feel fresh and clean after my showers.  Great deal though.</li>
            <li> Great body wash, hydrate my skin well... Love it</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite moisturizing body wash. This has an excellent scent. Smells like jasmine. It foams up super well when I apply it to my bath poof. Great cleansing that is gentle. Leaves my skin super soft and hydrated. I highly recommend this body wash.</li>
            <li> Creamy and smooth. Makes my skin smell good</li>
            <li> This body wash is very soothing, as it contain an entire container of moisturizer. In the wintertime when skin gets dry this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Most Olay products are great. This is no different. Wish it would come in bulk for the subscribe and pay program however.</li>
            <li> the best product . I mean body wash.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing body wash with a very nice, pleasant scent. I received this item at discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used this a little, but so far I like it a lot. It came out to about the price of hand soap on sale, yet this is so much richer, it doesn&#x27;t dry as much as regular soap. I use it with one of those plastic &amp;#34;loofah&amp;#34; balls, and use liquid soap primarily to avoid soap scum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this body wash is nice, though not my fave. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Olay products lately, having discovered a face wash via Amazon as well. I used to think of it as an old lady brand from the famous pink face lotion (which I much like, especially the scent), but I&#x27;m a modern convert.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash. Smells fresh! Would def buy again</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I love this. It&#x27;s my favorite bodywash!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and keeps your skin soft!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing product, love this body wash and will be a repeat user.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  My skins feels pampered though, so I do really like it!</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizing body wash, would recommend.</li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty well. I purchased it due to the dryness caused by the winter time (in the northeast, the dry heat is constantly draining the moisture out of the air) and I would say that it has lessened the need for lotion and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Meh.  It&#x27;s really strong - my husband says the scent about knocks him over.  It also stains fabric - my formerly-white washcloths are a blue-gray in the middle now - so use a plastic pouf.  On the plus side my skin is smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> i like it really lathers up good it is a good body was im gonna use it again like the feeling.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling lovely!</li>
            <li> I love Olay Ultra  Moisturizer and this was a great buy. Thanks Amazon for your Black Friday sale.</li>
            <li> It is indeed moisturizing as the name implies. I bought it with a subscribe and save just because it was a good price and I had nothing to lose. Great product. Will keep buying in the future.</li>
            <li> I am loving this body wash. It feels so silky. I don&#x27;t need much because it does go on so smoothly that it&#x27;s easy to use a little and make it go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft. As far as dry skin, well it&#x27;s not really helping with that. But I&#x27;m currently suffering from very severe dry skin right now for some reason. Usually winter is my worst time of year for it, but this summer is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other places where I&#x27;m not suffering dry skin, I feel soft.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and found it cleaned my skin and left it soft and smooth.  I enjoyed the scent and have ordered it several times through Subscribe and Save.  It isn&#x27;t expensive and well worth the price.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Very thick and leaves a residue feeling on skin. The smell is way too strong as well.</li>
            <li> will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with how creamy this is.  It makes your skin very soft.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a major smell.  It smells light so everyone can use it.  I think this beats any fruit scented body wash out there.</li>
            <li> This is te only body wash I use.  It goes great with the Olay bath bars I love.  Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of smell!&lt;br /&gt;when u used that you will feel that~~just try it OLAY is a good try!</li>
            <li> Love it love it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the most moisturizing body wash that I&#x27;ve tried, and I have tried a LOT of them.  I get very dry skin in the winter, with frequent itching and cracking, that goes away when I use this product.  No other product works, including the generic versions of this body wash.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough to people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash it leaves me skin super soft and smells great. I will buy more again when I run out :)</li>
            <li> When using this body wash i feel fresh and clean. It has moisture in it but it still cleans deep in your skin. The price was not even $2 because I used Amazon coupons. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for 2 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> The thick cream and water separated since I first time use it. I couldn&#x27;t use it at all but not worth to return it.</li>
            <li> Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)</li>
            <li> I used it once while traveling and maybe I had the wrong cloth.  I will try again with a sponge/netting.  Fragrance was very nice, not overwhelming as with some bar soaps, a plus because of my husband&#x27;s delicate nose.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing lotion that I found after a lot of false promises .Great price! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love anything shea - this is a real treat in the shower! Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> nice soft wash thx deb</li>
            <li> I love this product,use it all the time,leaves skin with nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> Did not like,ordered wrong product</li>
            <li> I love the scent so much!&lt;br /&gt;My skins so unbelievable soft.. Only body wash I will use</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel using this Olay product.  This is thick and creamy and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love the Olay bodywash! Very moisturizing...leaves skin soft!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Body Wash.  It smells great and I always feel refresh after taking a shower!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the texture.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> i only use this to shave - it&#x27;s much quicker to apply than shave gel and works wonderfully!  i really wish i hadn&#x27;t gotten this scent, though - it&#x27;s very loud and cheap smelling.  headache inducing.  i think i&#x27;ll give this one away and try one of the other fragrances, or perhaps the unscented version.</li>
            <li> This body wash really moisturizes as it states, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. A little soap goes a long way with this one. It smells great too! I recommend this Olay product to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! Leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> If you plan it right, you can get this high quality body wash for less than $2 here on Amazon. I see this retail at $3 and up at Wal-Mart and target, so check back when Amazon has their coupon clips plus subscribe and save option to save $$. As for the wash, it has a nice, pleasant scent and moisturizers the skin without leaving a sticky residue. I also notice my skin feels softer if I pair this with a nicer loofah. Overall, a body wash that keeps my skin soft and my wallet happy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash and this one smells amazing, and does moisture your body very well. Also it latters great, which is a big thing for me since if a body wash doesn&#x27;t latter I usually don&#x27;t repurchase it. But this one I sure will, once I run out since I bought two when they went on sale!</li>
            <li> good product for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more for my $, but the convenience was nice.</li>
            <li> Purchase this product a lot!  Does make your skin feel moisturized rather than dried out after a shower.</li>
            <li> Like Olay products &amp; this one was a good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I love it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use Olay instead of dove. This Olay version is my favorite. Silky smooth and soft with a nice light fragrance. It is a tad expensive for soap but I have not found anything that I like better yet.</li>
            <li> the product overall is great. It does make my skin a bit softer. And it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Omg!!! I love this product. It makes my skin smooth and silky, and the fragrance is amazingly. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> One of the best body washes for the price.</li>
            <li> Just came in. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> got it for $1.85 from the subscription deal. LOVE it! smells great! wish i ordered more!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and I love this soaking in the tub, nicely done olay.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an Olay product in years. It was always thought to be for old people (which is who I always saw using it when I myself was a teenager.) Well I suppose I&#x27;m one of those old people now because I bought this and it works great. The scent isn&#x27;t strong or overwhelming. I smell like I just washed my butt but didn&#x27;t swim through a strawberry stream in the process. My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or like a film was on it like some soaps can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually a Dove fan, but I think I&#x27;ll bring this body wash into rotation.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft</li>
            <li> This smells awesome and works excellent!!</li>
            <li> Watery compared to the brands I usually trust (gold bond).</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I notice a huge difference in skin moisture after shower.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash.  I enjoy the subtle and clean scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The price here was great too! I went to the store to buy more and the price was a lot higher. I&#x27;m sticking with Amazon!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and does not dry out my skin.  It is creamy and feels good on my skin.  Great body wash.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and have to be very careful what I put on my skin. This body wash is very hydrating. It feels lovely on my skin and is very thick! I actually prefer this over Dove. It smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I like the smell.  Every time after my daughter used it, I can feel a very comfortable smell from her.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this body wash. It is very thick and creamy and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was blown away by is incredible fragrance and softness. It is like showering in a luxury spa. My husband loves how it makes my skin feel and smell. This product is great for shaving because it is so thick. It lasts a long time because you only need a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the body washes that your entire family can use. It leaves the skin so soft and moisturized!! the good things is that there is no string perfume or feminine fragrance added to it so my husband can also use it and he likes it too.</li>
            <li> This has a powdery smell to it, and smells more like a lotion you&#x27;d rub into your skin than one you&#x27;d bathe with.  I&#x27;m not impressed. No complaints about the ability to clean.  I will finish the bottle but will not buy again. St. Ives oatmeal &amp; shea is my regular and I&#x27;ll go back to it.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! Love this product</li>
            <li> As we age our skin gets drier and we tend to have itchy skin . . . This product truly helps so much.</li>
            <li> This allows you to skip the step of lotion later while feeling very clean. I  will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely amazing and left my body feeling so hydrated and smooth, Love Olay and this product</li>
            <li> Eh. Nothing terrible, nothing great.</li>
            <li> Works great and is always a great price on the subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery. Used this and my body felt moisturized.  Good smelling too.</li>
            <li> Great deal the best moisturizer</li>
            <li> I had never tried Olay body wash but since this was such a great price I decided to take the leap. I&#x27;m glad I did. This body wash is wonderful. I have sensitive skin so there are a lot of shower products that I can&#x27;t use more than once. This is a product that I can use over and over again.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, or cause any rashes. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, either.</li>
            <li> Smelled really good made my skin feel really smooth!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite body wash!  The scent is subtle yet fresh and soothing, and the body wash makes a nice amount of suds to make you feel nice and clean.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and soothed all day.  I highly recommend this body wash!</li>
            <li> works well for shaving cream and cheap</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash, but I feel unsure about putting scented things on my body.  Too many chemicals.  I will go for unscented next time.</li>
            <li> We have used Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash With Shea Butter for years and really like the product, but be aware that this is the small bottle and not the large (23.6 oz) bottle. I just bought 3 large bottles at Sam&#x27;s for $11.88</li>
            <li> i love the scent of this, also love the way it really leaves skin silky and soft too  A+++ will def get again</li>
            <li> smells awesome and skin feels soft after using</li>
            <li> Great body wash. Smells and feels great!</li>
            <li> I dont ever use it but she loves it.. so, its all good and 5 star from me for something I never get to use.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and smell as great.  This is my winter body wash</li>
            <li> I have used for years since my aging skin dried out.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s okay I guess and not soapy. I thought at first it&#x27;s a lotion LOL</li>
            <li> Olay is my favorite!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;I love how it leaves my skin soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Nice clean smell</li>
            <li> I love this product so does my daughter</li>
            <li> I love all Olay products.  This body wash is very good.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and cleans great. My skin is soft</li>
            <li> We have used Olay Ultra Moisture Moisturizing Body Wash With Shea Butter for years and really like the product, but be aware that this is the small bottle and not the large (23.6 oz) bottle. I just bought 3 large bottles at Sam&#x27;s for $11.88</li>
            <li> Love the product, it just helps rejuvenate my skin to keep it young looking. Everyone thinks I am about 10 years younger then I really am!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing product and it smells amazing!  It lathers up very well and is concentrated so a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay for years. Nothing else keeps my skin as moisturized, especially through the long winter months. Love being able to have it shipped right to my door!</li>
            <li> My wife uses Olay Body Wash all the time. I was happy to see this on Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34;. The product arrived, and at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Love the product...however available lot cheaper at Sam&#x27;s club. Considering the additional 20% you get on subscribe and save...this still turns out to be more expensive.</li>
            <li> Bar none the best body wash. Worth every cent! Moisturizers and cleans.  Feel amazing after a shower.</li>
            <li> This is very nice on the skin. The smell is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> Really satisfied with this moisturizer, I have been using a small dabble a day and it keeps the wonderful coconut scent all day long along with keeping my skin being incredibly soft. I&#x27;ve been using it both morning and night to stay really fresh all day..even through my daily exercise routine.</li>
            <li> Olay has always been one of my favorites. After bathing in it my skin feels so much better.  It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works really easy- easy to apply, lather and wash off. The scent wasn&#x27;t too strong and will go away after finishing your shower and drying off. The shea butter really does make your skin softer. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this luscious and delightful body wash? It has just absolutely enhanced my showering experience. From its tantalizing aroma, to the silky feel of it on my skin, not to mention the smooth state in which it leaves my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is some amazing body wash! I started using it recently. I work long hours and I swear a lot. I also hate feeling gross so I tend to shower twice a day. So my skin gets easily dried out. But with this wash my skin doesn&#x27;t dry as bad. In combination with lotion it&#x27;s amazing. The smell isn&#x27;t over powering, simply a clean fresh smell. I would recommend most of the Olay products.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price</li>
            <li> Purchase frequently. Good price and smells great. Helps make skin softer. I use it also for shave cream.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> Smell is awful and this product leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> Feels so great on my skin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright! Nothing spectacular!</li>
            <li> This body wash is everything. SO moisturizing, SO nice smelling. My husband loves it too. Man I wish you could buy this in gallon-size!! I was a bit worried about buying this online and it spilling everywhere during shipping but it was packaged and bagged very well.</li>
            <li> Lathers great, feels great afterwards as well, big fan of Olay soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially addicted to this body wash!  I am a serial body wash buyer. It took me forever to find one that I will actually buy a second time. This one was it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing and leaves you feeling clean and moisturizer. It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and never makes you feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using it I rarely need body lotion. Really glad I made this purchase. Especially with the great subscribe and save price.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizing body wash.  It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent. It has a light creamy feel and leaves your skin soft.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Still using it and it is the same body wash I bought in Walmart and Target.</li>
            <li> AS A MAN I HATE HAVING TO PUT LOTION ON AFTER I SHOWER WITH THIS YOU CAN SHOWER AND AFTERWARDS YOUR SKIN IS SOFT NO LOTION NEEDED GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Its a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular item does not produce as much foam and soapiness as other brands</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was more of a liquid soap than a moisturizing body wash.  It did not lather well and did not have any scent.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing bodywash! Smells terrific too!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and super cheap, I love this</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good and I like the way it makes my skin feel!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Keeps body soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> good one. Every one can use this</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash. I used to have problems with dry skin on my lower back even after putting on lotion. With this body wash that&#x27;s no longer an issue for me!</li>
            <li> like it but the bottle is small and go through it too fast...will purchase larger bottles in future</li>
            <li> Great smell. Good feel on skin.</li>
            <li> Never really felt clean using a body wash until i tried this one. I like that i felt clean and moisturized at the same time.  Good product and great deal</li>
            <li> My wife likes this as her body wash for extra moisturizing - &amp; as an added bonus, it was our &amp;#34;5th Subscribe &amp; Save item&amp;#34; - so we received a 15% overall discount on our bill. The extra money we saved - it helped offset the sales tax that Amazon must now charge for items shipped to VA.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My winter skin couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> Olay is by far one of the best body washes.  The packagaing was superb, no complaints. I had quick shipping with this, never had to wait long. You can never go wrong with any product of Olay!</li>
            <li> I love the smell it is very good.</li>
            <li> I like the product over all. Its works as promised, moisturising your skin as you wash. Feels creamy when applied in the shower but does not feel weird on your body after you dry off. The itchiness I get from chlorine pools has been elevated as I hoped. The fragrance is moderate in the shower but light soon after you leave that area. It smells nice if you like floral scents. I was not disappointed by the size as I can read, it clearly states 13.5 Oz in the freaking title. Complaining because you expected it to be bigger is not taking responsibility for your actions as a consumer. To all the people who read this, please don&#x27;t let the bitterness of a few cloud your judgment. Oh it suds like normal too.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this! The fragrance is superb!</li>
            <li> love the feel and scent</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this scent, too perfume-y.  Texture is nice.  Would not reorder.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash! I have semi-sensitive skin and sometimes it gets itchy with other washes, that was definitely not the case with this one. It also felt very moisturizing, and there was no strong scent (I usually choose scented body washes but this was a nice change).</li>
            <li> OMG Silky smooth luscious skin is what you will have after one use, yup thats it 1 use!! I love the yummy fragrance it has and how soft and smooth it feels as it cleans and moisturizes you from head to toe! Olay is known for high quality products and the Ultra mositure moisturizing body wash is very top quality and is now on my grocery list everytime i need bodywash!</li>
            <li> I only have one issue with this body wash, it doesn&#x27;t clean well. I sweat most of the day since I&#x27;m an athlete and when I shower I want the smell to come off. For that to happen I had to use my bath and body works shower gel before this or I&#x27;d go to bed stinky. What I did love is that it make my eczema disappear and I didn&#x27;t have to put on lotion what so ever after using this. If you don&#x27;t make much of a stink then this will work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Philosophy Girl, but I liked the smell and creaminess of this body wash.  Shea butter is a must for dry ashy winter skin.</li>
            <li> Good price on an old favorite. That beats walmart and that makes me happy. If I never have to step foot in another walmart that would make me a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Not a great price for this small bottle.</li>
            <li> This bottle is much smaller than what is sold in the stores.  I buy this all the time at whatever store I go to that has it for the best price.  My husband, who has dryer skin, swears by it.  Loves the product, but not the size of the bottle.  It&#x27;s actually overpriced for what you get in the store.  I just assumed it was the same size since I&#x27;ve never seen this small a bottle in the store.  hmmm, bummer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the only body wash I&#x27;ll use going forward, but i like it a lot.  I moisturize obsessively but I really noticed a difference in my boyfriend&#x27;s skin as he never moisturizes and his skin felt noticeably softer and less dry after using it.</li>
            <li> it does  do a nice job of moisturizing skin. Makes it feel very smooth, and suds well for shaving. However this smells terrible. I&#x27;ll be buying a new body wash soon because I hate the smell so much.</li>
            <li> momma loves this stuff, nive scent lingers and skin is smooth</li>
            <li> Perfect body wash nice</li>
            <li> The Olay products are usually recognized by their quality and this one follows suit.  If you are looking for a great body product, you can not go wrong with this moisturizing body wash. I have dry skin and using this in my shower gives my skin a little bit more moisture.  I then combine it with a good body lotion and am good to go the whole day.  No need to re-apply lotion later, my skin would survive a full day without any other lotion application and not in small part because of this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product---very moisturizing and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great product..I have used Olay products for years and they are fabulous!</li>
            <li> makes my skin sooo smooth and smells great! I love Olay! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer at a great sale price.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and with a coupon offered it was a no brainer for me to grab this up! Great even on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Love this Olay with Shea oil. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth that I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion after showering if I choose not to. I highly recommend this and it too will become a product you can&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> This product was worth the buy. After my husband and I were done in the shower, our skin felt smooth. Olay body wash fragrance  smelt great. I didn&#x27;t have spray any body mist or perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love all of Olay products. This body wash is very nice, silky and smooth leaves your skin feeling very soft. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> It smells like old ladies, but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This body wash is great. The smell is perfect. Not too strong or weak. It moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy.  It lathers up nicely and has a beautiful sent.  Skin feels moisturized and soft all day. Will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin is the key. That is what you get by using this wash.</li>
            <li> I like the soap and lather but hate the scent. It smells like cheap bathroom spray to me. But leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my hair. Just takes a little and it works wonderfully. My hair isn&#x27;t as dry because of the Olay lotion in it. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even use conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have not come across a better body wash than this one (even much higher priced ones do not compare).  Smells great, moisturizes amazing (you do not even have to apply lotion after) and the mixture stays on the whole day.  Love this body wash, could not be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Lots of soft lather with this product.  Not too perfumy either. Love it!</li>
            <li> This bottle is much smaller than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s not necessarily tiny, but It&#x27;s not as large as other Olay body moisturizers. It really provides a good lather, and I didn&#x27;t feel too dry after using it, but I still needed to use a moisturizer afterwards. It&#x27;s also got a thin consistency. I used this after I used my Dove body wash and the density is noticeably different. It also smelly strongly of honeysuckle. Not in an overly sweet, cloying way but enough to linger for maybe an hour after you get out of the shower. I&#x27;m not a particular fan of flowery scents so it&#x27;s not for me, but if you like that smell you&#x27;re in luck!</li>
            <li> As expected; quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one- but this stunk to high heaven. Honestly, it smells like feces to me. Will not buy again, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Skin soft with a quiet fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been pretty loyal to Dove Body Wash for about the past 10 years, but Amazon has a killer deal on this stuff so I tried it. It&#x27;s great! Smells awesome, not irritating on your skin (I have sensitive skin). You also need very little soap on your poof. You get so much lather from about a dime size.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! It&#x27;s smell really nice!!!</li>
            <li> Was liquified upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness of this body wash and it doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin.</li>
            <li> I love order health and beauty products from Amazon, and this one did not disappoint! The scent of this moisturizing body wash is outstanding! I love that I can smell it an hour later when I go to bed. Also, it lathers very well. I have been using it every day for a week now and it is helping my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Excellent!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin super soft. smells nice.</li>
            <li> Olay has been my favorite bodywash and the best thing is it is available worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently subscribed to this bodywash subscription but have been using this brand since many years. Comin to this bodywash - It has all the goodness of facial moisturizer too and yes I use it on my face too. Its not too foamy (depends on the quality of water) , so I use a little extra sometimes to get more foamy bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does its job cleans and moisturizes my body. Like in the product it says it has 1 jar of moisturizer ... and I feel that it is right because I dont need  to moisturize right after the shower... but I do of course. On lazy days when I dont use moisturizer after bath , my skin still remain soft n hydrated for few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can really recommend it.. definitely to tackle the dryness, dunno whether its age-defying though.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this body wash. Very moisturizing and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite body washes, but it does do the job.  Was ordering, because I had on my ship and save, which made the price great.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Have used it for years.  It has a nice fresh scent, suds nicely, and is moisturizing.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Some years back, I started getting dry itchy skin. And I mean really itchy. I could hardly bear it. I would wrap my legs in order to deal with the itch. You know, like ace bandages. The pressure would give some relief and eventually the itch would subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on the subject and found several ways to lessen my condition.  From what I understand, the itch is caused by small invisible cracks in the skin.  A few things I learned was not to shower with hot water, keep my showers short, do not use soap, and do not rub my skin dry (with a towel), rather, pat dry or air dry.  So on the line of not using soap, I also found this Moisturizing Body Wash. I tried different products, but found the best relief came from this Olay product. It has really saved me so much grief over the past four or five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t have extremely dry itchy skin.  This Moisturizing Body Wash is nice and smooth, lathers up plenty good, and as it&#x27;s title would suggest, it Moisturizes! I&#x27;m now back to enjoying long, very hot steamy shower with no difficulty. I still pat my skin dry and I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;m very happy with the results I get from this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find my review helpful,&lt;br /&gt;Scott A.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various &#x27;flavors&#x27; of Olay Body Wash for years. This is actually the perfect size for use in the shower, too.</li>
            <li> Good, but a very small size similar to a sample size Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE body wash and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds. I keep going back to this one. I highly recommend this for it&#x27;s ease of use (washes off easily but is not drying) and smell potency (perfectly scented; clean not perfumey). Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love Olay.  Good product and great smell.</li>
            <li> A lot of moisturizer, great smell!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it! So nice on the body and shipping was fast. Im very satisfied</li>
            <li> Smells so wonderful. Reminds me of Hawaii. Makes my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Absolute must have. Makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Works great, cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li> Smells really good, moisturizing. Good price.</li>
            <li> This product has an odd odor that is not Shea butter odor. I can&#x27;t place it but it is very flowery and is displeasing. It is very overpowering this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap also does not seem to moisturize as well as I expected, so I will not be repurchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price, 1.75 it was a decent product.</li>
            <li> I like it which make my skin smooth, the price is also cheap.</li>
            <li> excellent price quick shipping</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent and it lasts a very long time!  At first I thought I was crazy for spending so much for so little. It only takes a quarter sized dollop (and that&#x27;s still a bit much) to lather up and use all over.  It hasn&#x27;t changed my skin drastically, but it does help keep it moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands really oily and sticky feeling I had to was it back off. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash a lot. It&#x27;s creamy out of the bottle, but it foams up nicely with my wash cloth. It&#x27;s not heavily fragranced, but it does have a nice, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Great body wash ,my wife is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Best price I ever paid for this product and I love how it makes me feel!  Rick lather and skin soothing.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> this is pne of the best body washes I have ever used, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great scent and makes skin smooth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> My skin feels better after using this. Incan actually feel a difference. Goodbye itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and us it every day. But be careful reading the description. I miss read it and thought it was 23oz but it is only 13oz so it is not the great buy I thought it was.Totally my mistake but make sure  you read the the description.</li>
            <li> Not a good deal.  But a great product.  More bang for your buck going to the store.</li>
            <li> I always used Dove but noticed my skin was very dry after the shower.  I switched to this and don&#x27;t need to apply lotion. Dove seems to clean more which is why it dries my skin more.</li>
            <li> Smaller size than I thought so it&#x27;s only an okay price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Leaves too much of a film on skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is me, but Olay body wash has a weird after smell. I like the primary fragrance of it, and it lathers up nice, but as I rinse, there is a weird smell that I don&#x27;t care for. I&#x27;ve tried a few &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; but that smell is still there. I have switched brands.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for years!</li>
            <li> My grandson wants some for his house! My husband loves it....asked me to buy more.</li>
            <li> every one in the house loves it</li>
            <li> Nice change from soap use luffa gets very soapy</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and leaves skin super soft. The fragrance lingers long after showering too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this product.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a very long time for a body wash that I could use with my super-sensitive skin and I&#x27;m thrilled that I stumbled across this one.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for everyday use and it&#x27;s such a treat as it leaves my normally very dry skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - and a better price than even Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it and at a great price too</li>
            <li> the product spilled n it was all messed up in the packaging</li>
            <li> Love this, best body wash ever! Leaves my skin moisturized, feeling great, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It smells good.  If feels good.  I will buy it again,  However, I will also be careful not to put it on the bottom of my feel because it is slippery.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I always use Oil of Olay&#x27;s body wash as it keeps my skin from getting too dry. I just wish they sold this in the same size as they do in the grocery stores. I use this within a month easily!</li>
            <li> I bought this here on amazon as a gift, but have bought it myself in the past and think it&#x27;s great! I love the Olay Moisturizing Body Wash for winter time because it is a thicker/non gel-like body wash. I wouldn&#x27;t say it moisturizes my skin exactly, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture either. It feels nice to use and leaves my skin feeling silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother and my sister both have really sensitive skin, and they both love this! My mother has psoriasis and this is pretty much the only body wash she will use even! So overall a great product, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this great deal on subscribe and save.  We usually get it at Costco, but this was a good deal.  Olay does moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 6years and I love it,it makes my face complexion beautiful,glowing soft and skin looks brand new it really makes a difference love it</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the only body wash that works excellent with my skin. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I have no more dry skin and my skin is so soft. I love it and will definitely continue purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Olay with moisture has a nice smell cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry.  Still need lotion after use but nice overall.</li>
            <li> Really great body wash at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Great quality to price ratio. There are other brands that may have fancier chemicals/ingredients, but this does what it is suppose to, plus it is not as oily as other butter infused body wahes at be afterwards. The smell is not overpowering as well.</li>
            <li> Olay makes some real good moisturizing products and this is definitely one of them. Unfortunately, the fragrance is just a little too potent for me.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t use yet but smells so good ...</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about ingredients. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the best soap ever created and when it goes on sale makes it even better!</li>
            <li> Olay has a nice fragrance and leaves skin clean and soft.  I would recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> i have actually used this product before so i know that it really works on my skin. this product is a definite purchase and if i must say that if i could i would purchase at least 6 of these at one time.</li>
            <li> leaves body so so soft and silky. Just love this product. i will be purchasing it in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great body wash!! I have tried many this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I guess it works fine as a soap but I feel it has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again</li>
            <li> Gave me a rash all over my body</li>
            <li> My favorite Body Wash, hands down!  I have used several different body washes over the years, and Olay Ultra Moisture is the BEST product if you want soft skin.  And because this product is so thick, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash. It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This did help with my dry, itchy, winter skin alot better than dove did. It doesn&#x27;t feel licky on my skin, but leaves my skin feeling very clean and moisturized. I have even been able to skip using lotion, although there are some days where I do need it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. The first time I used it I thought it smelled like an old grandma. I would give it 4 stars but the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb I to skin. Left residue all over my black leather upholstery.</li>
            <li> Good item! Very soft!</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price! Olay keeps my skin moisturized, clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to use this because of the scent/ fragrance but it worked out fine, I / usually only use unscented body washes I / wish it came in a bigger bottle although you only need a little I use / this with my exfoliating cloth quarter size amount you can use less and that&#x27;s all I need. One bottle did last mine a good while. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now. It really creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on you after your shower like some soaps but that&#x27;s okay, them soaps are very harsh andbto strong for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick and luxurious formula. It has fragrance, but it dissipates quickly. I use a special scrubber towel with this, and a little goes a long way. Two, quarter-sized dollops is more than enough for me, and it&#x27;s bubbles up wonderfully. If you shave, it&#x27;s a wonderful alternative to shaving gels or creams.</li>
            <li> Love the Olay!! Just wish it was a larger size. Maybe I need to change the delivery frequency.</li>
            <li> This really works great I love the smell and it makes my skin SO soft that I can still see it the next day and that is with me skipping lotion.I have to say normally my skin would be visibly dry so it&#x27;s amazing to me.This is my permanent in my life now that is for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. The texture is thick and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t wash away with a slight sprinkle from the shower water. It has a great smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I use it not only as body wash, but also as shaving lotion. It leaves my skin super silky. I don&#x27;t even need to apply lotion after getting out of the shower!! Fantastic product</li>
            <li> I love all Olay products.</li>
            <li> ITS OK, IVE HAD BETTER. I DONT LIKE THE SCENT BUT IT IS A GOOD CLEANSER AND SOFTNER.</li>
            <li> Of course I love it! Makes me silky smooth no lotion/oil  in the summer</li>
            <li> This one was definitely surprising for me. Although the product wasn&#x27;t bought for me specifically, I decided to try this out and wash my face with it. I&#x27;m a 26 year old male, and sometimes dry skin in the winter is frustrating, so I figured the moisturizing in this could help. Amazingly enough, it did wonders for my face. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth, and my beard feels nicer too even!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely gotta recommend this one for just about anyone!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Really helps my dry skin. Gets me squeaky clean and smells nice. What more could you want from body wash?</li>
            <li> I have always loved this bath lotion since I first discovered it.  I am so glad to have a chance to buy it in a small size bottle.  All I see in stores is the 23+ oz bottle.  That is much more than I need at one time, and the bottle is too awkward to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell for this particular shower soap. Can&#x27;t beat the price for this item.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than i thought and I think I can get the huge bottle at walmart for the same price.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash. My hubby uses it daily in the shower. It leaves your skin soft and refreshed. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but this one is by far the best. I keep coming back to it! Sometimes it&#x27;s a little pricey that is when I try another brand. But, all in all, I like this one the best. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Luxurious body wash, it feels so good! I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  The price for this in the stores is around $5.</li>
            <li> I love how silky soft I feel after using this product.  They only thing that keeps me from buying it on a regular basis is the cost.  I got this one by clipping the available coupon.</li>
            <li> After having used Caress as my primary Body Wash, I wanted to switch things up and so I chose Olay for its&#x27; reasonable price. I&#x27;ve never tried this product before so I was willing to test it out so that I could give it a fair review.  After having used this product for a week, I am in love!  The smell is amazing! Also, I loved the amount of moisture it gave my skin as it felt fresh and soft right out of the shower. I love it so much that it has now become my primary Body Wash!</li>
            <li> Love olay and that it keeps my skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash and i feel like it moisturizes very well but I don&#x27;t feel like this is the best deal. You could probaley get similar body was for cheaper at target or something.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out, but I did get the itchies and flaky skin from using it. Hadn&#x27;t used Olay bodywash in *years* but saw the Sensitive formula and thought I&#x27;d give it another chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have time to put lotion or oil on your skin right after your shower, your skin will be kind of flaky/ashy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave 2 stars because no rash, no redness, formula was creamy and lathered up nicely. If I thought it wouldn&#x27;t wreck the stuff I&#x27;d add some baby oil and shake it up to make it more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love these, can&#x27;t really say that it&#x27;s moisturizing for me personally because I have really , really dry skin. But it smells good and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t lying when they say that there&#x27;s cans of lotion mixed in.  You&#x27;ll fee like you&#x27;re washing with lotion, but it really cleans well and is everything you&#x27;d want in a moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> This soap has a lot of lather</li>
            <li> I am a Olay girl. I have nott used it because I am still using my last Olay purchase!! A must buy for me..:-)</li>
            <li> Wow, this Olay Ultra Moisture Body Wash impressed me. I like Olay products anyway but I decided to grab this when it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much lather! One squirt of this on my loofah last the whole shower. You really don&#x27;t need a lot to get your whole body clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells lovely too. A soft, pleasant coconut scent. Very clean and fresh smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth as well. I think this might be my favorite new body wash. I would definitely reorder this.</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin look better, love it</li>
            <li> Nice to be clean and still not have to smell like a tropical rainforest.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin super moisturized.  Smell is nice but nothing to write home about. Would be a good product to use in the winter when your skin dries out all the time.</li>
            <li> best body wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It clans my body when it use it in the shower. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Price is right. I appreciate the delivery every 2 months or whenever you chose.  I&#x27;m disabled so I can&#x27;t go out and shop like I use to. Amazon works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> very good quality. will recommend.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Ultra Moisture Body Wash with Shea Butter is the best inexpensive body wash that I have ever used. It leaves my sensitive skin feeling very smooth and pampered. After a shower it leaves a faint nice smell. I am never going back to a different brand. After the first use, you can already feel the difference - soft and smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I had come from a bad experience from buying a dove body soap, which seemed like liquified bar soap, not in a good way. This is night and day with what i had. I had to check the label as it feels like i was using conditioner instead of soap! Like i said, great stuff, wish i had a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a body wash that moisturizes my skin as well as Olay does. It improved the look and feel of my skin even after just one time of using it. I usually don&#x27;t even need to put on lotion after getting out of the shower! I have really sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Olay ultra moisturizing body wash.  It smells amazing and actually moisturizes my skin (that is usually extremely dry) as promised.  I recommend this body wash to anyone who needs a reliable product  that consistently:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Gets you clean&lt;br /&gt;2.  Leaves you smelling great&lt;br /&gt;3.  Moisturizes your dry/dehydrated skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this body wash will not disappoint you.</li>
            <li> What can I say? This is the only body wash I have bought for a year and it&#x27;s all I will buy. Smells great, lathers amazing and leaves my skin feeling smooth love it!</li>
            <li> This is great; I prefer the ribbons and I just don&#x27;t think this one smells as good as other Olay washes.  Other than that personal opinion, it&#x27;s recommended.</li>
            <li> This feels &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and smells good.  I like the idea of &amp;#34;ultra moisture moisturizing. Also, it&#x27;s nice to be able to order one body wash instead of 2-3 since it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful , moisturizes great</li>
            <li> Love this.  Great for the quick showers after exercising in the AM before work.</li>
            <li> Hey, this is one body wash that does what it is supposed to do.You willfeel like a queen as you slide your silky feeling body between the sheets.</li>
            <li> I paid $4.55 and this is way smaller than you would get at Walmart for the same or lower price.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Olay Moisture Body wash worked great for me with my extra-dry and sensitive skin. I could not believe how soft and nourished my skin felt afterward for the whole day! Using continuously, improved the overall health and nourishment of my skin even more! I even noticed my skin was less itchy and irritated.</li>
            <li> Bottle small for price,smells nice,but don&#x27;t see much difference from other cheaper brands</li>
            <li> Smells amazing works amazing!</li>
            <li> Great body wash that I have used for a long time.  The purchase was a good value.  Each bottle was wrapped well and the entire package arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. It smells clean, it&#x27;s just not for me. This product does a great job with moisturizing. Which is great, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite body washes! Leaves skin feeling extra clean and soft.  &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Helps with dry skin</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and  include it as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; often.  Great smell, great moisturizing, great deal</li>
            <li> Great scent!&lt;br /&gt;Only need a small amount for a big lather.</li>
            <li> Feels good, does it&#x27;s job, but the scent is way too overpowering and florally for my tastes. (I prefer more of a clean/soothing scent rather than a powerful floral scent).</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I melted some 100% Natural Shea Butter that I purchased on Amazon and poured it in the body wash. Makes this stuff 100 times better than it already was!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible! We use olay body bars thought this would be the same...its not ... Its really bad !</li>
            <li> I love this Olay body wash it makes my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> Love the feeling it leaves &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> this has a nice light scent to it, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay brand.  Has been helping my skin ease out of the winter months and cut down on dry skin.</li>
            <li> makes skin very soft - great product!</li>
            <li> great price again and I love how soft this makes my skin especially since this winter has been so ruff on the skin!!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin and this stuff has really helped a lot. I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of body washes in my time. I have to say this one has been my favorite for quite a long time now. I ran out recently and had a bottle of something else in the cabinet so I put that in the shower and wow. It really made me appreciate my Olay! I&#x27;ve tried other varieties but this one works best on my dry skin. Keeps it much softer, I&#x27;m not itchy, etc. I will make sure I do not run out again.</li>
            <li> Smaller then I thought it was going to be, but for the price.. I would buy it again lol.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooo good! So smooth and creamy, very moisturizing. The scent is pleasant. A bottle lasts a while, just a small amount creates lots of lather, especially when you use a shower loofah.</li>
            <li> arrived on time,, always use oil of olay products</li>
            <li> Amazing body wash for dry skin.  It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and was a good deal at the discounted price absolutely loved it  keep giving good deals thank you</li>
            <li> Great product and a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve bought it from Amazon several times now.</li>
            <li> I no longer smell like a old moldy cucumber dipped in sewage.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and able to store upside down so product easily available.  Great product for Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I love olay body wash! It has always smelled so good and left my skin soft! I love that it lathers great</li>
            <li> This product gave my wife and I rashes, lasting 3 days. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells amazing! Olay always leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> Olay has always been one of my favorites. This product is definitely another great addition to the oil of olay beauty skin care line. It is very thick and creamy and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have found this body wash to be great! It is very  moisturizing  writing and feels soft on my body!</li>
            <li> I love all Olay body wash and this is no different. Great moisturizing and nice clean scent!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! This feels great and smells nice. The body wash made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell!&lt;br /&gt;I hate to use lotion so this body wash is perfect to nourish my skin :)</li>
            <li> I bought it for a great add on price, the texture is so creamy but the smell..... I&#x27;m 24 and it makes me feel like an very old person.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and made my skin soft.....</li>
            <li> smells great and gets me refreshed and ready to go for the day. would recommend</li>
            <li> Very good scent and lather. Love the way my skin feels after the shower.</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry but in just a weeks time began to get softer. Love it!</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay .. need I say more - LOVE IT</li>
            <li> My entire family loves this creamy, moisturizing body wash-not oily, just enough lather that rinses off easily-- the scent is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It was ok..Didn&#x27;t make a lot of suds and was kind of slick..</li>
            <li> Very good body wash, can&#x27;t go wrong, I definitely prefer this to most others. Good consistency not too thick or too thin</li>
            <li> it arrived in time. I just used it for one time and it seemed work well.</li>
            <li> Very nice, smells great and leaves my skin baby soft.  I love it!</li>
            <li> smaller than i expected for the price, but I still love this body wash! I&#x27;ve tried dove&#x27;s moisturizing wash and this one is much more moisturizing and lathering</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizing body wash, would recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is good.  I use it every time I shower.  It has a nice scent which is always good.</li>
            <li> Gives a good moisturizing feeling... But if it&#x27;s the fragrance you are looking for this ain&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Perfect product.  We use this still and have used it for years and it&#x27;s consistently good.  Will keep ordering.  It has a great fresh scent and leaves my skin moisturized and feels great!</li>
            <li> Great body wash, smells nice and makes skin feel moisturized</li>
            <li> Not as nice at St. Ives, but the price was right...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bodywash! It smells super good and it is also great with moisturizing my skin. I love how moisturizing Olay bodywashes are! No other bodywash can compare to this brand! As soon as I run out of this product, I will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> This is awesome body wash! Defiantly will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Best body wash I have found for this old dry skin!  Nice fragrance.  Leaves skin feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> Yes,  after bath there is no need to use moisturizer. I have been using this since 2 weeks and I feel my skin is little softer now.</li>
            <li> The name speaks for itself.  I love this product and this product loves me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an Olay product in years. It was always thought to be for old people (which is who I always saw using it when I myself was a teenager.) Well I suppose I&#x27;m one of those old people now because I bought this and it works great. The scent isn&#x27;t strong or overwhelming. I smell like I just washed my butt but didn&#x27;t swim through a strawberry stream in the process. My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or like a film was on it like some soaps can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually a Dove fan, but I think I&#x27;ll bring this body wash into rotation.</li>
            <li> Olay has a nice fragrance and leaves skin clean and soft. I would recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a gamble buying scented things you haven&#x27;t actually smelled, but I took a chance on this one because I&#x27;ve generally liked the stuff Olay puts out.  Like most Olay bodywashes, this one&#x27;s gentle but effective.  You end up feeling clean but not scorched-earth clean.  What surprised me (pleasantly) was how good this smells, though!  Seriously, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the cheapest soap I found but it works like a charm. I have very dry skin and I hate using lotion or having anything on my skin but with this body wash I dont have to use as much lotion as before. It&#x27;s very hydrating and helps keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> i am not a super model, in fact i am not attractive, but the cream makes me feel good</li>
            <li> The product is good. I use it every time I shower.</li>
            <li> What was used was good. Most of it was wasted out</li>
            <li> best body wash out there!  leaves my skin silky smooth without having to use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> always been a fan of Olay for years, never been disappointed and this item is no different</li>
            <li> great product, nice smell, great price</li>
            <li> I really liked the scent of the  olay.I have allergies and it didnt aggravate thrm at all.I liked the fact that it was creamy; and susdy unlikr sone of the waterdowned body washes.This is something my family and I will get many uses of.I got it at a great priced, my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Smells soooooo good!!!! Fresh and clean! Amazing event and keeps your skin soft! Did I say how great it smells. Best smelling soap I&#x27;ve EVER used!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, moisturizing soap with a pleasant fragrance. Not sure if the price is a comparable value with &amp;#34;Walmart&amp;#34; or a drug store but I think I only paid 2 and a half bucks.</li>
            <li> I like it. It smells okay.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this soap and it leaves my skin very soft.  I have always like the Olay brand and I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li> best body wash i have ever used. you only need a few drops of the cream to create a lot of bubbles!</li>
            <li> Its body wash. Can&#x27;t really go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I got this body wash randomly when I saw a daily deal for it. I&#x27;ve been searching for something with a mild scent since most of my other washes are fruity or vanilla scented. I like the smell of this. It smells clean and fresh with a hint of hibiscus and lathers nicely without needing a lot of product. The only draw back I noticed is that it tends to leave my skin a little dry. However,for the value and nice scent I think this item is worth it.</li>
            <li> A nice body wash, but the scent is too strong for my taste. I like little to no scent, unless it&#x27;s woody or citrus. This is almost fruity. The moisturizing effect is lovely though.</li>
            <li> Great feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks to the plastic bottle&#x27;s wall, if you don&#x27;t want to waste it you have to mix in 1:1 ratio of water and shake it before every use , enough for 2-3 more weeks.</li>
            <li> price was low so I tried it.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin, but I personally dislike the strong and sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash.  I have never used an Olay product I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Wonderful bubbles! Keeps me from being so itchy with our dry air here</li>
            <li> Came at a great price. Lasts long. Moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I had a coupon so I tried this Olay body wash.  I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to body wash.  I like a scent that lasts, and this one delivers!  It&#x27;s a very nice smell but if you don&#x27;t like a strong smell, you might not like it.  It lathers well and is very creamy, leaving my skin feel so soft.  I will definitely buy this one again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Great price.</li>
            <li> Very good body wash and leaves my skin feeling very moisturized. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Olay Utra Body Wash, did its job it didn&#x27;t leave my body feeling tight which is important since I have dry skin. Would definitely buy again, I used coconut oil after drying for extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the smell really lingers i love this body wash!!</li>
            <li> Yes my skin is a bit softer. But I smell like an old spanish lady after I use it. The fragrance is SO strong I really can&#x27;t use it. Great price, but I understand why it&#x27;s so cheap now. I would try another type of this if there was an unscented one or maybe just one that&#x27;s not SO scented. I don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose or skin. This is just really too much.</li>
            <li> Good body wash and smells great. I like the soupy smooth feeling it gives when you wash up.</li>
