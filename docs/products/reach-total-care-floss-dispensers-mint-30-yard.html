            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for awhile but was quite happy to discover I could purchase it via Amazon because availability in stores was so sporadic.</li>
            <li>Great dental floss.  </li>
            <li>Very effective.  </li>
            <li>but I am so loving this floss!  </li>
            <li>Please try these items, diligently, and be prepared for a pleasant surprise.    </li>
            <li>having it transported by air, but this floss is so superior to others that I am making an exception.</li>
            <li>This is the best floss available today.  </li>
            <li>This leads to superior performance.</li>
            <li>Well,a s good as dental floss can be.</li>
            <li>-it hurts and isn&#x27;t good for you gums when it  cuts.</li>
            <li>It was all good and arrived as scheduled.</li>
            <li>so I am very glad to have a supply</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to order 6 more dispensers now!</li>
            <li>Product perfect, exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best so can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>For those users of this floss that find it effective, I urge you to also try the NIMBUS Brand tooth brushes (also found online).   </li>
            <li>This floss is nice to use with the flatter ribbon effect and slides between teeth easier plus a minty&lt;br /&gt;flavor.</li>
            <li>Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>sold out because it&#x27;s so popular?</li>
            <li>The photos of this floss lead one to believe that it will be fibrous and therefore specially effective.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase, it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>is much better than Glide because it also pulls plaque better than waxed floss, as good as the braided waxed floss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stretchy and very strong unless it gets a bit frayed or nicked -- after which it breaks very easily.    </li>
            <li>This is really some good floss!</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the unique and cool packaging of this product and its claim of being up to twice as effective as the competition, as well as the claims on the packaging of sliding easily, being easy to grip, and not shredding.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it seems too slippery to do a good job</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, no shredding, and I have had excellent dental exams the last 2 years since using this floss.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite floss</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth better, and doesn&#x27;t cut into your hands when you use it.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast reliable service</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am now enjoying using that floss.  </li>
            <li>Love these. ...</li>
            <li>I like this product and am glad you carry it.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it from Amazon, and getting it in bulk and for a reasonable price was great.  </li>
            <li>It is also easier to use--feels better in my hands.  </li>
            <li>The only floss I use, the best!</li>
            <li>I liked the 90 yard ones that used to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this dental floss.  </li>
            <li>Most of the stores I shop at stopped carrying this product</li>
            <li>One reason many people defer flossing is the fact that floss often injures the gingival and causes sore teeth that then must be treated by not flossing for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Safe and dependable.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I feared I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get more.  </li>
            <li>I have never been so impressed by an improvement in an every day product such as floss.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many teeth floss all over the world and nothing like this one ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything about this Reach Total Care Floss is as close to perfect as I&#x27;ve found in a dental floss.  </li>
            <li>The touch more mint flavor is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It cleans better between my teeth and can be manipulated faster in and out of teeth because it&#x27;s waxed.  </li>
            <li>I am glad you have it available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the most resistant to shredding of all flosses I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>That elasticity encourages you to floss more than with non-elastic floss.</li>
            <li>-- so was glad to find it online.  </li>
            <li>We love this dental floss but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere after we got hooked on it.</li>
            <li>Never run out, as it stretches to fit what ever you pull off the spool!</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this brand of floss.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>One frustration I have is that it appears they are not producing this floss any more - can&#x27;t find it anywhere but on the web</li>
            <li>stretching is great with no breakage....works beautiful for those whose floss breaks in tight spots</li>
            <li>This is easily the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used, as it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t tear against or draw blood from my fillings.</li>
            <li>I first bought this floss in a tall skinny container and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to slide in, and picks up much better than Glide.</li>
            <li>It is very strong, a little stretchy and the best thing about it</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, strong, sort of stretchy and more like dental tape then dental floss.  </li>
            <li>This is the first of many reviews I&#x27;ve written where I wish I could give the product 6 stars!</li>
            <li>so it gets in betwen the teeth in an extraordinarly easy manner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t impress easily.  </li>
            <li>easy on the gum and gets in between the teeth gaps.</li>
            <li>and it slides easily without shredding.</li>
            <li>What I like about it, is how easily it slides between teeth.</li>
            <li>This floss is strong and elastic.  </li>
            <li>It is a fine product and dentists recommend it.</li>
            <li>The description of this product led me to believe it would be just the right thing to replace my favorite floss, J&amp;J Reach Easy Slide, which has virtually disappeared from all the stores.  </li>
            <li>Feel fortunate to have gotten such a great deal.</li>
            <li>I bought a huge quantity of that when I saw it was going away, but now my supply is gone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 since I don&#x27;t care for waxed floss, and this is lightly waxed.    </li>
            <li>I found that it&#x27;s too stretchy, easily breaks, and glides too easily to actually clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame that the bulk roll is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t break easily and seems to clean well.  </li>
            <li>but if I have to go without some junk food snack once in a while to be able to afford it, so much the better for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I happen to find this very useful</li>
            <li>Happy to have a long time supply</li>
            <li>you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different types of floss including woven floss which I liked a lot</li>
            <li>The woven texture allows you to stretch it to get into the smaller spaces between teeth which makes flossing easier and more effective.</li>
            <li>I went for a period not using this product and my next dental checkup was not as good when the hygienist measure for pockets.</li>
            <li>Love this gentle way of flossing.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase - I have always bought this at a local pharmacy - and they haven&#x27;t had it in recent months</li>
            <li>Used correctly, it is my opinion that THIS flss can be of tremendous benefit to almost every type of dental patient.</li>
            <li>As described, quick shipping</li>
            <li>It costs more, but if it does a better job it is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>Great Reach Total Care Floss, tastes fresh and really cleans between teeth</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is great, and it is slightly elastic</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is slightly stretchable, which makes it more effective than nylon.  </li>
            <li>No one can PROMISE any particular outcome; the final outcome rests with YOU and your own diligence and motivation !  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product, thin profile great if your teeth have little to no space between them.</li>
            <li>At best, you can save yourself a lot of unnecessary pain and expense.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better, I think, than the old Oral B Ultra Floss.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Reach Total Care for using Amazon to make this available. :)</li>
            <li>The floss has a \\&quot;stretchy\\&quot; quality that seems to clean between the teeth quite well, although it seems a bit more prone to break than traditional floss.</li>
            <li>I flossed right afterwards with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>exactly right or keep changing your grip.</li>
            <li>It does not cut into my gums and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole yard to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really feel like my teeth are clean and</li>
            <li>The stuff they ship does not reasonably resemble the picture or the product (which used to be available at most stores and pharmacies).  </li>
            <li>Super fast service.  </li>
            <li>The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed</li>
            <li>The Reach Dentotape that some others have reviewed so highly is too thick to easily manipulate between my fairly snugly placed teeth and its non-mint waxy taste is mildly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, strong enough that I can use a short length of it to clean all my teeth, and I very rarely have problems with it breaking.  </li>
            <li>but if you floss correctly, I&#x27;m certain that it will perform just a good as any other product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never stretched it until it breaks, but I&#x27;m sure it will at some point.</li>
            <li>The stores run out of this product very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering several online to be sure I have it.  </li>
            <li>I love Reach Total Access dental floss.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These smaller sizes are more pricy but</li>
            <li>This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY different flosses.</li>
            <li>Love this Total Care floss!</li>
            <li>I like the elastic quality of it because I often have cut my gums with the other kind of floss</li>
            <li>great product and hard to find, thanks.</li>
            <li>and the floss is soft, gentle, comfortable to use, and cleans the medial aspects of the teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>As a result I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market.  </li>
            <li>It does a far superior job than any other floss on the market.  </li>
            <li>The width and elasticity make it far superior to any other floss.  </li>
            <li>Of course, this is not LITERALLY true, but it darn near feels like it.</li>
            <li>True, it frequently gets cut by those troublesome teeth, but it does *not</li>
            <li>It is THE MOST COMFORTABLE floss I have ever used on my very tightly spaced teeth.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li>Looks nice, stretches a little and breaks every time you use it.</li>
            <li>and it has grooves on the floss which really holds onto the plaque.  </li>
            <li>I received my order promptly for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am so happy Amazon has it since I looked far and wide to find it in numerous stores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for asking -</li>
            <li>I would like to see the bigger packaging be available.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My dentist gave me a free sample and now it is the only floss I use.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>arrived fast and as advertised</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This floss really works well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like it,</li>
            <li>so I was willing to give this new one in the funky packaging a try.</li>
            <li>Not completely shred resistant but it doesn&#x27;t shred easily.</li>
            <li>This is the first floss I&#x27;ve used that eliminates my dismay that the old Oral B Ultra Floss was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are tightly packed, so resistance to shredding is very important to me.</li>
            <li>It costs a little bit more than stranded-waxed floss, but because it&#x27;s so easy to use and very durable, your time spent  </li>
            <li>Great product but could not find it in local stores lately.  </li>
            <li>Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit more expensive per yard than most flosses, but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous flosses and flossing devices and this is the first that I would be willing to give a five star review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend either of them over this one.</li>
            <li>I like this floss since my teeth are widely spaced and fairly smooth.  </li>
            <li>It works well at removing my plaque, but I don&#x27;t let much plaque build up since I brush frequently, as well as flossing and using an oral irrigator (the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Fast and complete.  </li>
            <li>From an environmental point of view I would rather buy it somewhere that I normally shop instead of</li>
            <li>but I suspect that he is not using a fresh area of floss for each gap which could save you money in the short term.  </li>
            <li>I can rarely find Reach Total Care in stores --</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing quite like having a more traditional floss shred into little fibers that get stuck between your teeth, and having to carefully work out the shreds with yet more floss, to convince you that this stuff has its virtues.  </li>
            <li>it removed debris that this new Reach did not.  </li>
            <li>It is wide and it stretches, so you can cover every tooth surface and get them squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I a very surprised  </li>
            <li>I like this type of floss very much and could not find it in local stores.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is pretty intense, which leaves an impression at least of your mouth being clean after you finish flossing.    </li>
            <li>I find it easy to work between tight teeth</li>
            <li>After using it past 8 months, my hygienist couldn&#x27;t stop raving about how healthy my gums are.</li>
            <li>flossing will be much quicker, more effective, and without those annoying breakages.</li>
            <li>My two all-time favorites are Reach Woven Mint and Reach Cleanpaste (an updated version of the woven, which is hard to find these days) - both of these have a soft, woven texture that easily gets between my teeth, doesn&#x27;t cut my gums, and has enough texture to really clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are close together and tear up plain floss very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of floss, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li>It is strong and doesn&#x27;t fray even on the one sharp edge on one of my teeth that always used to fray regular floss.  </li>
            <li>I only need about 6-8 inches because it is so sturdy to do the whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>This floss, in combination with the Nimbus brand toothbrushes [...], you can practically perform a complete dental cleaning at home.</li>
            <li>Flexible and soft on tender areas.  </li>
            <li>Even though the description and picture was of Reach TOTAL CARE floss, I received Reach GENTLE GUM Care floss.  </li>
            <li>Typical move from a major company to get rid of something that was so highly rated and effective and replace it with slick packaging but no substance.  </li>
            <li>For those tight places, I can stretch the floss to fit it in, then relax it while doing the actual flossing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find the tall container that had a lot of floss on it, so must settle for the 30 yd.</li>
            <li>You probably already know that you must bring the floss tight against the side of a tooth and pull up (or down depending on whether you&#x27;re flossing the top or bottom) toward the end of the tooth to dislodge hiding particles and to scrape away tartar and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fairly tight spacing between my teeth, so have some difficulty finding the right floss.  </li>
            <li>Removes plaque better than any other product I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I personally use this floss and least twice a day, it removes all sorts of left over \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that other flosses cannot effectively remove.  </li>
            <li>Between these two itms, used proprerly, you will acieve a high level of personal dental hygiene, and impress the hell out of your Dentist &amp; Hygienist and, at the same time cut down on expensive dental procedures by reducing bleeding gums,reducing calculus buildup, reducing periodontal pocket depths; all sorts of good things.</li>
            <li>It is a wide-width floss and has a very elastic rubber band-like feel which makes it soft on the fingers and easy to hold onto without cutting off circulation to your fingertips.</li>
            <li>My local drugstore does not carry it (they obviously never tried it), but it is far and away the floss I like to use.  </li>
            <li>This is the first floss that I have personally encountered that I actually look forward to using on myself, EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li>It slides between tight spaces and is very satisfactory, especially for the elasic nature of thr floss</li>

            <li> Great service.  </li>
            <li> Great floss.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for awhile but was quite happy to discover I could purchase it via Amazon because availability in stores was so sporadic.</li>
            <li> Great dental floss.  </li>
            <li> Very effective.  </li>
            <li> but I am so loving this floss!  </li>
            <li> Please try these items, diligently, and be prepared for a pleasant surprise.    </li>
            <li> having it transported by air, but this floss is so superior to others that I am making an exception.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss available today.  </li>
            <li> This leads to superior performance.</li>
            <li> Well,a s good as dental floss can be.</li>
            <li> -it hurts and isn&#x27;t good for you gums when it  cuts.</li>
            <li> It was all good and arrived as scheduled.</li>
            <li> so I am very glad to have a supply</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to order 6 more dispensers now!</li>
            <li> Product perfect, exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the best so can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> For those users of this floss that find it effective, I urge you to also try the NIMBUS Brand tooth brushes (also found online).   </li>
            <li> This floss is nice to use with the flatter ribbon effect and slides between teeth easier plus a minty&lt;br /&gt;flavor.</li>
            <li> Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> sold out because it&#x27;s so popular?</li>
            <li> The photos of this floss lead one to believe that it will be fibrous and therefore specially effective.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase, it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> is much better than Glide because it also pulls plaque better than waxed floss, as good as the braided waxed floss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stretchy and very strong unless it gets a bit frayed or nicked -- after which it breaks very easily.    </li>
            <li> This is really some good floss!</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the unique and cool packaging of this product and its claim of being up to twice as effective as the competition, as well as the claims on the packaging of sliding easily, being easy to grip, and not shredding.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it seems too slippery to do a good job</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, no shredding, and I have had excellent dental exams the last 2 years since using this floss.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth better, and doesn&#x27;t cut into your hands when you use it.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast reliable service</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am now enjoying using that floss.  </li>
            <li> Love these. ...</li>
            <li> I like this product and am glad you carry it.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it from Amazon, and getting it in bulk and for a reasonable price was great.  </li>
            <li> It is also easier to use--feels better in my hands.  </li>
            <li> The only floss I use, the best!</li>
            <li> I liked the 90 yard ones that used to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this dental floss.  </li>
            <li> Most of the stores I shop at stopped carrying this product</li>
            <li> One reason many people defer flossing is the fact that floss often injures the gingival and causes sore teeth that then must be treated by not flossing for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Safe and dependable.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I feared I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get more.  </li>
            <li> I have never been so impressed by an improvement in an every day product such as floss.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many many teeth floss all over the world and nothing like this one ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything about this Reach Total Care Floss is as close to perfect as I&#x27;ve found in a dental floss.  </li>
            <li> The touch more mint flavor is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It cleans better between my teeth and can be manipulated faster in and out of teeth because it&#x27;s waxed.  </li>
            <li> I am glad you have it available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the most resistant to shredding of all flosses I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> That elasticity encourages you to floss more than with non-elastic floss.</li>
            <li> -- so was glad to find it online.  </li>
            <li> We love this dental floss but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere after we got hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Never run out, as it stretches to fit what ever you pull off the spool!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this brand of floss.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> One frustration I have is that it appears they are not producing this floss any more - can&#x27;t find it anywhere but on the web</li>
            <li> stretching is great with no breakage....works beautiful for those whose floss breaks in tight spots</li>
            <li> This is easily the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used, as it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t tear against or draw blood from my fillings.</li>
            <li> I first bought this floss in a tall skinny container and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to slide in, and picks up much better than Glide.</li>
            <li> It is very strong, a little stretchy and the best thing about it</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, strong, sort of stretchy and more like dental tape then dental floss.  </li>
            <li> This is the first of many reviews I&#x27;ve written where I wish I could give the product 6 stars!</li>
            <li> so it gets in betwen the teeth in an extraordinarly easy manner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t impress easily.  </li>
            <li> easy on the gum and gets in between the teeth gaps.</li>
            <li> and it slides easily without shredding.</li>
            <li> What I like about it, is how easily it slides between teeth.</li>
            <li> This floss is strong and elastic.  </li>
            <li> It is a fine product and dentists recommend it.</li>
            <li> The description of this product led me to believe it would be just the right thing to replace my favorite floss, J&amp;J Reach Easy Slide, which has virtually disappeared from all the stores.  </li>
            <li> Feel fortunate to have gotten such a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought a huge quantity of that when I saw it was going away, but now my supply is gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 since I don&#x27;t care for waxed floss, and this is lightly waxed.    </li>
            <li> I found that it&#x27;s too stretchy, easily breaks, and glides too easily to actually clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is a shame that the bulk roll is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t break easily and seems to clean well.  </li>
            <li> but if I have to go without some junk food snack once in a while to be able to afford it, so much the better for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I happen to find this very useful</li>
            <li> Happy to have a long time supply</li>
            <li> you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different types of floss including woven floss which I liked a lot</li>
            <li> The woven texture allows you to stretch it to get into the smaller spaces between teeth which makes flossing easier and more effective.</li>
            <li> I went for a period not using this product and my next dental checkup was not as good when the hygienist measure for pockets.</li>
            <li> Love this gentle way of flossing.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase - I have always bought this at a local pharmacy - and they haven&#x27;t had it in recent months</li>
            <li> Used correctly, it is my opinion that THIS flss can be of tremendous benefit to almost every type of dental patient.</li>
            <li> As described, quick shipping</li>
            <li> It costs more, but if it does a better job it is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> Great Reach Total Care Floss, tastes fresh and really cleans between teeth</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is great, and it is slightly elastic</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is slightly stretchable, which makes it more effective than nylon.  </li>
            <li> No one can PROMISE any particular outcome; the final outcome rests with YOU and your own diligence and motivation !  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product, thin profile great if your teeth have little to no space between them.</li>
            <li> At best, you can save yourself a lot of unnecessary pain and expense.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better, I think, than the old Oral B Ultra Floss.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Reach Total Care for using Amazon to make this available. :)</li>
            <li> The floss has a \\&quot;stretchy\\&quot; quality that seems to clean between the teeth quite well, although it seems a bit more prone to break than traditional floss.</li>
            <li> I flossed right afterwards with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> exactly right or keep changing your grip.</li>
            <li> It does not cut into my gums and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole yard to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my teeth are clean and</li>
            <li> The stuff they ship does not reasonably resemble the picture or the product (which used to be available at most stores and pharmacies).  </li>
            <li> Super fast service.  </li>
            <li> The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed</li>
            <li> The Reach Dentotape that some others have reviewed so highly is too thick to easily manipulate between my fairly snugly placed teeth and its non-mint waxy taste is mildly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, strong enough that I can use a short length of it to clean all my teeth, and I very rarely have problems with it breaking.  </li>
            <li> but if you floss correctly, I&#x27;m certain that it will perform just a good as any other product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never stretched it until it breaks, but I&#x27;m sure it will at some point.</li>
            <li> The stores run out of this product very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering several online to be sure I have it.  </li>
            <li> I love Reach Total Access dental floss.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These smaller sizes are more pricy but</li>
            <li> This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY different flosses.</li>
            <li> Love this Total Care floss!</li>
            <li> I like the elastic quality of it because I often have cut my gums with the other kind of floss</li>
            <li> great product and hard to find, thanks.</li>
            <li> and the floss is soft, gentle, comfortable to use, and cleans the medial aspects of the teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> As a result I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market.  </li>
            <li> It does a far superior job than any other floss on the market.  </li>
            <li> The width and elasticity make it far superior to any other floss.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this is not LITERALLY true, but it darn near feels like it.</li>
            <li> True, it frequently gets cut by those troublesome teeth, but it does *not</li>
            <li> It is THE MOST COMFORTABLE floss I have ever used on my very tightly spaced teeth.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Looks nice, stretches a little and breaks every time you use it.</li>
            <li> and it has grooves on the floss which really holds onto the plaque.  </li>
            <li> I received my order promptly for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am so happy Amazon has it since I looked far and wide to find it in numerous stores.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for asking -</li>
            <li> I would like to see the bigger packaging be available.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a free sample and now it is the only floss I use.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> arrived fast and as advertised</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This floss really works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like it,</li>
            <li> so I was willing to give this new one in the funky packaging a try.</li>
            <li> Not completely shred resistant but it doesn&#x27;t shred easily.</li>
            <li> This is the first floss I&#x27;ve used that eliminates my dismay that the old Oral B Ultra Floss was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are tightly packed, so resistance to shredding is very important to me.</li>
            <li> It costs a little bit more than stranded-waxed floss, but because it&#x27;s so easy to use and very durable, your time spent  </li>
            <li> Great product but could not find it in local stores lately.  </li>
            <li> Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit more expensive per yard than most flosses, but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous flosses and flossing devices and this is the first that I would be willing to give a five star review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend either of them over this one.</li>
            <li> I like this floss since my teeth are widely spaced and fairly smooth.  </li>
            <li> It works well at removing my plaque, but I don&#x27;t let much plaque build up since I brush frequently, as well as flossing and using an oral irrigator (the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Fast and complete.  </li>
            <li> From an environmental point of view I would rather buy it somewhere that I normally shop instead of</li>
            <li> but I suspect that he is not using a fresh area of floss for each gap which could save you money in the short term.  </li>
            <li> I can rarely find Reach Total Care in stores --</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing quite like having a more traditional floss shred into little fibers that get stuck between your teeth, and having to carefully work out the shreds with yet more floss, to convince you that this stuff has its virtues.  </li>
            <li> it removed debris that this new Reach did not.  </li>
            <li> It is wide and it stretches, so you can cover every tooth surface and get them squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> I a very surprised  </li>
            <li> I like this type of floss very much and could not find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is pretty intense, which leaves an impression at least of your mouth being clean after you finish flossing.    </li>
            <li> I find it easy to work between tight teeth</li>
            <li> After using it past 8 months, my hygienist couldn&#x27;t stop raving about how healthy my gums are.</li>
            <li> flossing will be much quicker, more effective, and without those annoying breakages.</li>
            <li> My two all-time favorites are Reach Woven Mint and Reach Cleanpaste (an updated version of the woven, which is hard to find these days) - both of these have a soft, woven texture that easily gets between my teeth, doesn&#x27;t cut my gums, and has enough texture to really clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are close together and tear up plain floss very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of floss, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> It is strong and doesn&#x27;t fray even on the one sharp edge on one of my teeth that always used to fray regular floss.  </li>
            <li> I only need about 6-8 inches because it is so sturdy to do the whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> This floss, in combination with the Nimbus brand toothbrushes [...], you can practically perform a complete dental cleaning at home.</li>
            <li> Flexible and soft on tender areas.  </li>
            <li> Even though the description and picture was of Reach TOTAL CARE floss, I received Reach GENTLE GUM Care floss.  </li>
            <li> Typical move from a major company to get rid of something that was so highly rated and effective and replace it with slick packaging but no substance.  </li>
            <li> For those tight places, I can stretch the floss to fit it in, then relax it while doing the actual flossing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find the tall container that had a lot of floss on it, so must settle for the 30 yd.</li>
            <li> You probably already know that you must bring the floss tight against the side of a tooth and pull up (or down depending on whether you&#x27;re flossing the top or bottom) toward the end of the tooth to dislodge hiding particles and to scrape away tartar and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fairly tight spacing between my teeth, so have some difficulty finding the right floss.  </li>
            <li> Removes plaque better than any other product I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I personally use this floss and least twice a day, it removes all sorts of left over \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that other flosses cannot effectively remove.  </li>
            <li> Between these two itms, used proprerly, you will acieve a high level of personal dental hygiene, and impress the hell out of your Dentist &amp; Hygienist and, at the same time cut down on expensive dental procedures by reducing bleeding gums,reducing calculus buildup, reducing periodontal pocket depths; all sorts of good things.</li>
            <li> It is a wide-width floss and has a very elastic rubber band-like feel which makes it soft on the fingers and easy to hold onto without cutting off circulation to your fingertips.</li>
            <li> My local drugstore does not carry it (they obviously never tried it), but it is far and away the floss I like to use.  </li>
            <li> This is the first floss that I have personally encountered that I actually look forward to using on myself, EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> It slides between tight spaces and is very satisfactory, especially for the elasic nature of thr floss</li>
            <li> The thin waxed stuff cuts my gums and glides too easily to actually clean anything.  </li>
            <li> I think the packages are about the same cost as other flosses, but a package is only 30 yards, so per-yard it is probably several times more expensive than alternative flosses.</li>
            <li> Reach Floss is different from other flosses in several key characteristics.</li>
            <li> Once you use the floss, you won&#x27;t ever go back to Glade or any other regular floss.</li>
            <li> This floss really gets hard to reach spaces between your teeth.</li>
            <li> The stretchiness is unexpectedly helpful in terms of holding onto the floss, keeping it tight, and getting it to eject particles from between teeth with a single stroke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After starting to use this several years ago, other floss seems useless - doesnt clean.  </li>
            <li> Once the stretch is released, pulling the floss back and forth is less likely to bruise or cut the gums, and any obstruction is removed.</li>
            <li> The floss is wide and flat, does not break or fray.</li>
            <li> Other flosses come up short.  </li>
            <li> and I suspect that will dry up too.</li>
            <li> I see that several other kinds of floss are marketed under the \\&quot;Reach\\&quot; brand name, so you shouldn&#x27;t confuse this product with other kinds like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Fits tight spaces, conforms, scrubs, rarely breaks, never leaves a fiber behind.</li>
            <li> Beats regular floss hands down - no fraying!</li>
            <li> The floss is slick, and therefore generally ineffective.  </li>
            <li> B001F51Y68 Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss, Icy Mint Flavor, 50-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 6)]].</li>
            <li> I would rather pay a few extra bucks for dental floss than to pay a dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this Total Care floss in stores and hope they&#x27;re not discontinuing it.  </li>
            <li> surface is rough, i.e. the microgrooves, also making it easier to hold.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I did have some success with the Hummingbird device with its pick attachments, but that tended to be an expensive solution and it seems they have discontinued the picks.    </li>
            <li> It stretchs and works through the empty areas between your teeth.</li>
            <li> This seems like such a waste.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if your teeth are closely spaced or if you have dental work that the floss could snag on then you should avoid it.  </li>
            <li> Never tears or and can get it in areas where other floss hurts, like under crowns where gums have receded a bit.  </li>
            <li> CVS has stopped carrying it, couldn&#x27;t find it at Kroger and some other stores.</li>
            <li> I discovered this dental floss I stopped using any other brand or style.</li>
            <li> I ordered it here for about twice its usual price, as I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore - I only found out afterward that it&#x27;s been rebranded as &amp;#34;Listerine UltraClean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This floss has no peer in any other brand of floss I have used.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as we expected!</li>
            <li> If you have sharp spots between teeth, this floss will not fray.</li>
            <li> This floss does not shred and get stuck in your teeth like other floss.  </li>
            <li> However, we frequently are unable to find it in our rural area, so we decided to buy in bulk.  </li>
            <li> Well, this stuff isn&#x27;t the conventional stranded string that&#x27;s been wax-coated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, this is starting to get a bit hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I find I don&#x27;t need to use as much</li>
            <li> given that I have some sharp edges between some of my molars, which are also relatively tight together.  </li>
            <li> I have really tight contacts (the space between one&#x27;s teeth).  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so tight around your fingers</li>
            <li> This glides through tight spots without shredding as well as Glide.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It slides effortlessly into my tight gaps without ever hurting my gums.  </li>
            <li> ( for tight teeth)</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to since it&#x27;s stretchy, but now I don&#x27;t want to use anything else.  </li>
            <li> Have been having trouble finding this floss.</li>
            <li> and I was having trouble finding it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It is not cheap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> This is my first bad experience with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This floss reminds me of a long thin rubber band.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alternatives to floss in the past since floss always seemed to be either strangling my fingers until they turned purple, shredding, and/or sliding through my fingers.</li>
            <li> No more searching.</li>
            <li> This floss has been so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Had truble finding this locally lately.</li>
            <li> Lately (Dec. 2014).  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the new Ultraclean in almost every way.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I take my dental floss seriously.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether to try again and risk getting the wrong item again.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not coated in thick wax!</li>
            <li> Seems to be difficult to find this in stores lately.  </li>
            <li> Shredded thread can build up between teeth which feels uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we couldn&#x27;t find the floss in any drug or big-box store.</li>
            <li> The wrong item was sent to me.  </li>
            <li> Wife unhappy</li>
            <li> You will be angry and disappointed.</li>
            <li> To bad they discontinued making it :(</li>
            <li> I bought some, and was horribly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> the worst thing was it did not remove anything from between my teeth!  </li>
            <li> Try them (these two dental preventative items), all that can happen , at worst, is that you are out about $5, between the two items.</li>

            <li> Had truble finding this locally lately. Feel fortunate to have gotten such a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss there is and your price is the best too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been discontinued and that&#x27;s why I bought it.  Love the product and am sad it&#x27;s going the way of the dinosaurs.</li>
            <li> My very favorite floss of all time!  I a very surprised  that REACH has decided not to keep manufacturing it.  It does a far superior job than any other floss on the market.  So glad to find this on Amazon.  I think I&#x27;m going to order 6 more dispensers now!</li>
            <li> This has been the best floss I have ever used. It does not cut into my gums and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole yard to clean my teeth. I only need about 6-8 inches because it is so sturdy to do the whole mouth.  It doesn&#x27;t fray and shred like regular floss.</li>
            <li> Best floss I have ever found.</li>
            <li> (Reviewed after using one roll.)    This floss reminds me of a long thin rubber band.  It&#x27;s stretchy and very strong unless it gets a bit frayed or nicked -- after which it breaks very easily.    I like this floss since my teeth are widely spaced and fairly smooth.  It&#x27;s comfortable, strong enough that I can use a short length of it to clean all my teeth, and I very rarely have problems with it breaking.  On the other hand, if your teeth are closely spaced or if you have dental work that the floss could snag on then you should avoid it.  It works well at removing my plaque, but I don&#x27;t let much plaque build up since I brush frequently, as well as flossing and using an oral irrigator (the [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator]]).  I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 since I don&#x27;t care for waxed floss, and this is lightly waxed.    I see that several other kinds of floss are marketed under the \\&quot;Reach\\&quot; brand name, so you shouldn&#x27;t confuse this product with other kinds like [[ASIN:B001F51Y68 Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss, Icy Mint Flavor, 50-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 6)]].</li>
            <li> The description of this product led me to believe it would be just the right thing to replace my favorite floss, J&amp;J Reach Easy Slide, which has virtually disappeared from all the stores.  Typical move from a major company to get rid of something that was so highly rated and effective and replace it with slick packaging but no substance.  I was disappointed in the new Ultraclean in almost every way.  It was stretchy, so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t break, but it did, and it felt insubstantial, and the worst thing was it did not remove anything from between my teeth!  I flossed right afterwards with [[ASIN:B001FCMKN2 Radius Toothbrushes Floss,Cranberry Coated, Cranberry Coated 50 M (Case of 6)]] floss and it removed debris that this new Reach did not.  I don&#x27;t recommend it and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Best dental floss made.  It costs more, but if it does a better job it is worth the extra money.  I would rather pay a few extra bucks for dental floss than to pay a dentist.  Have been having trouble finding this floss.</li>
            <li> No need to worry about shipping or paying DOUBLE the price just shop at walmart and pick up 30 yds for 2.74. The floss has a \\&quot;stretchy\\&quot; quality that seems to clean between the teeth quite well, although it seems a bit more prone to break than traditional floss.</li>
            <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve found.  I have really tight contacts (the space between one&#x27;s teeth).  This floss is strong and elastic.  For those tight places, I can stretch the floss to fit it in, then relax it while doing the actual flossing.</li>
            <li> Lately (Dec. 2014).  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this Total Care floss in stores and hope they&#x27;re not discontinuing it.  The width and elasticity make it far superior to any other floss.  Never tears or and can get it in areas where other floss hurts, like under crowns where gums have receded a bit.  I have all crowned teeth.  I&#x27;m ordering several online to be sure I have it.  My dental hygienist uses it too.  CVS has stopped carrying it, couldn&#x27;t find it at Kroger and some other stores.</li>
            <li> This is my first bad experience with Amazon.  The product they show and promote and advertise is not what they send you.  The stuff they ship does not reasonably resemble the picture or the product (which used to be available at most stores and pharmacies).  Don&#x27;t do it.  You will be angry and disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss and I was having trouble finding it in the stores.  I am happy with the purchase, it arrived quickly.  It would be nice if it was a little cheaper but it&#x27;s the best so can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I love Reach Total Access dental floss. I had to get it from Amazon because I can not find it at my local grocery store nor drug store. I bout a pack of 6 just in case it is being discontinued. The floss is wide and flat, does not break or fray.</li>
            <li> This floss has been so hard to find.  It does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> I have fairly tight spacing between my teeth, so have some difficulty finding the right floss.  As a result I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market.  The thin waxed stuff cuts my gums and glides too easily to actually clean anything.  This floss has a tape shape which, together with the \\&quot;microgrooves\\&quot; gave me hope that it would work well. Reach makes my two all-time favorites so I was willing to give this new one in the funky packaging a try. I found that it&#x27;s too stretchy, easily breaks, and glides too easily to actually clean teeth.  My two all-time favorites are Reach Woven Mint and Reach Cleanpaste (an updated version of the woven, which is hard to find these days) - both of these have a soft, woven texture that easily gets between my teeth, doesn&#x27;t cut my gums, and has enough texture to really clean the teeth.  They also have a minty flavor that tastes great.  I&#x27;d highly recommend either of them over this one.</li>
            <li> I first bought this floss in a tall skinny container and loved it.  It took a little getting used to since it&#x27;s stretchy, but now I don&#x27;t want to use anything else.  I really feel like my teeth are clean and flossing doesn&#x27;t seem to be the necessary chore it used to be.  I got the best result at my hygienist I&#x27;ve had in years and the only thing I changed was the floss!  My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find the tall container that had a lot of floss on it, so must settle for the 30 yd. one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and this truly is the best dental floss in the world.  The floss is stretchy so it&#x27;s not so tight around your fingers and it has grooves on the floss which really holds onto the plaque.  Not completely shred resistant but it doesn&#x27;t shred easily.</li>
            <li> Love this floss and have been unable to find it at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It cleans your teeth better, and doesn&#x27;t cut into your hands when you use it. It&#x27;s expensive, but I find I don&#x27;t need to use as much</li>
            <li> I like this type of floss very much and could not find it in local stores. I received my order promptly for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast reliable service</li>
            <li> i think this is the best floss on the market.  I am so happy Amazon has it since I looked far and wide to find it in numerous stores.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Super fast service.  Product perfect, exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. To bad they discontinued making it :(</li>
            <li> Being a aging \\&quot;Boomer\\&quot; I take my dental floss seriously. This brand gets sold out at CVS and Walgreens so I got to order it on-line.</li>
            <li> ordered J&amp;J Reach Total Care.  Received J&amp;J Reach Gum Care...Wife unhappy</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best floss around. Easy to slide in, and picks up much better than Glide. Having difficulty finding it now, and can only get the 30 yard dispenser. Can&#x27;t find the 90 yard anymore. Hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued.</li>
            <li> Like the mint flavor, and does an excellent cleaning job on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;Once I discovered this dental floss I stopped using any other brand or style. But for some reason stores that used to carry it stopped doing so and I couldn&#x27;t find it. From an environmental point of view I would rather buy it somewhere that I normally shop instead of having it transported by air, but this floss is so superior to others that I am making an exception.</li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  Try it--you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used, as it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t tear against or draw blood from my fillings. I ordered it here for about twice its usual price, as I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore - I only found out afterward that it&#x27;s been rebranded as &amp;#34;Listerine UltraClean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking - I am very happy with the purchase - I have always bought this at a local pharmacy - and they haven&#x27;t had it in recent months so I am very glad to have a supply now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor Bruce</li>
            <li> I would like to see the bigger packaging be available.</li>
            <li> Great product but could not find it in local stores lately.  Amazon had it!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> My order arrived very shortly after I ordered it.  Great service.  I am now enjoying using that floss.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great floss. My dentist gave me a free sample and now it is the only floss I use.</li>
            <li> Love these. ...stretching is great with no breakage....works beautiful for those whose floss breaks in tight spots</li>
            <li> I like this product and am glad you carry it.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; floss.  My local drugstore does not carry it (they obviously never tried it), but it is far and away the floss I like to use.  I was able to get it from Amazon, and getting it in bulk and for a reasonable price was great.  I like the fact that it is slightly stretchable, which makes it more effective than nylon.  It is also easier to use--feels better in my hands.  This floss has no peer in any other brand of floss I have used.  Now I have to figure out what to do with the unused nylon floss I still have--maybe use it for fishing line.</li>
            <li> Best dental floss ever. Don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find it in local stores!</li>
            <li> I am a dentist, and as such, have tried literally dozens of types of floss over the years. This is the first floss that I have personally encountered that I actually look forward to using on myself, EVERYDAY. Used correctly, it is my opinion that THIS flss can be of tremendous benefit to almost every type of dental patient. Of course, there are exceptions to everything, however, the vast majority of users will find this to be an exceptionall brand of floss. I personally use this floss and least twice a day, it removes all sorts of left over \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that other flosses cannot effectively remove.  This floss, in combination with the Nimbus brand toothbrushes [...], you can practically perform a complete dental cleaning at home. Of course, this is not LITERALLY true, but it darn near feels like it. Nothing can replace a regular visit to a dentist and hygienist.  For those users of this floss that find it effective, I urge you to also try the NIMBUS Brand tooth brushes (also found online).   Between these two itms, used proprerly, you will acieve a high level of personal dental hygiene, and impress the hell out of your Dentist &amp; Hygienist and, at the same time cut down on expensive dental procedures by reducing bleeding gums,reducing calculus buildup, reducing periodontal pocket depths; all sorts of good things. Try them (these two dental preventative items), all that can happen , at worst, is that you are out about $5, between the two items. At best, you can save yourself a lot of unnecessary pain and expense.  No one can PROMISE any particular outcome; the final outcome rests with YOU and your own diligence and motivation !  Please try these items, diligently, and be prepared for a pleasant surprise.    NOTE: I DO NOT WORK FOR EITHER COMPANY AND DO NOT RECIEVE ANY monetary reward for posting my OPINION, and THIS IS MY OPINION, based on MY PERSONAL USE. In fact, I no longer practice dentistry, at all, although I do have a license to do so. So I recieve NO MONEY from ANYONE FOR ANY OPINION that I express, regarding dental products.</li>
            <li> Fast and complete.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> One package was overly waxed to the point that the floss was one mass of wax and floss.</li>
            <li> Could not find at the stores. This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It slides between tight spaces and is very satisfactory, especially for the elasic nature of thr floss</li>
            <li> arrived fast and as advertised</li>
            <li> The only floss I use, the best!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of floss, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> Just what Irequested; arrived in timely manner.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss available today.  Does not cut gums.  Does not break. Flexible and soft on tender areas.  Very effective.  I will never go back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; types of floss.</li>
            <li> Great Reach Total Care Floss, tastes fresh and really cleans between teeth</li>
            <li> This glides through tight spots without shredding as well as Glide.&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than Glide because it also pulls plaque better than waxed floss, as good as the braided waxed floss.</li>
            <li> Exactly as we expected!</li>
            <li> My order came in time, No problems</li>
            <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve ever used. I liked the 90 yard ones that used to be available on Amazon. These smaller sizes are more pricy but still the best floss I have found. Very comfortable, no shredding, and I have had excellent dental exams the last 2 years since using this floss.</li>
            <li> This floss is nice to use with the flatter ribbon effect and slides between teeth easier plus a minty&lt;br /&gt;flavor.</li>
            <li> I love this dental floss.  It is easy to use, strong, sort of stretchy and more like dental tape then dental floss.  Most of the stores I shop at stopped carrying this product so I decided to try Amazon.  Thank you Amazon for carrying everything I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that flossing is imperative for getting to the food particles that lodge between teen - especially in receding gums that happens with aging. One reason many people defer flossing is the fact that floss often injures the gingival and causes sore teeth that then must be treated by not flossing for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes Reach Total Care Floss and the floss is soft, gentle, comfortable to use, and cleans the medial aspects of the teeth thoroughly. It is a fine product and dentists recommend it. Safe and dependable. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. Removes plaque better than any other product I have used in the past.  The mint flavor is great, and it is slightly elastic so it gets in betwen the teeth in an extraordinarly easy manner.</li>
            <li> Reach Floss is different from other flosses in several key characteristics. This leads to superior performance. It is a ribbon not a thread. Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surface is rough, i.e. the microgrooves, also making it easier to hold. The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it stretches. This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length exactly right or keep changing your grip. The length adjusts to your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one downside: the cost. Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses. However, it is competitive with Oral-B Floss Tape. Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> SHOP AROUND FOR THE BEST PRICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product at a store which sometimes sells closeouts or discontinued items so I feared I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get more.  Thank God they still make it.  It is THE MOST COMFORTABLE floss I have ever used on my very tightly spaced teeth.  I have never been so impressed by an improvement in an every day product such as floss.  I don&#x27;t impress easily.  It&#x27;s true that it seems too slippery to do a good job but if you floss correctly, I&#x27;m certain that it will perform just a good as any other product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply pulling floss through the gaps is not sufficient for cleaning well.  You probably already know that you must bring the floss tight against the side of a tooth and pull up (or down depending on whether you&#x27;re flossing the top or bottom) toward the end of the tooth to dislodge hiding particles and to scrape away tartar and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one reviewer stated that this product frays.  Maybe so for him but I suspect that he is not using a fresh area of floss for each gap which could save you money in the short term.  However, using the same piece for several gaps could spread an infection or bacteria from one gap to another.  So don&#x27;t be stingy with the length you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different types of floss including woven floss which I liked a lot but I am so loving this floss!  It slides effortlessly into my tight gaps without ever hurting my gums.  It is strong and doesn&#x27;t fray even on the one sharp edge on one of my teeth that always used to fray regular floss.  It is not cheap but if I have to go without some junk food snack once in a while to be able to afford it, so much the better for my teeth.  This is the first of many reviews I&#x27;ve written where I wish I could give the product 6 stars!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  I&#x27;ve owned them before and the value here can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The woven texture allows you to stretch it to get into the smaller spaces between teeth which makes flossing easier and more effective. Once the stretch is released, pulling the floss back and forth is less likely to bruise or cut the gums, and any obstruction is removed. The stores run out of this product very fast.</li>
            <li> Beats regular floss hands down - no fraying!</li>
            <li> I have tried many many teeth floss all over the world and nothing like this one ever. easy on the gum and gets in between the teeth gaps. Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Best floss ever! Gets everywhere without shredding</li>
            <li> This is the first floss I&#x27;ve used that eliminates my dismay that the old Oral B Ultra Floss was discontinued.  I bought a huge quantity of that when I saw it was going away, but now my supply is gone.  Other flosses come up short.  The Reach Dentotape that some others have reviewed so highly is too thick to easily manipulate between my fairly snugly placed teeth and its non-mint waxy taste is mildly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this Reach Total Care Floss is as close to perfect as I&#x27;ve found in a dental floss.  It&#x27;s actually better, I think, than the old Oral B Ultra Floss.  The touch more mint flavor is refreshing.  It cleans better between my teeth and can be manipulated faster in and out of teeth because it&#x27;s waxed.  The stretchiness is unexpectedly helpful in terms of holding onto the floss, keeping it tight, and getting it to eject particles from between teeth with a single stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit more expensive per yard than most flosses, but you get what you pay for and then some with this.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very good floss. I am glad you have it available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous flosses and flossing devices and this is the first that I would be willing to give a five star review. I&#x27;ve tried alternatives to floss in the past since floss always seemed to be either strangling my fingers until they turned purple, shredding, and/or sliding through my fingers. Devices that hold the floss won&#x27;t work for me because my teeth are too close together. I did have some success with the Hummingbird device with its pick attachments, but that tended to be an expensive solution and it seems they have discontinued the picks.    I was impressed by the unique and cool packaging of this product and its claim of being up to twice as effective as the competition, as well as the claims on the packaging of sliding easily, being easy to grip, and not shredding.    For me (and my wife) it works as advertised. It is a wide-width floss and has a very elastic rubber band-like feel which makes it soft on the fingers and easy to hold onto without cutting off circulation to your fingertips. I find it easy to work between tight teeth and it slides easily without shredding. The mint flavor is pretty intense, which leaves an impression at least of your mouth being clean after you finish flossing.    The biggest downside is probably price. I think the packages are about the same cost as other flosses, but a package is only 30 yards, so per-yard it is probably several times more expensive than alternative flosses.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, stretches a little and breaks every time you use it. Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, thin profile great if your teeth have little to no space between them.</li>
            <li> The only floss my husband will use.</li>
            <li> The only dental floss my husband will use.  Happy to have a long time supply</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY different flosses. This is the most resistant to shredding of all flosses I&#x27;ve tried. My teeth are tightly packed, so resistance to shredding is very important to me. Shredded thread can build up between teeth which feels uncomfortable. Also, this floss has elasticity, which is very pleasant while you&#x27;re flossing. That elasticity encourages you to floss more than with non-elastic floss. I went for a period not using this product and my next dental checkup was not as good when the hygienist measure for pockets.</li>
            <li> As you can see from the reviews here, dental floss is a rather personal matter......  I happen to find this very useful given that I have some sharp edges between some of my molars, which are also relatively tight together.  There&#x27;s nothing quite like having a more traditional floss shred into little fibers that get stuck between your teeth, and having to carefully work out the shreds with yet more floss, to convince you that this stuff has its virtues.  True, it frequently gets cut by those troublesome teeth, but it does *not* shred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is starting to get a bit hard to find.  The reason appears to be that Johnson &amp; Johnson is transitioning this product from the Reach brand name to the Listerine brand name (and it appears, messing with the flavoring a bit).</li>
            <li> I wish I could still buy it in the larger size</li>
            <li> This is my floss of choice.  When my local store no longer had them in stock, I decided to order a supply.  My teeth are close together and tear up plain floss very quickly.  This lasts thru a flossing unless I catch it on something and weaken it.  The mint flavor is a plus.</li>
            <li> Seems to be difficult to find this in stores lately.  After starting to use this several years ago, other floss seems useless - doesnt clean.  This is really some good floss! Well,a s good as dental floss can be.</li>
            <li> I like the thinness of the floss and it&#x27;s not coated in thick wax!</li>
            <li> Fits tight spaces, conforms, scrubs, rarely breaks, never leaves a fiber behind. After using it past 8 months, my hygienist couldn&#x27;t stop raving about how healthy my gums are. My local CVS stopped carrying it so I got it here.</li>
            <li> Best dental floss ever.  It is wide and it stretches, so you can cover every tooth surface and get them squeaky clean.  I can rarely find Reach Total Care in stores -- sold out because it&#x27;s so popular? -- so was glad to find it online.  No more searching.</li>
            <li> Love this Total Care floss!</li>
            <li> We love this dental floss but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere after we got hooked on it.</li>
            <li> The greatest. ( for tight teeth)</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Best floss ever!  Never run out, as it stretches to fit what ever you pull off the spool!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on my teeth even though my dentist told me it would!  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> The photos of this floss lead one to believe that it will be fibrous and therefore specially effective.  I bought some, and was horribly disappointed.  The floss is slick, and therefore generally ineffective.  This product is vastly inferior to the \\&quot;cleanpaste\\&quot; floss made by the same company.  The \\&quot;cleanpaste\\&quot; floss is fibrous and has toothpaste embedded in it.</li>
            <li> This is the world&#x27;s best dental floss, bar none.  I got a sample from my dentist&#x27;s, and I thought it was going to be just like the rest. Well, this stuff isn&#x27;t the conventional stranded string that&#x27;s been wax-coated. This stuff will not fray, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the regular fibers. This stuff is made of stretchy plastic, that at some point, stops stretching. I have never stretched it until it breaks, but I&#x27;m sure it will at some point. What I like about it, is how easily it slides between teeth. If you have sharp spots between teeth, this floss will not fray. It has never caught on anything in between the teeth at all. You can slide it between your teeth and pull one end without the worry of separating the threads and getting it stuck in your teeth. It seems to be made of one strand of plastic, or, it could be polymer strands embedded in plastic.  Whatever it is, it won&#x27;t absorb water, so your grip on the floss stays put.  It costs a little bit more than stranded-waxed floss, but because it&#x27;s so easy to use and very durable, your time spent  flossing will be much quicker, more effective, and without those annoying breakages.</li>
            <li> This floss does not shred and get stuck in your teeth like other floss.  It stretchs and works through the empty areas between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good price!</li>
            <li> Love this gentle way of flossing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this brand of floss.  In fact, it&#x27;s the only floss he&#x27;s found that doesn&#x27;t shred when he uses it.  However, we frequently are unable to find it in our rural area, so we decided to buy in bulk.  This should last us for months!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for awhile but was quite happy to discover I could purchase it via Amazon because availability in stores was so sporadic. I like the elastic quality of it because I often have cut my gums with the other kind of floss-it hurts and isn&#x27;t good for you gums when it  cuts. This IS the answer. Thank you Reach Total Care for using Amazon to make this available. :)</li>
            <li> great product and hard to find, thanks.</li>
            <li> The dental floss is the best we ever used. My husband received that type of floss as a sample from his dentist. We were hooked. Unfortunately, we couldn&#x27;t find the floss in any drug or big-box store. However, we found it on Amazon. Once you use the floss, you won&#x27;t ever go back to Glade or any other regular floss.</li>
            <li> This floss really gets hard to reach spaces between your teeth. I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss.  It is a shame that the bulk roll is no longer available.  This seems like such a waste.</li>
            <li> Great dental floss.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so stocked up on it.</li>
            <li> This is excellent floss, works great, the best I&#x27;ve found.  It was all good and arrived as scheduled.</li>
            <li> The wrong item was sent to me.  Even though the description and picture was of Reach TOTAL CARE floss, I received Reach GENTLE GUM Care floss.  I returned it.  Not sure whether to try again and risk getting the wrong item again.</li>
            <li> Best floss in the world.</li>
            <li> This is a ribbon floss.  It is very strong, a little stretchy and the best thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t break and leave strings between your teeth.  It seems to have disappeared from store shelves which is why I ordered it online.</li>
            <li> As described, quick shipping</li>
            <li> Great floss--recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This floss really works well for me.  I really like it, doesn&#x27;t break easily and seems to clean well.  One frustration I have is that it appears they are not producing this floss any more - can&#x27;t find it anywhere but on the web and I suspect that will dry up too.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Best floss ever.</li>
