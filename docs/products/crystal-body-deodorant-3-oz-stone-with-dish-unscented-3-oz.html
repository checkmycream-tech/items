    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>works real good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, yet it has perfect odor protection that lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Apply after showering works best.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>This is a great product !!!  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>but if you are paying for a product, you should receive it in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!!  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is incredible, so I bought one just to try it.</li>
            <li>also found this product to be ideal for foot odor.  </li>
            <li>I had seen this in stores years ago, and I have to admit that I laughed it off when I saw it!</li>
            <li>So I am buying a load of these things before Amazon run out or realize that they should be charging more! :D</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>my boyfriend has even used it on his feet and noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li>Then I heard from my aunt about some \\&quot;rock\\&quot; a friend of hers used that worked great.  </li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve used any number of dishes I have on hand) which makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>Great product, not harmful and NO</li>
            <li>it is a great product-</li>
            <li>The best product on the market of its kind.  </li>
            <li>I have NO irritation, which is something I&#x27;ve experienced with almost every deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but  it  works great.</li>
            <li>but, on a nice day when I&#x27;m just going about my day, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>stuff is great,  I struggled for years trying to find something to help my pit stench.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love it!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing it works !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a good product and a welcome alternative to having goo or paste under your arms all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and an incredible cost saver.</li>
            <li>Yep, it really is as good as they say.</li>
            <li>and then I was good to go.</li>
            <li>The price is very cheap and is a great product.</li>
            <li>I really liked it though, just a couple swipes and I was good to go.  </li>
            <li>It works best right after the shower and does keep the underarm stink away on the skin.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with the crystal rock deodorant, but now that I know how to use it, I&#x27;m quite satisfied!  </li>
            <li>We are sure smelly creatures!  </li>
            <li>I love the deodorant stones!</li>
            <li>Not the most pleasant feeling when you are applying it and accidentally scrape your armpit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no odor to this stone, which is perfectly fine and it works great</li>
            <li>What an amazing antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Even before that I did not find this to be an effective product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in May, and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be wise to experiment with it during these warmer months here in the south.  </li>
            <li>Also, since deodorants stop perspiration, the underarm area is effectively \\&quot;sealed\\&quot;, the toxins cannot escape ...</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish it had a scent....</li>
            <li>But for now I&#x27;m not too thrilled.</li>
            <li>I LOVE crystal stones and have loved it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed like I was better off not wearing any at all, because I smelled better without them!</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it continues to work for me, but so far, I am extremely impressed!</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I am happy to find such a great deal.</li>
            <li>After using Crystal for over 6 months, I can attest that it is more effective, easier, cheaper, and better for me than what I was using.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased more for friends.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT,</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT...........</li>
            <li>Most of the articles or comments I read about the issue ended with the person trying this miracle crystal rock deodorant.</li>
            <li>I would say that is my favorite form, however you will go through it a lot faster.  </li>
            <li>, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Also, the longer you use it, the better it works.</li>
            <li>Thank you for carrying such an excellent product!</li>
            <li>I bought one on a whim at my local Health Foods store, figuring &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s more, this doesn&#x27;t clog the pores like the roll-ons or gels.  </li>
            <li>I love deodorant stones...</li>
            <li>This works better than any deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best to use it with tank tops and similar.</li>
            <li>I love this thing</li>
            <li>I have ordered two more of these to either use myself, or give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with washing up more often and reapplying to avoid the chemicals in most deo.</li>
            <li>The problem is that aluminum is the ingredient used in most deodorants to control wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a roll on version that I would probably like better.  </li>
            <li>dry\\&quot; in most conditions.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the sweat at bay through most days.</li>
            <li>But I have no complaints at all this thing is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have found that I love this rock!</li>
            <li>Best used dry on moist skin to prevent eventual cracking of crystal.</li>
            <li>Very effective, easy to use, and NOT messy !!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!</li>
            <li>I started putting on some lavender essential oil afterwards on top of the rock application, and that worked great.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Instead of having to scrub under my arms during a shower while trying to remove the gunkiness, I find that Crystal just rinses off quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your pits are clean before you put it on, if you come out of the shower smelly, you&#x27;ll stay that way.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed , probably because I was so used to the strong smelling traditional deodorants - I could smell some stinkyness with the Crystal.  </li>
            <li>Works well, although on very hot days I need to apply more often than I do</li>
            <li>Large crystal with a nice dish to set it in, to catch any water and build up.</li>
            <li>The Rock is great, it will last you way over a year, probably even 2 years.  </li>
            <li>Crystal works way better than any of the kind diluted in water as a spray (those work for on the go or for overall body use better).</li>
            <li>Works better than the Naturally Fresh 2.1 oz deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li>: I have experienced, as another review has also stated, a rash after several weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>For now, hydrocortisone cream used at night is keeping me comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The deodorants really don&#x27;t work, just kind put a floral scent over a stinky one...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any residue on my clothing, which is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>fantastic....</li>
            <li>Works great, the only one I use, no smell.</li>
            <li>The primary reason I purchased it was to minimize wasteful packaging and still \\&quot;keep me</li>
            <li>Well, it is not the most powerful deodorant out there.  </li>
            <li>can put this on Friday and still be odor free by</li>
            <li>If I miss a day I am still odor free.</li>
            <li>the most important thing for me is a fresh scent and this has no scent</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s chemical free, it does a great job of keeping me dry</li>
            <li>He was a huge skeptic and now is a true believer.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, a great product to have and I like that its all natural and at a very decent price</li>
            <li>Finally, I came across this crystal on amazon, and after seeing the good reviews, I thought that it was worth a shot, but didn&#x27;t get my hopes up!</li>
            <li>In the winter, or if you are mostly indoors this really works for up to 24hrs.</li>
            <li>There is literally no smell and best of all it&#x27;ll take at least a yr before I need another one</li>
            <li>I ordered another one though, this keeps the smell away, I apply it after a shower and am good for the next full day.</li>
            <li>Do still feel moist more often but love the fact don&#x27;t have to deal with white marks on shirts.</li>
            <li>would say that if your average or below on the sweaty/stinky scales then this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li>Love that there is no scent and also that it comes with its own little dish.&lt;br /&gt;Supposed</li>
            <li>REALLY well, I have the added peace of mind of knowing that I&#x27;m not slathering my pits with all sorts of bizarre chemicals.  </li>
            <li>In any case, 6 months of natural deodorant for a few bucks is a great deal!</li>
            <li>This works OK for being a natural alternative to those chemical body deodorants.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works pretty well, but I&#x27;m going to give the true test in the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and effective.</li>
            <li>But definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>No dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li>Simple baking soda in the shower (used QUICKLY to prevent irritation) can be quite effective before your first use.</li>
            <li>As long as you get a good coat, then the stuff is amazing, works for over a couple days on a single application.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this, my days of searching for/wasting money on other deodorants are done :)</li>
            <li>The only thing is you have to put it on every couple of hours because it starts to wear off but other than that it&#x27;s great !!</li>
            <li>i used this on my stink chakra, opened it right up.</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t outdoors), and I felt clean the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are probably the best solution for something to keep in the shower/bathroom, as the container makes it less likely to fall and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has nothing to do with my scent, but more how I feel better after an additional application half way through the day.  </li>
            <li>I like its odor-fighting action, but even more I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave stains or gunky stuff on my clothes like regular deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the rock for about a month, and it keeps me fresh the entire day at work most of the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it a few more times and maybe apply more.</li>
            <li>After trying this deodorant all else failed my comparison test awesome product.</li>
            <li>Even now, going back to the ones w/ more chemicals, I wasn&#x27;t getting the desired results.  </li>
            <li>This is the first crystal deodorant I have ever used</li>
            <li>but it really does!</li>
            <li>I run the crystal once a day over his forehead, back, neck, top of chest, arms, anywhere that gives off smell.</li>
            <li>Any of these alum based salt blocks deodorize better than standard deodorants, though.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;m going to tell you that for years I used Mitchum Ladies deodorant</li>
            <li>but I do get hot and stressed and</li>
            <li>The idea sounds logical, but did not work for me.</li>
            <li>It really works...in Winter and Summer!  </li>
            <li>is you have to make sure you get a nice even coating, and a larger area then you would normally with standard deodorant, if you miss a spot then you&#x27;ll smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty convinced its witchcraft.</li>
            <li>so I really love not putting some man-made chemical concoction on my skin anymore that only served to plug up my sweat glands and stain my clothing.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that hasn&#x27;t been the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you can imagine how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li>If you drop it it will break so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>The down side is you have to clean up before you can reapply, as it seems to be more of a preventative measure for odor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But even after all that, it does seem to work pretty well for just average days and is nice to give your body a break from the stronger stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased in February 2014 in an effort to reduce parabens in my daily maintenance and the Rock is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>you have to wet the rock before using it which makes it slippery, so the plastic holder is great to keep your fingers dry and prevent you from dropping it; if you don&#x27;t  mind the price and want the liquid</li>
            <li>you have to wet the rock before using it which makes it slippery, so the plastic holder is great to keep your fingers dry and prevent you from dropping it; if you don&#x27;t  mind the price and want the liquid</li>
            <li>It says to only use it on clean underarms, so you&#x27;ll have to wash first, then you apply it and there is no odor, at all.</li>
            <li>Have only had product for a week, but works fine, is much larger than expected (good thing), shaped like a ball with flattened sides.</li>
            <li>I tried this deodorant rock on a whim and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I purchased two, and after much prodding, convinced my husband to try one.  </li>
            <li>I really like the crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li>I spend probably 15-20 seconds really rubbing it into each armpit.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Crystal products.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>There are also studies done that show the potential cancer free benefits of this salt crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li>it gets very slippery.</li>
            <li>Now that is cheap personal grooming!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>real downside here, just a quality product.</li>
            <li>Very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter how much they bathe.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help much in the odor department.</li>
            <li>I had one that would have lasted my whole life</li>
            <li>had my cleaning lady not broken it into a million pieces.</li>
            <li>when normally I wouldn&#x27;t have!</li>
            <li>This works better for me than any other unscented deoderant -</li>
            <li>Since I really don&#x27;t perspire on a normal basis, this really served the purpose that I needed it for.</li>
            <li>I have  tried  many  natural  deodorants, even  tried  to  make  one, I  don&#x27;t  know  why  I waited so  long  to try this  </li>
            <li>This product is very effective, easy to use, lasts a very long time and it is recommended for cancer patients due to its lack of ingredients that are harmful for people who have had chemo, radiation or are taking drugs due to their cancer.  </li>
            <li>If I want the extra assurance that my odor will be OK, I did pick up a scented coconut oil/shea butter deodorant at our local farmer&#x27;s market that works really well too.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t work for me on anything but the most average of days -</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it broke into several pieces.  </li>
            <li>Love it, will only use this in the future.</li>
            <li>It is not flawless protection, as you can tell since I wasn&#x27;t impressed going from traditional pit stick to this, but after going a year without wearing anything and stinking to high hell, this Crystal does work.  </li>
            <li>After trying many different types of all-natural deodorants (which seemed to only last a few hours tops) and making my own (also didn&#x27;t work that well), I am pretty freaking amazed at this deodorant stone.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering buying it.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As far as holding up to other deodorant brands, it&#x27;s not any better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but I am truly amazed at how great it is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my old deodorant by mistake, and I really noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li>You literally just get this stone wet, then rub it on your underarms, and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I found that I really have to rub it in and cover a pretty big area of underarm skin to get satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li>I could work all day and be grossly sweaty but have  fresh pit.</li>
            <li>I held the rock in one hand, added a few drops of water to the top of it and smeared it around some then rubbed it into my armpit.  </li>
            <li>however you are only supposed to apply to freshly showered skin.  </li>
            <li>Some sweat more than others and some have trouble with odor.</li>
            <li>The weather was cooler when I started using this, and I was able to stay smell free for a bit, but I can personally still smell myself and that&#x27;s no good.  </li>
            <li>have experienced a bit of burning after shaving, but it only lasts long enough for your arm pits to dry.  </li>
            <li>so I needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy a new one, and I will update this afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I live in AZ</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers I was a skeptic, but trying it now I am a big fan.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other deodorant I have ever used actually.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>If you want to save money in expensive deodorants and smells clean, this is the better choice.</li>
            <li>I m new to this product but has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>This new one is large enough to finish out my life.</li>
            <li>Of course, during warmer weather I had no other choice but to wear them and continue to buy new ones in hopes that the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one would come along!</li>
            <li>It was purchased for my girlfriend who went through breast surgery due to cancer and had to use special deodorants.  </li>
            <li>In brief: using this &#x27;rock&#x27; is at least as effective in neutralizing odor as any commercial deodorant/antiperspirant product, but it has no residue, is very mild on the skin and has minimal packaging (for fans of the environment).</li>
            <li>especially if you are worried about toxic chemicals in your very sensitive arm pits!!</li>
            <li>for those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a clear block of salt, it has no smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since thrown my old deodorant away.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this product because I thought it would last much longer than anything else I had tried</li>
            <li>Much safer than regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>For anyone thinking to switch over to a natural deodorant, just keep in mind that it takes some time for the body to acclimate to using any natural deodorant rather than chemical.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it twice so far.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this as a natural alternative for deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It really works well and the crystal lasts a lot longer than regular brand deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a standard scented spray deodorant in a can for decades and was very leery of trying anything else.  </li>
            <li>So far, RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>I put it on right out of the shower while my underarms are still wet.</li>
            <li>The only reason I ever have to buy a new one is that I invariably drop them and they shatter!</li>
            <li>Definitely reccomend that you use this instead of deodorant as this actualy fights off BO instead of masking it, though it is not as long lasting and effective as other deodorants.</li>
            <li>I believe your body tries to clear typical antiperspirants out by \\&quot;trying\\&quot; to sweat more.</li>
            <li>Several reviewers say they can use just 2 sprays, however I am up to 12 sprays per pit just to get decent coverage</li>
            <li>Several reviewers say they can use just 2 sprays, however I am up to 12 sprays per pit just to get decent coverage</li>
            <li>so much better than using smelly, runny or powdery expensive deodorants, which almost always contain Aluminum as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different types of deodorant over the years, partially because I&#x27;m picky and health conscious, and partially because I have extremely sensitive armpits.</li>
            <li>if I have a stressful presentation or if I am doing more strenuous-that-average work, it is not potent enough to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the other reviewers have said, you need to use this right out of the shower when you are at your cleanest.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday, right after I get out of the shower, this is the rock in my life!</li>
            <li>I put it on a larger area than I would with normal deodorant</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic packaging is pretty minimal</li>
            <li>He says it works, keeps him fresh, but I have noticed tward the end of the day he is not really so fresh...  </li>
            <li>This one is much cleaner and easier to rinse and dry.</li>
            <li>to last a whole year (cross your fingers).</li>
            <li>I have used different versions of this in the past, and I recently wanted to become more organic again, so I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Not the arm pits, but his general body all over.</li>
            <li>But then I was headed to vacation time in 120+ degree weather, panicked, and went back to my old, chemically-ness, toxic deodorant.  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old is starting to smell sweaty after school.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it works well so far.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine who suggested it to me said they last over a year, so far mine looks to have not changed in size at all (2 months~).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first few times applying it was a bit confusing in that I wasn&#x27;t sure if any of it was actually rubbing off onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>Which is ironic because I really do not sweat, and he does, a lot....</li>
            <li>I usually use the gel one, but it dissipates so quickly, that by 10am, I can smell myself.</li>
            <li>It comes with a small plastic shell to hold it on top of your counter on, and you just wet it with water and rub under your arm pit and it lasts me till the next morning or even longer.</li>
            <li>But it really works and lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li>(my armpits), only occasionally, but when it happens it takes weeks for the rashes to clear up and heal.</li>
            <li>Those shards really flew, too; I spent the last 20 minutes vacuuming.</li>
            <li>The ONLY natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me stink and actually keeps me from sweating.</li>
            <li>I would say I perspire as much as the average woman.  </li>
            <li>I bit the bullet and decided to try it on a day when I would have to be out all day long and busy with people.  </li>
            <li>This stone worked well at first; but, within a few days, I noticed my underarms felt sore.</li>
            <li>Since then I have totally discontinued using the Crystal Rock and have switched to using milk of magnesia with no strange effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then the past few years, Secret Clinical strength, meaning I&#x27;m not one of those women who just &amp;#34;glows.&amp;#34;  I tried this on a whim due to the incredible price, and holy moly, it works!  </li>

    <ol>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, yet it has perfect odor protection that lasts all day!</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> but if you are paying for a product, you should receive it in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is incredible, so I bought one just to try it.</li>
            <li> also found this product to be ideal for foot odor.  </li>
            <li> I had seen this in stores years ago, and I have to admit that I laughed it off when I saw it!</li>
            <li> So I am buying a load of these things before Amazon run out or realize that they should be charging more! :D</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li> my boyfriend has even used it on his feet and noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li> Then I heard from my aunt about some \\&quot;rock\\&quot; a friend of hers used that worked great.  </li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve used any number of dishes I have on hand) which makes me happy.  </li>
            <li> Great product, not harmful and NO</li>
            <li> it is a great product-</li>
            <li> The best product on the market of its kind.  </li>
            <li> I have NO irritation, which is something I&#x27;ve experienced with almost every deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but  it  works great.</li>
            <li> but, on a nice day when I&#x27;m just going about my day, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> stuff is great,  I struggled for years trying to find something to help my pit stench.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I love it!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing it works !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a good product and a welcome alternative to having goo or paste under your arms all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and an incredible cost saver.</li>
            <li> Yep, it really is as good as they say.</li>
            <li> and then I was good to go.</li>
            <li> The price is very cheap and is a great product.</li>
            <li> I really liked it though, just a couple swipes and I was good to go.  </li>
            <li> It works best right after the shower and does keep the underarm stink away on the skin.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with the crystal rock deodorant, but now that I know how to use it, I&#x27;m quite satisfied!  </li>
            <li> We are sure smelly creatures!  </li>
            <li> I love the deodorant stones!</li>
            <li> Not the most pleasant feeling when you are applying it and accidentally scrape your armpit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no odor to this stone, which is perfectly fine and it works great</li>
            <li> What an amazing antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Even before that I did not find this to be an effective product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in May, and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be wise to experiment with it during these warmer months here in the south.  </li>
            <li> Also, since deodorants stop perspiration, the underarm area is effectively \\&quot;sealed\\&quot;, the toxins cannot escape ...</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish it had a scent....</li>
            <li> But for now I&#x27;m not too thrilled.</li>
            <li> I LOVE crystal stones and have loved it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed like I was better off not wearing any at all, because I smelled better without them!</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it continues to work for me, but so far, I am extremely impressed!</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I am happy to find such a great deal.</li>
            <li> After using Crystal for over 6 months, I can attest that it is more effective, easier, cheaper, and better for me than what I was using.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased more for friends.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT,</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT...........</li>
            <li> Most of the articles or comments I read about the issue ended with the person trying this miracle crystal rock deodorant.</li>
            <li> I would say that is my favorite form, however you will go through it a lot faster.  </li>
            <li> , what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Also, the longer you use it, the better it works.</li>
            <li> Thank you for carrying such an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I bought one on a whim at my local Health Foods store, figuring &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s more, this doesn&#x27;t clog the pores like the roll-ons or gels.  </li>
            <li> I love deodorant stones...</li>
            <li> This works better than any deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best to use it with tank tops and similar.</li>
            <li> I love this thing</li>
            <li> I have ordered two more of these to either use myself, or give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with washing up more often and reapplying to avoid the chemicals in most deo.</li>
            <li> The problem is that aluminum is the ingredient used in most deodorants to control wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a roll on version that I would probably like better.  </li>
            <li> dry\\&quot; in most conditions.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the sweat at bay through most days.</li>
            <li> But I have no complaints at all this thing is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have found that I love this rock!</li>
            <li> Best used dry on moist skin to prevent eventual cracking of crystal.</li>
            <li> Very effective, easy to use, and NOT messy !!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!</li>
            <li> I started putting on some lavender essential oil afterwards on top of the rock application, and that worked great.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Instead of having to scrub under my arms during a shower while trying to remove the gunkiness, I find that Crystal just rinses off quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your pits are clean before you put it on, if you come out of the shower smelly, you&#x27;ll stay that way.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed , probably because I was so used to the strong smelling traditional deodorants - I could smell some stinkyness with the Crystal.  </li>
            <li> Works well, although on very hot days I need to apply more often than I do</li>
            <li> Large crystal with a nice dish to set it in, to catch any water and build up.</li>
            <li> The Rock is great, it will last you way over a year, probably even 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Crystal works way better than any of the kind diluted in water as a spray (those work for on the go or for overall body use better).</li>
            <li> Works better than the Naturally Fresh 2.1 oz deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li> : I have experienced, as another review has also stated, a rash after several weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> For now, hydrocortisone cream used at night is keeping me comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The deodorants really don&#x27;t work, just kind put a floral scent over a stinky one...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any residue on my clothing, which is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> fantastic....</li>
            <li> Works great, the only one I use, no smell.</li>
            <li> The primary reason I purchased it was to minimize wasteful packaging and still \\&quot;keep me</li>
            <li> Well, it is not the most powerful deodorant out there.  </li>
            <li> can put this on Friday and still be odor free by</li>
            <li> If I miss a day I am still odor free.</li>
            <li> the most important thing for me is a fresh scent and this has no scent</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s chemical free, it does a great job of keeping me dry</li>
            <li> He was a huge skeptic and now is a true believer.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, a great product to have and I like that its all natural and at a very decent price</li>
            <li> Finally, I came across this crystal on amazon, and after seeing the good reviews, I thought that it was worth a shot, but didn&#x27;t get my hopes up!</li>
            <li> In the winter, or if you are mostly indoors this really works for up to 24hrs.</li>
            <li> There is literally no smell and best of all it&#x27;ll take at least a yr before I need another one</li>
            <li> I ordered another one though, this keeps the smell away, I apply it after a shower and am good for the next full day.</li>
            <li> Do still feel moist more often but love the fact don&#x27;t have to deal with white marks on shirts.</li>
            <li> would say that if your average or below on the sweaty/stinky scales then this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> Love that there is no scent and also that it comes with its own little dish.&lt;br /&gt;Supposed</li>
            <li> REALLY well, I have the added peace of mind of knowing that I&#x27;m not slathering my pits with all sorts of bizarre chemicals.  </li>
            <li> In any case, 6 months of natural deodorant for a few bucks is a great deal!</li>
            <li> This works OK for being a natural alternative to those chemical body deodorants.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty well, but I&#x27;m going to give the true test in the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and effective.</li>
            <li> But definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> No dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> Simple baking soda in the shower (used QUICKLY to prevent irritation) can be quite effective before your first use.</li>
            <li> As long as you get a good coat, then the stuff is amazing, works for over a couple days on a single application.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this, my days of searching for/wasting money on other deodorants are done :)</li>
            <li> The only thing is you have to put it on every couple of hours because it starts to wear off but other than that it&#x27;s great !!</li>
            <li> i used this on my stink chakra, opened it right up.</li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t outdoors), and I felt clean the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are probably the best solution for something to keep in the shower/bathroom, as the container makes it less likely to fall and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has nothing to do with my scent, but more how I feel better after an additional application half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> I like its odor-fighting action, but even more I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave stains or gunky stuff on my clothes like regular deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the rock for about a month, and it keeps me fresh the entire day at work most of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it a few more times and maybe apply more.</li>
            <li> After trying this deodorant all else failed my comparison test awesome product.</li>
            <li> Even now, going back to the ones w/ more chemicals, I wasn&#x27;t getting the desired results.  </li>
            <li> This is the first crystal deodorant I have ever used</li>
            <li> but it really does!</li>
            <li> I run the crystal once a day over his forehead, back, neck, top of chest, arms, anywhere that gives off smell.</li>
            <li> Any of these alum based salt blocks deodorize better than standard deodorants, though.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;m going to tell you that for years I used Mitchum Ladies deodorant</li>
            <li> but I do get hot and stressed and</li>
            <li> The idea sounds logical, but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It really works...in Winter and Summer!  </li>
            <li> is you have to make sure you get a nice even coating, and a larger area then you would normally with standard deodorant, if you miss a spot then you&#x27;ll smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced its witchcraft.</li>
            <li> so I really love not putting some man-made chemical concoction on my skin anymore that only served to plug up my sweat glands and stain my clothing.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that hasn&#x27;t been the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can imagine how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li> If you drop it it will break so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> The down side is you have to clean up before you can reapply, as it seems to be more of a preventative measure for odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But even after all that, it does seem to work pretty well for just average days and is nice to give your body a break from the stronger stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased in February 2014 in an effort to reduce parabens in my daily maintenance and the Rock is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> you have to wet the rock before using it which makes it slippery, so the plastic holder is great to keep your fingers dry and prevent you from dropping it; if you don&#x27;t  mind the price and want the liquid</li>
            <li> you have to wet the rock before using it which makes it slippery, so the plastic holder is great to keep your fingers dry and prevent you from dropping it; if you don&#x27;t  mind the price and want the liquid</li>
            <li> It says to only use it on clean underarms, so you&#x27;ll have to wash first, then you apply it and there is no odor, at all.</li>
            <li> Have only had product for a week, but works fine, is much larger than expected (good thing), shaped like a ball with flattened sides.</li>
            <li> I tried this deodorant rock on a whim and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two, and after much prodding, convinced my husband to try one.  </li>
            <li> I really like the crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I spend probably 15-20 seconds really rubbing it into each armpit.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Crystal products.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> There are also studies done that show the potential cancer free benefits of this salt crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li> it gets very slippery.</li>
            <li> Now that is cheap personal grooming!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> real downside here, just a quality product.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how much they bathe.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help much in the odor department.</li>
            <li> I had one that would have lasted my whole life</li>
            <li> had my cleaning lady not broken it into a million pieces.</li>
            <li> when normally I wouldn&#x27;t have!</li>
            <li> This works better for me than any other unscented deoderant -</li>
            <li> Since I really don&#x27;t perspire on a normal basis, this really served the purpose that I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I have  tried  many  natural  deodorants, even  tried  to  make  one, I  don&#x27;t  know  why  I waited so  long  to try this  </li>
            <li> This product is very effective, easy to use, lasts a very long time and it is recommended for cancer patients due to its lack of ingredients that are harmful for people who have had chemo, radiation or are taking drugs due to their cancer.  </li>
            <li> If I want the extra assurance that my odor will be OK, I did pick up a scented coconut oil/shea butter deodorant at our local farmer&#x27;s market that works really well too.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t work for me on anything but the most average of days -</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it broke into several pieces.  </li>
            <li> Love it, will only use this in the future.</li>
            <li> It is not flawless protection, as you can tell since I wasn&#x27;t impressed going from traditional pit stick to this, but after going a year without wearing anything and stinking to high hell, this Crystal does work.  </li>
            <li> After trying many different types of all-natural deodorants (which seemed to only last a few hours tops) and making my own (also didn&#x27;t work that well), I am pretty freaking amazed at this deodorant stone.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering buying it.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As far as holding up to other deodorant brands, it&#x27;s not any better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but I am truly amazed at how great it is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my old deodorant by mistake, and I really noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li> You literally just get this stone wet, then rub it on your underarms, and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I found that I really have to rub it in and cover a pretty big area of underarm skin to get satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> I could work all day and be grossly sweaty but have  fresh pit.</li>
            <li> I held the rock in one hand, added a few drops of water to the top of it and smeared it around some then rubbed it into my armpit.  </li>
            <li> however you are only supposed to apply to freshly showered skin.  </li>
            <li> Some sweat more than others and some have trouble with odor.</li>
            <li> The weather was cooler when I started using this, and I was able to stay smell free for a bit, but I can personally still smell myself and that&#x27;s no good.  </li>
            <li> have experienced a bit of burning after shaving, but it only lasts long enough for your arm pits to dry.  </li>
            <li> so I needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I am going to buy a new one, and I will update this afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I live in AZ</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I was a skeptic, but trying it now I am a big fan.  </li>
            <li> Better than any other deodorant I have ever used actually.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> If you want to save money in expensive deodorants and smells clean, this is the better choice.</li>
            <li> I m new to this product but has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> This new one is large enough to finish out my life.</li>
            <li> Of course, during warmer weather I had no other choice but to wear them and continue to buy new ones in hopes that the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one would come along!</li>
            <li> It was purchased for my girlfriend who went through breast surgery due to cancer and had to use special deodorants.  </li>
            <li> In brief: using this &#x27;rock&#x27; is at least as effective in neutralizing odor as any commercial deodorant/antiperspirant product, but it has no residue, is very mild on the skin and has minimal packaging (for fans of the environment).</li>
            <li> especially if you are worried about toxic chemicals in your very sensitive arm pits!!</li>
            <li> for those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a clear block of salt, it has no smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since thrown my old deodorant away.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this product because I thought it would last much longer than anything else I had tried</li>
            <li> Much safer than regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> For anyone thinking to switch over to a natural deodorant, just keep in mind that it takes some time for the body to acclimate to using any natural deodorant rather than chemical.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it twice so far.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this as a natural alternative for deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It really works well and the crystal lasts a lot longer than regular brand deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a standard scented spray deodorant in a can for decades and was very leery of trying anything else.  </li>
            <li> So far, RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I put it on right out of the shower while my underarms are still wet.</li>
            <li> The only reason I ever have to buy a new one is that I invariably drop them and they shatter!</li>
            <li> Definitely reccomend that you use this instead of deodorant as this actualy fights off BO instead of masking it, though it is not as long lasting and effective as other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I believe your body tries to clear typical antiperspirants out by \\&quot;trying\\&quot; to sweat more.</li>
            <li> Several reviewers say they can use just 2 sprays, however I am up to 12 sprays per pit just to get decent coverage</li>
            <li> Several reviewers say they can use just 2 sprays, however I am up to 12 sprays per pit just to get decent coverage</li>
            <li> so much better than using smelly, runny or powdery expensive deodorants, which almost always contain Aluminum as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types of deodorant over the years, partially because I&#x27;m picky and health conscious, and partially because I have extremely sensitive armpits.</li>
            <li> if I have a stressful presentation or if I am doing more strenuous-that-average work, it is not potent enough to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers have said, you need to use this right out of the shower when you are at your cleanest.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday, right after I get out of the shower, this is the rock in my life!</li>
            <li> I put it on a larger area than I would with normal deodorant</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic packaging is pretty minimal</li>
            <li> He says it works, keeps him fresh, but I have noticed tward the end of the day he is not really so fresh...  </li>
            <li> This one is much cleaner and easier to rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> to last a whole year (cross your fingers).</li>
            <li> I have used different versions of this in the past, and I recently wanted to become more organic again, so I ordered this.</li>
            <li> Not the arm pits, but his general body all over.</li>
            <li> But then I was headed to vacation time in 120+ degree weather, panicked, and went back to my old, chemically-ness, toxic deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My 13 year old is starting to smell sweaty after school.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it works well so far.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine who suggested it to me said they last over a year, so far mine looks to have not changed in size at all (2 months~).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first few times applying it was a bit confusing in that I wasn&#x27;t sure if any of it was actually rubbing off onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> Which is ironic because I really do not sweat, and he does, a lot....</li>
            <li> I usually use the gel one, but it dissipates so quickly, that by 10am, I can smell myself.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small plastic shell to hold it on top of your counter on, and you just wet it with water and rub under your arm pit and it lasts me till the next morning or even longer.</li>
            <li> But it really works and lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> (my armpits), only occasionally, but when it happens it takes weeks for the rashes to clear up and heal.</li>
            <li> Those shards really flew, too; I spent the last 20 minutes vacuuming.</li>
            <li> The ONLY natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me stink and actually keeps me from sweating.</li>
            <li> I would say I perspire as much as the average woman.  </li>
            <li> I bit the bullet and decided to try it on a day when I would have to be out all day long and busy with people.  </li>
            <li> This stone worked well at first; but, within a few days, I noticed my underarms felt sore.</li>
            <li> Since then I have totally discontinued using the Crystal Rock and have switched to using milk of magnesia with no strange effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then the past few years, Secret Clinical strength, meaning I&#x27;m not one of those women who just &amp;#34;glows.&amp;#34;  I tried this on a whim due to the incredible price, and holy moly, it works!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t intend to go back to using my other deodorant/anti-perspirants that I used for years (Dove, Degree, Sure, Secret, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Fast forward a few years, and I still have yet to find a deodorant stick/spray/gel that I like!</li>
            <li> so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long either.  </li>
            <li> so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long either.   </li>
            <li> stopped using the deodorant for several days and the strange taste in my mouth went away.  </li>
            <li> These rocks last a long, long time...</li>
            <li> It works and will last a very long time as long as you don&#x27;t drop it like I did.</li>
            <li> So I did some research and found out that it&#x27;s not really a deodorant or an antiperspirant but an anti-odorant if such a thing exists.</li>
            <li> Shipping took about 3 days too long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The stones aren&#x27;t totally solid, like an ice cube the impurities are always in the center.</li>
            <li> I stopped using deoderants with antiperspirants years ago, so I&#x27;m long over the sweating factor.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long, long time</li>
            <li> But lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll save you in the long run over a stick, spray, or roll-on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used regular deodorant for a few months now and as long as this crystal keeps working like it has been, I have no intention of going back.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I dont like is after a while the edges can get a bit sharp.  </li>
            <li> it actually took a while to get use to having completely neutral smelling armpits even after a hard days work out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time - takes a year to use it up.</li>
            <li> and I am dry and odor-free.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple of minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> And you do have to give your under arms a bit of time to dry before putting your clothes on.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it gets less efficient because I had it for so long, or maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s warmer outside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, after using it for a few months, it has developed some sharp places.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a deodorant w/ less chemicals, especially parabens.  </li>
            <li> When wearing typical deodorants, I actually tend to end up having BO</li>
            <li> and I need to use these types of deodorant because I react to the typical commercial products.  </li>
            <li> you are coming from typical commercial deos, try exfoliating under your arms before switching to the crystal.</li>
            <li> Certain foods even seemed to make the metallic taste worse.  </li>
            <li> But for heavy work out extremely sweaty sessions, I am not sure if I am ready to use just that.  </li>
            <li> The packaging part fits the bill, only a little plastic tray to throw in recycling when the rock is used up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to feel wet under my arms or catch a whiff of any body odor.  </li>
            <li> , that you get with antiperspirant!I also don&#x27;t notice any sweat stains on my shirts and I don&#x27;t seem to be wet, although I don&#x27;t think this product is listed as \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It did not really help.</li>
            <li> Just be careful handling it when wetting....</li>
            <li> I keep this in my shower so it gets wet from the shower.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> apply it, wet it</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly for a few months and it does work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, wet the stone or leave your underarms damp after a shower/bath, and then rub the stone all over your armpits.</li>
            <li> To clarify, I use it immediately after shower, while I&#x27;m still wet.</li>
            <li> To use, you wet the stone and then apply it as you would deodorant.  </li>
            <li> After using the Crystal Rock deodorant for about a month now, I can say it works as well as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really helpful if you need help with odor in my opinion.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because every one I ordered came in with a broken crystal which for me isn&#x27;t a big deal because I throw the smaller pieces in my Crystal spray deodorant in order to make it stronger</li>
            <li> Mine slipped within a few seconds even though I was being careful, hit the cement floor, and shattered into tiny shards.</li>
            <li> However one day I accidentally dropped it in the sink and it broke into a bunch of pieces; the biggest remaining piece had some sharp edges</li>
            <li> The screw-out sticks fail first, on the screw hole.</li>
            <li> Mostly due to a wider face which makes application easier.  </li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s been mentioned in other reviews, it still makes your shirt smell.</li>
            <li> It cracks and gets really sharp parts that scratch my armpits.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this rock is ammonium alum which is made from aluminum hydroxide, a component of aluminum bauxite ore.  </li>
            <li> Not sure of any other effects it may have long term, but I think my body told me what to do.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear spaghetti straps as a teen because my pits stunk pretty bad</li>
            <li> And if it works for you the Rock will last at least a year.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt cut but its not very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It does not stop sweat, but I sweat less now.</li>
            <li> We would need to reapply this too often for it to work even slightly.</li>
            <li> It is slippery and difficult to hold on to when it is wet, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I dropped it on the floor and broke it into four jagged pieces.</li>
            <li> Put it on when you are still damp from the shower and stink less throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I guess I also have sensitive skin, as I was recently forced to switch deodorant/antiperspirant because my usual brand was out of stock, and I started to suffer itching and burning with several other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply daily and had zero issues when it was cold outside.  </li>
            <li> I have had a few times where I may wait 20-30 mins</li>
            <li> a few minutes after my shower.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not doing heavy labor</li>
            <li> It took me a few months to detox</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not convenient to take on a vacation yet because I don&#x27;t have a container for it, but otherwise I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It either smears my clothes, or gets trapped in my armpit hair.</li>
            <li> Give it a few seconds to air-dry and you are all set.</li>
            <li> After a night of hanging out with friends and drinking, I would usually smell pretty bad in the morning for some reason.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I developed rashes and discomfort and subsequent use was nothing but painful and irritating.</li>
            <li> Not sure about that.  </li>
            <li> I have a small backyard garden</li>
            <li> The packaging is excessive and the dish is plastic.</li>
            <li> The white flaky version of their deodorants work, but I hate white flaky deodorant.</li>
            <li> I grew tired of the gunky mess under my arms and the discoloration on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I tried hypoallergenic brands, sensitive skin brands, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands, etc, and everything made me itch so bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a geek like I am, I googled the issue and found that it is quite common.</li>
            <li> So I started to go without using any type of deodorant, which really sucks.  </li>
            <li> To my delight, I didn&#x27;t smell anything even when I returned home late that evening.  </li>
            <li> I would encourage anyone who is looking for alternatives to at least give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am forced to using it as a spray.  </li>
            <li> so I am forced to using it as a spray.  </li>
            <li> Even though I can&#x27;t tell there is anything on my skin, the rock is slowly wearing away</li>
            <li> No more smells!</li>
            <li> did I conduct a simple test to see if it was the Crystal deodorant causing the unpleasant taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is safer than regular deodorant since it does contain aluminum, but I don&#x27;t know if I believe aluminum is bad.</li>
            <li> For those complaining that the stone smells after youve used it for a while, it means their pits were stinky to begin with and the stone just absorbed your nasty BO.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward wetting the crystal every time I use it, but this is a small price to pay for something that works so well!</li>
            <li> I suspect that is the weak spot of these stones, that water will erode these fault lines in the rock.</li>
            <li> I was so self conscious; I hated reaching around people because I could smell myself and I was worried they would smell me too.  </li>
            <li> I did perspire a bit during the day, but it wasn&#x27;t an uncomfortable amount</li>
            <li> For under $3, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with odor, even after swimming which I was afraid would take it off.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of crystal deodorants.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating (its not antiperspirant and isn&#x27;t supposed to..not sweating is bad for the body)</li>
            <li> He was shocked that the product was still working after doing an hour of running on his treadmill.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me how this crazy stone works, but it does!</li>
            <li> Also having to moisten this while out and about is very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell bad and this thing lasts forever!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s painful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works real good. I love it. I purchased more for friends.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT........... After trying this deodorant all else failed my comparison test awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a deodorant w/ less chemicals, especially parabens.  I have been unsuccessful in finding one that works.  Even now, going back to the ones w/ more chemicals, I wasn&#x27;t getting the desired results.  I tried this deodorant rock on a whim and it really works.  We are in the middle of a week+ of 100+ degrees and I am dry and odor-free.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but I am truly amazed at how great it is.  I feel cleaner and fresher, and even in 100 degree weather, have no underarm issues. I purchased two, and after much prodding, convinced my husband to try one.  He was a huge skeptic and now is a true believer.  He was shocked that the product was still working after doing an hour of running on his treadmill.  Twice I&#x27;ve used my old deodorant by mistake, and I really noticed the difference.  I&#x27;ve since thrown my old deodorant away.</li>
            <li> I really like the crystal deodorant. Remember, it&#x27;s not an anti-persperant, just a deodorant. But it really works and lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I am not a \\&quot;Man&#x27;s man\\&quot; but I am a man and I have a \\&quot;Man&#x27;s man\\&quot; body. (I smell when I sweat) Unfortunately I guess I also have sensitive skin, as I was recently forced to switch deodorant/antiperspirant because my usual brand was out of stock, and I started to suffer itching and burning with several other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a geek like I am, I googled the issue and found that it is quite common. Most of the articles or comments I read about the issue ended with the person trying this miracle crystal rock deodorant. So I did some research and found out that it&#x27;s not really a deodorant or an antiperspirant but an anti-odorant if such a thing exists. It doesn&#x27;t cover odor, or prevent perspiration, but it prevents the bacteria that cause odor from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if your average or below on the sweaty/stinky scales then this would be a great product for you. It does seem to do the job well, but it really only lasts about 12 hours. And as a man with a \\&quot;Man&#x27;s man\\&quot; type of body I will say that you need to apply IMMEDIATELY after existing the shower. I have had a few times where I may wait 20-30 mins and it seems like it&#x27;s already too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a good product and a welcome alternative to having goo or paste under your arms all day. I have been using the rock for about a month, and it keeps me fresh the entire day at work most of the time. (desk job) I am also considering trying the deodorant stick specifically for men made by the same company.</li>
            <li> I m new to this product but has worked well so far. my boyfriend has even used it on his feet and noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with the crystal rock deodorant, but now that I know how to use it, I&#x27;m quite satisfied!  You can&#x27;t put this on like regular deodorant -- I tried, it didn&#x27;t work.  I found that I really have to rub it in and cover a pretty big area of underarm skin to get satisfactory results.  I spend probably 15-20 seconds really rubbing it into each armpit.  I like its odor-fighting action, but even more I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave stains or gunky stuff on my clothes like regular deodorants.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the Crystal products. About 5 years ago, for some reason, traditional deodorants started making me itch immensely.  I tried hypoallergenic brands, sensitive skin brands, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands, etc, and everything made me itch so bad.  Then I heard from my aunt about some \\&quot;rock\\&quot; a friend of hers used that worked great.  So I finally purchased the Crystal \\&quot;rock\\&quot; (without any holder or anything).  At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed , probably because I was so used to the strong smelling traditional deodorants - I could smell some stinkyness with the Crystal.  So I started to go without using any type of deodorant, which really sucks.  We are sure smelly creatures!  I was so self conscious; I hated reaching around people because I could smell myself and I was worried they would smell me too.  After going like this awhile, I couldn&#x27;t even get the smell off in the shower, I could soak in the tub and scrub with soap, and when getting out of the shower my pits would still stink.  So that&#x27;s when I decided to try the Crystal \\&quot;rock\\&quot; again, and it definitely works!  It is not flawless protection, as you can tell since I wasn&#x27;t impressed going from traditional pit stick to this, but after going a year without wearing anything and stinking to high hell, this Crystal does work.  I have now used all forms of Crystal.  The Rock is great, it will last you way over a year, probably even 2 years.  However one day I accidentally dropped it in the sink and it broke into a bunch of pieces; the biggest remaining piece had some sharp edges so I needed to buy a new one.  So I bought The Rock in the plastic holder, and that is definitely nicer.  However one time on a flight it must have gotten whacked because the deal that pushes the deodorant up stopped working.  Then I tried the Roll On Crystal.  I would say that is my favorite form, however you will go through it a lot faster.  A bottle would last me maybe 2 months.  I really liked it though, just a couple swipes and I was good to go.  When I ran out of that I decided to buy the Spray bottle since it is a lot cheaper per ounce, thinking I would use it to refill my roll on bottle; however I could not get the roll on bottle open so I am forced to using it as a spray.  Several reviewers say they can use just 2 sprays, however I am up to 12 sprays per pit just to get decent coverage so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long either.  So overall, if you have skin sensitivities to traditional pit stick like me, or you worry about the chemicals in traditional deodorant, I would definitely recommend Crystal.  If you want to save money, I would splurge for getting the Rock in the plastic holder because the rock will break if you drop it - you have to wet the rock before using it which makes it slippery, so the plastic holder is great to keep your fingers dry and prevent you from dropping it; if you don&#x27;t  mind the price and want the liquid, I would recommend the Roll On.When I ran out of that I decided to buy the Spray bottle since it is a lot cheaper per ounce, thinking I would use it to refill my roll on bottle; however I could not get the roll on bottle open so I am forced to using it as a spray.

            <li> I wanted to get rid of deodorants after reading about the hazards of the ingredients used in them.  These crystals do the job.  No they do not keep you from sweating.  But, they do take care of the odor.  Use as directed... after showering and such.  I have not bought deodorant in years.  These rocks last a long, long time...</li>
            <li> I had seen this in stores years ago, and I have to admit that I laughed it off when I saw it! Fast forward a few years, and I still have yet to find a deodorant stick/spray/gel that I like! When wearing typical deodorants, I actually tend to end up having BO when normally I wouldn&#x27;t have! It seemed like I was better off not wearing any at all, because I smelled better without them! Of course, during warmer weather I had no other choice but to wear them and continue to buy new ones in hopes that the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one would come along! Finally, I came across this crystal on amazon, and after seeing the good reviews, I thought that it was worth a shot, but didn&#x27;t get my hopes up! Luckily, I have found that I love this rock! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, yet it has perfect odor protection that lasts all day! Since I really don&#x27;t perspire on a normal basis, this really served the purpose that I needed it for. Hopefully it continues to work for me, but so far, I am extremely impressed! It is a little awkward wetting the crystal every time I use it, but this is a small price to pay for something that works so well! I am glad I found this, my days of searching for/wasting money on other deodorants are done :)</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 months, but now, its effects are starting to fade. Maybe it gets less efficient because I had it for so long, or maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s warmer outside. I am going to buy a new one, and I will update this afterwards. In any case, 6 months of natural deodorant for a few bucks is a great deal!</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.  It was purchased for my girlfriend who went through breast surgery due to cancer and had to use special deodorants.  This product is very effective, easy to use, lasts a very long time and it is recommended for cancer patients due to its lack of ingredients that are harmful for people who have had chemo, radiation or are taking drugs due to their cancer.  I have started using it myself as well and I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering buying it.</li>
            <li> I like how it works.  It doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating (its not antiperspirant and isn&#x27;t supposed to..not sweating is bad for the body) but when you do sweat it doesn&#x27;t stink in my experience.</li>
            <li> And it gets the job done.  Apply after showering works best.  Lasts a very long time - takes a year to use it up.</li>
            <li> If you want to save money in expensive deodorants and smells clean, this is the better choice. It works really well. You only need to know that it does not have any aroma.</li>
            <li> The weather was cooler when I started using this, and I was able to stay smell free for a bit, but I can personally still smell myself and that&#x27;s no good.  I started putting on some lavender essential oil afterwards on top of the rock application, and that worked great.  But then I was headed to vacation time in 120+ degree weather, panicked, and went back to my old, chemically-ness, toxic deodorant.  Shame on me!  I&#x27;ll hold onto this rock, and maybe break it out again in the fall and experiment.</li>
            <li> This is the first crystal deodorant I have ever used &amp; I love it!! It has no fragrance, it&#x27;s chemical free, it does a great job of keeping me dry, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Here is a combination that stops the smell even if working in 100 degree heat in the swamp:  After showering swab the underarm with 70 percent alcohol using a cotton ball.  Then a couple of squirts of this product and there is no smell for 24 hours.  This product is easy to apply.  After using this product regularly for a month there is no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell or perfume.  You can use whatever you like for that purpose without overloading the people around you with scents.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I did not believe this would work but it really does! I put it on a larger area than I would with normal deodorant a few minutes after my shower. It takes a couple of minutes to dry. I have not had any issues with odor, even after swimming which I was afraid would take it off. I do not know if it is safer than regular deodorant since it does contain aluminum, but I don&#x27;t know if I believe aluminum is bad. It has not been proven without a doubt. I like this because it should not stain my clothing.</li>
            <li> Crystal works way better than any of the kind diluted in water as a spray (those work for on the go or for overall body use better). In the winter, or if you are mostly indoors this really works for up to 24hrs. In the summer, it will definitely get you through the work/school day, but you may want to wash up and reapply later. Also, the longer you use it, the better it works. It does not stop sweat, but I sweat less now. I believe your body tries to clear typical antiperspirants out by \\&quot;trying\\&quot; to sweat more.</li>
            <li> There is no way you can hold on to this tiny, slippery stone. Mine slipped within a few seconds even though I was being careful, hit the cement floor, and shattered into tiny shards. Those shards really flew, too; I spent the last 20 minutes vacuuming. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I never knew there was such a thing as a deodorant stone. I was attracted to this product because I thought it would last much longer than anything else I had tried and I need to use these types of deodorant because I react to the typical commercial products.  This stone worked well at first; but, within a few days, I noticed my underarms felt sore. I developed rashes and discomfort and subsequent use was nothing but painful and irritating. Once I figured out the problem was the rock, I washed it off and went back to the Crystal towelettes.  I have since purchased the Crystal roll-on and have had no problem with either the towelettes or roll-on (even after shaving).</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me and my daughter. We would need to reapply this too often for it to work even slightly. Also having to moisten this while out and about is very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It will shatter into a thousand pieces.  Even before that I did not find this to be an effective product.  Shipping took about 3 days too long.  It seems to work for some so I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t try it.  But for me it was a joke.</li>
            <li> Deodorant stones are the way to go. The screw-out sticks fail first, on the screw hole. The no-moving-parts sticks last maybe 6 months but tend to fall off shelves and shatter. These are probably the best solution for something to keep in the shower/bathroom, as the container makes it less likely to fall and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stones aren&#x27;t totally solid, like an ice cube the impurities are always in the center. I suspect that is the weak spot of these stones, that water will erode these fault lines in the rock. Perhaps they can be resealed with a torch, this stuff melts at 240F</li>
            <li> I am allergic to deodorants and anti-perspirants so a friend suggested I try a deodorant stone. It is like a miracle for me! Thank you for carrying such an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, right after I get out of the shower, this is the rock in my life! Definitely reccomend that you use this instead of deodorant as this actualy fights off BO instead of masking it, though it is not as long lasting and effective as other deodorants. There are also studies done that show the potential cancer free benefits of this salt crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is incredible, so I bought one just to try it. My 13 year old is starting to smell sweaty after school. Not the arm pits, but his general body all over. I run the crystal once a day over his forehead, back, neck, top of chest, arms, anywhere that gives off smell. Takes about a minute to do this after he showers each night. No more smells! No scent, nothing. Not even after he works out the next evening. So I am buying a load of these things before Amazon run out or realize that they should be charging more! :D</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS. It is slippery and difficult to hold on to when it is wet, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I dropped it on the floor and broke it into four jagged pieces. I&#x27;ll buy the stick next time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but it does! It prevents odor, so use as directed.(After shower)</li>
            <li> After trying many different types of all-natural deodorants (which seemed to only last a few hours tops) and making my own (also didn&#x27;t work that well), I am pretty freaking amazed at this deodorant stone.  I bought one on a whim at my local Health Foods store, figuring &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; and have been very happy with it.  Not only does it work REALLY well, I have the added peace of mind of knowing that I&#x27;m not slathering my pits with all sorts of bizarre chemicals.  Also, the plastic packaging is pretty minimal (I do wish it didn&#x27;t come with the plastic tray-I could&#x27;ve used any number of dishes I have on hand) which makes me happy.  All in all, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works better than the Naturally Fresh 2.1 oz deodorant stick.  Mostly due to a wider face which makes application easier.  Any of these alum based salt blocks deodorize better than standard deodorants, though.</li>
            <li> works but I just stank</li>
            <li> Awesome! Much safer than regular deodorants. What an amazing antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;m going to tell you that for years I used Mitchum Ladies deodorant and then the past few years, Secret Clinical strength, meaning I&#x27;m not one of those women who just &amp;#34;glows.&amp;#34;  I tried this on a whim due to the incredible price, and holy moly, it works!  Now, I&#x27;m not doing heavy labor but I do get hot and stressed and I&#x27;ve yet to feel wet under my arms or catch a whiff of any body odor.  And what&#x27;s more, this doesn&#x27;t clog the pores like the roll-ons or gels.  I haven&#x27;t used regular deodorant for a few months now and as long as this crystal keeps working like it has been, I have no intention of going back.  It&#x27;s effective and an incredible cost saver.</li>
            <li> Yep, it really is as good as they say. Put it on when you are still damp from the shower and stink less throughout the day. I stopped using deoderants with antiperspirants years ago, so I&#x27;m long over the sweating factor. This works better for me than any other unscented deoderant - those always stop working sometime in the afternoon. This works well into the evening, sometimes even overnight depending on the day I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I bought this \\&quot;stone\\&quot; before I realized that Crystal also sells a pump spray and towelettes.  Still, I have been turned onto this stone because it just works!  I would say I perspire as much as the average woman.  I bought this in May, and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be wise to experiment with it during these warmer months here in the south.  I bit the bullet and decided to try it on a day when I would have to be out all day long and busy with people.  To my delight, I didn&#x27;t smell anything even when I returned home late that evening.  The armpits on my blouse had NO odor AT ALL!  I thought it was too good to be true.  I did perspire a bit during the day, but it wasn&#x27;t an uncomfortable amount (I wasn&#x27;t outdoors), and I felt clean the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced a bit of burning after shaving, but it only lasts long enough for your arm pits to dry.  No problem there.  And you do have to give your under arms a bit of time to dry before putting your clothes on.  Still, not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t intend to go back to using my other deodorant/anti-perspirants that I used for years (Dove, Degree, Sure, Secret, etc.).  I grew tired of the gunky mess under my arms and the discoloration on my clothes.  Instead of having to scrub under my arms during a shower while trying to remove the gunkiness, I find that Crystal just rinses off quite easily.  I&#x27;m sold.  What can I say?  I would encourage anyone who is looking for alternatives to at least give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (7/29/14): I have experienced, as another review has also stated, a rash after several weeks of use.  For now, hydrocortisone cream used at night is keeping me comfortable.  I had read that the rash could be an effect of detox.  Not sure about that.  If I can keep this rash to a minimum, I still intend to continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I dropped my Crystal stone on the tile floor in a hotel bathroom over the weekend. Sure enough, it broke into several pieces.  One of the pieces is still big enough to use until I can get a replacement. The stone is quite slippery when wet,so in the future, I plan to lean over a towel-covered vanity/sink while using for a softer resting place if my rock slips again.big enough to use until I can get a replacement.

            <li> This is a great product !!!  Very effective, easy to use, and NOT messy !!</li>
            <li> I love deodorant stones...so much better than using smelly, runny or powdery expensive deodorants, which almost always contain Aluminum as the first ingredient.  Since Aluminum is sometimes linked with Alzheimer&#x27;s, I avoid anything that contains it.  Also, since deodorants stop perspiration, the underarm area is effectively \\&quot;sealed\\&quot;, the toxins cannot escape ...which in my in-expert opionion, can be a contributing factor to breast cancer.  So it&#x27;s deodorants stones for me!  And they last FOREVER.  The only reason I ever have to buy a new one is that I invariably drop them and they shatter!</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this rock is ammonium alum which is made from aluminum hydroxide, a component of aluminum bauxite ore.  It works well in controlling odor and I would have kept using it for that purpose.  UNTIL.......................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to notice a metallic taste in my mouth that became stronger as time went on.  Certain foods even seemed to make the metallic taste worse.  Only when I did some searching did I find that you can actually absorb it into your body did I conduct a simple test to see if it was the Crystal deodorant causing the unpleasant taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the deodorant for several days and the strange taste in my mouth went away.  Since then I have totally discontinued using the Crystal Rock and have switched to using milk of magnesia with no strange effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you experience a metallic taste you may wish to stop and switch.  Not sure of any other effects it may have long term, but I think my body told me what to do.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this, I was worrying about a lump I had removed from under my arm coming back again, after the doctor informed me it was likely to happen in my sweat glands. The deodorants really don&#x27;t work, just kind put a floral scent over a stinky one... this actually has no scent at all, it kills the bacteria that causes the stinky armpits, so there is simply just no smell at all. It comes with a small plastic shell to hold it on top of your counter on, and you just wet it with water and rub under your arm pit and it lasts me till the next morning or even longer. It says to only use it on clean underarms, so you&#x27;ll have to wash first, then you apply it and there is no odor, at all. Great product, not harmful and NO Aluminum chlorohydrate, that you get with antiperspirant!I also don&#x27;t notice any sweat stains on my shirts and I don&#x27;t seem to be wet, although I don&#x27;t think this product is listed as \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot;. All in all it is a great product- especially if you are worried about toxic chemicals in your very sensitive arm pits!!</li>
            <li> It did not really help. The idea sounds logical, but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The price is very cheap and is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it works well so far.  I don&#x27;t smell any odor in my under arm area.  But for heavy work out extremely sweaty sessions, I am not sure if I am ready to use just that.  Maybe I will bring it to the gym with me next time and try to re-apply it if I smell anything.  Nonetheless, a great product to have and I like that its all natural and at a very decent price</li>
            <li> This works OK for being a natural alternative to those chemical body deodorants. Just be careful handling it when wetting....it gets very slippery. I broke mine into a couple pieces when it slipped out of my hand and hit the floor but it is still usable.</li>
            <li> This works if you use it daily. Highy recommend a try to move away from chemical deodorant.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I was a skeptic, but trying it now I am a big fan.  In brief: using this &#x27;rock&#x27; is at least as effective in neutralizing odor as any commercial deodorant/antiperspirant product, but it has no residue, is very mild on the skin and has minimal packaging (for fans of the environment). It&#x27;s just makes armpit odor a non-issue.  Love it, will only use this in the future.</li>
            <li> Big change for me. Seems to be working. Do still feel moist more often but love the fact don&#x27;t have to deal with white marks on shirts.</li>
            <li> Works just like it&#x27;s supposed too!  Love that there is no scent and also that it comes with its own little dish.&lt;br /&gt;Supposed to last a whole year (cross your fingers).</li>
            <li> It really works...in Winter and Summer!  I purchased in February 2014 in an effort to reduce parabens in my daily maintenance and the Rock is still going strong.  I apply daily and had zero issues when it was cold outside.  My wife was just waiting until the Alabama heat picked up to see if the Rock could hold up, and it does!  I have had no complaints about odor from the ladies in my life (wife and daughters) since purchasing this product.  If I want the extra assurance that my odor will be OK, I did pick up a scented coconut oil/shea butter deodorant at our local farmer&#x27;s market that works really well too.  However 90% of the time I stick with the Rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  For under $3, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  And if it works for you the Rock will last at least a year.  Now that is cheap personal grooming!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing</li>
            <li> Large crystal with a nice dish to set it in, to catch any water and build up. I actually prefer this one to the last brand I would use, that was purchased at Walmart. This one is much cleaner and easier to rinse and dry. For anyone thinking to switch over to a natural deodorant, just keep in mind that it takes some time for the body to acclimate to using any natural deodorant rather than chemical. It took me a few months to detox and then I was good to go. Prefer salt crystal over the baking soda types I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. Better than any other deodorant I have ever used actually. I put it on right out of the shower while my underarms are still wet. Since its just a stone its needs some moisture to apply. Make sure your pits are clean before you put it on, if you come out of the shower smelly, you&#x27;ll stay that way. It doesnt mask your scent, it stops the stink from producing it self. For those complaining that the stone smells after youve used it for a while, it means their pits were stinky to begin with and the stone just absorbed your nasty BO.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing with it is you have to make sure you get a nice even coating, and a larger area then you would normally with standard deodorant, if you miss a spot then you&#x27;ll smell. As long as you get a good coat, then the stuff is amazing, works for over a couple days on a single application.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that it does not stop you from sweating, you just wont stink, like at all... it actually took a while to get use to having completely neutral smelling armpits even after a hard days work out in the sun. I&#x27;m pretty convinced its witchcraft. A friend of mine who suggested it to me said they last over a year, so far mine looks to have not changed in size at all (2 months~).</li>
            <li> Nice product. I keep this in my shower so it gets wet from the shower. It works.I could work all day and be grossly sweaty but have  fresh pit. There is literally no smell and best of all it&#x27;ll take at least a yr before I need another one</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of crystal deodorants.  I am very pleased with the results!  This works better than any deodorant I have ever used.  I will never go back to traditional deodorants.  This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I like it. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. for those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a clear block of salt, it has no smell whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;To apply it, wet it first.&lt;br /&gt;It works, but like it&#x27;s been mentioned in other reviews, it still makes your shirt smell. so it&#x27;s best to use it with tank tops and similar.</li>
            <li> Did not know it was going to be a ball. Thought it was a stick. Haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about how this \\&quot;rock\\&quot; would work, but I gotta admit, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It&#x27;s not convenient to take on a vacation yet because I don&#x27;t have a container for it, but otherwise I use it everyday.  I have a small backyard garden and I have applied Crystal Body in the morning and then toiled like a slave during the hottest part of the day.  Yes, I sweat.  Like a PIG!  But I don&#x27;t stink!  AT ALL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times applying it was a bit confusing in that I wasn&#x27;t sure if any of it was actually rubbing off onto my skin.  I held the rock in one hand, added a few drops of water to the top of it and smeared it around some then rubbed it into my armpit.  Even though I can&#x27;t tell there is anything on my skin, the rock is slowly wearing away and I don&#x27;t stink.  I love this thing and it&#x27;s all natural so I really love not putting some man-made chemical concoction on my skin anymore that only served to plug up my sweat glands and stain my clothing.  I have ordered two more of these to either use myself, or give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Works well, although on very hot days I need to apply more often than I do, I think. I&#x27;m ok with washing up more often and reapplying to avoid the chemicals in most deo.</li>
            <li> i used this on my stink chakra, opened it right up. aligned both armpits for days at a time! AXEWOLF</li>
            <li> I read several reviews prior to purchasing this product.  I have been using it regularly for a few months and it does work.  It works best right after the shower and does keep the underarm stink away on the skin.  As others have mentioned, the product prevents bacterial growth that causes smell.  I haven&#x27;t seen any residue on my clothing, which is fantastic.  I am still testing it for how well it prevents smell on clothing, especially synthetic fabrics and blends, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li> The best product on the market of its kind.  Been using for years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this product works . . . But, it does.  It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out. It&#x27;s works pretty well, but I&#x27;m going to give the true test in the summer.</li>
            <li> fantastic.... ya people that use chemical deodorant need to switch asap</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff! I&#x27;ve used many different types of deodorant over the years, partially because I&#x27;m picky and health conscious, and partially because I have extremely sensitive armpits. I don&#x27;t like using deodorant that contains aluminum, because of health concerns. The problem is that aluminum is the ingredient used in most deodorants to control wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Dove Men + Care deodorant for a while. The white flaky version of their deodorants work, but I hate white flaky deodorant. It either smears my clothes, or gets trapped in my armpit hair. I know, it&#x27;s gross. I usually use the gel one, but it dissipates so quickly, that by 10am, I can smell myself. That stuff is garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this alum deodorant stone on accident, and bought it. I&#x27;ve worn it twice so far. You literally just get this stone wet, then rub it on your underarms, and it works fantastic. I have NO irritation, which is something I&#x27;ve experienced with almost every deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Also, I applied some yesterday morning, worked in the office all day, went to the bar with some friends, and woke up without smelling any body odor. After a night of hanging out with friends and drinking, I would usually smell pretty bad in the morning for some reason. This is the first time that hasn&#x27;t been the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another level, I like to save money whenever possible, and this crystal was around $5 and should last a year. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Simple packaging.  If you are looking for an alternative to aluminum based deodorants the crystal works well.  Easy to use.  since its not liquid it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I love the deodorant stones! The packaging is excessive and the dish is plastic. Eh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, wet the stone or leave your underarms damp after a shower/bath, and then rub the stone all over your armpits. Give it a few seconds to air-dry and you are all set. Works for about 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming from typical commercial deos, try exfoliating under your arms before switching to the crystal. Simple baking soda in the shower (used QUICKLY to prevent irritation) can be quite effective before your first use. There is no need to exfoliate every day, but something to consider if you have years of build-up from waxy deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have  tried  many  natural  deodorants, even  tried  to  make  one, I  don&#x27;t  know  why  I waited so  long  to try this  but  it  works great.</li>
            <li> This rock rocks. It&#x27;s simple and effective. I&#x27;ll keep using it just because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real downside here, just a quality product.</li>
            <li> My local health food store sells a similar product for $9.  I am happy to find such a great deal.</li>
            <li> This product gives me rashes. To clarify, I use it immediately after shower, while I&#x27;m still wet. I shower twice daily. I&#x27;m finding that I break out in rashes where I apply it (my armpits), only occasionally, but when it happens it takes weeks for the rashes to clear up and heal. Very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone should do a study to see what the deal is with this product.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I am one of those people who have always applied another layer of deodorant on once to twice daily to freshen up.  It has nothing to do with my scent, but more how I feel better after an additional application half way through the day.  There is no odor to this stone, which is perfectly fine and it works great however you are only supposed to apply to freshly showered skin.  I use it after my shower but to freshen up during the day I&#x27;ll use the crystal roll on liquid.</li>
            <li> This actually works. After working for 12 hours I did not come home smelling funky.</li>
            <li> Works great, the only one I use, no smell.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both decided to try this, he loves it and I do not.  Which is ironic because I really do not sweat, and he does, a lot.... He says it works, keeps him fresh, but I have noticed tward the end of the day he is not really so fresh...  I do not like it at all, as I said I do not sweat, so the most important thing for me is a fresh scent and this has no scent, I don&#x27;t like it, I feel like I may as well use nothing...</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this as a natural alternative for deodorant.  There&#x27;s also a roll on version that I would probably like better.  To use, you wet the stone and then apply it as you would deodorant.  It tends to slip out of your hand when doing so.  As far as holding up to other deodorant brands, it&#x27;s not any better in my opinion.  It&#x27;s probably about the same.</li>
            <li> I have used different versions of this in the past, and I recently wanted to become more organic again, so I ordered this. I guess I had forgot the reason I stopped using it. It cracks and gets really sharp parts that scratch my armpits. I don&#x27;t know how to make it not do that. I have started filing it with a fingernail file, and that seems to work and keep it from scratching me, but I wish there was another solution. It will literally leave scrapes on my underarms and it&#x27;s painful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and I like it.  The only thing I dont like is after a while the edges can get a bit sharp.  It doesnt cut but its not very comfortable.  But definitely worth the price and it lasts a long, long time</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  It really works well and the crystal lasts a lot longer than regular brand deodorants.  The only draw back, if you can call it that, it is not an anti persperant.  But lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing it works ! The only thing is you have to put it on every couple of hours because it starts to wear off but other than that it&#x27;s great !! No white stains on shirts !</li>
            <li> After using the Crystal Rock deodorant for about a month now, I can say it works as well as I expected it to. The primary reason I purchased it was to minimize wasteful packaging and still \\&quot;keep me dry\\&quot; in most conditions.  The packaging part fits the bill, only a little plastic tray to throw in recycling when the rock is used up. It keeps the sweat at bay through most days. Working in a warehouse in the heat of the summer, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it do wonders which it doesn&#x27;t but, on a nice day when I&#x27;m just going about my day, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use!</li>
            <li> The ONLY natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me stink and actually keeps me from sweating. I&#x27;ve tried ALL brands and haven&#x27;t found one yet that does the job. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, though. I kind of wish it had a scent.... But who cares?!? I don&#x27;t smell bad and this thing lasts forever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really helpful if you need help with odor in my opinion. I know everyone is different. Some sweat more than others and some have trouble with odor. No matter how much they bathe. This didn&#x27;t help much in the odor department. I&#x27;m going to try it a few more times and maybe apply more. I&#x27;ll see how it works. But for now I&#x27;m not too thrilled.</li>
            <li> Well, it is not the most powerful deodorant out there.  As the other reviewers have said, you need to use this right out of the shower when you are at your cleanest.  It also doesn&#x27;t work for me on anything but the most average of days - if I have a stressful presentation or if I am doing more strenuous-that-average work, it is not potent enough to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after using it for a few months, it has developed some sharp places.  Not the most pleasant feeling when you are applying it and accidentally scrape your armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even after all that, it does seem to work pretty well for just average days and is nice to give your body a break from the stronger stuff.</li>
            <li> I started using Crystal Deodorant on the recommendation of a friend.  I had been using a standard scented spray deodorant in a can for decades and was very leery of trying anything else.  After using Crystal for over 6 months, I can attest that it is more effective, easier, cheaper, and better for me than what I was using.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t just cover up odors, it manages to stop them from occurring.</li>
            <li> This was an add on item. Dad has been using these for years and they last forever. They do not work on me. You will sweat still, but haven&#x27;t odor. I just can&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE crystal stones and have loved it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because every one I ordered came in with a broken crystal which for me isn&#x27;t a big deal because I throw the smaller pieces in my Crystal spray deodorant in order to make it stronger but if you are paying for a product, you should receive it in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great,  I struggled for years trying to find something to help my pit stench.  I couldn&#x27;t wear spaghetti straps as a teen because my pits stunk pretty bad and I live in AZ so you can imagine how hot it gets.  I always had to wear cotton tee&#x27;s and even then I struggled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can put this on Friday and still be odor free by Sunday - YES,  I have gone all weekend without a shower - I like letting myself go every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found this product to be ideal for foot odor.  As with spaghetti straps, I couldn&#x27;t use sandals without having odor problems.  This solved that issue as well.</li>
            <li> Have only had product for a week, but works fine, is much larger than expected (good thing), shaped like a ball with flattened sides. Best used dry on moist skin to prevent eventual cracking of crystal. This is a form of alum (look it up). So far, RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me how this crazy stone works, but it does! The down side is you have to clean up before you can reapply, as it seems to be more of a preventative measure for odor. I can go 24 hours without any hint of odor, even when going to the gym. But I will say, once odor strikes, you might as well jump in the shower that instant.</li>
            <li> i still don&#x27;t get how this thing works</li>
            <li> The Crystal Body Deodorant Stone works. I had one that would have lasted my whole life had my cleaning lady not broken it into a million pieces. This new one is large enough to finish out my life. No dangerous chemicals. If I miss a day I am still odor free.</li>
            <li> Wow! I used this 10 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I can&#x27;t believe how well this works compared to stick deodorants. IIRC these things last and last (maybe 2-3 years?) It&#x27;ll save you in the long run over a stick, spray, or roll-on.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It works and will last a very long time as long as you don&#x27;t drop it like I did. I ordered another one though, this keeps the smell away, I apply it after a shower and am good for the next full day. If you drop it it will break so be aware of that. But I have no complaints at all this thing is fantastic!</li>
