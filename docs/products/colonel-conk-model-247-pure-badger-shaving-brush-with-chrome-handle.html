            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and it arrived in time and in good shape -</li>
            <li>This is a really good compromise.</li>
            <li>It has some weight to it which is good, good handle for use</li>

            <li>It is shedding more hair than my dog!</li>
            <li>now i&#x27;m happy to report it is holding up well and doing a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>cause it looks nice and</li>
            <li>This brush has some heft alot heavier than i thought but its nice.</li>
            <li>Badger hair is the best for shaving brushes but not everyone wants to spend $150 for one.</li>
            <li>Art of shaving lavender soap, Escali deluxe razor stand.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, get this brush, a nice Merkur 180, and get shaving the way you were meant to...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a high end brush, so cannot compare it to the ones priced over $50, but this is perfect for my purpose.</li>
            <li>the brush has good weight and comfortable in hand .</li>
            <li>Worked great for the first 3 months until it started shedding a lot, now at a rate of around 20 bristles each time I shave that tickle my face like hell.</li>
            <li>first brush....very happy with it....researched for hours on what to get</li>
            <li>Like I said before, maybe just need to brush up my technique a bit more, or try softer soaps.</li>
            <li>and we men sure do love</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this shaving</li>
            <li>My husband was looking for a better quality brush and we bought this one.  </li>
            <li>That said, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>brush.&lt;br /&gt;Still shedding a bit more</li>
            <li>so well that you can use it for three or four passes without touching the soap or cream again.</li>
            <li>: Well, I have had this brush for over 6 months now and it has yet to lose any more bristles.</li>
            <li>Upgraded from a cheap starter brush and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Because of this, my face is becoming smoother and my shaves have become more enjoyable and closer</li>
            <li>Both of them are a nice, clean silver and the brush  </li>
            <li>Firstly, this brush seems to be of good quality and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>The new brush seemed great.</li>
            <li>It had been used almost a year and was as attractive as a new brush.  </li>
            <li>Brushes like this easily cost 2 or 3 times more.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my face, handle is nice and heavy with a beautiful polished finish</li>
            <li>At first, I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for my old brush, all my setup is chrome (razor, shaving bowl and brush stand) was happy to find a brush with chrome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft on your skin but it whips up a great lather for shaving.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to work the shave soap that I had also purchased.</li>
            <li>After a very short period of use the brush becomes even more attractive.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an Amazon purchase, they make returns so easy and are so gracious about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 2: It&#x27;s been a year and the brush is still going strong not losing bristles and looks and performs as it should.</li>
            <li>The knot is just beautiful but needed a bit of my personal touch with a scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is still holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>No stand came with the brush,but I alreadt had my own large stand.</li>
            <li>In addition to it being fun, it is also necessary to tweak a good thing and make it even better!</li>
            <li>I own a much cheaper brush for myself</li>
            <li>I ordered it because it had handle dimensions that fit a stand I wanted to use.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so far so good</li>
            <li>so I dont know how it is to actually use, but it makes a very nice looking gift &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice looking and made from badger hair which is key for a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this nice high quality shaving brush and expect to be using it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>The bristles of the replacement brush are longer than the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve adjusted to using it but miss the quality of the original brush that cam with the set.</li>
            <li>It effortlessly yields a rich lather on the face.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I was excited by the descriptions on this page, noting that the item was said to be hand-crafted on the Isle of Man.  </li>
            <li>can tell you that for the first time ever, I actually enjoy shaving!</li>
            <li>The brush holds water good and is not rough when applying, the hairs are not too flimsy with soap</li>
            <li>It smells clean.</li>
            <li>and I think (JMHO) that it&#x27;s a nice product that will deliver and will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those interested in wet shaving, and reluctant to spend $100 or more on a high-end brush, this is a great choice for the money.</li>
            <li>Good price for English shaving brush.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still full</li>
            <li>The knot is very dense and the brush is fuller and much better at whipping up my shaving soap.</li>
            <li>yesterday, going back today.&lt;br /&gt;Opened it, gave it a good rinse and loaded it with Proraso and whipped it up</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the soap gets a nice lather. .</li>
            <li>The handle is solid with good heft.  </li>
            <li>Boar odor was neutralized by washing first in a strong pet shampoo a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great brush.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Got much better lather the first time I used this brush and got a much smother shave.</li>
            <li>I currently own a Super Badger with Pewter Handle that came from the same craftsmen on the Isle of Man.  </li>
            <li>Its heavy, b/c the handle is metal, but it feels like great quality.  </li>
            <li>and it does fit the stand very well.</li>
            <li>Much of the badger hair that is loaded into the finest handmade brushes available comes from China.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush, the chrome seem&#x27;s to have a yellow tint, almost like Nichole plating.</li>
            <li>it is quite soft and handsome.  </li>
            <li>The hairs are longer and more flexible than my old brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it&#x27;s soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>Dosent hold as much water as i expected but vary happy regardless.</li>
            <li>but if you do go right ahead and save some money</li>
            <li>It feels quite heavy in hand, fits perfectly in the deluxe stainless steel stand I bought at the same time, and the bristles feel soft.</li>
            <li>The weight of the brush feels great in my hand; it&#x27;s very heavy considering the size.</li>
            <li>I am still learning how to shave and I am also having fun trying the many different blades that are out there.</li>
            <li>It came in a generic white box, and is made in Taiwan, but I am happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>This will extend its life considerably, which a fine product like this deserves.</li>
            <li>As far as the brush itself, for the price, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is also necessary, because I am finding that the most expensive blade doesn&#x27;t always get you the best results!</li>
            <li>and I am also noticing that my facial skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s my first brush</li>
            <li>I will probably go back to my Escali brush as it does a better job of spreading the soap or cream withouit using a lot of either.</li>
            <li>Several washings with pet shampoo did the trick and time, I&#x27;m sure will finish the job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last for years.</li>
            <li>more slippery than my wooden handle</li>
            <li>My brush was so nice that I gave it to a family member that I had introduced to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>;-)  in my life..  </li>
            <li>Weight is heavy and feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that not only am I enjoying the experience of a warm brush on my face to prep my whiskers before shaving, but I&#x27;m getting a better shave than I ever got with pro-glide for far less money!</li>
            <li>The bristle seem a little more prickly than my old boars hair brush against my skin, but in a good way, I think it is due to the denser knot that the bristles seem to stand up more and seem stiffer.</li>
            <li>I started with a cheap pure badger and almost gave up on soaps, then got this brush and WOW!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the difference in quality compared to the original brush that came with the set.  </li>
            <li>Used my Taylor of Old Bond Street Rose Shaving Cream and that finally did it.</li>
            <li>Cheap, Hairs Fallout Left &amp; Right.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush because of the positive reviews, and the chrome polished handle.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t really know that I am qualified to say anything.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I went back to the classic</li>
            <li>Water stained the chrome finish.. make sure to dry off after use</li>
            <li>Aesthetics aside, the brush works well and after several months of use is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shaving brush based on the product information, pure badger, hand knotted in the Isle of Man, etc.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks, I find that it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>Shaving with a straight razor, brush and soap in the mirror of a dingy motel room with a lit cigarette still in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it seems like a reasonable brush besides the discrepancies.</li>
            <li>It performs very well and seems to be very durable.</li>
            <li>It seems to rough up the skin a bit more and lift the hair.</li>
            <li>colors.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers my face fast by holding a ton of cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Handle get real hot.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>I am still amazed at the quality of this brush when I look at how much it costs.  </li>
            <li>The chrome handle is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>I did get cut allot at first because my face needed to get used to the new razor and blade.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets, it still looks great, gets the job done, and is softer than I had expected it to be initially.</li>
            <li>Lost a few bristles/hairs for the first couple of shaves, but seems OK now.</li>
            <li>I do clean it on a regular basis and  use a holder for it and the razor.</li>
            <li>It did say in the initial description when purchasing it that it had a mixture of both Boar Hair with a variety of Badger Hair of Silver Tip, Super and Pure Badger Hair.</li>
            <li>My first 100% Badger Hair Brush was actually to soft anyway</li>
            <li>Ruffed up the new knot with a towel like drying my own hair and used a low setting hair drier to dry the knot</li>
            <li>Although the Muhle Silvertip is 5x more expensive, it is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Dear Friends:  Colonel Conk is a highly respected name in shaving items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommand.</li>
            <li>decided to bite the bullet and purchase a high end</li>
            <li>If you assume from just the title that is is 100% pure badger hair with no other hair mixed in the knot that would not be true.</li>
            <li>Bought this as my first time brush, couldn&#x27;t find anything at a reasonable price that would ship to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was labelled as made in the UK on the box, but on the internal bag it was labelled as made in Taiwan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it pretty much every day for the last six months</li>
            <li>so I shampooed again with my normal shampoo a couple of times.</li>
            <li>sure to rinse out your brush after use, and it is highly recommended that you use a brush stand, to allow your brush to drain &amp; dry properly.</li>
            <li>Will spend a bit more next time; just limited with what will ship to Australia.</li>
            <li>My skin has since gotten used to my new razor and I no longer have problems with cuts and rashes caused from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>you see it stand out like any new brush.</li>
            <li>Handle is surprisingly heavy but gives a nice solid feel to the brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>the first month several hairs came out.</li>
            <li>I soaked it in a dish soap vinegar and hot water mix rinsing it several times and the smell was still beyond my tolerance.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that this badger brush comes in a chrome finish, it a fusion of the old and new worlds.</li>
            <li>This brush is a huge upgrade and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Recently I came across this Evernice Progress Model 247 Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Chrome Handle.</li>
            <li>I am going to say the Pure Badger shaving brush is meant to say a mixed hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li>little advice dont use the free supersaver shipping they wait 5 days to actualy ship your item</li>
            <li>Sturdy but soft bristles</li>
            <li>However, when it arrived, it was actually marked as \\&quot;made in Taiwan.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Overall, he really likes it.</li>
            <li>and it is too soft to spread either well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very inclined to believe I was smelling the actual beaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a well-made brush that feels solid in my hand and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>I made the switch from the old multi-blade razors &amp; spray-can foam to a safety-razor and shave soap.</li>
            <li>and I like the mixture of the soft and the medium boar hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great medium to soft brush.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li>I have purchased at least three more to give as gifts to family since.  </li>
            <li>There are definitely more expensive brushes and they may be worth the price but this shaving brush works for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Might just be my technique but have a difficult time getting a good lather.</li>
            <li>The right brush does make all the difference in wet shaving.</li>
            <li>The only reason for giving it 4 stars is due to the brush that I had before was cheap</li>
            <li>other fun thing to do is to try different shaving creams.</li>
            <li>May try a silver tip badger next, the hairs to to be a bit soft to get the brush loaded well.</li>
            <li>A little stinky at first but foams shaving soap well and doesn&#x27;t shed like my last brush.</li>
            <li>of the hairs did pull out the first few times I used it, but it seems to have stopped, and it wasn&#x27;t even close to enough that you can tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be aware it is a solid metal handle and is quite heavy.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it will slow way down after 2 to 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got out the old barber shears, scissors and started to trim the knot rounder while removing loose hair as I went by hand and tweezers.</li>
            <li>It does require a large drip stand and will not fit in the smaller,average stand.</li>
            <li>Soft brush tends to be hard to control the lather as it spreads fibers out too much and does not load lather well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;Brush is great, never had brisels fall</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I also have a very comfortable Best Badger Brush.  </li>
            <li> best part is that I am saving money and getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> - they work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s good about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> The handle has a good and substantial weight to it; the user will know he is using a product of good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it arrived in time and in good shape -</li>
            <li> This is a really good compromise.</li>
            <li> It has some weight to it which is good, good handle for use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> It is that good.  </li>
            <li> good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush has a nice weight, makes a nice lather, great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> A very worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> It is shedding more hair than my dog!</li>
            <li> now i&#x27;m happy to report it is holding up well and doing a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> cause it looks nice and</li>
            <li> This brush has some heft alot heavier than i thought but its nice.</li>
            <li> Badger hair is the best for shaving brushes but not everyone wants to spend $150 for one.</li>
            <li> Art of shaving lavender soap, Escali deluxe razor stand.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, get this brush, a nice Merkur 180, and get shaving the way you were meant to...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a high end brush, so cannot compare it to the ones priced over $50, but this is perfect for my purpose.</li>
            <li> the brush has good weight and comfortable in hand .</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first 3 months until it started shedding a lot, now at a rate of around 20 bristles each time I shave that tickle my face like hell.</li>
            <li> first brush....very happy with it....researched for hours on what to get</li>
            <li> Like I said before, maybe just need to brush up my technique a bit more, or try softer soaps.</li>
            <li> and we men sure do love</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this shaving</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for a better quality brush and we bought this one.  </li>
            <li> That said, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> brush.&lt;br /&gt;Still shedding a bit more</li>
            <li> so well that you can use it for three or four passes without touching the soap or cream again.</li>
            <li> : Well, I have had this brush for over 6 months now and it has yet to lose any more bristles.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a cheap starter brush and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Because of this, my face is becoming smoother and my shaves have become more enjoyable and closer</li>
            <li> Both of them are a nice, clean silver and the brush  </li>
            <li> Firstly, this brush seems to be of good quality and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> The new brush seemed great.</li>
            <li> It had been used almost a year and was as attractive as a new brush.  </li>
            <li> Brushes like this easily cost 2 or 3 times more.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my face, handle is nice and heavy with a beautiful polished finish</li>
            <li> At first, I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my old brush, all my setup is chrome (razor, shaving bowl and brush stand) was happy to find a brush with chrome</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft on your skin but it whips up a great lather for shaving.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to work the shave soap that I had also purchased.</li>
            <li> After a very short period of use the brush becomes even more attractive.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an Amazon purchase, they make returns so easy and are so gracious about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2: It&#x27;s been a year and the brush is still going strong not losing bristles and looks and performs as it should.</li>
            <li> The knot is just beautiful but needed a bit of my personal touch with a scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is still holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> No stand came with the brush,but I alreadt had my own large stand.</li>
            <li> In addition to it being fun, it is also necessary to tweak a good thing and make it even better!</li>
            <li> I own a much cheaper brush for myself</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it had handle dimensions that fit a stand I wanted to use.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so far so good</li>
            <li> so I dont know how it is to actually use, but it makes a very nice looking gift &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice looking and made from badger hair which is key for a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this nice high quality shaving brush and expect to be using it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> The bristles of the replacement brush are longer than the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve adjusted to using it but miss the quality of the original brush that cam with the set.</li>
            <li> It effortlessly yields a rich lather on the face.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was excited by the descriptions on this page, noting that the item was said to be hand-crafted on the Isle of Man.  </li>
            <li> can tell you that for the first time ever, I actually enjoy shaving!</li>
            <li> The brush holds water good and is not rough when applying, the hairs are not too flimsy with soap</li>
            <li> It smells clean.</li>
            <li> and I think (JMHO) that it&#x27;s a nice product that will deliver and will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those interested in wet shaving, and reluctant to spend $100 or more on a high-end brush, this is a great choice for the money.</li>
            <li> Good price for English shaving brush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still full</li>
            <li> The knot is very dense and the brush is fuller and much better at whipping up my shaving soap.</li>
            <li> yesterday, going back today.&lt;br /&gt;Opened it, gave it a good rinse and loaded it with Proraso and whipped it up</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the soap gets a nice lather. .</li>
            <li> The handle is solid with good heft.  </li>
            <li> Boar odor was neutralized by washing first in a strong pet shampoo a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great brush.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Got much better lather the first time I used this brush and got a much smother shave.</li>
            <li> I currently own a Super Badger with Pewter Handle that came from the same craftsmen on the Isle of Man.  </li>
            <li> Its heavy, b/c the handle is metal, but it feels like great quality.  </li>
            <li> and it does fit the stand very well.</li>
            <li> Much of the badger hair that is loaded into the finest handmade brushes available comes from China.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush, the chrome seem&#x27;s to have a yellow tint, almost like Nichole plating.</li>
            <li> it is quite soft and handsome.  </li>
            <li> The hairs are longer and more flexible than my old brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s soft and durable.  </li>
            <li> Dosent hold as much water as i expected but vary happy regardless.</li>
            <li> but if you do go right ahead and save some money</li>
            <li> It feels quite heavy in hand, fits perfectly in the deluxe stainless steel stand I bought at the same time, and the bristles feel soft.</li>
            <li> The weight of the brush feels great in my hand; it&#x27;s very heavy considering the size.</li>
            <li> I am still learning how to shave and I am also having fun trying the many different blades that are out there.</li>
            <li> It came in a generic white box, and is made in Taiwan, but I am happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> This will extend its life considerably, which a fine product like this deserves.</li>
            <li> As far as the brush itself, for the price, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is also necessary, because I am finding that the most expensive blade doesn&#x27;t always get you the best results!</li>
            <li> and I am also noticing that my facial skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s my first brush</li>
            <li> I will probably go back to my Escali brush as it does a better job of spreading the soap or cream withouit using a lot of either.</li>
            <li> Several washings with pet shampoo did the trick and time, I&#x27;m sure will finish the job.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will last for years.</li>
            <li> more slippery than my wooden handle</li>
            <li> My brush was so nice that I gave it to a family member that I had introduced to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> ;-)  in my life..  </li>
            <li> Weight is heavy and feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that not only am I enjoying the experience of a warm brush on my face to prep my whiskers before shaving, but I&#x27;m getting a better shave than I ever got with pro-glide for far less money!</li>
            <li> The bristle seem a little more prickly than my old boars hair brush against my skin, but in a good way, I think it is due to the denser knot that the bristles seem to stand up more and seem stiffer.</li>
            <li> I started with a cheap pure badger and almost gave up on soaps, then got this brush and WOW!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the difference in quality compared to the original brush that came with the set.  </li>
            <li> Used my Taylor of Old Bond Street Rose Shaving Cream and that finally did it.</li>
            <li> Cheap, Hairs Fallout Left &amp; Right.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because of the positive reviews, and the chrome polished handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t really know that I am qualified to say anything.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to the classic</li>
            <li> Water stained the chrome finish.. make sure to dry off after use</li>
            <li> Aesthetics aside, the brush works well and after several months of use is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaving brush based on the product information, pure badger, hand knotted in the Isle of Man, etc.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.  </li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks, I find that it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a straight razor, brush and soap in the mirror of a dingy motel room with a lit cigarette still in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it seems like a reasonable brush besides the discrepancies.</li>
            <li> It performs very well and seems to be very durable.</li>
            <li> It seems to rough up the skin a bit more and lift the hair.</li>
            <li> colors.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers my face fast by holding a ton of cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Handle get real hot.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> I am still amazed at the quality of this brush when I look at how much it costs.  </li>
            <li> The chrome handle is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> I did get cut allot at first because my face needed to get used to the new razor and blade.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets, it still looks great, gets the job done, and is softer than I had expected it to be initially.</li>
            <li> Lost a few bristles/hairs for the first couple of shaves, but seems OK now.</li>
            <li> I do clean it on a regular basis and  use a holder for it and the razor.</li>
            <li> It did say in the initial description when purchasing it that it had a mixture of both Boar Hair with a variety of Badger Hair of Silver Tip, Super and Pure Badger Hair.</li>
            <li> My first 100% Badger Hair Brush was actually to soft anyway</li>
            <li> Ruffed up the new knot with a towel like drying my own hair and used a low setting hair drier to dry the knot</li>
            <li> Although the Muhle Silvertip is 5x more expensive, it is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Dear Friends:  Colonel Conk is a highly respected name in shaving items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommand.</li>
            <li> decided to bite the bullet and purchase a high end</li>
            <li> If you assume from just the title that is is 100% pure badger hair with no other hair mixed in the knot that would not be true.</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first time brush, couldn&#x27;t find anything at a reasonable price that would ship to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was labelled as made in the UK on the box, but on the internal bag it was labelled as made in Taiwan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it pretty much every day for the last six months</li>
            <li> so I shampooed again with my normal shampoo a couple of times.</li>
            <li> sure to rinse out your brush after use, and it is highly recommended that you use a brush stand, to allow your brush to drain &amp; dry properly.</li>
            <li> Will spend a bit more next time; just limited with what will ship to Australia.</li>
            <li> My skin has since gotten used to my new razor and I no longer have problems with cuts and rashes caused from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> you see it stand out like any new brush.</li>
            <li> Handle is surprisingly heavy but gives a nice solid feel to the brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> the first month several hairs came out.</li>
            <li> I soaked it in a dish soap vinegar and hot water mix rinsing it several times and the smell was still beyond my tolerance.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that this badger brush comes in a chrome finish, it a fusion of the old and new worlds.</li>
            <li> This brush is a huge upgrade and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Recently I came across this Evernice Progress Model 247 Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Chrome Handle.</li>
            <li> I am going to say the Pure Badger shaving brush is meant to say a mixed hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> little advice dont use the free supersaver shipping they wait 5 days to actualy ship your item</li>
            <li> Sturdy but soft bristles</li>
            <li> However, when it arrived, it was actually marked as \\&quot;made in Taiwan.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Overall, he really likes it.</li>
            <li> and it is too soft to spread either well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very inclined to believe I was smelling the actual beaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a well-made brush that feels solid in my hand and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> I made the switch from the old multi-blade razors &amp; spray-can foam to a safety-razor and shave soap.</li>
            <li> and I like the mixture of the soft and the medium boar hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great medium to soft brush.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least three more to give as gifts to family since.  </li>
            <li> There are definitely more expensive brushes and they may be worth the price but this shaving brush works for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Might just be my technique but have a difficult time getting a good lather.</li>
            <li> The right brush does make all the difference in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The only reason for giving it 4 stars is due to the brush that I had before was cheap</li>
            <li> other fun thing to do is to try different shaving creams.</li>
            <li> May try a silver tip badger next, the hairs to to be a bit soft to get the brush loaded well.</li>
            <li> A little stinky at first but foams shaving soap well and doesn&#x27;t shed like my last brush.</li>
            <li> of the hairs did pull out the first few times I used it, but it seems to have stopped, and it wasn&#x27;t even close to enough that you can tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be aware it is a solid metal handle and is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it will slow way down after 2 to 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got out the old barber shears, scissors and started to trim the knot rounder while removing loose hair as I went by hand and tweezers.</li>
            <li> It does require a large drip stand and will not fit in the smaller,average stand.</li>
            <li> Soft brush tends to be hard to control the lather as it spreads fibers out too much and does not load lather well.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there appears to be some brass in the handle and thus it has a slight golden hue, making it stand out from my Merkur Classic Razor and stand.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived it appeared as in the picture, but was in packaging that in no way indicated it was a Co. Conk product nor indicated that it was badger except a small bar-code sticker as an afterthought on the bottom which leads me to believe that it isn&#x27;t really badger.</li>
            <li> Looking for a hefty, inexpensive, long lasting badger brush-you found it.</li>
            <li> New brush is still a little course on my face.  </li>
            <li> The brush smelled a bit odd at first, but after a few uses, has no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> This is one heavy brush, and for  being boar&#x27;s hair, it has soft bristles.</li>
            <li> It had a strange, animal smell to it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still shedding bristles like a long haired dog in summer.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are long and the brush has a nice,hefty feel to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great brush to mix with in the bowl or your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Holds lots of heat for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pro&#x27;s out way the cons by a long shot</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush daily now for the last few weeks and have lost only 2 or 3 bristles.</li>
            <li> some other lesser made brushes as you apply your soap.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a DE razor and decided to upgrade my other shaving accoutrements.</li>
            <li> All in all, I cannot find a single flaw with this</li>
            <li> Pull out all the loose hair everywhere</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the badger smell was VERY strong and quite sickening at first.</li>
            <li> When wet, it flops around like an over loaded paint brush.  </li>
            <li> : Minus 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Just like no real person would ever do.  </li>
            <li> Still a wet animal hair</li>
            <li> Its solid metal handle gives it a sturdy hefty feel and the bristles feel quite soft even before they are fully broken in.</li>
            <li> though I do like a thick lather, no hairs have come out so far</li>
            <li> No batteries, no multi-blades, funky gel strips, mach this or that, and seemingly dull all the time... just plain simple shaving like our grandfathers did in the old days.</li>
            <li> I will need to replace it and will certainly not get this one again.</li>
            <li> This brush was certainly not made in Taiwan.  </li>
            <li> I recently foundanother brush that I am anxious to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I decided to go with this due to the stand that I ordered was chrome and some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Check the other Amazon listings.</li>
            <li> but the brush hair quality was not there when looking at other product or were out of my price range.</li>
            <li> and I had a very hard time finding a &#x27;badger hair&#x27; brush with a &#x27;chrome handle&#x27; to boot for such a low price.</li>
            <li> the weight feels right although a little difficult to hold on to with soapy hands.</li>
            <li> When its wet, its a floppy mess.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, despite the good care I put.</li>
            <li> The brush hair is very soft; unfortunately, the its too soft and has a hard time making lather.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are thick and luxurious, and do not appear to fall out with regular use.</li>
            <li> the other reviewer who stated, \\&quot;little course on my face...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little too soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> If I ever wear this brush out, I&#x27;ll try one a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> The smell disappeared after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The shedding of bristles stopped after a few weeks</li>
            <li> After a few months of use it still looses a hair here and there</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it lasts for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Chrome handle is heavy and well built.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon has mixed up products or is selling this item under false (fraudulent?)</li>
            <li> Handle is Too heavy and brush is too thin, floppy, when wet</li>
            <li> It seemed to shed very little, no more than a hair or 2 every shave.</li>
            <li> I like the weight and feel of this brush but not sure I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> No more animal hair odor.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Each day I shave the brush loses a dozen or so bristles.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe the smell as unpleasant, just strange.  </li>
            <li> Wet it once again and trimmed the base by removing the short and crazy hairs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> I also got cut because the ingrown hairs that made my skin uneven also made it impossible for me to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> the weird bit:  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after three months use the bristles are disappearing as well.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was disappointed -</li>
            <li> &#x27;s what&#x27;s bad about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is still dropping hair here and there at the moment.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t look bad yet</li>
            <li> , bad odor too.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> cleaned it all up and tried again, and again the brush leached whatever its dyed with, turning the cream nasty brown.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sturdy but soft bristles - they work up a good lather.  Handle is surprisingly heavy but gives a nice solid feel to the brush.  Good price for English shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The brush smelled a bit odd at first, but after a few uses, has no noticeable smell. The bristles do not seem to be falling out at all. Weight is heavy and feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> As far as the brush itself, for the price, it&#x27;s fantastic. The weight of the brush feels great in my hand; it&#x27;s very heavy considering the size. I also like the fact that this badger brush comes in a chrome finish, it a fusion of the old and new worlds. The badger hairs won&#x27;t come off strand by strand like some other lesser made brushes as you apply your soap. All in all, I cannot find a single flaw with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the other reviewer who stated, \\&quot;little course on my face...\\&quot; All brushes, just like everything else, have to go through a breaking in process,  Don&#x27;t worry, it will get softer with use and time.</li>
            <li> Dear Friends:  Colonel Conk is a highly respected name in shaving items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last Badger Brush was inherited from my father.  It was well used when I began using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;This New brush is still a little course on my face.  Hopefully it will improve with use?  The next brush I purchase will be more expensive.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my face, handle is nice and heavy with a beautiful polished finish and it&#x27;s made in the UK</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for the brush that came with the Colonel Conk set.  It&#x27;s a good brush for the price.  I was surprised at the difference in quality compared to the original brush that came with the set.  The bristles of the replacement brush are longer than the original. When wet, it flops around like an over loaded paint brush.  I&#x27;ve adjusted to using it but miss the quality of the original brush that cam with the set.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first 3 months until it started shedding a lot, now at a rate of around 20 bristles each time I shave that tickle my face like hell. Very disappointed, despite the good care I put. Going back to a Parker brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Shaving Brush almost 4 months ago. At first, I was very pleased with it. It replaced a brush I had purchased at the mall over 20 years ago and was showing its age. The new brush seemed great. It seemed to shed very little, no more than a hair or 2 every shave. Now it is shedding bunches of hair every shave, which actually interferes with shaving . I will need to replace it and will certainly not get this one again.</li>
            <li> Bought these, soap &amp; a pewter bowl as groomsmen gifts for my wedding. I own a much cheaper brush for myself so I dont know how it is to actually use, but it makes a very nice looking gift &amp; I was impressed with the weight.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my old brush, all my setup is chrome (razor, shaving bowl and brush stand) was happy to find a brush with chrome handle.&lt;br /&gt;Read review mentioning it has a \\&quot;Badger\\&quot; smell to it, and yes it does, but do go away after 5 or 6 use.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has a nice weight, makes a nice lather, great quality for the price. I highly recommand.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, the chrome seem&#x27;s to have a yellow tint, almost like Nichole plating. Might just be my technique but have a difficult time getting a good lather. May try a silver tip badger next, the hairs to to be a bit soft to get the brush loaded well. I started with a cheap pure badger and almost gave up on soaps, then got this brush and WOW! Got much better lather the first time I used this brush and got a much smother shave. The right brush does make all the difference in wet shaving. Like I said before, maybe just need to brush up my technique a bit more, or try softer soaps. But I gave it 4 stars any way cause it looks nice and the weight feels right although a little difficult to hold on to with soapy hands.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s good about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;1. The bristles are thick and luxurious, and do not appear to fall out with regular use. It effortlessly yields a rich lather on the face.&lt;br /&gt;2. The handle has a good and substantial weight to it; the user will know he is using a product of good quality. Also...it&#x27;s chrome and shiny - and we men sure do love chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s bad about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;1. Absolutely nothing. I could not be more pleased with this shaving implement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to rinse out your brush after use, and it is highly recommended that you use a brush stand, to allow your brush to drain &amp; dry properly. This will extend its life considerably, which a fine product like this deserves.</li>
            <li> I am yet to use this because I am waiting for my edwin jagger de89l to come, but it arrived before the estimated time. This brush has some heft alot heavier than i thought but its nice. little advice dont use the free supersaver shipping they wait 5 days to actualy ship your item and then a estimated 3 days to get to you after 3 days i switched to standard shipping for the razor so it arrives faster i dont know why i chose that method i have no patience but if you do go right ahead and save some money</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. There are definitely more expensive brushes and they may be worth the price but this shaving brush works for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A little too soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first month several hairs came out. This is not longer a problem and the amount of hair was one to two per shave. If I ever wear this brush out, I&#x27;ll try one a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it arrived in time and in good shape - it is quite soft and handsome.  I was excited by the descriptions on this page, noting that the item was said to be hand-crafted on the Isle of Man.  However, when it arrived, it was actually marked as \\&quot;made in Taiwan.\\&quot;  Needless to say, I was disappointed - I feel that I was misled by the product descriptions.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and wasn&#x27;t looking to spend a lot of money. This is the best value I have found in weight and softness of the brush.</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for a better quality brush and we bought this one.  He really likes it.  Its heavy, b/c the handle is metal, but it feels like great quality.  He also likes the metal b/c it won&#x27;t rot like some cheaper wood handles can. He likes the bristles too.  Overall, he really likes it.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It&#x27;s really soft on your skin but it whips up a great lather for shaving. Badger hair is the best for shaving brushes but not everyone wants to spend $150 for one. This is a really good compromise. Having never used a $150 brush I can&#x27;t say how it compares. But I definitely have no complaints about this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t really know that I am qualified to say anything. I can tell you that not only am I enjoying the experience of a warm brush on my face to prep my whiskers before shaving, but I&#x27;m getting a better shave than I ever got with pro-glide for far less money! I am still learning how to shave and I am also having fun trying the many different blades that are out there. This is also necessary, because I am finding that the most expensive blade doesn&#x27;t always get you the best results! This depends on your skin type, shaving methods and skill, shaving brush, shaving cream and of course the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is made of the best materials I understand and I had a very hard time finding a &#x27;badger hair&#x27; brush with a &#x27;chrome handle&#x27; to boot for such a low price. I can tell you that it makes my face feel great and I am also noticing that my facial skin has never looked or felt better. I cannot tell you the reason why, but it could be that DE razors don&#x27;t give you ingrown hairs. It could also be the brush massaging my whiskers to stand up for a close shave or maybe it&#x27;s something else..?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that for the first time ever, I actually enjoy shaving! I did get cut allot at first because my face needed to get used to the new razor and blade. I also got cut because the ingrown hairs that made my skin uneven also made it impossible for me to get a close shave. My skin has since gotten used to my new razor and I no longer have problems with cuts and rashes caused from ingrown hairs. Because of this, my face is becoming smoother and my shaves have become more enjoyable and closer than I ever dreamed possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other fun thing to do is to try different shaving creams. In addition to it being fun, it is also necessary to tweak a good thing and make it even better! I have only been using a DE razor for about a month and I can&#x27;t wait to try different creams, blades and brushes. I recently foundanother brush that I am anxious to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I am saving money and getting a better shave. If you are using a pro glide power like me and you change the cartridge weekly, you are spending $200 a year on blades. For that same amount you can buy a Merkur 34C Razor, 100 Feather Blades, Chrome Badger Shaving Brush, Shaving Mug of choice, Col Conk Chrome Razor &amp; Brush Stand, Assorted Shaving Creams, Soaps, Aftershaves and still have money left over! The rest is money in your pocket...</li>
            <li> does the job.&lt;br /&gt;good weight.&lt;br /&gt;soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s my first brush so im not an expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far so good</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first time brush, couldn&#x27;t find anything at a reasonable price that would ship to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was labelled as made in the UK on the box, but on the internal bag it was labelled as made in Taiwan. Lost a few bristles/hairs for the first couple of shaves, but seems OK now. Will spend a bit more next time; just limited with what will ship to Australia.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because of the positive reviews, and the chrome polished handle. With my polished Parker 99R and polished Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, it makes an impressive display. This is one heavy brush, and for  being boar&#x27;s hair, it has soft bristles. Contrary to what I have read on shaving websites, it has no animal odor at all. It smells clean. It came in a generic white box, and is made in Taiwan, but I am happy with this brush. Thank you.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks, I find that it lathers really well. Too bad it is still dropping hair here and there at the moment. Other than that, great brush.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Minus 2 stars. It is shedding more hair than my dog!</li>
            <li> Because its too soft...used it with a soap and a creme and it is too soft to spread either well. I will probably go back to my Escali brush as it does a better job of spreading the soap or cream withouit using a lot of either. Soft brush tends to be hard to control the lather as it spreads fibers out too much and does not load lather well.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a well made brush. My only complaint was that the badger smell was VERY strong and quite sickening at first. I soaked it in a dish soap vinegar and hot water mix rinsing it several times and the smell was still beyond my tolerance. Several washings with pet shampoo did the trick and time, I&#x27;m sure will finish the job. That said, I love this brush. I should be rinsed and hanged after use like any brush and I&#x27;m sure it will last for years. Its solid metal handle gives it a sturdy hefty feel and the bristles feel quite soft even before they are fully broken in.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this brush seems to be of good quality and gets the job done.  The hairs are longer and more flexible than my old brush. I&#x27;m not snooty enough to critique the finer points of &amp;#34;brush puts soap on face&amp;#34;.  I just use the soap and brush because it makes me feel like some hard-boiled detective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the hairs did pull out the first few times I used it, but it seems to have stopped, and it wasn&#x27;t even close to enough that you can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the weird bit:  It had a strange, animal smell to it.  I&#x27;m very inclined to believe I was smelling the actual beaver.  I wouldn&#x27;t describe the smell as unpleasant, just strange.  I&#x27;ve had about 6 shaves with it now and the smell is almost entirely gone, and might even just be my imagination by now.  I suppose this helps verify that it actually is badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would almost recommend you buy it on the offhand chance yours comes with bonus aroma as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hard-boiled detective: Wearing a wife-beater, suspenders hanging below his waist. Shaving with a straight razor, brush and soap in the mirror of a dingy motel room with a lit cigarette still in his mouth.  And then the guy just wipes the extra soap of his face with a hand towel rather than rinse his face. Just like no real person would ever do.  You totally want to buy this brush now, don&#x27;t you?)</li>
            <li> I like the weight and feel of this brush but not sure I would recommend it.  I&#x27;ve used it pretty much every day for the last six months and it&#x27;s still shedding bristles like a long haired dog in summer.  Other than that I really like it.</li>
            <li> Handle is Too heavy and brush is too thin, floppy, when wet</li>
            <li> I received a brush for x-mas along with a razor and bowl, and after I used the brush a few times I decided to get a up grade from the cheap brush Van Der Hagen with the green handle. I decided to go with this due to the stand that I ordered was chrome and some of the reviews. It has some weight to it which is good, good handle for use and it was easy to work the shave soap that I had also purchased. Art of shaving lavender soap, Escali deluxe razor stand. The brush holds water good and is not rough when applying, the hairs are not too flimsy with soap though I do like a thick lather, no hairs have come out so far and it does fit the stand very well. The only reason for giving it 4 stars is due to the brush that I had before was cheap and you could see the glue on the hairs so it was a big improvement. I would purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up date. 11-22-13. The brush is still holding up just fine. It has not corroded, flaked, or hairs fallen out. I do clean it on a regular basis and  use a holder for it and the razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaving brush based on the product information, pure badger, hand knotted in the Isle of Man, etc. When it arrived it appeared as in the picture, but was in packaging that in no way indicated it was a Co. Conk product nor indicated that it was badger except a small bar-code sticker as an afterthought on the bottom which leads me to believe that it isn&#x27;t really badger. The box was printed with &#x27;manufactured in the UK&#x27; but the plastic bag inside holding the brush was labeled &#x27;made in Taiwan&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon has mixed up products or is selling this item under false (fraudulent?) pretenses, but I returned it to see if actually I would get something that matches the Product Features or Description. I gave it two stars because it seems like a reasonable brush besides the discrepancies.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made brush that feels solid in my hand and gentle on my face.  My only complaint is that there appears to be some brass in the handle and thus it has a slight golden hue, making it stand out from my Merkur Classic Razor and stand.  Both of them are a nice, clean silver and the brush  looks like a mismatch.  Aesthetics aside, the brush works well and after several months of use is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Very good value for the price. The bristles are long and the brush has a nice,hefty feel to it. It does require a large drip stand and will not fit in the smaller,average stand. No stand came with the brush,but I alreadt had my own large stand. Brushes like this easily cost 2 or 3 times more.Check the other Amazon listings. Looking for a hefty, inexpensive, long lasting badger brush-you found it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s soft and durable.  It&#x27;s very nice looking and made from badger hair which is key for a shaving brush.  I&#x27;ve never owned a high end brush, so cannot compare it to the ones priced over $50, but this is perfect for my purpose.</li>
            <li> first brush....very happy with it....researched for hours on what to get and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase...colonel conk is very good brand from my understanding.</li>
            <li> I received this brush as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and began using it immediately.  As others mentioned it does come with a \\&quot;Made in Taiwan\\&quot; sticker and does have the badger smell.  The smell disappeared after a few uses.  Unfortunately, after three months use the bristles are disappearing as well.  Each day I shave the brush loses a dozen or so bristles.  The brush doesn&#x27;t look bad yet but I don&#x27;t see it lasting a year at this rate.  Out of the box the brush looks and feels great but it doesn&#x27;t seem built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year update: The shedding of bristles stopped after a few weeks and I am quite happy with this brush.  It performs very well and seems to be very durable.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush! He has 2 and it&#x27;s a great brush for a great price! We received it in a timely matter.</li>
            <li> After using this brush regularly for about a year now i&#x27;m happy to report it is holding up well and doing a fantastic job. I have no regrets, it still looks great, gets the job done, and is softer than I had expected it to be initially. For those interested in wet shaving, and reluctant to spend $100 or more on a high-end brush, this is a great choice for the money. I made the switch from the old multi-blade razors &amp; spray-can foam to a safety-razor and shave soap. I purchased this brush at that time. Do yourself a favor, get this brush, a nice Merkur 180, and get shaving the way you were meant to... No batteries, no multi-blades, funky gel strips, mach this or that, and seemingly dull all the time... just plain simple shaving like our grandfathers did in the old days. They knew a thing or two about this, and if you are reading this, you are probably on that same path of rediscovering the joys of wetshaving.</li>
            <li> It works and looks great.  After a few months of use it still looses a hair here and there but it&#x27;s still full so I&#x27;m hoping it lasts for a few years.  It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I Have wanted a matching brush to match a set I have but the brush hair quality was not there when looking at other product or were out of my price range. Recently I came across this Evernice Progress Model 247 Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Chrome Handle. I am going to say the Pure Badger shaving brush is meant to say a mixed hair shaving brush. If you assume from just the title that is is 100% pure badger hair with no other hair mixed in the knot that would not be true. It did say in the initial description when purchasing it that it had a mixture of both Boar Hair with a variety of Badger Hair of Silver Tip, Super and Pure Badger Hair. My first 100% Badger Hair Brush was actually to soft anyway and I like the mixture of the soft and the medium boar hair. It seems to rough up the skin a bit more and lift the hair. The knot is just beautiful but needed a bit of my personal touch with a scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ODOR Treatment;&lt;br /&gt;1. Boar odor was neutralized by washing first in a strong pet shampoo a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pull out all the loose hair everywhere you see it stand out like any new brush. Don&#x27;t be fooled they shed at 1st and through their life.&lt;br /&gt;3. Still had a boar odor so I shampooed again with my normal shampoo a couple of times. Still a wet animal hair smell.&lt;br /&gt;4. Used my Taylor of Old Bond Street Rose Shaving Cream and that finally did it. No more animal hair odor.&lt;br /&gt;5. Ruffed up the new knot with a towel like drying my own hair and used a low setting hair drier to dry the knot completely.&lt;br /&gt;6. Got out the old barber shears, scissors and started to trim the knot rounder while removing loose hair as I went by hand and tweezers. (remember once gone it&#x27;s gone so be easy)&lt;br /&gt;7. Wet it once again and trimmed the base by removing the short and crazy hairs.&lt;br /&gt; Finally You Are DONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;Great medium to soft brush.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful combination of animal hair that exfoliates your skin and pores.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful handle.&lt;br /&gt;Ascetically beautiful combo of hair colors.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers my face fast by holding a ton of cream.&lt;br /&gt;Great brush to mix with in the bowl or your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Holds lots of heat for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;Handle get real hot.&lt;br /&gt;Much more slippery than my wooden handle brush.&lt;br /&gt;Still shedding a bit more but I am sure it will slow way down after 2 to 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion;&lt;br /&gt;The pro&#x27;s out way the cons by a long shot and I think (JMHO) that it&#x27;s a nice product that will deliver and will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Baslow</li>
            <li> This is an extraordinarily beautiful badger brush.  After a very short period of use the brush becomes even more attractive.  It dries well and has a beautiful shape when it \\&quot;blooms\\&quot;.  I had perfect lather and great comfort.  This brush loads so well that you can use it for three or four passes without touching the soap or cream again. This brush was certainly not made in Taiwan.  My brush was so nice that I gave it to a family member that I had introduced to wet shaving.  It had been used almost a year and was as attractive as a new brush.  There was no noticeable wear on the bristles or the weighty chrome handle.  I have purchased at least three more to give as gifts to family since.  I currently own a Super Badger with Pewter Handle that came from the same craftsmen on the Isle of Man.  I also have a very comfortable Best Badger Brush.  One was more expensive and one was cheaper than the brush being reviewed.  I would trade either brush for the Model 247.  It is that good.  One thing that may bear mentioning though, after reading some of the worries that customers have over this brush&#x27;s origin.  Much of the badger hair that is loaded into the finest handmade brushes available comes from China.  You will find that Manchurian Badger Hair for instance is quite coveted and is imported by the makers of some of the finest badger brushes you can buy.  I am still amazed at the quality of this brush when I look at how much it costs.  The quality is superb.  Vulfix makes good brushes and the quality is excellent.  Vulfix also owns Simpsons if that makes a difference in your opinion of their quality control.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to the classic razor!&lt;br /&gt;Brush is great, never had brisels fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful gift!</li>
            <li> I have been using a shaving brush and soap puck for years, but had always purchased a drug store cheapo  boar bristle brush which constantly lost bristles and had to be replaced every year or so. I have been using this brush daily now for the last few weeks and have lost only 2 or 3 bristles. The knot is very dense and the brush is fuller and much better at whipping up my shaving soap. The bristle seem a little more prickly than my old boars hair brush against my skin, but in a good way, I think it is due to the denser knot that the bristles seem to stand up more and seem stiffer. I recently switched to a DE razor and decided to upgrade my other shaving accoutrements. This brush is a huge upgrade and seems like it will last a long time. Just be aware it is a solid metal handle and is quite heavy. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this nice high quality shaving brush and expect to be using it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Well, I have had this brush for over 6 months now and it has yet to lose any more bristles. It has been used daily and looks and performs as well as the day it was purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: It&#x27;s been a year and the brush is still going strong not losing bristles and looks and performs as it should. A very worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> A little stinky at first but foams shaving soap well and doesn&#x27;t shed like my last brush. Chrome handle is heavy and well built.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it had handle dimensions that fit a stand I wanted to use.&lt;br /&gt;Came yesterday, going back today.&lt;br /&gt;Opened it, gave it a good rinse and loaded it with Proraso and whipped it up; the snow white Proraso turned brown, i&#x27;d never seen that before.&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned it all up and tried again, and again the brush leached whatever its dyed with, turning the cream nasty brown., bad odor too.&lt;br /&gt;Glad it&#x27;s an Amazon purchase, they make returns so easy and are so gracious about it.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a cheap starter brush and the difference is amazing. It does have some extra weight but I like the sturdiness. The bristles are soft and the soap gets a nice lather. . Would definitely buy again if I had to redo</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and I think it will be perfect for the shaving snob ;-)  in my life..  It feels quite heavy in hand, fits perfectly in the deluxe stainless steel stand I bought at the same time, and the bristles feel soft.</li>
            <li> Water stained the chrome finish.. make sure to dry off after use</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  The handle is solid with good heft.  The brush hair is very soft; unfortunately, the its too soft and has a hard time making lather.  When its wet, its a floppy mess.  The hair needs to be stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to bite the bullet and purchase a high end Muhle Silvertip brush.  Although the Muhle Silvertip is 5x more expensive, it is so much better.  Ultimately, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The chrome handle is nice and heavy. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The bristles are very soft. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product. good quality.&lt;br /&gt;vbhlfkd hjdbfg bghb sbgsn b strbg gjbggkk ergg erbfgie arvebg ghh ovrhobkb  aerh fh</li>
            <li> the brush has good weight and comfortable in hand . Dosent hold as much water as i expected but vary happy regardless.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this quality brush! It was a gift, one that he continues to express pleasure in using. Great product.</li>
            <li> Cheap, Hairs Fallout Left &amp; Right.</li>
