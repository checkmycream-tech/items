            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this perfume</li>
            <li>The product was in perfect conditions - Overall everything was okay</li>
            <li>this is far better than the price this could easily be a $65 value as it smells just as good as any designer fragrance out there !</li>
            <li>This is such a great product my wife absolutely loves this and its a great deal</li>
            <li>Said it smell fresh, not overly overpowering and a fine complement after a refreshing shower.</li>
            <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li>I bought \\&quot;Hot\\&quot;&#x27;s counterpart \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; for myself and loved it so much and thought I&#x27;d try Hot as well since it is supposedly also unisex.  </li>
            <li>Original product</li>
            <li>Hot by United Colors of Benetton for Women is a great fragrance for anyone looking for a nice light scent, nothing overpowering or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PERFUME IS A WONDERFUL FRANGANCIA DELICATE SO SOFT</li>
            <li>Luckily I thought it smelled trendy enough that my sister would like it</li>
            <li>It is actually sweeter than I thought it would be, for the name, &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; was a bit misleading to me, but I knew I liked another Benetton scent, and thought I would try this one out.  </li>
            <li>I think it smells like a freshly showered guy</li>
            <li>Nice  lady perfume, great smelling and moderate to long  lasting</li>
            <li>Hot is perhaps even better, but only for women..</li>
            <li>the fragrance remains not previously used the original</li>
            <li>Very affordable</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well packaged.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Its very affordable, lasts long and it has a rich fragrance..</li>
            <li>I love that it is so cheap and smells so expensive.  </li>
            <li>The items seem to be old stocks..??!</li>
            <li>Hot is feminine (definitely not unisex)..</li>
            <li>Cold is great for either.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already.</li>
            <li>Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?</li>
            <li>thanks, every things it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;i wish visit your products next time.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>Trust me, both Hot and Cold smell fantastic..</li>

            <li> Trust me, both Hot and Cold smell fantastic..</li>
            <li> A little sweet and a little spicy.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last long</li>
            <li> I loved, get well and met my expectations, I had to be afraid because I thought that would come fragrance broken but protected him very well packaged.</li>
            <li> After a sniff I definately discovered while Cold might be unisex, Hot is very feminine.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit too long for me to get it, I was expecting it before.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a sweet or heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, she loves it and wears it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Grateful for the product only they sent a product with the poor and broken lid which makes it go to waste when using</li>
            <li> i like this perfume alot and would have given it 5 stars, however, it&#x27;s difficultly with the sprayer and the perfume gets on your hands.</li>
            <li> You wont go wrong with this...</li>
            <li> Es bueno pero prefiero el cold, el proveedor se porto  muy bien con la calidad del producto, recomendado al 100%</li>
            <li> This inexpensive cologne smells very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed, and the worst part: It can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>

            <li> Hadn&#x27;t ever smelled or seen this before, but I like it a lot!  It is actually sweeter than I thought it would be, for the name, &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; was a bit misleading to me, but I knew I liked another Benetton scent, and thought I would try this one out.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very affordable and she liked it. Said it smell fresh, not overly overpowering and a fine complement after a refreshing shower. I guess that will make it 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> The items seem to be old stocks..??! If I&#x27;ll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already. How do we prevent these scenarios? Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?</li>

            <li> Grand daughters favorite perfume......&lt;br /&gt;I get her a bottle every Christmas....she was happy!!!!</li>
            <li> Great! Just what I expected to receive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfum for about 12 years, and this one I just got doesn&#x27;t smell like the others. I&#x27;m really disappointed, and the worst part: It can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> I bought \\&quot;Hot\\&quot;&#x27;s counterpart \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; for myself and loved it so much and thought I&#x27;d try Hot as well since it is supposedly also unisex.

I must admit it smells good, very rich and floral.  I love that it is so cheap and smells so expensive.  I always recommend testing a perfume before buying it (they smell differently on all skin types) but at this price I couldn&#x27;t resist and I won&#x27;t critique you if you don&#x27;t either.  Trust me, both Hot and Cold smell fantastic.. Hot is perhaps even better, but only for women.. Cold is great for either.</li>
            <li> Nice strong smell but the spicy smell could cause you a nice migraine if you suffer from them .(some specific smells can cause them ,for me there some in this perfume)</li>

            <li> I love this perfume! This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased. I always get compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s not a sweet or heavy fragrance. I think it smells like a freshly showered guy and that&#x27;s why so many people connect with the scent.</li>
