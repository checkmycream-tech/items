            <li>Great brush, soft hair.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used  and leave my hair shinier and more full.  </li>

            <li>These are fantastic brushes.  </li>

            <li>I bought the medium, large and extra large Bio Ionic Blue Wave Nano-Ionic brushes to replace my favorite Bio Ionic brush that I had bought back in 2005.</li>

            <li>Live the brush.</li>

            <li> Careful with the measurements of these brushes, this one is really small, only for very short hair.</li>

            <li> Great brush, soft hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  I had the larger brush, got my hair cut short and needed the smaller brush.  Just perfect!</li>
            <li> I just love this brush.  I learned about this square brush from my hairdresser.  It works perfect with my &amp;#34;BOB&amp;#34;.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Careful with the measurements of these brushes, this one is really small, only for very short hair.</li>
            <li> I love it. It really grabs the hair.  I am going to buy another one.</li>
            <li> The medium brush is smaller than I thought it would be, but works great on my short hair!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is this brush or my new Bio Ionic hair dryer, but my hair is very happy.  I have fine hair, and I can really get the volume using this brush and my new dryer.</li>
            <li> Live the brush. Wish it was delivered faster.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush, so gentle on my hair, let&#x27;s me wrap the hair around it, pull it out and no tangles!  I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of them...that&#x27;s how much I love it!</li>
            <li> The first brush which effectively handles and dries my abundant fine hair. Terrific!</li>
            <li> I Hate the square feature, my hair is fine, and it leaves distinct square prints in my hair. Might work better for someone with coarser hair...</li>
            <li> The brush is great but really runs big.  I have the small size that I got as a gift and love how it works.  I have short hair but not super short and I like fullness and volume so thought I would try the medium size.  Way too big and doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hairstyle.  I still like the small one better.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic brushes.  I have naturally wavy hair and I use them both to straighten and to curl my hair, along with my hairdryer, depending on the style I am trying to achieve that day.  They work SO much better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used  and leave my hair shinier and more full.  Love them!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush and recommended by my hair designer.</li>
            <li> I bought the medium, large and extra large Bio Ionic Blue Wave Nano-Ionic brushes to replace my favorite Bio Ionic brush that I had bought back in 2005. Yes, it lasted nearly 10 years and I remember paying $50 for it back then from a hair salon. I had bought other brands of similar brushes and never found a suitable replacement until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes work even better! The square shape does add fullness and also makes it easier to grab my hair for styling. My hair comes out silky soft and full of volume. I love these brushes and will never stray to another brand again!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this brush. Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and is easy to use! A little smaller than I think a medium size brush would be and I have fairly short hair.  I love the square shape!</li>
            <li> Hair does not stay in brushes.  Just falls out and I can&#x27;t get any traction.</li>
            <li> Product is great! Exactly as described! Great quality! Great price! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> My daughter in law recommended this brush to me.  It&#x27;s the best brush i&#x27;ve ever used.  So glad I bought it.</li>
