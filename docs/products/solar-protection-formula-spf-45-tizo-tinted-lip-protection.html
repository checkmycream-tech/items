    <ol>
            <li>Best lip protectant I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Well, this product was perfect and will always be with me when I am in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m allergic to any chemical sunscreens, this is a perfect choice.</li>
            <li>And best, it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes when in the water!</li>
            <li>Order was Perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip protection out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and had one episode of skin cancer, which was removed.</li>
            <li>I also loved the face sunscreen with a bit of tint, again no sunburn!  </li>
            <li>Liptect has done a great job of keeping my lips from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that isn&#x27;t affected by heat as is most SPF formula lip protection.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I was in the Philippines for a month in 100 degree weather most of the day.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Very useful!</li>
            <li>it was very pricey ($12.50 right now on Amazon) and none were very good.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lip treatment ever and it gives a slight tint color like a gloss.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, but does have a light tan color that shows on your lips.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but my lips feel much softer and love the silkines feeling when I put it on.</li>
            <li>My lips blister quickly when exposed to sun.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t run, and is very  water resistant, making it  great for outside activities.</li>
            <li>Liked the facial SPF so decided to try lip product.</li>
            <li>Used only the Solar Protection Formula on a recent trip to Aruba and loved the feel on my lips and sun protection!  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste and not like your typical Banana Boat lip balm.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was how emollient it was.</li>
            <li>I think this is to keep it from being white like so many zinc sticks are.</li>
            <li>is more healthy looking and pink in its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore the product is not just protecting but also rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>I found it pretty water proof from sweating but you should reapply it after eating (again pretty normal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about 4 years and introduced it to many friends  who have become daily users.</li>
            <li>I tried pretty much every lip balm before I bought this one b/c</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based on the reviews and am so very thankful I did.  </li>
            <li>I spend hours in the water (and reapply every couple of hours) and this worked very well.</li>
            <li>but it was very chalky and drying as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing (applies just like a burts bee&#x27;s lip balm), doesn&#x27;t make my lips burn or blister in reaction to the sunscreen components, and isn&#x27;t a chalky white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been out in the sun much</li>
            <li>Lip sunscreens available in drug stores just weren&#x27;t enough protection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of an off-setting beige color when you unscrew the cap, but it doesn&#x27;t show up too much on the lips.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and even put tinfoil over my lips.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me I had lip damage, doubtless from so much sun exposure on bicycle rides in Iowa, and prescribed this particular brand of sun protection sunscreen for my lips.</li>
            <li>After discovering that I was becoming allergic to chemical sunscreens, I had to toss all my lipsticks, lip balms, and other makeup.  </li>
            <li>Cotz was a little better since it was tinted a brown</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny (I&#x27;m older and only wish it had been invented years ago).</li>
            <li>Moisturizer and foundation made with physical sunscreen (either titanium or zinc oxide) were easy enough to find, but finding a lip balm was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>My lips have become very sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>In the long run, it&#x27;s not any pricier than  buying a new lipstick, and it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You must use it every 60-80 minutes (when you are in the Sun) but that is pretty standard for any lip balm....</li>
            <li>Protects my lips from sun damage and is clear when applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and protects lips well from sun and wind.  </li>
            <li>Completely protected my lips on vacation at the beach.</li>
            <li>Works great, a little more expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li>It is the SAME color as normal lips after applied so it does not appear like lipstick...</li>
            <li>I could barely even smear the Solar Sense face/lip zinc stick on my lips</li>
            <li>actually it makes your lips look natural</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have really a taste nor do I get an allergic reaction in my throat like others have done if they PABA and other irritants in it.</li>
            <li>I take medication that makes me extra sensitive to the sun and already have a dry lip issue no matter what time of the year.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and had one episode of skin cancer, which was removed. My dermatologist told me I had lip damage, doubtless from so much sun exposure on bicycle rides in Iowa, and prescribed this particular brand of sun protection sunscreen for my lips. I bought two and began sharing with my daughter. Then my husband, who is fairer than I am, began having sun damaged skin keratoses burned off his face and scalp. So I bought him some. Now I&#x27;ve just ordered one for everyone in my family. There&#x27;ll be one in every Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip treatment ever and it gives a slight tint color like a gloss. Love love love it</li>
            <li> Best lip protectant I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used them all.  First thing I noticed was how emollient it was.</li>
            <li> My lips blister quickly when exposed to sun.  I ordered this product based on the reviews and am so very thankful I did.  I spent a week in the sun in Florida and this product protected my lips.  I have tried many other products and even put tinfoil over my lips.  Well, this product was perfect and will always be with me when I am in the sun.  Yay!  No more Mr. Tin Man lips.  :)</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant to me taste, like old-fashioned Sea and Ski suntan lotion. It&#x27;s also not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this due to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients and thought it wouldn&#x27;t protect my lips. I spend hours in the water (and reapply every couple of hours) and this worked very well. It has a pleasant taste and not like your typical Banana Boat lip balm.</li>
            <li> After discovering that I was becoming allergic to chemical sunscreens, I had to toss all my lipsticks, lip balms, and other makeup.  Moisturizer and foundation made with physical sunscreen (either titanium or zinc oxide) were easy enough to find, but finding a lip balm was a nightmare.  I tried pretty much every lip balm before I bought this one b/c it was very pricey ($12.50 right now on Amazon) and none were very good.  Badger turned my lips an opaque white and dried them out terribly.  Cotz was a little better since it was tinted a brown but it was very chalky and drying as well.  I could barely even smear the Solar Sense face/lip zinc stick on my lips it was so dry and coarse.  The list goes on, but I finally decided to just buy the Liptect brand because I was becoming increasingly desperate.  I&#x27;m really glad I did b/c this stuff has been God sent!  It&#x27;s very moisturizing (applies just like a burts bee&#x27;s lip balm), doesn&#x27;t make my lips burn or blister in reaction to the sunscreen components, and isn&#x27;t a chalky white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this under my lipstick every day, and reapply probably as often as I&#x27;d need to reapply lipstick (after eating, drinking, etc).  Recently I went to Disneyland and was walking around in the blazing sun all morning and afternoon and didn&#x27;t have any issues.  The Liptect kept my lips moisturized, protected from the sun, and didn&#x27;t interfere or mix with my lipstick color.  Even though it&#x27;s pricey, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it.  In the long run, it&#x27;s not any pricier than  buying a new lipstick, and it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I take medication that makes me extra sensitive to the sun and already have a dry lip issue no matter what time of the year. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have really a taste nor do I get an allergic reaction in my throat like others have done if they PABA and other irritants in it. I have to reapply often though. Not as thick as others which do the same job but would buy this again because it works.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m allergic to any chemical sunscreens, this is a perfect choice. Protects my lips from sun damage and is clear when applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and protects lips well from sun and wind.  I also loved the face sunscreen with a bit of tint, again no sunburn!  And best, it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes when in the water!</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this I haven&#x27;t gotten any cold sores. It goes on smoothly, but does have a light tan color that shows on your lips. You can rub it mostly in but will still leave a small tan color behind. I think this is to keep it from being white like so many zinc sticks are.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been out in the sun much but my lips feel much softer and love the silkines feeling when I put it on.</li>
            <li> My lips have become very sensitive to the sun.  Lip sunscreens available in drug stores just weren&#x27;t enough protection.  Liptect has done a great job of keeping my lips from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. I was in the Philippines for a month in 100 degree weather most of the day. I used this all day and my lips got burned very badly.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any but has that awful aftertaste... not as bad as some but still definitely there. I use it as backup only and use one that doesn&#x27;t taste so awful as first choice.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am a fair-skinned redhead who regularly gets cold sores.  Used only the Solar Protection Formula on a recent trip to Aruba and loved the feel on my lips and sun protection!  Never got any taste from it and remained cold sore-free, which was the true test!  Looks cocoa-color in the container but I used it over lipstick and alone and never noticed any adverse color on my lips.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement in my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is more healthy looking and pink in its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore the product is not just protecting but also rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> Liked the facial SPF so decided to try lip product. I was not disappointed. Helps a lot to keep lips moist.</li>
            <li> Completely protected my lips on vacation at the beach. Love it. Will definitely be ordering this again, and again, and again, and again!!!!!</li>
            <li> never even thought about my lips when I&#x27;m in the sun but I have to now and this was recommended by my dr.</li>
            <li> Order was Perfect. This is the best lip protection out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out in the sun constantly. Was using regular lip balm and still my lips were showing signs of serious Sun Damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. It is not clear in color...solid in stick form and not a cream or paste. It is the SAME color as normal lips after applied so it does not appear like lipstick...actually it makes your lips look natural (I&#x27;m a male who did not want a lip balm that looked like lipstick when it was on my lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must use it every 60-80 minutes (when you are in the Sun) but that is pretty standard for any lip balm....I found it pretty water proof from sweating but you should reapply it after eating (again pretty normal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is not cheap (not your bees wax stick for $1.99) but when it comes to Lip Cancer, sores or chapping from the Sun it is worth every penny (I&#x27;m older and only wish it had been invented years ago). I bought the 1st one from my Doctor. It was a few dollars cheaper from her than on Amazon but by the time you factor in gas, your personal time going to the doctors office in a high rise, parking fee, etc (could not find it in Walgreens, CVS, etc)...so I went to Amazon and got several (arrived in 2 days..BRAVO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t miss with this stuff....like I said:  It Works !</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Product as described.</li>
            <li> It does not moisturizes the lips.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that isn&#x27;t affected by heat as is most SPF formula lip protection.  This means I can carry it around in my pocket and can leave it in my car.  Very useful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about 4 years and introduced it to many friends  who have become daily users. This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t run, and is very  water resistant, making it  great for outside activities.</li>
            <li> This does prevent my lips from getting burned.  It&#x27;s sort of an off-setting beige color when you unscrew the cap, but it doesn&#x27;t show up too much on the lips.  I put it on every morning before a long walk with the dog.</li>
            <li> We like this product and recommend it. Works great, a little more expensive than other brands. We would order this again.</li>
