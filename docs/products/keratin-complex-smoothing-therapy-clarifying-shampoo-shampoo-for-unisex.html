            <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t lather very well, so I have to use more to get all my hair.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>worth it every penny</li>
            <li>This really does strip everything out from my hair and make it really clean.</li>
            <li>I use this before using the smooting treatment, it really gets your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>Ok I used this shampoo for the 1st time last night on my 4yo after the 3 day wait on her Keratin smoothing treatment.</li>
            <li>To get great results with the Coppola Keratin Complex Treatment you MUST use the the Coppola Clarifying Shampoo.</li>
            <li>To get great results with the Coppola Keratin Complex Treatment you MUST use the the Coppola Clarifying Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It took way more than should be necessary even to feel like I could get it around to all of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I felt like I died &amp; went to heaven....</li>
            <li>think I have to search more before the next purchase.</li>
            <li>If you are doing a Coppola Keratin Blowout Express, this is a must-have the first step.</li>
            <li>no more waves just nice smooth shiny straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Definitely helps if you&#x27;re familiar with the process and have patience!</li>
            <li>I was an avid user of Coppola&#x27;s Keratin Smoothing Treatment until I read that it too has a large amount if formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li>though- your hair will be really brittle after using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it worked very well in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recomend it, it does really work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking the unofficial internet version is less potent than the the salon brand.</li>
            <li>I can tell by only the first use how much cleaner her hair feels.</li>
            <li>Love it, but it&#x27;s not for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>It will all last for 20 treatments, so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>THis is the claryfying shampoo that must be used prior to having the Coppola Keratin process done, it works exactly as it is supposed to, you cannot have a Keratin process w/o this step.</li>
            <li>This is an essential first step before you apply the Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have natural (no relaxer, color or perm) 4b hair type.</li>

            <li> Ok I used this shampoo for the 1st time last night on my 4yo after the 3 day wait on her Keratin smoothing treatment. I really love this shampoo, and it smells really good.

I&#x27;m going tho miss it to be honest.</li>
            <li> Nutrogina works the same as this product and smell great.  However, with that said the product works as promised.</li>

            <li> This is the shampoo that my hairdresser uses in the salon before my keratain treatments.  Love it, but it&#x27;s not for everyday use.  Only use it before keratin treatments or for really deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Smell is awful like poison. I threw it in the trash, I couldn&#x27;t stand the scent. Youdont have to use this for keratin.you can use any clarifying shampoo. I use suave or tresemme before and it works fine.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing. My mother loved it</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this item. I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with or not, but the texture of the shampoo is WAY too watery and I know keratin shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, but this quality was HORRIBLE.  It took way more than should be necessary even to feel like I could get it around to all of my hair.  I think I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> Please see the extensive proof cited below about how this company has knowingly put customers at risk.  The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products. Please do not purchase Coppola product until you at least look at this link.

            <li> The smoothing therapy lasted me for almost 6 months and I really liked my hair texture.  I have been using this product over 3 years.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Keratin Complex Natural Smoothing Treatment. After doing the natural smoothing treatment my hair is feeling awesome and flattens quickly! :)</li>
            <li> you need this for kerating complex smoothing treatment, so you have to buy it if you plan on doing the treatment. these products seem expensive, but hairdressers ask around $350 for 1 treatment, and you spend around $250 if you buy this shampoo for preparation, the keratin treatment, shampoo and conditioner for follow up. It will all last for 20 treatments, so it is worth it. If your hair is damaged and full of split ends, this makes a RADICAL difference, at least it does for my hair. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Worked just like when my stylist does it! Definitely helps if you&#x27;re familiar with the process and have patience!</li>
            <li> This product was used on my hair at a salon and was amazing.  However when I ordered it here and used it myself the results were not anything like at the salon.  It seemed thinner and did not well at all.</li>
            <li> The product is very good.  it worked very well in my hair.  I have used it couple of times already. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair look nice! I have a wave hair but kind of frizzy. But now my hair look nice and it so easy for just blow out with my finger. I dont even need use a hairbrush. I would recomend it, it does really work for me.</li>
            <li> This clarifying shampoo MUST be used before applying a Keratin Complex treatment. It is designed to raise your hair&#x27;s PH and open the cuticle to receive the treatment. An ordinary clarifying shampoo will not do this. If you need a clarifying shampoo for anything else, consider Suave brand to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love all the line of coppola products. I use this one to clean my hair before applying keratin to it. It cleanses it great. And opens the follicles perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this before using the smooting treatment, it really gets your hair clean.  Your hair even feels different after you shampoo, it&#x27;s not for everyday use, I would think it would be to harsh!</li>
            <li> ...clarifies. I have prematurely grey hair - color by God - that looks beautiful until product build up turns it yellowish. This takes it out. Love it when you get what you think you are paying for.</li>
            <li> I have been using Coppola Smoothing therapy for about 2 yrs now..it is the best straightening product out there.  The first time I used it I felt like I died &amp; went to heaven....no more waves just nice smooth shiny straight hair.  Would not use any other product!!</li>
            <li> It has been 5 months which I used this product and just now I think I need to reapply it again. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it every penny, this is the 3rd time I used it. The only concern that I have is, I heard some where that these keratin product will cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;I think I have to search more before the next purchase.</li>
            <li> Used it once before the keratin treatment. Seemed to work well as it is intended to strip hair of all products in order to start treatment. Smell is not good  but like I said only had to use once.</li>
            <li> Treatment doesnt last as long as it used to. I&#x27;m thinking the unofficial internet version is less potent than the the salon brand.</li>
            <li> If you are doing a Coppola Keratin Blowout Express, this is a must-have the first step. Contrary to what some people will tell you, I&#x27;ll clarifying shampoos are not created equal. This one is designed to prep your hair specifically for the Coppola Keratin treatment. Follow the directions on the bottle and you will have a perfect blowout.</li>
            <li> This product does not get rid of &#x27;fizz&#x27; as its ad promises, and I am concerned that it is not good on colored hair! I may try WEN products next!</li>
            <li> Works well, but don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;ve already treated your hair with an expensive keratin treatment - it will strip it out.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair comes out ....I will let you know since summer is on  it&#x27;s way how long it lasts but for now it&#x27;s an awesome product. I have no complaints. :)</li>
