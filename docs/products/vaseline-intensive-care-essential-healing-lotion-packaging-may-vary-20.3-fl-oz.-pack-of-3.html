            <li>People keep telling me I smell good, and I&#x27;m not wearing any scent save</li>
            <li>It smells so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful smelling with fantastic moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good going on, and I found myself using a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin surprisingly well, compared to the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Vaseline, which just feels greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anybody that&#x27;s looking for a GOOD moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the quality...and the price..</li>
            <li>This feels great when it goes on and then even better after it is rubbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this cream!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and yes, I have sniffed my skin more than once because of it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I put this on every day after I shower and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>have no idea how effective it is, but it is a nice before bed treat.</li>
            <li>It smells nice going on and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>I do use it on my hands and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it is effective in keeping moisture on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer that makes my skin feel great and has a mild scent that I like.</li>
            <li>It smells better than most of them too!</li>
            <li>Smells nice and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily, and does a good job of moistening my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shea better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;d imagine in most places that would be the case also.</li>
            <li>I used to have many scars on my legs from mosquito bites that I couldn&#x27;t help but</li>
            <li>I decided to use Vaseline brand cocoa butter, I&#x27;m expecting some outstanding results with this brand.</li>
            <li>I would surely buy it again</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like buy 2 get one free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many stretch mark creams, lotions, oils that were made FOR stretch marks, and this Cocoa Butter is better than the rest.</li>
            <li>I love Cocoa Butter and Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>I have to re-apply the lotion every 5 to 10 minutes and most of the time my hands feel like I haven&#x27;t put on lotion on them at all.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to try this come summer after getting a sunburn where it has the cocoa butter in it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the aloe version better, but this one does have the edge for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve been better as a coconut scent...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite scent</li>
            <li>made the skin on both feel better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I can&#x27;t even begin to explain.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and love the feel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect the effectiveness of the product, but it looks more like suntan lotion that a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered for!!!</li>
            <li>I also got the super saver shipping so - even better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that this one works so great without me having to put forth extra effort!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for dry winters!</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth...and smells great.</li>
            <li>sort of warm and fuzzy opposed to fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotions not to strong and light on the skin.</li>
            <li>Once I saw the results I bought my own right away.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a decent lotion and is probably best for normal skin.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent of cocoa butter, if you are a someone who doesn&#x27;t like scented products this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>Very good skin conditioner, I have dry skin but not after applying this.</li>
            <li>I think any brand of cocoa butter is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also best to put on when you&#x27;re slightly damp after the shower.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample from Vaseline to try.  </li>
            <li>The cocoa scent isn&#x27;t at all over powering, it&#x27;s light and sticks with you.</li>
            <li>Flows on the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s light and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If so, this a great way to order something you need regularly.  </li>
            <li>Its good on your skin and makes your sking soft.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will tan and be able to keep the tan with using this right away.</li>
            <li>so I had to start putting baby oil on first and then layering the lotion on top.  </li>
            <li>, this is a great product if you want moisture all day long.</li>
            <li>something lighter and not so rich.</li>
            <li>It works best when mixed in a blender(we use an old one that leaked liquids).</li>
            <li>Perfect for winter too thick in summer</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able do prove that it really works like it says it do.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and used it throughout my entire pregnancy!</li>
            <li>The only benefit is it smells good</li>
            <li>This is a overall good product and would use it again.</li>
            <li>Since I found out that I was pregnant</li>
            <li>Cannot complain, items showed up at my door quick.  </li>
            <li>After many years of winter dry skin, I finally tried this cocoa butter and loved it!  </li>
            <li>New Favorite.</li>
            <li>and this is doing a wonderful job as making them less dry and looking much better without cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel like some others I have used and it absorbs quickly which is a big plus.  </li>
            <li>And it will take forever to go through a pack of 3, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Vaseline lotions are known to be lightweight, smooth, and with many different flavors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no scent or powerful smell, which is a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li>My 1 star rating is due to this fact and not because the lotion isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Vaseline moisturizers and have had good luck, so I thought I would try this.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>I love cocoa butter because it lightens up dark spots on my body and gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I will be using this product for as long as its selling because on top of that my skin is very moisturized and even has a pretty glow :-)    </li>
            <li>Loved this lotion when purchased in store but when bought on line it seemed watered down.</li>
            <li>However, there is a significant difference in the odor of the product, which is one of the main reasons I use it.</li>
            <li>I got the creams to give them to my mother and she really loves them, the cream absorves really quick and heals the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Imagine my happy surprise when I discovered this product is actually lotion, vitamin E, and petroleum jelly mixed together.</li>
            <li>Either way I love the auto replenish concept but will choose a different product.</li>
            <li>I called myself being cheap and bought a different kind of Vaseline lotion (the cucumber one) and I was wondering why I was ashy by the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars for its uses, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I bought a few of these because it feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am not crazy about moisturizers that have a strong scent and was critical of another Vaseline moisturizer because of that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Aveeno which is translucent and doesn&#x27;t last long, and now I realize that just because it&#x27;s unscented and natural does not mean it is the best choice for my skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty good price and enough lotion to last awhile.  </li>
            <li>I really like Vaseline products and have since I was very small many many years ago.  </li>
            <li>In fact,  my ex husband took it when we separated and he&#x27;s tried many types of lotions for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Never greasy, and keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Vaseline products have always been reliable and this Cocoa Radiant Body Lotion is truly outstanding for really dry skin which I have.</li>
            <li>The nice smell (which is more vanilla coconut than chocolate) eventually fades into a strange smell like sniffing a laptop that has been running for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Must shake before use which is unusual.  </li>
            <li>It came fast in the mail, and everything worked out well.</li>
            <li>and I figured for such a cheap price, why not?</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>When I have free time these days, the last thing I want to do is mix</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t really, really keep your skin moisturized though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have this condition!  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really works well</li>
            <li>I do use the product a couple of times each day and my skin is smoother and my feet are much softer,</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it feels very silky when applied.  </li>
            <li>I have used other lotions but this 1 outshines most of them.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily, but also not so light that your skin still feels dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a lotion that will help my skin all on its own.</li>
            <li>During the colder weather, this seemed to help with chapping on my legs that I normally get in winter.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly but keeps my skin moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li>This lotion is really nice and the only reason I gave it a four star was because I am not sure if I like the fragrance as much as the Aloe one.  </li>
            <li>least favorite part of the whole package is the color of the container.</li>
            <li>My skin is ridiculously soft, I feel like I have baby skin all over again!</li>
            <li>It did not always spread easily so it may have been due to age (no expiration date)or formula is different.</li>
            <li>so I only used them when I absolutely had no</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin soft and moistened all day.</li>
            <li>I never actually take the time to sit and review products, but after using this I felt very obliged.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had people ask me why I&#x27;m so soft</li>
            <li>and so far I haven&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Often it is much cheaper on Amazon than at the big box stores.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li>My daily lotion, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical and long lasting, for the money.</li>
            <li>After only 3 days, my skin is a normal color and nourished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really moisturizing for my dry skin</li>
            <li>What I like about the Vaseline brand is the smell is mild and it rubs on smoothly, not oily like others.    </li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and finally I have found a lotion that makes my skin feel and look like I am</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, so this was ok, but not strong enough.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and has a nice thickness (not to thick that it&#x27;s hard to spread, but not too thin that you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve applied lotion).</li>
            <li>One of few lotions I have used that has actually help combat my dry skin, and smooth stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I usually use it right after a shower.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a nice moisturizer that makes my skin feel great and has a mild scent that I like.</li>
            <li> It smells better than most of them too!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily, and does a good job of moistening my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shea better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d imagine in most places that would be the case also.</li>
            <li> I used to have many scars on my legs from mosquito bites that I couldn&#x27;t help but</li>
            <li> I decided to use Vaseline brand cocoa butter, I&#x27;m expecting some outstanding results with this brand.</li>
            <li> I would surely buy it again</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like buy 2 get one free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many stretch mark creams, lotions, oils that were made FOR stretch marks, and this Cocoa Butter is better than the rest.</li>
            <li> I love Cocoa Butter and Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I have to re-apply the lotion every 5 to 10 minutes and most of the time my hands feel like I haven&#x27;t put on lotion on them at all.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to try this come summer after getting a sunburn where it has the cocoa butter in it.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the aloe version better, but this one does have the edge for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been better as a coconut scent...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite scent</li>
            <li> made the skin on both feel better.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I can&#x27;t even begin to explain.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love the feel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect the effectiveness of the product, but it looks more like suntan lotion that a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered for!!!</li>
            <li> I also got the super saver shipping so - even better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that this one works so great without me having to put forth extra effort!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for dry winters!</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth...and smells great.</li>
            <li> sort of warm and fuzzy opposed to fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotions not to strong and light on the skin.</li>
            <li> Once I saw the results I bought my own right away.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a decent lotion and is probably best for normal skin.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent of cocoa butter, if you are a someone who doesn&#x27;t like scented products this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Very good skin conditioner, I have dry skin but not after applying this.</li>
            <li> I think any brand of cocoa butter is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also best to put on when you&#x27;re slightly damp after the shower.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Vaseline to try.  </li>
            <li> The cocoa scent isn&#x27;t at all over powering, it&#x27;s light and sticks with you.</li>
            <li> Flows on the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If so, this a great way to order something you need regularly.  </li>
            <li> Its good on your skin and makes your sking soft.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will tan and be able to keep the tan with using this right away.</li>
            <li> so I had to start putting baby oil on first and then layering the lotion on top.  </li>
            <li> , this is a great product if you want moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> something lighter and not so rich.</li>
            <li> It works best when mixed in a blender(we use an old one that leaked liquids).</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter too thick in summer</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able do prove that it really works like it says it do.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and used it throughout my entire pregnancy!</li>
            <li> The only benefit is it smells good</li>
            <li> This is a overall good product and would use it again.</li>
            <li> Since I found out that I was pregnant</li>
            <li> Cannot complain, items showed up at my door quick.  </li>
            <li> After many years of winter dry skin, I finally tried this cocoa butter and loved it!  </li>
            <li> New Favorite.</li>
            <li> and this is doing a wonderful job as making them less dry and looking much better without cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel like some others I have used and it absorbs quickly which is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> And it will take forever to go through a pack of 3, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Vaseline lotions are known to be lightweight, smooth, and with many different flavors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no scent or powerful smell, which is a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li> My 1 star rating is due to this fact and not because the lotion isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vaseline moisturizers and have had good luck, so I thought I would try this.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter because it lightens up dark spots on my body and gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for as long as its selling because on top of that my skin is very moisturized and even has a pretty glow :-)    </li>
            <li> Loved this lotion when purchased in store but when bought on line it seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> However, there is a significant difference in the odor of the product, which is one of the main reasons I use it.</li>
            <li> I got the creams to give them to my mother and she really loves them, the cream absorves really quick and heals the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Imagine my happy surprise when I discovered this product is actually lotion, vitamin E, and petroleum jelly mixed together.</li>
            <li> Either way I love the auto replenish concept but will choose a different product.</li>
            <li> I called myself being cheap and bought a different kind of Vaseline lotion (the cucumber one) and I was wondering why I was ashy by the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars for its uses, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these because it feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am not crazy about moisturizers that have a strong scent and was critical of another Vaseline moisturizer because of that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Aveeno which is translucent and doesn&#x27;t last long, and now I realize that just because it&#x27;s unscented and natural does not mean it is the best choice for my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty good price and enough lotion to last awhile.  </li>
            <li> I really like Vaseline products and have since I was very small many many years ago.  </li>
            <li> In fact,  my ex husband took it when we separated and he&#x27;s tried many types of lotions for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Never greasy, and keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Vaseline products have always been reliable and this Cocoa Radiant Body Lotion is truly outstanding for really dry skin which I have.</li>
            <li> The nice smell (which is more vanilla coconut than chocolate) eventually fades into a strange smell like sniffing a laptop that has been running for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Must shake before use which is unusual.  </li>
            <li> It came fast in the mail, and everything worked out well.</li>
            <li> and I figured for such a cheap price, why not?</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> When I have free time these days, the last thing I want to do is mix</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t really, really keep your skin moisturized though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have this condition!  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really works well</li>
            <li> I do use the product a couple of times each day and my skin is smoother and my feet are much softer,</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it feels very silky when applied.  </li>
            <li> I have used other lotions but this 1 outshines most of them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily, but also not so light that your skin still feels dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a lotion that will help my skin all on its own.</li>
            <li> During the colder weather, this seemed to help with chapping on my legs that I normally get in winter.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly but keeps my skin moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really nice and the only reason I gave it a four star was because I am not sure if I like the fragrance as much as the Aloe one.  </li>
            <li> least favorite part of the whole package is the color of the container.</li>
            <li> My skin is ridiculously soft, I feel like I have baby skin all over again!</li>
            <li> It did not always spread easily so it may have been due to age (no expiration date)or formula is different.</li>
            <li> so I only used them when I absolutely had no</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin soft and moistened all day.</li>
            <li> I never actually take the time to sit and review products, but after using this I felt very obliged.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people ask me why I&#x27;m so soft</li>
            <li> and so far I haven&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Often it is much cheaper on Amazon than at the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li> My daily lotion, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical and long lasting, for the money.</li>
            <li> After only 3 days, my skin is a normal color and nourished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing for my dry skin</li>
            <li> What I like about the Vaseline brand is the smell is mild and it rubs on smoothly, not oily like others.    </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and finally I have found a lotion that makes my skin feel and look like I am</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so this was ok, but not strong enough.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and has a nice thickness (not to thick that it&#x27;s hard to spread, but not too thin that you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve applied lotion).</li>
            <li> One of few lotions I have used that has actually help combat my dry skin, and smooth stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I usually use it right after a shower.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, dries fairly quick and it definitely long lasting on moisture.</li>
            <li> In the winter it&#x27;s normal to see lots of dandruff-like tiny flakes on the inside of my black leggings when I take them off.</li>
            <li> This may seem like a quibble, but I just finished my previous container and opened a new one (that I ordered from you).</li>
            <li> I use this product on my upper arms where I used to have bumps from dry skin ( keratosis pilaris) Paired with clearasil ultra daily face wash, it is now gone.</li>
            <li> The big test of any body lotion for me is how well and how long it lasts on my feet.</li>
            <li> My wife purchases an off brand of this same lotion for the kid&#x27;s dry skin.  </li>
            <li> knees and feet tend to get really dry at times and using this on a regular basis</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to judge how someone else would perceive smells, but I really like the smell of this,</li>
            <li> n supple all the day long.</li>
            <li> Vaseline, total moisture cocoa radiant is just as expected.</li>
            <li> Also, it lasts a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li> Even now, in the summertime my skin is so scaly and dry.</li>
            <li> I have really dry feet</li>
            <li> I would recommend this in your bathroom for your hands, or at your office desk when your hands are dry.</li>
            <li> Dry to severely dry find something else, like Eucerin.</li>
            <li> have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even considered dry!</li>
            <li> I broke out in a heavy red rash everywhere I applied it.</li>
            <li> Anything that can cause such a harsh allergic reaction shouldn&#x27;t be on the market.</li>
            <li> Not only did it immediately lighten the appearance of them, over time they got less and less visible</li>
            <li> During the cold seasons, I have super dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I would probably use just a small two beads if I was to use it outside of home like at work in an office.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the bundle package and shared with other family members.  </li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s not worth the money at all.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that this lotion smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> The lotion is slightly thick and definitely creamy.</li>
            <li> That is the recipe that was passed down to me, and the mix I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I typically have to create a combination of products, which is sometimes a pain.</li>
            <li> I buy it at Walmart or Target for less than it sells on here.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep on here.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is like sunscreen-it&#x27;s thin and you have to rub it in a lot because it leaves white streaks on you.</li>
            <li> I have consistently disliked Vaseline for years until trying their Cocoa Butter line.</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out, order a few of these for home, work, and small containers to keep in the car as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the richer side, slightly thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the explanation here,</li>
            <li> But once it soaks in it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, I&#x27;ve never liked the smell of lotions</li>
            <li> , at least I didn&#x27;t have to leave my house</li>
            <li> I find the chocolate scent awkward enough to avoid using this lotion on days when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat really thick</li>
            <li> my skin tends to get very dry in cold weathers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m shocked Unilever would use such a chemical in a skin care product.</li>
            <li> With the weather getting colder I noticed it getting worse</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> It does that thing where it dries into a clump in the pump, and it has a weird after-smell.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, Vaseline&#x27;s Cocoa Butter outdoes any of the others.     </li>
            <li> You have to rub your hands together once you pump it or it will be too cold on skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was so bad on my legs that it would flake when you scratched it.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wear lotion, I itch so bad</li>
            <li> and I am SHOCKED.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great body moisturizer that smells great. Doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily, but also not so light that your skin still feels dry. And it will take forever to go through a pack of 3, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price. One of my friends swears by it, and I can see why. It&#x27;s perfect for dry winters!</li>
            <li> me like smell cocoa like going to beach or resort.  is good lotion but me mistake cocoa and shea.  Shea better. next time i look for shea lotion. but smell good. not like lady smell but like vacation smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smells and feels divine on the skin. And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I like that quote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I&#x27;ve never liked the smell of lotions so I only used them when I absolutely had no choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until walking through the store and this bottle&#x27;s chocolate color caught my eye...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how effective it is, but it is a nice before bed treat.</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter too thick in summer and i&#x27;m San Diego so i&#x27;d imagine in most places that would be the case also.</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion when purchased in store but when bought on line it seemed watered down. It did not always spread easily so it may have been due to age (no expiration date)or formula is different. Must shake before use which is unusual.  Either way I love the auto replenish concept but will choose a different product.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It smells extremely great and moisturizes to a degree. Haven&#x27;t been able do prove that it really works like it says it do.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion.  I use it on both myself and my baby.  It smells nice going on and moisturizes well.  It has two drawbacks.  It does that thing where it dries into a clump in the pump, and it has a weird after-smell.  It took me awhile to figure it out, but I kept smelling my hands trying to figure out why they smelled like electronics.  The nice smell (which is more vanilla coconut than chocolate) eventually fades into a strange smell like sniffing a laptop that has been running for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this all over the place. I found it in BJ&#x27;s wholesale club website for a tiny bit cheaper, however I am not a member so I ordered it online, at least I didn&#x27;t have to leave my house LOL.    I love cocoa butter because it lightens up dark spots on my body and gives my skin a healthy glow. I used to have many scars on my legs from mosquito bites that I couldn&#x27;t help but scratch. I thought they would be there permanently. I used a cheaper brand of cocoa butter, Queen Helene, I believe it&#x27;s called and it literally cleared up all the marks leaving my legs looking flawless. I decided to use Vaseline brand cocoa butter, I&#x27;m expecting some outstanding results with this brand. I think any brand of cocoa butter is fine. What I like about the Vaseline brand is the smell is mild and it rubs on smoothly, not oily like others.    Also I&#x27;d like to point out, Neosporin (antibiotic ointment) has cocoa butter in its ingredients, hence why it prevents scarring of cuts and wounds.</li>
            <li> my skin tends to get very dry in cold weathers. However this body lotion keeps it well moisturised n supple all the day long. I have used other lotions but this 1 outshines most of them. I would surely buy it again</li>
            <li> It came fast in the mail, and everything worked out well. Would buy it again online, I saved money!!!</li>
            <li> I called myself being cheap and bought a different kind of Vaseline lotion (the cucumber one) and I was wondering why I was ashy by the middle of the day.  With the weather getting colder I noticed it getting worse so I had to start putting baby oil on first and then layering the lotion on top.  I found this lotion on sale at Target and started using it again and am proud to say that I don&#x27;t have to use both baby oil and lotion anymore.  Great product and it has also improved my feet whereas Gold Bond foot cream didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> My wife purchases an off brand of this same lotion for the kid&#x27;s dry skin.  I don&#x27;t like lotions because of how grease my hands feel.  After many years of winter dry skin, I finally tried this cocoa butter and loved it!  Once I figured that out, order a few of these for home, work, and small containers to keep in the car as well.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Vaseline to try.  I LOVE the smell of it.  My skin feels soft and smooth...and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Smells so good and used it throughout my entire pregnancy!</li>
            <li> Great value pack for the price, i have enough to last me for now</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these because it feels good on the skin.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Vaseline lotions are known to be lightweight, smooth, and with many different flavors. This Vaseline cocoa radiant body lotion provides good all day moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no scent or powerful smell, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the lightweight consistency of the lotion and the hint of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> one of the best lotions that I have ever used. Just once a day and it last for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is thick and creamy, dries fairly quick and it definitely long lasting on moisture. The cocoa scent isn&#x27;t at all over powering, it&#x27;s light and sticks with you. Great lotion for the winter months and I will definitely be a returning customer!</li>
            <li> I received Vaseline Total Moisture Cocoa Glow instead of Cocoa Radiant. This may seem like a quibble, but I just finished my previous container and opened a new one (that I ordered from you). I noticed the name was different but figured it was just a rebranding. However, there is a significant difference in the odor of the product, which is one of the main reasons I use it. Not sure of the explanation here, but now I have 3 bottles of something I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and light and not greasey. Flows on the skin smoothly. Keeps the skin soft and moistened all day.</li>
            <li> Very nice feeling lotion.  In fact,  my ex husband took it when we separated and he&#x27;s tried many types of lotions for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good lotion. Smells like cocoa butter. Kinda tastes like cocoa butter. Good price value.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this on, it was like my skin immediately thanked me! It is easily absorbed. My skin was so bad on my legs that it would flake when you scratched it. You have to rub your hands together once you pump it or it will be too cold on skin. After only 3 days, my skin is a normal color and nourished. It&#x27;s not even considered dry! I can&#x27;t believe what a great deal this was. It&#x27;s like buy 2 get one free! I also got the super saver shipping so - even better! It is bigger than I thought it would be. I gave one to my husband and one to my teenage daughter who&#x27;s always stealing my lotion. Can&#x27;t thank Vasseline enough.</li>
            <li> I never actually take the time to sit and review products, but after using this I felt very obliged.     I bought it because I&#x27;ve had stretch marks for years and I figured for such a cheap price, why not? I&#x27;ve used so many stretch mark creams, lotions, oils that were made FOR stretch marks, and this Cocoa Butter is better than the rest. Including Palmer&#x27;s.     Not only did it immediately lighten the appearance of them, over time they got less and less visible and I am SHOCKED. I will be using this product for as long as its selling because on top of that my skin is very moisturized and even has a pretty glow :-)    Needless to say, Vaseline&#x27;s Cocoa Butter outdoes any of the others.     P.S. It smells better than most of them too!</li>
            <li> I love Cocoa Butter and Shea Butter.  Its good on your skin and makes your sking soft.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin. In the winter it&#x27;s normal to see lots of dandruff-like tiny flakes on the inside of my black leggings when I take them off. Even now, in the summertime my skin is so scaly and dry. My parents happened to have this at their house and I tried it after a shower one day. Once I saw the results I bought my own right away.  It&#x27;s like a creamy lotion. I&#x27;ve always used Aveeno which is translucent and doesn&#x27;t last long, and now I realize that just because it&#x27;s unscented and natural does not mean it is the best choice for my skin. This stuff is like sunscreen-it&#x27;s thin and you have to rub it in a lot because it leaves white streaks on you. But once it soaks in it&#x27;s unbelievable. My skin is actually not just &amp;#34;not that dry&amp;#34; but actually silky and hydrated. I can&#x27;t believe that such an inexpensive product I picked up at the grocery store works so well. I hope I can always get my hands on it. I&#x27;d pay double for this stuff.</li>
            <li> The best body lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of cocoa butter lotion in a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells wonderful. People keep telling me I smell good, and I&#x27;m not wearing any scent save what&#x27;s in this lotion. It goes on smoothly and easily, and does a good job of moistening my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a case of heat rash on my upper body. I applied this lotion daily, and it soothed the bumps without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. It&#x27;s also best to put on when you&#x27;re slightly damp after the shower. It absorbs well and definately moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I got the creams to give them to my mother and she really loves them, the cream absorves really quick and heals the skin</li>
            <li> FYI the lotion I received was the Vaseline INTENSIVE CARE version NOT the richer TOTAL MOISTURE line. My 1 star rating is due to this fact and not because the lotion isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s a wonderful smelling with fantastic moisturizing properties. I ultimately prefer Vaseline Total Moisture DEEP CONDITIONING Cream. Using that version (after washing my hands in the winter months) I no longer need to use petroleum jelly with &amp;#34;gloves&amp;#34; on at night. The deep conditioning version has the consistency of body butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago and I&#x27;m not happy with it at all.  It doesn&#x27;t keep my hands or feet moisturized at all.  I have to re-apply the lotion every 5 to 10 minutes and most of the time my hands feel like I haven&#x27;t put on lotion on them at all. The only benefit is it smells good but It&#x27;s not worth the money at all.  I will have to look for another hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an odor. This is a overall good product and would use it again.</li>
            <li> I really like Vaseline products and have since I was very small many many years ago.  This lotion is really nice and the only reason I gave it a four star was because I am not sure if I like the fragrance as much as the Aloe one.  It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel like some others I have used and it absorbs quickly which is a big plus.  I have really dry feet and this is doing a wonderful job as making them less dry and looking much better without cracked skin.  It will be interesting to try this come summer after getting a sunburn where it has the cocoa butter in it.  Hopefully I will tan and be able to keep the tan with using this right away.</li>
            <li> Vaseline, total moisture cocoa radiant is just as expected. Softens skin while restoring color. Purchasing the 3 pack saved me some money.</li>
            <li> Great price, shipped way ahead of time, this is a great product if you want moisture all day long. Love it</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because of value. I give it 4 stars for its uses, it works pretty well. It&#x27;s value is the reason why I purchased this product. It&#x27;s economical and long lasting, for the money. You can&#x27;t beat getting 3 bottles in a pack.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and has a nice thickness (not to thick that it&#x27;s hard to spread, but not too thin that you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve applied lotion).</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and finally I have found a lotion that makes my skin feel and look like I am&lt;br /&gt;20 years younger.</li>
            <li> My skin is ridiculously soft, I feel like I have baby skin all over again! I put this on every day after I shower and the results are amazing. Your skin will glow and people will want to touch! haha I&#x27;ve had people ask me why I&#x27;m so soft and I never quite find a way of explaining it. The lotion itself smells delicious and yes, I have sniffed my skin more than once because of it! Will never ever stop using it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the quality...and the price..</li>
            <li> During the cold seasons, I have super dry skin. If I don&#x27;t wear lotion, I itch so bad, I just can&#x27;t bear it! I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a lotion that will help my skin all on its own. I typically have to create a combination of products, which is sometimes a pain. When I have free time these days, the last thing I want to do is mix lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my happy surprise when I discovered this product is actually lotion, vitamin E, and petroleum jelly mixed together. That is the recipe that was passed down to me, and the mix I&#x27;ve been using. Again, that is such a pain to make! It works best when mixed in a blender(we use an old one that leaked liquids). I&#x27;m thrilled that this one works so great without me having to put forth extra effort! I LOVE it! Plus, it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vaseline moisturizers and have had good luck, so I thought I would try this.  During the colder weather, this seemed to help with chapping on my legs that I normally get in winter.  Not crazy about the scent.  I like the smell of the aloe version better, but this one does have the edge for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Since I found out that I was pregnant I started using this lotion and so far I haven&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Vaseline lotion is a bit watery. I would recommend this in your bathroom for your hands, or at your office desk when your hands are dry. It won&#x27;t really, really keep your skin moisturized though. I used it on my body very shortly needed to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good going on, and I found myself using a lot of it. I think it&#x27;s a decent lotion and is probably best for normal skin. Dry to severely dry find something else, like Eucerin. I have very dry skin, so this was ok, but not strong enough. I do use it on my hands and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I would have to use this lotion when I am about to go to bed since its not something that can be used regularly through out the day.  It is somewhat really thick and I would probably use just a small two beads if I was to use it outside of home like at work in an office.  Anyway, it is effective in keeping moisture on the skin. Really an excellent product.  It does have a strong scent of cocoa butter, if you are a someone who doesn&#x27;t like scented products this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I have consistently disliked Vaseline for years until trying their Cocoa Butter line. The lotion is slightly thick and definitely creamy. It soaks into my skin surprisingly well, compared to the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Vaseline, which just feels greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this lotion smells like chocolate. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love chocolate but I don&#x27;t want to smell like the stuff. Would&#x27;ve been better as a coconut scent...something lighter and not so rich. I find the chocolate scent awkward enough to avoid using this lotion on days when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li> works great and at a great price on amazon. I purchased the bundle package and shared with other family members.  I love the smell of this lotions not to strong and light on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really, really great lotion. Smells nice and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong. I usually use it right after a shower. It&#x27;s really moisturizing for my dry skin and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It absorbs quickly but keeps my skin moisturized for a long time. One of my favorites!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. Often it is much cheaper on Amazon than at the big box stores. It does have a cocoa butter smell - but it&#x27;s light and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin? This is a great solution.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I got exactly what I ordered for!!! This has been the best lotion I have used for my skin.</li>
            <li> My daily lotion, I couldn&#x27;t live without it! This lotion works wonders, and smells great. Never greasy, and keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> The cream works great. It&#x27;s a little on the richer side, slightly thick. It smells like chocolate, which is always a plus. Also, it lasts a long time on the skin. As for service, I purchased my three-pack from PharmaPacks, and it arrived within a week. Good service, great quality, and excellent value.</li>
            <li> Heard about this on YouTube and it works! I use this product on my upper arms where I used to have bumps from dry skin ( keratosis pilaris) Paired with clearasil ultra daily face wash, it is now gone. Highly recommended if you have this condition!  Not my favorite scent, so I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li> One of few lotions I have used that has actually help combat my dry skin, and smooth stretch marks. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I use. I have been using this for over ten years now. Love it !!</li>
            <li> This Vaseline moisture care works great. I have come to expect this of all of their intensive care products. I would recommend any of them.</li>
            <li> This product contains styrene-butadiene, which is used in the production of synthetic rubber. It is also suspected of being a carcinogen. It is a known skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shocked Unilever would use such a chemical in a skin care product. I broke out in a heavy red rash everywhere I applied it. And it itched constantly. The itch and rash did not disappear for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product. Anything that can cause such a harsh allergic reaction shouldn&#x27;t be on the market.</li>
            <li> Cannot complain, items showed up at my door quick.  Pretty good price and enough lotion to last awhile.  Very good skin conditioner, I have dry skin but not after applying this.</li>
            <li> Yes , it did. I have bought this product before and I really like it. Therefore , I took advantage of this 3 pack. Very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer that makes my skin feel great and has a mild scent that I like. I am not crazy about moisturizers that have a strong scent and was critical of another Vaseline moisturizer because of that but I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin. This feels great when it goes on and then even better after it is rubbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My knees and feet tend to get really dry at times and using this on a regular basis made the skin on both feel better. Over time the dryness has started to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really works well and I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition and it&#x27;s a great value</li>
            <li> Thought I ordered the Aloe version of Vaseline Intensive care cream.  If so, this a great way to order something you need regularly.  I appreciate this service, as I have the items send to my son&#x27;s group home to keep his needs met.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I can&#x27;t even begin to explain. This moisturizer is incredible, honestly. I recommend this to anybody that&#x27;s looking for a GOOD moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love the feel. The big test of any body lotion for me is how well and how long it lasts on my feet. I do use the product a couple of times each day and my skin is smoother and my feet are much softer, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to judge how someone else would perceive smells, but I really like the smell of this, sort of warm and fuzzy opposed to fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite part of the whole package is the color of the container. It doesn&#x27;t affect the effectiveness of the product, but it looks more like suntan lotion that a moisturizer. That&#x27;s just a marketing thing, though.</li>
            <li> The Scent is great. Reminds me of sitting on a beach. It moisturizes very well and is not greasy at all. Will not be without this ever again. New Favorite.</li>
            <li> Vaseline products have always been reliable and this Cocoa Radiant Body Lotion is truly outstanding for really dry skin which I have.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great!  It is not greasy and it feels very silky when applied.  I love this lotion.  I will continue to buy this stuff.  FYI- The price is a little steep on here.  I buy it at Walmart or Target for less than it sells on here.</li>
