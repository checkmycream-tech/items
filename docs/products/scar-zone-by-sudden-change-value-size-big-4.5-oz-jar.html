    <ol>
            <li>Best scar diminishing product ever!</li>
            <li>Great product, got here on time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line: Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>This combination was amazing!</li>
            <li>i love this product, it is very good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s good at that</li>
            <li>so it has it good.</li>
            <li>Good Golly Miss Molly</li>
            <li>its good.</li>
            <li>Have been looking for this product and am very glad to have found it.  </li>
            <li>and you will be very pleased</li>
            <li>An amazing product that works just as well as mederma.</li>
            <li>Honestly I think my scars may have just needed some moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was able to see noticeable change within a week.</li>
            <li>The scar strips work much better as compared to this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better on someone else.</li>
            <li>I apply it on my acne scar on my face more than twice a day</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I guess it is better for newer scars not the ones I have.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a more convenient scar reducer, but not this time.</li>
            <li>I LOVE SCAR ZONE BECAUSE IT EARSES ALL MY SCARS</li>
            <li>It also makes me skin more brighter and healthier and more awake looking.</li>
            <li>this is a much better value.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I use it al over, basically as like a body lotion because I have so many scars.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to see what this combination will do, but it&#x27;s been working great and making real progress, which is way more than I can say for mederma or anything else I tried.</li>
            <li>It worked surprisingly well, it got rid of like 40% of my scars, which is pretty good, because i didn&#x27;t have that much scars to begin with, but yes i would recommend this</li>
            <li>If someone from Scar Zone (or anyone else, for that matter, who might happen to know) is reading this, please leave a comment on my review letting me know when this item may be available, or else where else I may be able to purchase this item.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST product I have ever used in preventing zits or in helping to very quickly get rid of new zits that pop up, it also stops zits from even fully developing.</li>
            <li>The formula is light, emollient and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could purchase some more right now, because I&#x27;m about to run out, and don&#x27;t want to resort to using my Mederma...</li>
            <li>The only good factor is that it contains zinc</li>
            <li>After months of this product I can only say its good for preventing acne on your face.</li>
            <li>After getting this, I really think it isn&#x27;t much more than sunblock.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>(but very noticeable) punctures on his top and bottom lip line.</li>
            <li>you very much!</li>
            <li>Acnefree had something pretty effective at one time that I had trouble finding again, and I think was kind of drying...</li>
            <li>These days it&#x27;s truly amazing to find a product that ACTUALLY works!</li>
            <li>Got two jars and used the first one in full with twice/daily applications.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The SPF is a nice addition to have, especially when using on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see a change right away</li>
            <li>You get way more bang for your buck with the big tub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s dealt with this frustration of trying a ton of products.</li>
            <li>Will not be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>and I religiously get my ScarZone 2 or more times a day.</li>
            <li>and it only gets better</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t testify for more recent scarring.</li>
            <li>She has told me that at first it seemed to be helping</li>
            <li>I noticed improvement within the first week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>I also use this as a face cream and any redness I had before diminished within the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and supple looking, and doesn&#x27;t cause my EXTREMELY sensitive skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>It really does work, and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a perfect product to put on your face before you go to sleep to help heal those ugly acne scars that you got over time, I STRONGLY suggest this product (and bio-oil).</li>
            <li>I used the whole jar and I don&#x27;t see any difference on my scar.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough, so why not try it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference after using this product for 4 months.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will help much.  </li>
            <li>It might take a bit of time to see the result but it is really working well for my kid.</li>
            <li>I think it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and works well</li>
            <li>IT SEEMS TO BE DOING VERY WELL,GOOD PRICE,</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Yes, you&#x27;re supposed to rub it in for 2-3 minutes, but you try to do that on a very fidgety&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is very product</li>
            <li>The scar did not look ANY better after months of other scar creams, silicon gels, and pure Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your consistent with putting it on at a certain time everyday</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this scar cream</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for an old scar I have so don&#x27;t expect it to do anything for ones you have had since childhood.</li>
            <li>It has sunscreen in it, so I just used it in place of a moisturizer, then went on with my normal make-up, or not.</li>
            <li>First, the price is so much cheaper than other scar diminishing products, yet I have read so many reviews about the other products and how they just have mineral oil and petroleum.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it every day, or sometimes only once a day, but my skin overall looks more even and healthy, and my scars are diminishing, slowly.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference after a month of religiously using it.</li>
            <li>The huge amount of cream which easily preserve and I don&#x27;t need to waste money on other scar removal products.</li>
            <li>I actually noticed a difference within that first week, but stick with it</li>
            <li>SO FAR ON A NEW SCAR</li>
            <li>Its a thick cream that rubs in clear after about a minute, has a very light scent, and is not greaser and won&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
            <li>I used this in combination with a microneedle roller to help me get rid of some old self harm scars on my legs.</li>
            <li>Product arrived just 5 days ago and my scars are almost completely faded and gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;8 year old boy.</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when I only have a small tube I automatically use it more sparingly... which seems less effective, and more expensive.</li>
            <li>that doest NOT mean yours will be the same).</li>
            <li>After so much researching and many failed attempts to reduce the redness and improve the texture of my scar, I wanted to try ScarZone.</li>
            <li>I have liked other scar reducing products, like Curad&#x27;s scar patches, which were super expensive last time I checked</li>
            <li>, I just rub until it is gone, but I&#x27;m not sure if I am making it less effective.</li>
            <li>ScarZone actually has silicon which is vital to help heal a scar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it to heal my back acne scars, and have seen a modest improvement in two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s about $15, and you can spend that on moisturizer easily... why not use something that improves your skin in a lasting way while you do skin maintenance?</li>
            <li>After the first day I could tell the scar was much less red and bumpy!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Son who had a pretty gnarly little dog bite on his mouth area with two tiny</li>

            <li> I bought this for my Son who had a pretty gnarly little dog bite on his mouth area with two tiny</li>
            <li> My scar is still very visible, and I have seen no more improvement than I believe I would have seen if I had just left the scar to fade over time.</li>
            <li> However I bought this product to help get rid of scars/dark spots from old zits, and well, it didn&#x27;t do too much on my dark spots...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying this as someone who once considered plastic surgery due to the texture of my skin, any time I looked in the mirror that was what I saw, and I no longer feels it&#x27;s a major issue, and we can credit that to two things 1.</li>
            <li> I bought the 5 oz jar because hoping it would work, I know that 5 oz&#x27;s would be enough for a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> IM ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE FINAL DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT IS ON MY NEW SCAR.</li>
            <li> they left black scars I had rought this rea months earlier just to try, so I used it on my scars several times a day</li>
            <li> My scar is 3 years old and very dark.</li>
            <li> my whole life - or at least as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> It has done wonders to my face and I&#x27;m not a frequent user like I should be.</li>
            <li> It has made the scar much less apparent.</li>
            <li> This product has softened scars I have that are dry and at times crack.  </li>
            <li> I applied 3 times a day, rubbed it in and let it dry.</li>
            <li> On my scabs/scars that are still healing, it seems to expedite the healing process and get the scab to dry up and fall off before I can pick at it</li>
            <li> This cream is not effective and highly overpriced.</li>
            <li> While it lasted a long time, the second jar goes into the trash because there was no benefit to be seen for all the trouble of applying and rubbing it in carefully twice every day.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> No real results yet.</li>
            <li> Get the 5 oz jar on Amazon if you plan on using it long term like I will, for any nicks, little scars, or discoloration.</li>
            <li> Oh and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> , this tub will last you forever if you have a small scar.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it lately, but that&#x27;s because I hadn&#x27;t seen the large tub in stores lately</li>
            <li> Active ingredients is sunblock.  </li>
            <li> Look at the active ingredients - this is basically just a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not a super cure all.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s already noticed some slight changes.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works and I am sooooo happy that my belly piercing is not all ugly because I didn&#x27;t want to take it out because of a stupid scar!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you are looking for a perfect product to put on your face before you go to sleep to help heal those ugly acne scars that you got over time, I STRONGLY suggest this product (and bio-oil). It has done wonders to my face and I&#x27;m not a frequent user like I should be.</li>
            <li> I started using Sacrzone years ago, due to acne scars and chicken pox scars. It has sunscreen in it, so I just used it in place of a moisturizer, then went on with my normal make-up, or not. I haven&#x27;t been using it lately, but that&#x27;s because I hadn&#x27;t seen the large tub in stores lately (I know, order it through Amazon...) and when I only have a small tube I automatically use it more sparingly... which seems less effective, and more expensive. You get way more bang for your buck with the big tub. I have liked other scar reducing products, like Curad&#x27;s scar patches, which were super expensive last time I checked (I used to buy them at Target for maybe twenty-something?) Acnefree had something pretty effective at one time that I had trouble finding again, and I think was kind of drying... I&#x27;d say this was the least complicated while still less expensive of the things I&#x27;ve tried. I mean, it&#x27;s about $15, and you can spend that on moisturizer easily... why not use something that improves your skin in a lasting way while you do skin maintenance? Big fan. Big, big fan. I&#x27;m saying this as someone who once considered plastic surgery due to the texture of my skin, any time I looked in the mirror that was what I saw, and I no longer feels it&#x27;s a major issue, and we can credit that to two things 1. God working on my heart. 2. Improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with a microneedle roller to help me get rid of some old self harm scars on my legs. I&#x27;ve tried mederma, silicon patches, eveeeerything. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s dealt with this frustration of trying a ton of products. This combination was amazing! I was able to see noticeable change within a week. It&#x27;s been a couple months and I&#x27;m excited to see what this combination will do, but it&#x27;s been working great and making real progress, which is way more than I can say for mederma or anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> The only sudden change is the one written on the label.  I used this product for a few months... I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it has helped or not.</li>
            <li> The scar strips work much better as compared to this product. Will not be coming back for more. The only good factor is that it contains zinc so I can use it as a sun block for my scars.</li>
            <li> Useless product.  Got two jars and used the first one in full with twice/daily applications.  While it lasted a long time, the second jar goes into the trash because there was no benefit to be seen for all the trouble of applying and rubbing it in carefully twice every day.</li>
            <li> Honestly I think my scars may have just needed some moisturizer. After months of this product I can only say its good for preventing acne on your face. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s good at that but fading scars I&#x27;m afraid is not in its wheelhouse. Maybe the results vary from person to person. But for this person there were no results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working for me... I used the whole jar and I don&#x27;t see any difference on my scar.  Maybe it&#x27;s not compatible on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference after a month of religiously using it. Maybe it will work better on someone else. My scar is 3 years old and very dark. I think if it was a lighter scar maybe you would notice a difference. It&#x27;s cheap enough, so why not try it! Compared to what they charge at the drug store for scar creams/jells, which I also have tried and no different.</li>
            <li> This product has softened scars I have that are dry and at times crack.  Scar Zone solves that problem for me.</li>
            <li> It worked surprisingly well, it got rid of like 40% of my scars, which is pretty good, because i didn&#x27;t have that much scars to begin with, but yes i would recommend this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference after using this product for 4 months.  I was really disappointed with this purchase and wish there was a trial period to return it to.  Now it&#x27;s going in trash.</li>
            <li> After getting this, I really think it isn&#x27;t much more than sunblock.  My burn is covered with clothing, so I don&#x27;t think it will help much.  Active ingredients is sunblock.  Not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> These days it&#x27;s truly amazing to find a product that ACTUALLY works! After so much researching and many failed attempts to reduce the redness and improve the texture of my scar, I wanted to try ScarZone. First, the price is so much cheaper than other scar diminishing products, yet I have read so many reviews about the other products and how they just have mineral oil and petroleum. ScarZone actually has silicon which is vital to help heal a scar. I had a horribly red-purple bumpy ring around my belly piercing after snagging it really badly. The scar did not look ANY better after months of other scar creams, silicon gels, and pure Vitamin E. After the first day I could tell the scar was much less red and bumpy! It&#x27;s been about a week and I religiously get my ScarZone 2 or more times a day. I bought the 5 oz jar because hoping it would work, I know that 5 oz&#x27;s would be enough for a very, very long time. The awful purple, protruding ring that was ruining the look of my belly piercing is now completely flat and getting closer and closer to my natural skin tone. Its a thick cream that rubs in clear after about a minute, has a very light scent, and is not greaser and won&#x27;t stain your clothes. Because the cream is so thick I just dip my finger in the jar and use SO little every time I apply the cream. This product absolutely works and I am sooooo happy that my belly piercing is not all ugly because I didn&#x27;t want to take it out because of a stupid scar! Best scar diminishing product ever! Get the 5 oz jar on Amazon if you plan on using it long term like I will, for any nicks, little scars, or discoloration.</li>
            <li> It might take a bit of time to see the result but it is really working well for my kid.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this product and am very glad to have found it.  I think it works very well.  I use it every day.  I see a change right away and it only gets better</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and works well</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for an old scar I have so don&#x27;t expect it to do anything for ones you have had since childhood. Can&#x27;t testify for more recent scarring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream religiously every day for 7 months now. I massage it in for 2-3 minutes like they say to do and everything. My scar is still very visible, and I have seen no more improvement than I believe I would have seen if I had just left the scar to fade over time. Look at the active ingredients - this is basically just a sunscreen. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used scar cream for 3 months and have seen no improvement in my scar. This cream is not effective and highly overpriced.</li>
            <li> I had the flab removed from my upper arms and this product did help but it of course takes time !!!! Used it 3 times a day for four months.</li>
            <li> SO FAR ON A NEW SCAR IT SEEMS TO BE DOING VERY WELL,GOOD PRICE,IM ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE FINAL DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT IS ON MY NEW SCAR.</li>
            <li> Make sure that your consistent with putting it on at a certain time everyday and I promise it will work for you as it did for me. Great product, got here on time!</li>
            <li> This small jar has a LOT of cream in it. If I apply it to my upper back twice a day it will probably last me several months. This cream goes on like sunscreen, and is totally unscented. I&#x27;ve been using it to heal my back acne scars, and have seen a modest improvement in two weeks of use. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a week and it has already lightened my scars and evened out the raised scars. I put it on twice a day. The only bad thing about this product is it says you have to rub the cream in for 2-3 minutes. I haven&#x27;t done that, I just rub until it is gone, but I&#x27;m not sure if I am making it less effective. I can&#x27;t rub them all in for 2 minutes because I have several scars, I&#x27;d be there forever. But other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li> Not a super cure all. But it does work. Ive noticed some changes and improvements. Will continue to use. Its definitely a lot of creme.</li>
            <li> my dater like it and it helps her allos and she is not strus anymore becouse it work well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I apply it on my acne scar on my face more than twice a day and it really works. The huge amount of cream which easily preserve and I don&#x27;t need to waste money on other scar removal products. It does what it supposed to do. I love it.</li>
            <li> i love this product, it is very good</li>
            <li> Working in the skin care industry, but not for this company, I&#x27;m naturally dubious of exaggerated product claims. However, this product actually performs as advertised. The formula is light, emollient and non-greasy. The ingredients are natural and amazingly effective. The only alternative is Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s Scar Gel from Dollar Tree, if you can find it!</li>
            <li> I guess it is better for newer scars not the ones I have.  I will continue to use and see.  I must say that it helped with the pain from the scaring so it has it good.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I did not see a sudden change.  I was hoping to find a more convenient scar reducer, but not this time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE SCAR ZONE BECAUSE IT EARSES ALL MY SCARS, IT IS A TERRIFIC PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;SCAR ZONE, SCAR ZONE, SCAR ZONE</li>
            <li> Product arrived just 5 days ago and my scars are almost completely faded and gone. I applied 3 times a day, rubbed it in and let it dry. An amazing product that works just as well as mederma.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every evening on a six inch scar. It has made the scar much less apparent. I have been recommending it to others often.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST product I have ever used in preventing zits or in helping to very quickly get rid of new zits that pop up, it also stops zits from even fully developing. It also makes me skin more brighter and healthier and more awake looking. However I bought this product to help get rid of scars/dark spots from old zits, and well, it didn&#x27;t do too much on my dark spots... I mean it might of helped some? I used it for a week and some spots faded, BUT my spots also fade with time anyways,</li>
            <li> Yes it oes work! Use it as tis direte on the jar and I guarantee you Will see results. Ater having a ba case one I notie they left black scars I had rought this rea months earlier just to try, so I used it on my scars several times a day and I began to notice them fading within no time. I highly recommend this scar cream It WORKS JUST USE IT DAILY AT LEAST 2 TIMES A DAY AND IT WIL FADE YOUR SCARS!</li>
            <li> Good Golly Miss Molly this stuff actually works! I bought this for my Son who had a pretty gnarly little dog bite on his mouth area with two tiny (but very noticeable) punctures on his top and bottom lip line. I bought and started using this stuff within about a week after the bite. I applied it to my kiddo twice a day and rubbed it in for about 30 seconds to a minute each time. Yes, you&#x27;re supposed to rub it in for 2-3 minutes, but you try to do that on a very fidgety&lt;br /&gt;8 year old boy. After a month I went to once a day, and then to whenever I managed to remember where I put it. The scar now is non existent, you&#x27;d never know he was bit unless you were 2 inches from his face looking through a magnifying glass. I actually noticed a difference within that first week, but stick with it and you will be very pleased -give it time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have my Mom using it now on a knee injury that happened a few months ago. It&#x27;s been about a week now and she&#x27;s already noticed some slight changes. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oh and a little goes a long way, this tub will last you forever if you have a small scar. Don&#x27;t bother with the smaller tubes this is a much better value.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my daughter after she had molluscum removed from her legs.  She has ugly little raised red bumps that remained after the molluscum was removed by her dermotologist.  She has told me that at first it seemed to be helping but after months of using this cream the scars are still just as obvious so she would not recommend wasting your money on this product.</li>
            <li> its good. Product I love it anybody should buy it because it does fade scratch and stretch marks and scars it is very product</li>
            <li> I have suffered with dermatillomania (Google it) my whole life - or at least as long as I can remember.  I also have keratosis pilaris, so those two together &#x3D; lots and lots of scars.  I noticed improvement within the first week of using this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now.  It is fading the pigmentation of my existing scars, and also flattening the scars I have that are raised.  On my scabs/scars that are still healing, it seems to expedite the healing process and get the scab to dry up and fall off before I can pick at it (I am by no means condoning this habit - the label does say NOT to use on broken/healing skin but I did and this is my experience with it... that doest NOT mean yours will be the same). I don&#x27;t even use it every day, or sometimes only once a day, but my skin overall looks more even and healthy, and my scars are diminishing, slowly.  I use it al over, basically as like a body lotion because I have so many scars.  I don&#x27;t spend 2-3 minutes massaging the cream into my scars; otherwise I would be there all day.  I also use this as a face cream and any redness I had before diminished within the first two weeks.  It keeps my skin smooth and supple looking, and doesn&#x27;t cause my EXTREMELY sensitive skin to break out.  The SPF is a nice addition to have, especially when using on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a miracle cream.  It has done wonders for me, and I wish I would have signed up on the auto-ship when this item was $32.95, because now it appears to be out of stock.  Does anyone have any idea of when this size might be back in stock?  If someone from Scar Zone (or anyone else, for that matter, who might happen to know) is reading this, please leave a comment on my review letting me know when this item may be available, or else where else I may be able to purchase this item.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Excellent product!  It really does work, and worth every penny.  I just wish I could purchase some more right now, because I&#x27;m about to run out, and don&#x27;t want to resort to using my Mederma... that stuff is garbage compared to Scar Zone!because I&#x27;m about to run out, and don&#x27;t want to resort to using my Mederma... that stuff is garbage compared to Scar Zone!</li>
            <li> No real results yet. Hopefully soon I will see something actually working. It&#x27;s been about a month and nothing yet.</li>
