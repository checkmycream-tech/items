            <li>It&#x27;s the best smell... not too sweet, not too rank.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED.</li>

            <li>This cologne is ok for the elderly but for 40</li>
            <li>I love to hold hands with him after he puts the after shave on</li>
            <li>When I wear Paul Sebastion I get more compliments than I do with any others that I use.</li>
            <li>It is not an overwhelming aroma as many are and it makes me feel like I am not being smelled before I enter the room.</li>
            <li>I waited 60 days  before writing a review to make sure this stuff didn&#x27;t evaporate on me-</li>
            <li>If you buy from this seller, then do not expect to be able to give this as a gift.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more.</li>

            <li>The person I bought this for was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I would love to take the credit and say it was me</li>
            <li>Just delisciously sexy.</li>
            <li>they want me to write 14 more words</li>
            <li>I really love the fragrance on my husband and will continue to purchase Paul Sebastian for him on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love PS cologne.</li>
            <li>I love for my husband to wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I personally like to use good cologne and have tried very many varieties.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered very promptly and in ery good conditon.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I  bought this for my boyfriend who is really into his &amp;#34;smell goods.&amp;#34; He even loved the deodorant stick.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and very nice and very masculine.</li>
            <li>Strong, lingering smell.</li>
            <li>The product is fine.  </li>
            <li>Paul Sebastian for Men set is really fine.  </li>
            <li>The aftershave bottle was fine.    </li>
            <li>I would suggest getting this from a Macys ($50 but comes with a free bag) or Perfumania ($35-40).  </li>
            <li>I love the beautiful black velvet box it arrived in.</li>
            <li>Since I normally pay retail,  this is, of course, a nice deal.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The quantity is tremendous for the price and that includes, of course, the deodorant which I am sure it is the kind that would smell outside of its intended radius.</li>
            <li>I recommend  it for you special guy or husband,</li>
            <li>The cologne,aftershave,and deodorant were full and in excelent shape.</li>
            <li>Paul Sebastian is better than Brut but it has a strong, powerful scent, so much in fact appeared to me, that I was able to spray 3 shots in the air and next day it was still around.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my husband favorite by the way,  thanks so much for speedy customer service.</li>
            <li>Apparently the problem was that the top was not secured in the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li>It is very affordable and true to item description.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance kept well throughout the course of the hot sweaty day.  </li>
            <li>One day as I was walking in the mall and passed my favorite perfume store I decided to test some scents and when i finally got to this one DEAR LORD!</li>
            <li>The deodorant had some white dirt settlement on top of it.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what they promised and I received it promptly.  </li>
            <li>It also comes in a really nice leather box that can be used for other things.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted with the perk of fast delivery to my home.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do with the deodorant.</li>
            <li>It came in the very sturdy,expensive looking, retail box.</li>
            <li>, someone smells really good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The product was as advertised and much cheaper than if I had bought it in a department store.  </li>
            <li>They issued a replacement and I had to ship the original back to them.  </li>
            <li>If you are uncomfortable with women telling your man how good he smells, then don&#x27;t buy this!  </li>
            <li>It might cost you a few dollars more, but at least you get a good product.    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>when I did, it was more expensive to buy alone than to get a free kit, makes no sense but love the aftershave and gave the other components away</li>
            <li>Good fragrance, and seems to work pretty well, I did notice the ladies perking up a little when I entered a room, and they were a little more talkative than the usual, which is pretty close to null.  </li>
            <li>I got this on line for half the price in the  stores and it was easy to find   i will order this again when i need it</li>
            <li>Im very surprised that Amazon would even sell this.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have had this cologne many times in the past.  </li>
            <li>I do not think that one could safely wear this in a crowder movie theater less some smart ass comment about its intense aroma, what I mean to say is that it is not a subtle smell, rather a</li>
            <li>ITS LIKE ONE OF THOSE TYPES OF COLOGNES OLD</li>
            <li>I bought this from Amazon directly.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think perfume has to be really expensive to be good.</li>
            <li>It is a little sweet and has a hint of musk.  </li>
            <li>That night I took a light shower, and when I woke up the next morning, I took my shirt off, and whaddya know, I still smelled the cologne a little.  </li>
            <li>women complement me on it, and it only takes a little.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to last the whole day.</li>
            <li>Tucchini replaced the product in a short time and very professionally.  </li>
            <li>It reminded me somewhat of Brut, the green plastic bottle that when it first came out I used until I realized it was way too overpowering.</li>
            <li>The deodorant isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d usually order for my husband, but you get double to cologne for the same price as the single bottle, so very worth it.</li>
            <li>This could be a good or bad thing depending on what a person chooses so</li>

            <li> This could be a good or bad thing depending on what a person chooses so</li>
            <li> First the package was hard to open.</li>
            <li> no make it 50 year old men and down this is a big</li>
            <li> Not overly musky and not with those strange, &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t put any more on the next day, and after another shower that night, I could still very faintly detect the cologne.  </li>
            <li> (This also ruined the box because once cardboard gets wet, it gets ruined).  </li>
            <li> and it was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weaker, but putting on a little extra should do the trick.  </li>

            <li> I have to admit that I was stupid for hastily ordering any cologne but for some reason I thought it wouldn&#x27;t matter so much. I learned my lesson and if I could I would have returned this, I tried it and felt like \\&quot;a sleaze bag\\&quot; or something like that. The worst, it will attract low-lifes to you so watch out!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this set for the cologne and the aftershave and deodorant is a bonus. Even though not antiperspirant the deodorant is enough for an evening out and not a workday. I love the smell of PS and when i wear it women always ask me what i am wearing.</li>
            <li> The cologne I ordered had leaked during shipment.  Apparently the problem was that the top was not secured in the manufacturing process.  Tucchini replaced the product in a short time and very professionally.  A-1 customer service.</li>
            <li> Well, I put some of the cologne on, about three or four sprays.  The fragrance kept well throughout the course of the hot sweaty day.  That night I took a light shower, and when I woke up the next morning, I took my shirt off, and whaddya know, I still smelled the cologne a little.  Well, I didn&#x27;t put any more on the next day, and after another shower that night, I could still very faintly detect the cologne.  Now, It is not greatly robust musky fragrance, but apparently it sticks with you.    It seems as though this cologne will seep into the pores of your skin, and stay there for a while.  Think of it as a time release capsule, or a wonderfully fragrant invisible henna tattoo.    Good fragrance, and seems to work pretty well, I did notice the ladies perking up a little when I entered a room, and they were a little more talkative than the usual, which is pretty close to null.  Pfft... Reserved conservatives.    This set is a great deal cause when you run out of the cologne, you can just start using the aftershave.  It&#x27;s a little weaker, but putting on a little extra should do the trick.  Like getting 1 3/4 for the price of 1.      I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do with the deodorant. Perhaps test its combustibility?</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne and aftershave and makes a great gift. The scent is timeless and is still a top notch cologne after all these years and still competes with the best of them.    Amazon is a bit cheaper then the other stores so I would recommend getting it.</li>
            <li> I got this on line for half the price in the  stores and it was easy to find   i will order this again when i need it</li>
            <li> My husband and I loved it. Great value and it came on time for christmas. That&#x27;s my husband favorite by the way,  thanks so much for speedy customer service.</li>
            <li> First the package was hard to open. The deodorant stick dried up and was gone. I even called Customer Service, but nobody help. Because the item was so old, the smell of the scent was not what I expected. I decided not to use it.  It was a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT BUY AND I USED REGULAR SHIPPING AND I GOT IN JUST 3 DAYS! WE THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING A SMALLER SIZE BUT IT WAS THE SAME SIZE WE HAD PAID TWICE THE PRICE IN A REGULAR STORE. VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> smells kinda grown up. meaning it givves me that swag as if i&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s lol. i like it. it makes me feel like im the big man around town.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered very promptly and in ery good conditon.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000E7YJV0 Paul Sebastian By Paul Sebastian For Men. Set-cologne Spray 4 Ounces &amp; Aftershave 4 Ounces &amp; Deodorant Stick 2.5 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my boyfriend who is really into his &amp;#34;smell goods.&amp;#34; He even loved the deodorant stick. I would recommend this, you get a lot for your money</li>
            <li> I love this cologne on my husband. We will continue to purchase it here. It is very affordable and true to item description.</li>
            <li> I received this gift set that I ordered through Amazon in the mail yesterday. It came in a different box than pictured. I love the beautiful black velvet box it arrived in. It is very nice, and it was packaged well. The cologne,aftershave,and deodorant were full and in excelent shape. The smell is strong and very nice and very masculine. My husband liked it, and so do I. This is a very nice gift for any man to receive. I am very pleased that I ordered this set. I will order this one again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for the Paul Sebastian fragrance.  Also, the cost of this set is unbelievable compared to the cost of the first 2 oz bottle of Paul Sebastian cologne for which I paid $32 (plus tax) at KOHL&#x27;s.  Wow!  This is a great deal!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best price for PS for men that I have found anywhere.  I get many comments about the great smell of PS.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> One day as I was walking in the mall and passed my favorite perfume store I decided to test some scents and when i finally got to this one DEAR LORD! IT SMELLED HORRIBLE ITS LIKE ONE OF THOSE TYPES OF COLOGNES OLD WANNA BE HAIRY PIMP MEN USE IT SMELLED LIKE FOR OLD PEOPLE LIKE WAY TO STRONG AND JUST NASTY This cologne is ok for the elderly but for 40 no make it 50 year old men and down this is a big no no......I do not reccomend this cologne</li>
            <li> My husband uses this all the time. We shopped around and found this to be the best price for the product. I love to hold hands with him after he puts the after shave on so I can have he scent with me after I leave for work.</li>
            <li> I personally like to use good cologne and have tried very many varieties. When I wear Paul Sebastion I get more compliments than I do with any others that I use. It is not an overwhelming aroma as many are and it makes me feel like I am not being smelled before I enter the room. When I go out strangers will comment on how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> The product is fine.  It came in the very sturdy,expensive looking, retail box. Actually, it looks like whats in the picture, and what I have purchased from the retail store Macy&#x27;s.  But, as we all know, we don&#x27;t always get what we think we are going to get. I waited 60 days  before writing a review to make sure this stuff didn&#x27;t evaporate on me- just kidding.  I have used this flavor after shave/cologne for 20+ years and know it well.  Since I normally pay retail,  this is, of course, a nice deal. I will buy additional after-shave from them.  I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Paul Sebastian for Men set is really fine.  My wife loves to scent.  I do, too.  An excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I looked in several department stores for this and couldn&#x27;t find it. As usual, Amazon had just what I needed. It was for a gift exchange and the person loved it!</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations! Price, Size, Product Description. Its exactly what I wanted with the perk of fast delivery to my home.</li>
            <li> Strong, lingering smell. It reminded me somewhat of Brut, the green plastic bottle that when it first came out I used until I realized it was way too overpowering. Paul Sebastian is better than Brut but it has a strong, powerful scent, so much in fact appeared to me, that I was able to spray 3 shots in the air and next day it was still around. Which certainly is not a bad thing for it would make it the strongest room deodorant in worst scenario.   The quantity is tremendous for the price and that includes, of course, the deodorant which I am sure it is the kind that would smell outside of its intended radius. This could be a good or bad thing depending on what a person chooses so I am not going to be disrespectful and ridicule those that like Paul Sebastian just like it is. Definitely a personal taste issue. The price was so inviting I purchased the package. I do not think that one could safely wear this in a crowder movie theater less some smart ass comment about its intense aroma, what I mean to say is that it is not a subtle smell, rather a Here I Am, Now What! kind of smell. Is not every day one gets 8oz (after shave and cologe +deodorant) for under $25 so the deal is there. Paul Sebastian will be used to its last drop, that I can assure anyone, from outings to cover bong hits, if necessary, for the smell will rule the airwaves. 3.5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve checked all over and this is the  best deal going! The deodorant isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d usually order for my husband, but you get double to cologne for the same price as the single bottle, so very worth it.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and exactly as described.  Husband has been wearing this cologne for over 20 years and always gets asked what he is wearing.  Great price.</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong with PS. I am using this brand for the last 4 years. people sometimes notice perfume if i change my perfume and when i wear this they always say \\&quot;u got it on perfect today\\&quot;. i don&#x27;t think perfume has to be really expensive to be good. this is my fav.</li>
            <li> I have had this cologne many times in the past.  It smells great and lasts a long time.  It is a little sweet and has a hint of musk.  The cologne comes in a refillable spray bottle which is excellent!    I bought this from Amazon directly.  The box it came in was different than the one in the picture.  It was very plain.  The bottles were not in a plastic wrap and it looked dirty.  The cologne leaked out onto the box and I lost about 25% of the cologne (This also ruined the box because once cardboard gets wet, it gets ruined).  In addition, the cap was made of metal which was slightly rusted.  Im very surprised that Amazon would even sell this.  The deodorant had some white dirt settlement on top of it.  The aftershave bottle was fine.    If you buy from this seller, then do not expect to be able to give this as a gift.  I would suggest getting this from a Macys ($50 but comes with a free bag) or Perfumania ($35-40).  It might cost you a few dollars more, but at least you get a good product.    ----    Update: I called amazon and stated what happened.  They issued a replacement and I had to ship the original back to them.  The shipping was slow, but they did come through.    Once again, excellent product.  I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND AM HAPPY  TO BE ABLE TO GET IT WITHOUT RUNNING  ALL AROUND LOOKING FOR IT.</li>
            <li> The person I bought this for was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Couldnt find it to buy the aftershave alone.  when I did, it was more expensive to buy alone than to get a free kit, makes no sense but love the aftershave and gave the other components away</li>
            <li> If you are uncomfortable with women telling your man how good he smells, then don&#x27;t buy this!  My husband wears this everyday and has worn it since we met 15 years ago. Almost every time we go out, someone will say &amp;#34;hmm, someone smells really good&amp;#34;. I would love to take the credit and say it was me but in most cases they are referring to him!  Not overly musky and not with those strange, &amp;#34;what the heck is that&amp;#34; undertones. Just delisciously sexy.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the money! It also comes in a really nice leather box that can be used for other things. My husband loved it!</li>
            <li> excellent price compared to department store. they want me to write 14 more words so here they are: hello hello</li>
            <li> Received my purchase in excellent condition.  The product was as advertised and much cheaper than if I had bought it in a department store.  I really love the fragrance on my husband and will continue to purchase Paul Sebastian for him on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price and gift to use. Nice set. Has it all. Lots of nice comments given.Will buy it again soon.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS</li>
            <li> This gift set is the BEST value you can buy for this prodduct. If you like PS and use both cologne and after shave, this price beats all others (even if you don&#x27;t use or want the deodorant). The fragrance smells great on any man that uses it. Package was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I love PS cologne. It&#x27;s the best smell... not too sweet, not too rank.&lt;br /&gt;Most women complement me on it, and it only takes a little.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to last the whole day.</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasing aroma along with a manly scent. I recomend this for partys and dates that where you want to empress.  one word  GREAT  les</li>
            <li> I knew what this was when I ordered it and it was just what I expected.  I love for my husband to wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what they promised and I received it promptly.  I will purchase again when my son runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use regularly, but can&#x27;t always find in the store.  The price for this set is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I got it on time but the box was broke other than that it was good&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift for my dad</li>
            <li> I bought for a Chrismtmas present and my husband loves the fragance as well!  I recommend  it for you special guy or husband,</li>
