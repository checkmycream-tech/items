            <li>Good product installs nicely.</li>

            <li>Handy Wall Hanger With Night Lite</li>
            <li>Nite lite is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The Sunbeam HD3001-001 1875 Watt Wall Mount Hair Dryer with LED Night Light work great and was very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Great full function hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This dryer was easy to install with a great night light</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy wall mounted holder with night light.  </li>
            <li>and you wouldn&#x27;t want more to get in the way around the sink.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The night light is adjustable in brightness (3 LED&#x27;s built into the holster) and a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but the design does take up more space and gives a more &amp;#34;cluttered&amp;#34; appearance than most wall mounted dryers.</li>
            <li>But when i use it i love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to instal and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>Wall mount easy to install.  </li>
            <li>neede a hari dryer that was wall mounted and easy to grab.</li>
            <li>It puts out a strong air flow.</li>
            <li>So glad I went for the full size dryer instead of the hotel size my husband got.....</li>
            <li>Hairdryer is available but not cluttering the counter or cabinet.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to turn on the bathroom light and wake the wife.  </li>
            <li>Love the features of this dryer but be prepared that ours had a really plastic like burning smell for the first 10 or more uses.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure why the high heat stopped working!</li>
            <li>And the night lite is cool.</li>
            <li>Nice switch selectors for various needs.  </li>
            <li>It says it 1875 watts, and it was for the first time I used it, (for about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li>I think you will really enjoy it more than a tiny dryer with limited power and controls.</li>
            <li>I paid extra to get the model with the night light, and I really don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>If you point the handle straight out from the wall</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the dryer for about 6 months now and it works very well for both heat and speed.  </li>
            <li>It seems really well made.</li>
            <li>High speed fan selection stopped working after 5 months!  </li>
            <li>Hair gets dry and easy to put away.</li>
            <li>Love the dryer, and really like the round wall mounted holster.</li>
            <li>Would like it if the fan was a little more high powered.</li>
            <li>It is a two prong plug but has a little breaker included to keep you safe.  </li>
            <li>Even though the wattage is 1875 it does not dry my hair very fast and their is no &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I think it will last much longer, however.</li>
            <li>They were both small,and less powerful.</li>
            <li>Cord is long enough without taking up too much space on the wall</li>
            <li>Now it barely kicks our 1000 watts.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The Sunbeam HD3001-001 1875 Watt Wall Mount Hair Dryer with LED Night Light work great and was very easy to install. I would recommend it to all</li>
            <li> Great full function hair dryer.  Separate controls for heat (including cold) and air.  Nice sturdy wall mounted holder with night light.  Lots of power.  Compact cord length but works well enough and you wouldn&#x27;t want more to get in the way around the sink.  You will want to think about how you will install this.  If you point the handle straight out from the wall it is about 13&amp;#34; deep.  Turned to the side requires at least 12&amp;#34;.  So it takes up a bit of room.  It also needs a place to plug it in.  Ours had about two feet of cord to the wall outlet.  The plug end is not a simple plug.  It is a two prong plug but has a little breaker included to keep you safe.  If you have the room and a handy plug for this I think you will really enjoy it more than a tiny dryer with limited power and controls.</li>
            <li> I saw this item in a condo I rented during our vacation.  It worked so well I decided to order one.  Boy was I glad I did.  I no longer have to mess around and wrap the cord from my old blow dryer.  You won&#x27;t go wrong if you order this one.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase.  Hairdryer is available but not cluttering the counter or cabinet. No real complaints. My only slight suggestion is that the cord could be about 1 foot longer. However, that could also cause problems with tangling.</li>
            <li> Good product installs nicely.</li>
            <li> Handy Wall Hanger With Night Lite&lt;br /&gt;Dries hair fast&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use controls&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the dryer for about 6 months now and it works very well for both heat and speed.

            <li> Even though the wattage is 1875 it does not dry my hair very fast and their is no &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34;.  The cord is cumbersome as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is wonderful - I like how it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> It begins with 5 stars and good review from people who was purchased it. But when i use it i love it. Easy to instal and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;it works great...</li>
            <li> This dryer was easy to install with a great night light so I don&#x27;t have to turn on the bathroom light and wake the wife.  Nice switch selectors for various needs.  Wish the cord would have been just a bit longer though.</li>
            <li> So glad I went for the full size dryer instead of the hotel size my husband got.....it works wonderful. Cord is long enough without taking up too much space on the wall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had very good luck with wall-mounted hair dryers. They&#x27;ve all burned out in a matter of 3-4 months. This one has worked very good for 3 months. It puts out a strong air flow. And the night lite is cool.</li>
            <li> When my daughter visited, she asked, &amp;#34;Mom, where did you get that?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good power.  Several speeds and temperature settings.  Wall mount easy to install.  Nite lite is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I have had two other wall hair dryers in the past. They were both small,and less powerful. This one has 3 heat setting with multiple fan speeds.But I have my fingers crossed hoping that it lasts longer than my other two........Gene T</li>
            <li> I paid extra to get the model with the night light, and I really don&#x27;t use it but it works great. Love the dryer, and really like the round wall mounted holster. Would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This dryer is great and I love the auto on feature. Would like it if the fan was a little more high powered.</li>
            <li> neede a hari dryer that was wall mounted and easy to grab. this does the job. Hair gets dry and easy to put away.</li>
            <li> High speed fan selection stopped working after 5 months!  But I like the dyer,  trying to see now how to get a replacement</li>
            <li> great dryer but has a really bad odor on first use. Love the features of this dryer but be prepared that ours had a really plastic like burning smell for the first 10 or more uses. Stunk up the bathroom but after about 10 uses and some baking soda it&#x27;s about gone now.</li>
