            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed I really recommend this product</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!!!</li>
            <li>This product has worked great for me and my OB recommended it for use while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for my whole family as we struggle with oily skin and acne for many years.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I used separately from my body wash and solely on my back/shoulder area and it worked great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found better products out there and stopped using this after a month.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more now and forever</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>my face has never felt better</li>
            <li>Glad I did</li>
            <li>I love the set because you get the toner and lotion with it</li>
            <li>I have been using this face wash for more than 8 years now before it I was using Proactive</li>
            <li>thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have acne free</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wear SPF when you use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Outside of &amp;#34;Proactive&amp;#34; this is the best acne wash I have found.  </li>
            <li>it did not work for me at all!)&lt;br /&gt;Goodluck to anyone who is suffering from breakouts it does get better(:</li>
            <li>Even when I forget to follow the whole three-step regimen, if I just use the face wash, it still works great.</li>
            <li>I am able to order it at anytime.  </li>
            <li>It works better than Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>After 1.5 months of use, I used too much of it to be able to return.</li>
            <li>I thought Amazon didn&#x27;t have it any more, I will check again.</li>
            <li>Most product leaked into box.</li>
            <li>I agree because when I saw her, her face looked better.</li>
            <li>It gives you this great clean and fresh tingly feeling to your face.</li>
            <li>Good product at first until they changed it.</li>
            <li>I always have an issue with acne on my chin and after 2 weeks of use, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m pimple free thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>(this may be too strong for most folks).</li>
            <li>overall a very good cleanser for faces prone to acne</li>
            <li>I love how cheap this is compared to Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>Most of my favorite retailers sell out of this quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect replacement for the pro active cleanser.</li>
            <li>As a person who has struggled with acne for YEARS, I am SO HAPPY I finally found a product that works, plus it&#x27;s cheap and can be found in retail stores as well!  </li>
            <li>works fine.  </li>
            <li>+ during the day and a richer lotion at night, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Use Acne Free either in morning or evening, alternating with Proactive.</li>
            <li>, I have been acne free for months.  </li>
            <li>then this is the one for you, at 2.5 % it is gentle but still effective and this formulation is non-drying.</li>
            <li>I have finally established an excellent routine plus the fact that I am now getting older my skin has drastically improved.</li>
            <li>Acnefree does not, and keeps my face looking nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li>First, I love that there is no fragrance which always irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cleanser, doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin</li>
            <li>Not only is it cheaper but it is just as effective and you get a lot more.</li>
            <li>I know it was because I didn&#x27;t clean my make up brushes for months .</li>
            <li>Not as clean a feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>but it made my face bright red and</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have full blown acne</li>
            <li>I am 18 and have been struggling with mild acne since I was about 13.</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;m lucky if it reaches my skin because it&#x27;s so watery.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using acne treatments altogether when I was pregnant</li>
            <li>the bottle lasts for about 6 months of daily usage- such a great product!</li>
            <li>not work so perfect and the smell is not good</li>
            <li>nice product, altho it didn&#x27;t work for my son, only due to an infection he had not FROM THE PRODUCT...and great price....</li>
            <li>I have used so many acne products for my very mild breakouts and I am totally blown away by this.</li>
            <li>It can make you more sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>It definitely is worth trying so you can save money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the savings.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like the 10% cleaners and is very light and easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>my face was getting better and better, and I have noticed that every time I try to buy other brands products my face breaks</li>
            <li>Once she returned, she immediately started using this again, and her skin cleared right up.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well...</li>
            <li>May switch over completely to Acne Free.</li>
            <li>I am 21 and have suffered from moderate acne for many years.</li>
            <li>and I especially make sure I do it on the days</li>
            <li>I have worn makeup, which is not often, just to make sure I don&#x27;t break out the next day.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I buy another product because I hear it&#x27;s better, but I always come back to this.</li>
            <li>I can finally use moisturizer without it causing my skin to be extra oily and now I can have a nice smooth, baby-soft face.</li>
            <li>my skin peel on the first use</li>
            <li>All of which worked in the first 6-9 months and then seemed to stop working as well after.</li>
            <li>My name is Lisa rosario I have had acne since the age of fourteen, I tried your product my skin is clear n smooth</li>
            <li>I will be going back to dollar tree and purchasing 10 more.</li>
            <li>More watery and different smelling.</li>
            <li>I have tried Neutrogena, Proactiv, Clean and Clear, Equate, Oxy etc etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every clean and clear, clearasil, strydex, neutrogena thing out there to no avail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena (didn&#x27;t work), Proactiv (too harsh), and everything else in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from prescription strength medications, which is not needed for my skin issues as they are not very severe, I would say this is the best you can get.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this facial cleanser for mild acne for mild acne for years.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean without drying, gently exfoliates and leaves my skin clear.</li>
            <li>So, you can not be certain if the product has been tampered with...</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up so fast and there were no marks or traces of acne.</li>
            <li>so finding a cleanser that gets rid of them and prevents them is a real bonus.</li>
            <li>So, basically I am a convert haha.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling fresh and clear.</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t really working, I ran out of it and saw at Walgreens the Severe treatment and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>cleanser is enough to keep my skin acne free for five years now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the entire Acne Free system that includes this wash, a toner, and breakout cream.</li>
            <li>I have much clearer skin now and have used this product for close to 4 years,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very acne prone and having been using this as my morning cleanser for years.</li>
            <li>but this REALLY cleared up my acne and smoothed out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really breakout anymore unless I sweat a lot, and as I do a lot of running don&#x27;t want to have to choose between my mileage time and my face.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really get his pores cleaned he face</li>
            <li>It cleans very thoroughly without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>and it does seem to last on my face throughout the day dealing with oil from sweat that would otherwise cause more frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I got it a few days ago and my acne is already clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li>The microbeads exfoliate but are still very gentle to my SENSITIVE skin!  </li>
            <li>good thing about this product is that it lasts after you rinse, so unlike other products your face won&#x27;t go back to normal after a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I am 30, I have always had acne on my lower chin area, this seems to help clear it up along with the Acne Free terminator, which I apply to my whole chin daily</li>
            <li>For the price this is a decent item though in my case I did not have allot of acne on my face</li>
            <li>I do shower 1-2 times per day depending on my physical activity level, so using this method you may get better longetivity out of a bottle if you shower only once per day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come across much better non lather facial cleansers that actually leave the face feeling</li>
            <li>I started washing my face only with this cleanser, and I rarely get pimples, it really controls the acne, and it&#x27;s not very irritating.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Cheaper alternative to Proactive and just as efficient, my wife has been using it for years with execellent results, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you the AcneFree Energizing Wipes.</li>
            <li>Works as well as the high dollar products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for those who have oily skin or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>many other teenagers or young adults tried to get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li>Not over-drying like many benzoyl peroxide products, although I do moisturize everyday.  </li>
            <li>Daughter went to live out of the country for a while and ran out of this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It seems gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t over dry and doesn&#x27;t stain my towels like many other products.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this system again, I&#x27;m all clear!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a problem with back/shoulder acne being a negative consequence from exercising and have tried many body washes and topical creams that are marketed to fight acne without much success.  </li>
            <li>Daughter uses it regularly for the most part and has for the last several years.  </li>
            <li>Not just for the young!</li>
            <li>it keeps my skin clear without over drying.</li>
            <li>I have had acne since my teens and this keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>(in my late 20&#x27;s -- so my acne should get better naturally anyways), but my acne has virtually disappeared in the 3-4 years I&#x27;ve been using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I started with the&lt;br /&gt;Acnefree severe kit to clear my skin and</li>
            <li>I see many negative reviews</li>
            <li>ended up tossing it after a brief struggle as I really dislike wasting things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still suffer from adult acne and this keeps it under control.</li>
            <li>So the second and subsequent bottles I&#x27;ve been adding a quarter sized amount to my loofah and mixing it with my normal dove body wash and washing my whole body as normal.  </li>
            <li>My face is not oily and feels really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It took about a week to notice results but my acne was completely gone within about 3 weeks...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having acne since I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>If your face is only and gets greasy during the day or after working out, don&#x27;t use it as it may be very drying.</li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, the beads in it are sparse and a complete joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This contains gentle cleansing grains that exfoliate and deep cleanse the skin and kill the bacteria causes acne.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin does not like Proactiv, it loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>and i noticed it reduced and faded old acne scars.</li>
            <li>I would suggest only using it once  per day to start out as this cleaner can really dry your skin out quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been such a relief after fourteen years to be able to go outside without feeling like I have to hide my face under makeup or wear my hair down to try and hide my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this system a few years ago when I had some mild adult acne</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a shot because this bottle will last me at least 2 months for a fraction of the cost of ProActiv.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser, which did the exact same thing to my skin after a long period of use.</li>
            <li>I notice the difference when I do not use this cleanser, generally what I do</li>
            <li>Only thing that keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>but I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was desperate for help, and after reading good reviews on this cleanser, I tried it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for more then 2 month twice a day and no change this didnt help me or made it worse.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to actually help and it is much cheaper than other brands.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really want to subscribe to ProActiv, much less pay their prices.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t lather, which is fine with me, but the formula of its cream like substance clogs my pores, making acne worse.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is perfect for my whole family as we struggle with oily skin and acne for many years.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I used separately from my body wash and solely on my back/shoulder area and it worked great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found better products out there and stopped using this after a month.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more now and forever</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> my face has never felt better</li>
            <li> Glad I did</li>
            <li> I love the set because you get the toner and lotion with it</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for more than 8 years now before it I was using Proactive</li>
            <li> thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have acne free</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wear SPF when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Outside of &amp;#34;Proactive&amp;#34; this is the best acne wash I have found.  </li>
            <li> it did not work for me at all!)&lt;br /&gt;Goodluck to anyone who is suffering from breakouts it does get better(:</li>
            <li> Even when I forget to follow the whole three-step regimen, if I just use the face wash, it still works great.</li>
            <li> I am able to order it at anytime.  </li>
            <li> It works better than Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> After 1.5 months of use, I used too much of it to be able to return.</li>
            <li> I thought Amazon didn&#x27;t have it any more, I will check again.</li>
            <li> Most product leaked into box.</li>
            <li> I agree because when I saw her, her face looked better.</li>
            <li> It gives you this great clean and fresh tingly feeling to your face.</li>
            <li> Good product at first until they changed it.</li>
            <li> I always have an issue with acne on my chin and after 2 weeks of use, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m pimple free thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> (this may be too strong for most folks).</li>
            <li> overall a very good cleanser for faces prone to acne</li>
            <li> I love how cheap this is compared to Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> Most of my favorite retailers sell out of this quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for the pro active cleanser.</li>
            <li> As a person who has struggled with acne for YEARS, I am SO HAPPY I finally found a product that works, plus it&#x27;s cheap and can be found in retail stores as well!  </li>
            <li> works fine.  </li>
            <li> + during the day and a richer lotion at night, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Use Acne Free either in morning or evening, alternating with Proactive.</li>
            <li> , I have been acne free for months.  </li>
            <li> then this is the one for you, at 2.5 % it is gentle but still effective and this formulation is non-drying.</li>
            <li> I have finally established an excellent routine plus the fact that I am now getting older my skin has drastically improved.</li>
            <li> Acnefree does not, and keeps my face looking nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> First, I love that there is no fragrance which always irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cleanser, doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin</li>
            <li> Not only is it cheaper but it is just as effective and you get a lot more.</li>
            <li> I know it was because I didn&#x27;t clean my make up brushes for months .</li>
            <li> Not as clean a feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> but it made my face bright red and</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have full blown acne</li>
            <li> I am 18 and have been struggling with mild acne since I was about 13.</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;m lucky if it reaches my skin because it&#x27;s so watery.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using acne treatments altogether when I was pregnant</li>
            <li> the bottle lasts for about 6 months of daily usage- such a great product!</li>
            <li> not work so perfect and the smell is not good</li>
            <li> nice product, altho it didn&#x27;t work for my son, only due to an infection he had not FROM THE PRODUCT...and great price....</li>
            <li> I have used so many acne products for my very mild breakouts and I am totally blown away by this.</li>
            <li> It can make you more sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> It definitely is worth trying so you can save money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the savings.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like the 10% cleaners and is very light and easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> my face was getting better and better, and I have noticed that every time I try to buy other brands products my face breaks</li>
            <li> Once she returned, she immediately started using this again, and her skin cleared right up.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well...</li>
            <li> May switch over completely to Acne Free.</li>
            <li> I am 21 and have suffered from moderate acne for many years.</li>
            <li> and I especially make sure I do it on the days</li>
            <li> I have worn makeup, which is not often, just to make sure I don&#x27;t break out the next day.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I buy another product because I hear it&#x27;s better, but I always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I can finally use moisturizer without it causing my skin to be extra oily and now I can have a nice smooth, baby-soft face.</li>
            <li> my skin peel on the first use</li>
            <li> All of which worked in the first 6-9 months and then seemed to stop working as well after.</li>
            <li> My name is Lisa rosario I have had acne since the age of fourteen, I tried your product my skin is clear n smooth</li>
            <li> I will be going back to dollar tree and purchasing 10 more.</li>
            <li> More watery and different smelling.</li>
            <li> I have tried Neutrogena, Proactiv, Clean and Clear, Equate, Oxy etc etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every clean and clear, clearasil, strydex, neutrogena thing out there to no avail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena (didn&#x27;t work), Proactiv (too harsh), and everything else in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from prescription strength medications, which is not needed for my skin issues as they are not very severe, I would say this is the best you can get.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this facial cleanser for mild acne for mild acne for years.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face clean without drying, gently exfoliates and leaves my skin clear.</li>
            <li> So, you can not be certain if the product has been tampered with...</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up so fast and there were no marks or traces of acne.</li>
            <li> so finding a cleanser that gets rid of them and prevents them is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> So, basically I am a convert haha.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling fresh and clear.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t really working, I ran out of it and saw at Walgreens the Severe treatment and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> cleanser is enough to keep my skin acne free for five years now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the entire Acne Free system that includes this wash, a toner, and breakout cream.</li>
            <li> I have much clearer skin now and have used this product for close to 4 years,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very acne prone and having been using this as my morning cleanser for years.</li>
            <li> but this REALLY cleared up my acne and smoothed out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really breakout anymore unless I sweat a lot, and as I do a lot of running don&#x27;t want to have to choose between my mileage time and my face.</li>
            <li> and this stuff really get his pores cleaned he face</li>
            <li> It cleans very thoroughly without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> and it does seem to last on my face throughout the day dealing with oil from sweat that would otherwise cause more frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I got it a few days ago and my acne is already clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li> The microbeads exfoliate but are still very gentle to my SENSITIVE skin!  </li>
            <li> good thing about this product is that it lasts after you rinse, so unlike other products your face won&#x27;t go back to normal after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I am 30, I have always had acne on my lower chin area, this seems to help clear it up along with the Acne Free terminator, which I apply to my whole chin daily</li>
            <li> For the price this is a decent item though in my case I did not have allot of acne on my face</li>
            <li> I do shower 1-2 times per day depending on my physical activity level, so using this method you may get better longetivity out of a bottle if you shower only once per day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come across much better non lather facial cleansers that actually leave the face feeling</li>
            <li> I started washing my face only with this cleanser, and I rarely get pimples, it really controls the acne, and it&#x27;s not very irritating.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative to Proactive and just as efficient, my wife has been using it for years with execellent results, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you the AcneFree Energizing Wipes.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the high dollar products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for those who have oily skin or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> many other teenagers or young adults tried to get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> Not over-drying like many benzoyl peroxide products, although I do moisturize everyday.  </li>
            <li> Daughter went to live out of the country for a while and ran out of this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It seems gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t over dry and doesn&#x27;t stain my towels like many other products.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this system again, I&#x27;m all clear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with back/shoulder acne being a negative consequence from exercising and have tried many body washes and topical creams that are marketed to fight acne without much success.  </li>
            <li> Daughter uses it regularly for the most part and has for the last several years.  </li>
            <li> Not just for the young!</li>
            <li> it keeps my skin clear without over drying.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since my teens and this keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> (in my late 20&#x27;s -- so my acne should get better naturally anyways), but my acne has virtually disappeared in the 3-4 years I&#x27;ve been using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I started with the&lt;br /&gt;Acnefree severe kit to clear my skin and</li>
            <li> I see many negative reviews</li>
            <li> ended up tossing it after a brief struggle as I really dislike wasting things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still suffer from adult acne and this keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> So the second and subsequent bottles I&#x27;ve been adding a quarter sized amount to my loofah and mixing it with my normal dove body wash and washing my whole body as normal.  </li>
            <li> My face is not oily and feels really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It took about a week to notice results but my acne was completely gone within about 3 weeks...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having acne since I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li> If your face is only and gets greasy during the day or after working out, don&#x27;t use it as it may be very drying.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, the beads in it are sparse and a complete joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This contains gentle cleansing grains that exfoliate and deep cleanse the skin and kill the bacteria causes acne.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin does not like Proactiv, it loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> and i noticed it reduced and faded old acne scars.</li>
            <li> I would suggest only using it once  per day to start out as this cleaner can really dry your skin out quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been such a relief after fourteen years to be able to go outside without feeling like I have to hide my face under makeup or wear my hair down to try and hide my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this system a few years ago when I had some mild adult acne</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a shot because this bottle will last me at least 2 months for a fraction of the cost of ProActiv.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser, which did the exact same thing to my skin after a long period of use.</li>
            <li> I notice the difference when I do not use this cleanser, generally what I do</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> but I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for help, and after reading good reviews on this cleanser, I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for more then 2 month twice a day and no change this didnt help me or made it worse.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to actually help and it is much cheaper than other brands.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really want to subscribe to ProActiv, much less pay their prices.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t lather, which is fine with me, but the formula of its cream like substance clogs my pores, making acne worse.</li>
            <li> Due to the way the bottle opens and close (like those flat rectangular toggling light switches) some of the content leaked out and was very messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little older now</li>
            <li> I rinsed as i normally would, but looking at the towels later, they stained where I had dried my face off.</li>
            <li> You just apply a small amount in the morning and in the evening and massage gently.</li>
            <li> While my face is quite used to using products with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, I know when you first start it can become very raw and irritated</li>
            <li> but I found it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> i use this for long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun, tumeric face masks that turned my skin yellow, benzoyl peroxcide face masks and washed every sylic acid treament out there, even prescriptions for my skin have never really done anything.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be keeping it in my bathroom for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> My face us oily and dry</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> It works wonders for people with oily skins like mine, because it won&#x27;t leave your skin overly dry</li>
            <li> It does dry out your face, so use a moisturizer after each use.</li>
            <li> After over 10 years of trying dozens of different brands and active ingredients (i.e; benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, 5% mixes, 10%, etc), I came across this.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using it only a few times a week to begin and gradually working up to daily.</li>
            <li> every brand and active ingredient of face washes, spot treatments, even prescription topical creams and gels from a doctor.  </li>
            <li> I tried literally every single face wash.</li>
            <li> At such a cheap price you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and although it felt great and didn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin, I&#x27;m having a horrible reaction to this.</li>
            <li> She is in her late teens now and her skin has always been clear when she keeps up with using this.  </li>
            <li> i really like this face wash, it does have small beads in it for scrubbing but not many at all.</li>
            <li> One morning, son 2 showed up with an angry-red bumpy face since hygiene is not really his thing.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few things that has stayed a staple in my daily skincare regimen for longer than one year.</li>
            <li> not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Added bonus, size of bottle much bigger, cheaper and works as well if not better then</li>
            <li> but I did not need the other two things during this re-order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when using it twice a day like other products i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The only negative to this products and others with benzoyl peroxide is that they bleach out my sheets and towels over time.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I stained some towels.</li>
            <li> I was using saint Ives scrub with 2% Salic acid with no success .</li>
            <li> Use it everyday morning and night when I remember.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t burn your skin but just be careful with the eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previous Proactiv user gives this product thumbs-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40s and still have minor acne.  </li>
            <li> i like the little beads in it too.</li>
            <li> Using Proactive twice a day was a little too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> Middle aged woman who used to get chronic blind pimples on my jawline- haven&#x27;t had one in two years since using this product.  </li>
            <li> I understand that this may be a harsh approach for some</li>
            <li> Works well but dried out my daughter&#x27;s face a bit.</li>
            <li> The liquid is thin and white.  </li>
            <li> But, I washed every morning and every night with this face wash, I used clinique&#x27;s facail moisturized just a bit after washing and treated my spots which can be either cystic or whiteheads or blackheads with the acnefree spot terminator, and I also used the sulfur face mask a few times a week always using moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> It dried out my pimples</li>
            <li> Product works well at half the cost!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that maybe it was a fluke with just one bottle affected, but the past few shipments have all been watery.  </li>
            <li> is take a small amount of product, place it in my palm and mix it with some baking soda.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to continue spending a lot of money buying the Three Step Treatment from AcneFree because I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> At nights I use Terminator 10 ONLY when I get some random pimples.</li>
            <li> and I believe this works as well if not better than it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always at Target or Ulta but usually can be found here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this where he works he get very dirty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this face wash in the stores in stock</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason why this is so cheap: really nasty ingredients and preservatives to keep this microbe-free for decades.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and its.only made things worse for me.</li>
            <li> It is a lot less expensive than proactiv.</li>
            <li> My face is broken out much worse than before</li>
            <li> which can be as frustrating as having the break out.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Even the expensive brands didn&#x27;t help my acne.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be switching to another product.</li>
            <li> My three kids, two of whom have very bad acne, use this and it clears their skin extremely well--when they use it.  </li>
            <li> Although, I do get a few breakouts but nothing too bad!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my face, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had breakouts like this, and I had bad acne when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my skin breaking out quite badly :(</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed after receiving this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I hate squeezing blackheads</li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed with this face wash.  </li>
            <li> and so the idea of putting moisturizer on it seemed insane</li>
            <li> After a horrible breakout that lasted a month, pimple after pimple .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> For the price this is a decent item though in my case I did not have allot of acne on my face so the results were satisfactory combined with the price of this product</li>
            <li> Works pretty well... My face us oily and dry but this definitely does help. Use every day.</li>
            <li> Got as back up for Proactive.  Using Proactive twice a day was a little too harsh for me. Use Acne Free either in morning or evening, alternating with Proactive. Added bonus, size of bottle much bigger, cheaper and works as well if not better then Proactive. May switch over completely to Acne Free.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the microbeads that I am used to, but It&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my skin clear. The only negative to this products and others with benzoyl peroxide is that they bleach out my sheets and towels over time.</li>
            <li> Previous Proactiv user gives this product thumbs-up. Product works well at half the cost! I would recomend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great for me and my OB recommended it for use while pregnant.  Used with the spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin under control. Using for 2 years now!</li>
            <li> i use this for long time.  cheaper than buy from walmart or target&lt;br /&gt;it works</li>
            <li> I wasnt as impressed with this as others.  I&#x27;ve found better products out there and stopped using this after a month.  The smell of the product isnt terrific.</li>
            <li> I see many negative reviews but personally this is a miracle product for me. I am 21 and have suffered from moderate acne for many years. I have finally established an excellent routine plus the fact that I am now getting older my skin has drastically improved. I notice the difference when I do not use this cleanser, generally what I do is take a small amount of product, place it in my palm and mix it with some baking soda. I then apply it to my face and leave it on until it dries (15 minutes or so) once it&#x27;s dry I add some water to moisten it a bit then I use my clarisonic. I understand that this may be a harsh approach for some but I can swear by it, this has made all the difference. I do this a couple of times a week and I especially make sure I do it on the days I have worn makeup, which is not often, just to make sure I don&#x27;t break out the next day. I went out of town and forgot to bring this cleanser with me and I noticed my skin breaking out quite badly :( If you have moderate to severe acne then I suggest you try it but I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it for those with sensitive skin. At such a cheap price you cannot go wrong! I will be purchasing more now and forever lol I hope my review has helped some acne sufferers like myself ðŸ˜Š don&#x27;t give up friends just find what works for you!</li>
            <li> nice product, altho it didn&#x27;t work for my son, only due to an infection he had not FROM THE PRODUCT...and great price....</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a subscribe &amp; save shipment. Due to the way the bottle opens and close (like those flat rectangular toggling light switches) some of the content leaked out and was very messy. For things like this I would imagine the bottle should have an inner seal or some such to preserve the integrity of the content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no inner seal! So, you can not be certain if the product has been tampered with...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up tossing it after a brief struggle as I really dislike wasting things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please use a seal!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday morning and night when I remember.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t burn your skin but just be careful with the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Works well my face has cleared up 90% but you need to use it daily to keep the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser on and off for about 8 years. Sometimes I buy another product because I hear it&#x27;s better, but I always come back to this. it keeps my skin clear without over drying. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a CVS and loved the product. However, I was disappointed after receiving this product through Amazon. As stated in a couple of reviews, the product was watery.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years and it works great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon but my local walmart.  This is great product I love that you just have to use the one product.  I have had acne since my teens and this keeps my skin clear.  It runs about $5 and it last me about 2 months.  Great great product.</li>
            <li> Worked practically OVERNIGHT. I have used so many acne products for my very mild breakouts and I am totally blown away by this. My skin cleared up so fast and there were no marks or traces of acne. I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using product..I love it..my face has never felt better</li>
            <li> After over 10 years of trying dozens of different brands and active ingredients (i.e; benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, 5% mixes, 10%, etc), I came across this. Actually I was considering a try at ProActiv and ran into this by chance (and by price). Glad I did -- I&#x27;ve never tried ProActiv, but this stuff is GREAT. I&#x27;m a little older now (in my late 20&#x27;s -- so my acne should get better naturally anyways), but my acne has virtually disappeared in the 3-4 years I&#x27;ve been using this stuff. It seems gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t over dry and doesn&#x27;t stain my towels like many other products. I&#x27;ll never go back to anything but this stuff and would recommend a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cleanser, doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin and it does seem to last on my face throughout the day dealing with oil from sweat that would otherwise cause more frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I still suffer from adult acne and this keeps it under control. It&#x27;s the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena (didn&#x27;t work), Proactiv (too harsh), and everything else in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from prescription strength medications, which is not needed for my skin issues as they are not very severe, I would say this is the best you can get. I love the set because you get the toner and lotion with it but I did not need the other two things during this re-order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As inexpensive as it is, you should definitely give this product a try!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been the same since I had my second baby. I was desperate for help, and after reading good reviews on this cleanser, I tried it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and although it felt great and didn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin, I&#x27;m having a horrible reaction to this. My face is broken out much worse than before and it is sore. I&#x27;ve never had breakouts like this, and I had bad acne when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with back/shoulder acne being a negative consequence from exercising and have tried many body washes and topical creams that are marketed to fight acne without much success.  I bought this stuff because of a post on Slickdeals telling me about a coupon where I could pick this stuff up for a dollar, so I thought why not give it a shot?  It turns out to be the only thing that works for me, and its since made its way into my Amazon subscription list.  The first bottle I used separately from my body wash and solely on my back/shoulder area and it worked great but I found it didn&#x27;t last very long.  So the second and subsequent bottles I&#x27;ve been adding a quarter sized amount to my loofah and mixing it with my normal dove body wash and washing my whole body as normal.  This is working just as well, I have been acne free for months.  Plus, I&#x27;m getting total body coverage and extending the life of the bottle to about a month.  I do shower 1-2 times per day depending on my physical activity level, so using this method you may get better longetivity out of a bottle if you shower only once per day.  I&#x27;ve found this to be a really great product and I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> works fine.  steps 2 and 3 don&#x27;t seem to be necessary.  doesn&#x27;t over-dry</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative to Proactive and just as efficient, my wife has been using it for years with execellent results, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used this for more then 2 month twice a day and no change this didnt help me or made it worse. Useless.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for more than 8 years now before it I was using Proactive and this face wash is just as good.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this facial cleanser for mild acne for mild acne for years. very happy with the quality and pricewith this who the hell needs proactive lol....thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Product is working great! My face is not oily and feels really soft afterwards. It is perfect for my whole family as we struggle with oily skin and acne for many years. Thank you Acnefree!</li>
            <li> We have this delivered every 3 months or so. It&#x27;s hard to find this face wash in the stores in stock so it&#x27;s nice to have acne free delivered to my home knowing it will arrive when I need it.</li>
            <li> I buy these for myself. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
            <li> My son does not like this cleanser. I think it is because it doesn&#x27;t lather and he is not used to that.</li>
            <li> Like the title says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This AcneFree face cleanser is basically a miracle for me and likely for anyone with any skin type. You just apply a small amount in the morning and in the evening and massage gently. Don&#x27;t rub in with a cloth, but massage with your fingers to get the best results. It gives you this great clean and fresh tingly feeling to your face. If you have acne and skin issues you will understand that this is the best feeling in the world, lol! It works wonders for people with oily skins like mine, because it won&#x27;t leave your skin overly dry and also you won&#x27;t have an oily, gross face all day. Yes! I can finally use moisturizer without it causing my skin to be extra oily and now I can have a nice smooth, baby-soft face. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this product is that it lasts after you rinse, so unlike other products your face won&#x27;t go back to normal after a couple hours. It also helps get rid of blackheads over time. I hate squeezing blackheads so finding a cleanser that gets rid of them and prevents them is a real bonus. It also works on chest, back and neck spots which are so embarrassing. So, basically I am a convert haha.</li>
            <li> As effective as Proactiv, and about four times the size! It takes me month to go through it, and it&#x27;s as effective. It is drying, but all washes are - pair it with a non-comedogenic SPF 30+ during the day and a richer lotion at night, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling fresh and clear. i like the little beads in it too. overall a very good cleanser for faces prone to acne</li>
            <li> Works well but dried out my daughter&#x27;s face a bit. Would recommend it though...might just be her skin type. Her acne cleared up!</li>
            <li> Give this product a try if you&#x27;re having issues with oily skin &amp;/or breakouts.  I would suggest only using it once  per day to start out as this cleaner can really dry your skin out quickly.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and its.only made things worse for me. I have very red and rash like.pimples that itch .</li>
            <li> I am 18 and have been struggling with mild acne since I was about 13. I tried literally every single face wash. Even the expensive brands didn&#x27;t help my acne. I somehow stumbled upon AcneFree and absolutely loved it!!! It took about a week to notice results but my acne was completely gone within about 3 weeks... I have been using this face wash for about 2 years and my acne has yet to come back. Although, I do get a few breakouts but nothing too bad! All of the AcneFree products are great, but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> This product says it has micro-exfoliating beads in it, but there aren&#x27;t any!  I&#x27;m used to Proactiv&#x27;s cleanser with lots of beads so I was very disappointed with this face wash.  I only tried it to save money as it is a lot cheaper than Proactiv, but I guess you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> I really like this.  It helps to keep my acne under control.  Just make sure to wear SPF when you use it.  It can make you more sensitive to the sun (I beleive, Just like proactive).</li>
            <li> I think this has bleached my towels. It&#x27;s a cream cleanse and I do like it, but my towels have suffered a lot...</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have been using it for years. It leaves my face clean without drying, gently exfoliates and leaves my skin clear.</li>
            <li> i really like this face wash, it does have small beads in it for scrubbing but not many at all. it is really excellent</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Outside of &amp;#34;Proactive&amp;#34; this is the best acne wash I have found.  My three kids, two of whom have very bad acne, use this and it clears their skin extremely well--when they use it.  One morning, son 2 showed up with an angry-red bumpy face since hygiene is not really his thing.  I had him go wash his face with this and three hours later the redness was quite noticeably diminished.  Daughter uses it regularly for the most part and has for the last several years.  She is in her late teens now and her skin has always been clear when she keeps up with using this.  It is cheaper than a dermatologist co-pay and works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Daughter went to live out of the country for a while and ran out of this cleanser.  She went back to having problems with her complexion.  Once she returned, she immediately started using this again, and her skin cleared right up.</li>
            <li> if your looking for a benzoyl peroxide (BPO) then this is the one for you, at 2.5 % it is gentle but still effective and this formulation is non-drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having acne since I was 15 years old. I&#x27;m 22 now. I have like many other teenagers or young adults tried to get rid of my acne. I have tried Neutrogena, Proactiv, Clean and Clear, Equate, Oxy etc etc. In 2011 I was trying Proactiv and it wasn&#x27;t really working, I ran out of it and saw at Walgreens the Severe treatment and decided to buy it. Guess what in two weeks my face was getting better and better, and I have noticed that every time I try to buy other brands products my face breaks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well just to be short. I didn&#x27;t want to continue spending a lot of money buying the Three Step Treatment from AcneFree because I&#x27;m lazy and it&#x27;s a bit pricey. I started washing my face only with this cleanser, and I rarely get pimples, it really controls the acne, and it&#x27;s not very irritating. At nights I use Terminator 10 ONLY when I get some random pimples. If  I don&#x27;t have any I don&#x27;t use and only wash my face with this morning and night. If your face is only and gets greasy during the day or after working out, don&#x27;t use it as it may be very drying. I highly suggest you the AcneFree Energizing Wipes.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended i use this but it made my face bright red and my skin peel on the first use, i even applied it after diluting it with water. not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for the pro active cleanser. Not only is it cheaper but it is just as effective and you get a lot more.</li>
            <li> Suffered from Acne for almost nine years and the AcneeFree line was&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that saved my skin!! I started with the&lt;br /&gt;Acnefree severe kit to clear my skin and once my acne&lt;br /&gt;cleared up I used this cleanser and the scar fade&amp;erase only.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this product drying out my skin&lt;br /&gt;even when using it twice a day like other products i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is enough to keep my skin acne free for five years now.&lt;br /&gt;I swear by this cleanser it has been my holygrail product. (I have tried high-end&lt;br /&gt;products and proactiv which wasted so much of my money b/c it did not work for me at all!)&lt;br /&gt;Goodluck to anyone who is suffering from breakouts it does get better(:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the entire Acne Free system that includes this wash, a toner, and breakout cream. I just use this wash twice a day, moisturize on every place but my forehead and chin, and then use the spot treatment. This product, when in the three pack face treatment is supposed to be all you need, but I definitely need moisturizer. I have much clearer skin now and have used this product for close to 4 years,</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to actually help and it is much cheaper than other brands.  I am 30, I have always had acne on my lower chin area, this seems to help clear it up along with the Acne Free terminator, which I apply to my whole chin daily (this may be too strong for most folks).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Acnefree cleanser for about 2 weeks now and I have nothing but good things to say about it.  First, I love that there is no fragrance which always irritates my skin.  For years, I used ProActiv and I believe this works as well if not better than it. In an effort to save money, I decided to try AcneFree out and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a shot because this bottle will last me at least 2 months for a fraction of the cost of ProActiv.  I always have an issue with acne on my chin and after 2 weeks of use, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m pimple free thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> The best never get acne sfter I descovered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very acne prone and having been using this as my morning cleanser for years. It is one of the few things that has stayed a staple in my daily skincare regimen for longer than one year. I had tried Proactiv, Clinique, and Murad. All of which worked in the first 6-9 months and then seemed to stop working as well after. While my face is quite used to using products with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, I know when you first start it can become very raw and irritated which can be as frustrating as having the break out. I would suggest using it only a few times a week to begin and gradually working up to daily. Skipping moisturizer is not an option. Moisturizer can be scary because we feel they can lead to more breakout but if you amp up your skin&#x27;s exfoliation (especially with products containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid) you&#x27;re def going to need a boost of moisture for all the newer skin at the surface.</li>
            <li> I have used this line for years and I love it!</li>
            <li> best cleanser ever and it is cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless numbers of products...every brand and active ingredient of face washes, spot treatments, even prescription topical creams and gels from a doctor.  Nothing has come close to the results I&#x27;ve gotten with this cleanser!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I still get the occasional pimple but this REALLY cleared up my acne and smoothed out my skin.  Not over-drying like many benzoyl peroxide products, although I do moisturize everyday.  The microbeads exfoliate but are still very gentle to my SENSITIVE skin!  I use the AcneFree spot treatment as well, once a day, if needed.  As a person who has struggled with acne for YEARS, I am SO HAPPY I finally found a product that works, plus it&#x27;s cheap and can be found in retail stores as well!  Must try!</li>
            <li> There is a reason why this is so cheap: really nasty ingredients and preservatives to keep this microbe-free for decades. I&#x27;m not putting this on my face anymore. Switching to a cleaner acne brand.</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference after 2 weeks of daily use. Now it&#x27;s been 3 months and still great results. .</li>
            <li> The only part of the set that&#x27;s actually critical to not breaking out. I don&#x27;t really breakout anymore unless I sweat a lot, and as I do a lot of running don&#x27;t want to have to choose between my mileage time and my face. Applying this as a daily face wash is key.</li>
            <li> The liquid is thin and white.  It leaves nothing to massage into your skin.  I am still experiencing breakouts with this product.  I find that it also dries my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this where he works he get very dirty and this stuff really get his pores cleaned he face is looking so much better!!! We will be purchasing this again in the future!!!</li>
            <li> In love with this! I got it a few days ago and my acne is already clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li> I receive this through Subscribe and Save and have been for quite a while now.  In the beginning, the product I received was a creamy cleanser and it worked great at fighting off break outs.  Recently, I&#x27;m lucky if it reaches my skin because it&#x27;s so watery.  I was hoping that maybe it was a fluke with just one bottle affected, but the past few shipments have all been watery.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be switching to another product.</li>
            <li> This product was great... until they added the microbeads. Not only does my skin not respond well to these abrasives, but the beads are so tiny they can travel into streams and get eaten by fish. Good product at first until they changed it.</li>
            <li> I bought this system a few years ago when I had some mild adult acne and I didn&#x27;t really want to subscribe to ProActiv, much less pay their prices. This stuff cleared my skin within days and I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since. Even when I forget to follow the whole three-step regimen, if I just use the face wash, it still works great. I stopped using acne treatments altogether when I was pregnant and my skin immediately broke out for months. Ever since I started using this system again, I&#x27;m all clear!</li>
            <li> My name is Lisa rosario I have had acne since the age of fourteen, I tried your product my skin is clear n smooth thank you</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in the stores.  Most of my favorite retailers sell out of this quickly.  Thank goodness for Amazon.com.  I am able to order it at anytime.  It works better than Proactiv.  Proactiv would burn my face.  Acnefree does not, and keeps my face looking nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> My boyfriends uses this on his face every day. His skin is looking good. I think he would recommend it, and so do I.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like the 10% cleaners and is very light and easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I love how cheap this is compared to Proactiv.  Works Great for my skin.  It definitely is worth trying so you can save money.</li>
            <li> We keep buying it because it keeps working. Price is good too.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, the beads in it are sparse and a complete joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather, which is fine with me, but the formula of its cream like substance clogs my pores, making acne worse. The item is a contradictory to itself. It reminds me of Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser, which did the exact same thing to my skin after a long period of use. The ingredients leave a film on your face, so it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing your face with conditioner. I&#x27;ve come across much better non lather facial cleansers that actually leave the face feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed I out. After 1.5 months of use, I used too much of it to be able to return. will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> never tried this brand before now and don&#x27;t care for it at all.  i&#x27;m talking about the product only.  thank you.</li>
            <li> If salicylic acid washes haven&#x27;t quelled your acne, give this a try without a commitment to monthly deliveries of a well marketed acne package. This contains gentle cleansing grains that exfoliate and deep cleanse the skin and kill the bacteria causes acne. It&#x27;s not always at Target or Ulta but usually can be found here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and I like this product.  It is a lot less expensive than proactiv.</li>
            <li> I found this product works as well as the outragiously priced items.  I thought Amazon didn&#x27;t have it any more, I will check again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun, tumeric face masks that turned my skin yellow, benzoyl peroxcide face masks and washed every sylic acid treament out there, even prescriptions for my skin have never really done anything. I&#x27;ve used every clean and clear, clearasil, strydex, neutrogena thing out there to no avail. But, I washed every morning and every night with this face wash, I used clinique&#x27;s facail moisturized just a bit after washing and treated my spots which can be either cystic or whiteheads or blackheads with the acnefree spot terminator, and I also used the sulfur face mask a few times a week always using moisturizer afterwards. Which is something I had never dreamed of doing before - I have oily skin and so the idea of putting moisturizer on it seemed insane but it all worked. It&#x27;s been just under a month and almost all my spots are gone. I&#x27;ve had one or two TINY spots pop up but beyond that any discoloration still on my skin is what is currently healing there&#x27;s no soreness to it or fluid in it anymore at all. I&#x27;m so impressed I really recommend this product I know I&#x27;ll be keeping it in my bathroom for as long as they make it. It&#x27;s been such a relief after fourteen years to be able to go outside without feeling like I have to hide my face under makeup or wear my hair down to try and hide my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the high dollar products.</li>
            <li> its great for oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40s and still have minor acne.  This helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for well over 10 years and for my oily skin type this product keep my break outs at bay.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for those who have oily skin or breakouts.  It cleans very thoroughly without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived damaged in box.  Most product leaked into box.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin does not like Proactiv, it loves this stuff. I keep buying it because it keeps my breakouts at bay. Not just for the young! this never dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I stained some towels. I rinsed as i normally would, but looking at the towels later, they stained where I had dried my face off. Couldn&#x27;t have been from anything else. So I just use white towels.....it&#x27;s worth the savings. Bought proactiv for years, boo hoo losing all that money!</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Found this baby at Dollar tree !!!! After a horrible breakout that lasted a month, pimple after pimple . I know it was because I didn&#x27;t clean my make up brushes for months . (I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit it) I was using saint Ives scrub with 2% Salic acid with no success . This product gave me perfect skin in one week. It dried out my pimples and i noticed it reduced and faded old acne scars. It does dry out your face, so use a moisturizer after each use. I will be going back to dollar tree and purchasing 10 more. So if you&#x27;re on a budget this is the product to seek.</li>
            <li> Middle aged woman who used to get chronic blind pimples on my jawline- haven&#x27;t had one in two years since using this product.  the bottle lasts for about 6 months of daily usage- such a great product!</li>
            <li> Great and works well but dries out the face ðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> Always a great product &amp; even can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Seemed to be a different formula. More watery and different smelling. Not as clean a feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she said it worked great. I agree because when I saw her, her face looked better. She doesn&#x27;t have full blown acne but she does have blemishes and this seemed to help. Her face also looks brighter. She is happier now going to school. That makes me happy. Thanks for a great product!!!</li>
            <li> not work so perfect and the smell is not good</li>
