            <li>and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this soap again, I really like the bar soap</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I also use it to shampoo my hair, and it cleanses really well.</li>
            <li>Its a very unisex smell.  </li>
            <li>I really want to sell it myself.</li>

            <li>Yes, the bar soap is way messier and can get used up pretty quickly if you do not cover it up to keep it dry, but I just prefer it.  </li>
            <li>I love using the black soap to wash my face and the minty-ness of this</li>
            <li>my skin feels better with the bar of Black soap rather than this &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; wash</li>

            <li> And the price is not too outrageous.  </li>

            <li> I had bought this in the past and loved it, but this is not the same, not dark like it used to be, and had a weird funky smell.  Still lathered nice, but I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have fair, super sensitive skin.  This soap works equally well on both face and body.  It cleans and leaves skin feeling great.  It treats my acne and dry skin better than more expensive products.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> This surpasses any of the Body Washes out there.  Leaves you feeling clean, and the scent is wonderful to the senses.  I have purchased this product several times, and I recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for the clean, fresh feeling.  It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> Very rich lather but does not dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave, film rinses off and leave skin feeling moist and looking great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product exclusively for a good length of time so I&#x27;m not sure of the longer term benefits.  I love the smell and refreshing influence of the lime juice.  I look forward to ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo in the past and really liked it.  It worked well for oily har as well, the last shipment I recieved was runny,not thick and creamy and left my hair this morning a little oily. I&#x27;m not sure if the other bottles wil have the same issue I bought three of them?  I tryed to shake it up but nothing changed?  Not sure but it did work well before.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dudu Osun black bar soap for years and I absolutely adore it. I am white with long, thick, fine hair and a slightly oily complexion. I have, on several occasions, used the bar soap to wash my hair and, although it comes out squeaky clean, it is very difficult to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence the reason I purchased the shampoo. This is not nearly as good as  the bar soap as far as cleaning power. I need to wash my hair twice in order to not feel the oil in my scalp afterward. That being said, it smells nice and leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not buy it again due to the price and the fact that the quantity is almost cut in half by the washing twice thing. I wouldn&#x27;t try to dissuade anyone else from trying it out though...we&#x27;re all different.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this soap again, I really like the bar soap and I thought this was the same but it is not.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It makes you feel very clean.  And the price is not too outrageous.  The smell is refreshing too.</li>
            <li> Works well on skin and rashes. Compared to other products.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get results.</li>
            <li> It moisten my hair without stripping out the natural oils and it really cleanse the hair.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap makes my skin very smooth without the drying out feeling as well.  However, if you have sensitive skin you may want to read all ingredients.  The fragrance did give me a particular backlash, but I should not have used when I smelled the fragrance.  If you do not have skin allergies, you definitely have no worries.  All in all, you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> I would definately reccomend this to anyone.  Being a senior with fiar skin..&lt;br /&gt;whatever is used on my face is very delicate.  This leaves your skin feeling&lt;br /&gt;soft. amazingly clean, and very gentle.  VERY little needed for use.  Highly&lt;br /&gt;reccomend!!!!  I use a mixture of coconut oil and shey butter afterwards..&lt;br /&gt;Both 100% pure..</li>
            <li> I buy the Dudu Osun bar soap religiously and when I saw this I just had to try it. It is really minty which is different than the bars but it works well. I love using the black soap to wash my face and the minty-ness of this makes it that more refreshing. The bar soap I believe cleans better, it will strip the day away in one good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Just ok its nothing to brag about. my skin feels better with the bar of Black soap rather than this &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; wash</li>
            <li> It works so well - easier than using the soap - I use both of them. Will purchase again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I prefer the bar soap instead.  Yes, the bar soap is way messier and can get used up pretty quickly if you do not cover it up to keep it dry, but I just prefer it.  The liquid is better for travel (hence less messy).  AND- the liquid works better for hair and scalp than the bar.  It left my hair squeaky clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few of the black soaps out there and this to me is a good one. I look for a soap that lathers well, cleans thoroughly, rinses clean, and has a pleasant smell. This one does all that.</li>
            <li> I like this soap thank you very much...</li>
            <li> I really love this soap.  It smells great and is soft on the skin.  I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great if it could be sourced in the UK, though!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - my skin loved it too</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my teenagers skin to combat acne. It smells really good and did a good job with bringing the blackheads to the surface.  Now her skin is perfect again. There was no ugly dryness or bad effects. I like this soap because it is effective, clean smelling and very natural.</li>
            <li> Works better for my skin than most other soaps.  Good for acne and will not dry your skin.  Do try.</li>
            <li> These stuff right here is heaven sent.  I am an African America man who has struggled with shaving bumps also known as PFB and the discoloration that it leaves behind.  I previously used Menscience products for shaving.  It was a good product and helped tremendously; However it still had some shaving bumps leftover and a lot of discoloration.  I&#x27;ve been using the Herbal African Black Soap for about 3 weeks and all I can say is WoW!!.  My razor bumps and discoloration are almost gone.  This stuff works miracles.  J&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  To maximize results rub black soap in thoroughly and let it sit on your face for about 3 minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li> Love this soap,  It lathers well, smells great, and makes my skin so soft.  I also use it to shampoo my hair, and it cleanses really well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful body soap - and yes, I would use it as a facial wash as well. It smells just wonderful  and fresh. Its a very unisex smell.  I appreciate the purity of it and greatly prefer this over the bar soap, which is effective and smells great as well - but disintegrates quickly and can look quite unattractive in your shower as the the soap residue leaves a brown trail.  I highly recommend you at least try it once if you are considering it. I can&#x27;t really imagine someone not loving this soap!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I really like the creamy texture of this black soap and how it lathers.  I have used the bar form of black soap for years and I prefer the liquid form.</li>
            <li> It does not make suds like the bar soap.</li>
            <li> Real gentle and feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Overwelming appreciation for this product. I really want to sell it myself. I tell everybody I come in contact with how it makes me feel. I love it. I have used it for years and love that I can use it all over.</li>
