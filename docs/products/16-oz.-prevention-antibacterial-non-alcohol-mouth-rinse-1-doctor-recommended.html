            <li>Pleasant taste and heals all kinds of mouth and gum issues FAST!</li>
            <li>love this product, makes my mouth feel so clean and freash</li>
            <li>I use to buy at Wal-Green but they no longer have it  nor does any other store in this area soooo went on line to fine it and very happy I did.</li>
            <li>Prevention Antibacterial Non Alcohol Mouth Rinse is great, especially for those people who tend to get mouth problems like Thrush, etc.</li>
            <li>A bit more pricey,  but worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Still like the refreshing taste, and feel in my mouth much muh better than others I had tried.</li>
            <li>AND I FREQUANTLY GET THRUSH, AND THIS PRODUCT REALLY HELPS !!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really helped keep me more comfortable and pain free.  </li>
            <li>I use it as mouthwash and also to clean dental trays.</li>
            <li>Hard to find, but an excellent choice for people who don&#x27;t like the burn of mouth wash with alcohol.</li>
            <li>It does not taste like peroxide nor medicinal, but it also does not taste like sweet flavoring either.</li>
            <li>Soap leave film on the trays, so this has been a real blessing and better, safer cleaner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has no bad taste.</li>
            <li>I had a mild case of thrush and this product cleared it up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gentle on my gums, and not bad tasting.!</li>
            <li>I have been using this mouthwash for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Has a great minty flavor that is not too strong or weak; it&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li>It gets a little frothy, but I have noticed a remarkable improvement and my mouth is not as sore.  </li>
            <li>Took pain away fast!</li>
            <li>I am on my second order of this mouth rinse and am pleased that it contains no alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product if the over the counter mouth rinses that contain alcohol is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>Will not cure, however it made the pain very tolerable.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all my friends with similar problems, and they&#x27;ve all had success, too!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t magic or some odd home remedy; the mouthwash contains hydrogen peroxide, which cleans the area, and zinc, which protects the area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product, doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol (which can dry out your mouth and screw with helpful bacteria), and clears up my cracks within a day or two, tops.</li>
            <li>recent years I have not been able to find Prevention Mouth rinse at the local drug stores, so I have been ordering it from  Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you want a product that blows this junk off the shelves try Colgate Peroxyl Antiseptic -- while if might cost a little more depending on where you get it</li>
            <li>I use this a few times and I&#x27;m all better....</li>
            <li>But the mouthwash does more than that... if you bite your cheek you can rub a little of the mouthwash on the bite and within a day the bite will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have used it in the past and glad to find it on line.</li>
            <li>I have multiple allergies and this product has pure ingredients that I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li>and I am old and have tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li>small drawback is that I used to be able to buy it in my local drugstore, but now can&#x27;t find it anywhere except on line.  </li>
            <li>We used to purchase this at a local pharmacy but they stopped carrying it and after trying multiple alcohol free mouth washes we came to the conclusion that other mouth washes don&#x27;t burn his mouth</li>
            <li>I have chronic dry mouth related to a health condition and have developed some gum disease along with thrush problems.  </li>
            <li>which had healed - my mouth was still very sensitive to other mouth rinses.  </li>

            <li> It is a great product but very expensive when ordered on line!  </li>
            <li> The ONLY mouth rinse that works for dry mouth and sores on the tongue brought on by reactions to chemo.  </li>
            <li> I get oral thrush often due to my Multiple Sclerosis and have to use Nystatin</li>
            <li> I just bought 2 bottles today at Canton, Michigan Meijer on Ford/ Canton Center Road.</li>
            <li> This does not burn the skin inside my mouth like other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I also use it on other parts of the body to heal other sores.  </li>
            <li> Relief was nearly instant, and the sore, which had been there almost a week (and only getting worse, before this rinse) was GONE after 2 days of rinsing twice a day.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s not worth it, but</li>
            <li> This stuff clears up mouth sores as well as other little sores in the corner of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by a previous dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I have been unable to find it in any local stores for several months.....</li>
            <li> The only downside is i think it might be dissolving some of my fillings slowly although I am not sure about this.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble with canker sores, and this product was recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy it from the manufacturer&#x27;s website (www.newagemfg.com).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can not find it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past and it works to kill all kinds of bacteria</li>
            <li> The other bottle was broken in the mail.</li>
            <li> least you get a product that works.  </li>
            <li> Prevention mouthwash is the only product that I have ever found that prevents either of these two from flaring up and getting quite painful.</li>
            <li> No biggie but sometimes frustrating.</li>
            <li> Truly a case of lousy product being 5 starred by coerced or paid</li>
            <li> Had a bad sore throat and this did the trick in two days.</li>
            <li> Cleared up a painful canker sore within 2 days.</li>
            <li> IT was awful and painful.  </li>
            <li> It also does not contain alcohol, which is a plus for me &amp; does not taste nasty.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After having mouth sores from chemo. which had healed - my mouth was still very sensitive to other mouth rinses.  Prevention turned out to be a life saver, I have been using it for quite some time now and even my dentist has commented on how great my mouth looks - very clean - no bacteria etc.&lt;br /&gt;One small drawback is that I used to be able to buy it in my local drugstore, but now can&#x27;t find it anywhere except on line.  No biggie but sometimes frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have recurring periodontal problems.  sometimes my gums get sore and swollen.  I dilute this rinse with water in my water-pick.  It gets a little frothy, but I have noticed a remarkable improvement and my mouth is not as sore.  I wish I had found this years ago!</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis and acid ulcers. Prevention mouthwash is the only product that I have ever found that prevents either of these two from flaring up and getting quite painful. But the mouthwash does more than that... if you bite your cheek you can rub a little of the mouthwash on the bite and within a day the bite will be completely gone. It isn&#x27;t magic or some odd home remedy; the mouthwash contains hydrogen peroxide, which cleans the area, and zinc, which protects the area.</li>
            <li> Reduced my mouth sores from chemo.</li>
            <li> love this product, makes my mouth feel so clean and freash</li>
            <li> The ONLY mouth rinse that works for dry mouth and sores on the tongue brought on by reactions to chemo.  I am glad I found it on Amazon because no place sells it anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is EXCELLENT. I had a mild case of thrush and this product cleared it up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and it is very effective and has a pleasant taste. I have multiple allergies and this product has pure ingredients that I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but an excellent choice for people who don&#x27;t like the burn of mouth wash with alcohol. It works great as a rinse or on any kind of mouth sores.</li>
            <li> Ive only had this for a short time, so i dont know how it will help heal my mouth ulcers but it does feel good as a rince its clean and refreashing!</li>
            <li> This product is good for those who have severe throat pain, and mouth pain. I have throat cancer, and it was a godsend until I could have my surgery. Will not cure, however it made the pain very tolerable. Of course this was just my personal experience.</li>
            <li> My wife had some sores in her mouth and ordered this and says it works and has just ordered some more.  She almost ordered the 8 unit case which would have been a substantial savings.  If your Listerine isn&#x27;t working for you, you might do well to try this.</li>
            <li> Best mouth rinse to keep canker sores away!  Dealt with severe mouth sores for years.  Found the most relief and prevention with this rinse</li>
            <li> LOL. Truly a case of lousy product being 5 starred by coerced or paid reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware. This stuff is basically just watery hydrogen peroxide.  If you want a product that blows this junk off the shelves try Colgate Peroxyl Antiseptic -- while if might cost a little more depending on where you get it --at least you get a product that works.  Ok all you paid reviewers -- go for it!</li>
            <li> THE WIFE SWEARS BY THIS PRODUCT.  SO GLAD TO FIND IT.</li>
            <li> Works great. It was definitely a good purchase</li>
            <li> Works great. Took pain away fast!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouthwash for several years and love it!  I have a tendency to get thrush whenever I take antibiotics or steroids and this helps keep that in check.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and have been using it for years. It was recommended by a previous dental hygienist. I usually buy it from the manufacturer&#x27;s website (www.newagemfg.com).</li>
            <li> It is the only mouth wash I&#x27;ve found that heals a sore mouth.  Unfortunately, I can not find it locally anymore.  I don&#x27;t know why the local drugstores and grocerys don&#x27;t  stock it anymore.</li>
            <li> This rinse is awesome. Recommended by my husband&#x27;s dentist after oral surgery years ago. Have used ever since. No burning. Pleasant taste and heals all kinds of mouth and gum issues FAST!</li>
            <li> Had a bad sore throat and this did the trick in two days. Wish our local CVS or Walgreens stores would carry it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it made any difference.</li>
            <li> The other bottle was broken in the mail.</li>
            <li> Prevention Antibacterial Non Alcohol Mouth Rinse is great, especially for those people who tend to get mouth problems like Thrush, etc. from medications they have to take. My respiratory therapist recommended it years ago.  It also does not contain alcohol, which is a plus for me &amp; does not taste nasty.  It is a great product but very expensive when ordered on line!  For some reason, I have been unable to find it in any local stores for several months.....what&#x27;s up with that??</li>
            <li> Great for keeping my teeth clean and keeping my gums healthy.  I have chronic dry mouth related to a health condition and have developed some gum disease along with thrush problems.  This seems to help prevent the thrush and remove tartar build up, in addition to relieving some of the gum pain.  The only downside is i think it might be dissolving some of my fillings slowly although I am not sure about this.  Still definitely 5 star product...I just wish it was easier to find! Thank god for the internets.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have used it in the past and glad to find it on line.I will use it again.</li>
            <li> My spouse had a kidney transplant and one of the anti rejection medications causes occasional mouth sores/canker sores. It&#x27;s amazing that there is no in-store product comparable to this one. We used to purchase this at a local pharmacy but they stopped carrying it and after trying multiple alcohol free mouth washes we came to the conclusion that other mouth washes don&#x27;t burn his mouth but they don&#x27;t help it heal either -  this one does. with so many people taking chemotherapy or being transplant recipients this is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that Prevention has an actual Oncology rinse as well but this one is the one that was recommended and also worked for my husband.</li>
            <li> I am on my second order of this mouth rinse and am pleased that it contains no alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I just received my second order and plan to continue ordering it through Amazon as I haven&#x27;t seen it in my local stores.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found. It does not taste like peroxide nor medicinal, but it also does not taste like sweet flavoring either. I use it as mouthwash and also to clean dental trays. This does not burn the skin inside my mouth like other mouthwash. Soap leave film on the trays, so this has been a real blessing and better, safer cleaner. A friend found this for me while traveling; I have never seen it for sale in NYC (yet).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for about 6 months, since moving away from alcohol based products. Still like the refreshing taste, and feel in my mouth much muh better than others I had tried. A bit more pricey,  but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Prevention for about five years. I use  5 inhalers a day for my asthma and this product gives me that extra line of defense against thrush. I love it!</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders for mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT SLEEP WELL AND I FREQUANTLY GET THRUSH, AND THIS PRODUCT REALLY HELPS !!!  IT TASTES GOOD, AND I KNOW IT IS HELPING IN KEEPING MY MOUTH BACTERIA FREE..</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anybody. I&#x27;ve used it in the past and it works to kill all kinds of bacteria&#x27;s if you use it every couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no bad taste. Feels great after using it. And this is the cheapest price you&#x27;ll find it. Most places on the web are selling it for over a hundred bucks! Not that it&#x27;s not worth it, but that&#x27;s way expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend anybody purchase this mouth rinse as it is the best on the market!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002NHBPPC Prevention Non-Alcoholic Mouth Rinse - Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse, 16 oz - 12 Per Case - Model OTC6155]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent years I have not been able to find Prevention Mouth rinse at the local drug stores, so I have been ordering it from  Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product if the over the counter mouth rinses that contain alcohol is uncomfortable.  I&#x27;ve used Prevention for several years and it has help me with ulcers too.</li>
            <li> This stuff clears up mouth sores as well as other little sores in the corner of the mouth.  I also use it on other parts of the body to heal other sores.  It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Best mouth wash I have ever used i and I am old and have tried a lot of them. I use to buy at Wal-Green but they no longer have it  nor does any other store in this area soooo went on line to fine it and very happy I did. think it belongs in every home.</li>
            <li> Has a great minty flavor that is not too strong or weak; it&#x27;s just right! Love the way my mouth feels after using this!</li>
            <li> works great for canker sores</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  If I get a sore throat or thrush I use this a few times and I&#x27;m all better.... Get this stuff it awesome!</li>
            <li> I got bitten by a spider on my tongue.  IT was awful and painful.  This stuff really helped keep me more comfortable and pain free.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are trying to find this product, I have good news! All Meijer stores carry it. I just bought 2 bottles today at Canton, Michigan Meijer on Ford/ Canton Center Road. $5.99 per bottle. I was so excited to find it, although I had to do a lot of research to locate it!!! It&#x27;s the only mouth rinse that works 4 me!</li>
            <li> Cleared up a painful canker sore within 2 days. Relief was nearly instant, and the sore, which had been there almost a week (and only getting worse, before this rinse) was GONE after 2 days of rinsing twice a day.</li>
            <li> I get oral thrush often due to my Multiple Sclerosis and have to use Nystatin so I was looking for anything that would help keep a balance in my oral health. This product has changed my life. I use it after brushing in the morning and at night. I haven&#x27;t had a thrush outbreak since I purchased it. I told my dentist about it.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with canker sores, and this product was recommended by my dentist.  I had 1-2 canker sores inside my mouth each week. Now I have NONE.</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;prevention&amp;#34; for mouth ulcers!</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m stressed out, I often get infected cracks in the corners of my mouth -- especially in winter. They&#x27;d persist for weeks or more until I tried this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost ten years, only as-needed. It&#x27;s a fantastic product, doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol (which can dry out your mouth and screw with helpful bacteria), and clears up my cracks within a day or two, tops. I recommend it to all my friends with similar problems, and they&#x27;ve all had success, too!</li>
            <li> excellent mouth wash, that helped to heal my mouthsores after dental work. Gentle on my gums, and not bad tasting.!</li>
