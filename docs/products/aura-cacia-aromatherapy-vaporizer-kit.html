            <li>Perfect.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>

            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I am always very delighted with all my purchases from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s especially nice for children&#x27;s rooms, as there&#x27;s no heat involved (which is also good for the therapeutic qualities of your oils) and no way to over-saturate the room with oil.  </li>
            <li>It works great for traveling.</li>
            <li>This has been great in helping our toddler get to sleep.</li>
            <li>The vaporizer is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have a fancy diffuser at home that uses water and puts out a stream and works great, puts out a lot of scent.</li>
            <li>i bought this as a gift but as soon as my friend opened it we plugged it in and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Great filter and fan combo for aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>It has successful dispersed fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a good find.  </li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>

            <li>Fabulous product!!</li>
            <li>A great deal and can&#x27;t beat the free lavender oil that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to throw a soothing scent in the air as well as have a nice noise over the colder months.</li>
            <li>This will make your house smell nice</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a good quality oil to give the stronger scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser and the price was GREAT!</li>
            <li>Nice machine.</li>
            <li>This is a nice unit</li>
            <li>It is nice soothing fragrances from now on, lavender being a favorite and Thieves Oil if anyone is feeling under the weather.</li>
            <li>The Aroma smells good and clean.</li>
            <li>and so far, I am loving it!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gives the room a nice smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and ok - not for me.</li>
            <li>It is safe, as there is no heat.</li>
            <li>Contacted the company they stated we have to buy more filters.</li>
            <li>Why couldnt they give us more than one filter?</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser; mine is identical but branded as a Fan Fuser.  </li>
            <li>would love to have one for every room...</li>
            <li>just love this diffuser</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than saturating a pad and blowing air over it.</li>
            <li>WELL--FEEL MUCH BETTER--</li>
            <li>My geranium oil filled the air though!  </li>
            <li>This is okay for what it is.</li>
            <li>Would be better if I could get replacement filters.</li>
            <li>The product works just ok..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find the perfect essential oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The water ones work much better than this one</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not supposed to heat them, but so many people do.  </li>
            <li>I bought years ago, This is my favorite diffuser.</li>
            <li>Been looking for something safe and not have to worry  about water levels .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Now I will have to buy more pads just to use this product.</li>
            <li>I excited to get to use it!</li>
            <li>Works great, and smells wonderful but the aroma does not last long ..have to keep adding oil drops thruout day</li>
            <li>it was relatively easy to pry apart the glued housing to see what the problem was.  </li>
            <li>it is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I also own the type that uses water which is 100% better and very quite.</li>
            <li>After that it was easy.</li>
            <li>Went through the included oil very quickly.</li>
            <li>and the smell is still too strong for me to use.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a really good diffuser, I highly recommend the h2eo ultrasonic diffuser.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>This is such a great option to candles or airfreshners.  </li>
            <li>Works great at filling an entire floor of our home with scent.</li>
            <li>It is now March 2015 and the diffuser is finally free of the plastic odor.</li>
            <li>Young Living has good diffusers but tend to be $$</li>
            <li>The lavender oil that&#x27;s included isn&#x27;t realm potent by itself and  I had to keep applying more drops to try to achieve a real noticable fragrant effect.  </li>
            <li>I love the first one</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the amazing smells of essential oils throughout my home!</li>
            <li>I needed another after I got the first and liked it so much.</li>
            <li>We love these so much we ended up buying another one for our daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>I had looked at purchasing one earlier but couldn&#x27;t find a good price.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this since I burn candles all the time for that &amp;#34;Spa&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>Its compact size makes for quick portability from one area to another, and finding a place to set it is a snap.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and ordering extra filters is easy too.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use so far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Actually, since you don&#x27;t use that many drops of most oils, you can also mark the side of the filter and use one filter for more than one scent at different times.</li>
            <li>I have not tried a variety of oils yet, perhaps I will hit one that make the use of electricity worth while.</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>so I could use it right away.</li>
            <li>It looked very promising.</li>
            <li>This was very fast turn around time.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly except that the fan mechanism broke loose inside the unit when it was dropped; that&#x27;s my fault, but that did knock my rating down a star for fragility.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted for my twins&#x27; room.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for the first 20</li>
            <li>Almost better to put a cotton ball with essential oil on your bed stand</li>
            <li>I love the concept but whatever essentiel oil is put on the filter is dispersed into&lt;br /&gt;the air virtually in the first 10 minutes leaving nothing left.</li>
            <li>The one thing that did surprise me is the recommendation to just put 1-3 drops on the filter, but it took quite a bit more to actually smell it in the air.</li>
            <li>It helps me sleep much better at night with the soft sound and aroma from the Essential oils.</li>
            <li>It always works consistently, the smell is always consistent, no fuzz just reliable, simple, easy to maintain and replace filter.</li>
            <li>Good product, it is not noisy, it works well, but we need to put several drops for a big room.</li>
            <li>The only thing I noted is that with a good quality essential oil it fades out after about an hour or so.</li>
            <li>However I was surprised at the strong smell of plastic this new one has.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and simple.</li>
            <li>The low hum is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>If you have big room, high ceilings or a large house, these probably won&#x27;t do much for you unless you use more than 10+ drops of oil on the pads.</li>
            <li>I also wish there was a timer so it turned off after a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The filter that came with the unit is still fine, and I haven&#x27;t even considered replacing it with the extra filter I bought.</li>
            <li>Nice little machine.</li>
            <li>It works really well--</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving this item.</li>
            <li>The unit works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser-</li>
            <li>I so enjoy the scents of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Save your money, buy a REAL diffuser.</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier.</li>
            <li>it can make the whole house smell</li>
            <li>so much I have 2 in my home.</li>
            <li>They are a very dependable air diffuser.</li>
            <li>It does not work very well either.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of a waste.</li>
            <li>the scent is strong and pure from one single drop.</li>
            <li>I may have to get more for other rooms.</li>
            <li>I have a small master bedroom (11 x 13) and it emits a nice fragrance into the air while we sleep throughout the night.</li>
            <li>SUPER QUIET!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have an older version of this diffuser and like the simplicity and effectiveness of it.  </li>
            <li>Although I can hear it humming, unlike an older unit (no longer made)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty large, and the insert to add the oil is at the bottom, underneath, which is different for me.</li>
            <li>Is that normal?</li>
            <li>I normally like church</li>
            <li>First I really like the diffuser, it puts out alot of scent for only about 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops more and get the strength I want.</li>
            <li>But other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>purchased a second filter to try with the Breathe Right blend.</li>
            <li>and I could only smell it if I was right over it and even then after about an hour, close up I couldn&#x27;t smell anything.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited when this came, but it hardly puts out any aroma at all.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s the case then I will repost a new review.</li>
            <li>I love this little vaporizer!</li>
            <li>I am used to a window fan over the summer and love the quiet hum that drowns out other noises.</li>
            <li>Overall im very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>When I was in the hospital they used this exact same machine.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the way I needed it to for the essential oils.</li>
            <li>but it is not quiet like the first.  </li>
            <li>I bought replacement filters from the Frontier Co-op website (same as Aura Cacia), so I can keep certain things separate.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a little cheaply made for the price.</li>
            <li>; as another reviewer mentioned, pure essential oils will evaporate almost entirely... leaving the pad ready to be used again.  </li>
            <li>This is so loud</li>
            <li>and you really need to use a lot of oil with it to make it last.</li>
            <li>I have 2 young kids</li>
            <li>It does not diffuse fast enough.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and that it came with an essential oil</li>
            <li>unfortunately, you can&#x27;t use it if you intend to meditate using aromatherapy is too noisy because of the fan, saying it if you want to use it just as a vaporizer is a good product.</li>
            <li>evaporate rather quickly and does not last long.</li>
            <li>It came with a small bottle of lavender essential oil, a nice touch as Aura Cacia has the finest essential oils.</li>
            <li>It does release the smell and works fine if you have a small room.</li>
            <li>I would love to return and get my money back but not sure if I can at this time</li>
            <li>Have a low and high level.</li>
            <li>This vaporizer has a high and low setting and the low is barely noticeable and the high still not considered loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a diffuser before, through Young Life, and you could barely hear the fan.</li>
            <li>The scent pad is large, so you can use it for several different scents.</li>
            <li>It has two operating speeds the lower of which works very well not only for dispersing aromatherapy oils, but as a &#x27;white noise&#x27; generator at night to help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for small rooms like a small bedroom or small living room.</li>
            <li>It has a slight rattle and is pretty loud.</li>
            <li>This little device is definitely powerful when you need it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had spent a little more for something bigger.  </li>
            <li>This one the scent doesn&#x27;t last long no matter how much oil you put on the pad.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would need to buy several, but I see now that the scent gets completely diffused, so reusing the pad it came with will not be a problem.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quiet and small enough to put it in just about any room.</li>
            <li>I will be sending it back and requesting a new, quiet unit.</li>
            <li>There is one in my main living area &amp; one on the other side of the house in my bedroom with &amp;#34;relaxing oils&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Also, the discs seem wasteful, if you reuse it too many times it leaks oil, if you only put a little bit on it&#x27;s pointless.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not super loud, but loud enough to disguise household noises while my twin babies are sleeping.</li>
            <li>Too bad I don&#x27;t have enough $ to get another good one.</li>

            <li> It is now March 2015 and the diffuser is finally free of the plastic odor.</li>
            <li> Young Living has good diffusers but tend to be $$</li>
            <li> The lavender oil that&#x27;s included isn&#x27;t realm potent by itself and  I had to keep applying more drops to try to achieve a real noticable fragrant effect.  </li>
            <li> I love the first one</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the amazing smells of essential oils throughout my home!</li>
            <li> I needed another after I got the first and liked it so much.</li>
            <li> We love these so much we ended up buying another one for our daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> I had looked at purchasing one earlier but couldn&#x27;t find a good price.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this since I burn candles all the time for that &amp;#34;Spa&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> Its compact size makes for quick portability from one area to another, and finding a place to set it is a snap.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and ordering extra filters is easy too.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use so far.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Actually, since you don&#x27;t use that many drops of most oils, you can also mark the side of the filter and use one filter for more than one scent at different times.</li>
            <li> I have not tried a variety of oils yet, perhaps I will hit one that make the use of electricity worth while.</li>
            <li> Right</li>
            <li> so I could use it right away.</li>
            <li> It looked very promising.</li>
            <li> This was very fast turn around time.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly except that the fan mechanism broke loose inside the unit when it was dropped; that&#x27;s my fault, but that did knock my rating down a star for fragility.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted for my twins&#x27; room.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for the first 20</li>
            <li> Almost better to put a cotton ball with essential oil on your bed stand</li>
            <li> I love the concept but whatever essentiel oil is put on the filter is dispersed into&lt;br /&gt;the air virtually in the first 10 minutes leaving nothing left.</li>
            <li> The one thing that did surprise me is the recommendation to just put 1-3 drops on the filter, but it took quite a bit more to actually smell it in the air.</li>
            <li> It helps me sleep much better at night with the soft sound and aroma from the Essential oils.</li>
            <li> It always works consistently, the smell is always consistent, no fuzz just reliable, simple, easy to maintain and replace filter.</li>
            <li> Good product, it is not noisy, it works well, but we need to put several drops for a big room.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noted is that with a good quality essential oil it fades out after about an hour or so.</li>
            <li> However I was surprised at the strong smell of plastic this new one has.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and simple.</li>
            <li> The low hum is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> If you have big room, high ceilings or a large house, these probably won&#x27;t do much for you unless you use more than 10+ drops of oil on the pads.</li>
            <li> I also wish there was a timer so it turned off after a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The filter that came with the unit is still fine, and I haven&#x27;t even considered replacing it with the extra filter I bought.</li>
            <li> Nice little machine.</li>
            <li> It works really well--</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this item.</li>
            <li> The unit works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser-</li>
            <li> I so enjoy the scents of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Save your money, buy a REAL diffuser.</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier.</li>
            <li> it can make the whole house smell</li>
            <li> so much I have 2 in my home.</li>
            <li> They are a very dependable air diffuser.</li>
            <li> It does not work very well either.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of a waste.</li>
            <li> the scent is strong and pure from one single drop.</li>
            <li> I may have to get more for other rooms.</li>
            <li> I have a small master bedroom (11 x 13) and it emits a nice fragrance into the air while we sleep throughout the night.</li>
            <li> SUPER QUIET!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have an older version of this diffuser and like the simplicity and effectiveness of it.  </li>
            <li> Although I can hear it humming, unlike an older unit (no longer made)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty large, and the insert to add the oil is at the bottom, underneath, which is different for me.</li>
            <li> Is that normal?</li>
            <li> I normally like church</li>
            <li> First I really like the diffuser, it puts out alot of scent for only about 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops more and get the strength I want.</li>
            <li> But other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> purchased a second filter to try with the Breathe Right blend.</li>
            <li> and I could only smell it if I was right over it and even then after about an hour, close up I couldn&#x27;t smell anything.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited when this came, but it hardly puts out any aroma at all.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s the case then I will repost a new review.</li>
            <li> I love this little vaporizer!</li>
            <li> I am used to a window fan over the summer and love the quiet hum that drowns out other noises.</li>
            <li> Overall im very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> When I was in the hospital they used this exact same machine.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the way I needed it to for the essential oils.</li>
            <li> but it is not quiet like the first.  </li>
            <li> I bought replacement filters from the Frontier Co-op website (same as Aura Cacia), so I can keep certain things separate.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a little cheaply made for the price.</li>
            <li> ; as another reviewer mentioned, pure essential oils will evaporate almost entirely... leaving the pad ready to be used again.  </li>
            <li> This is so loud</li>
            <li> and you really need to use a lot of oil with it to make it last.</li>
            <li> I have 2 young kids</li>
            <li> It does not diffuse fast enough.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and that it came with an essential oil</li>
            <li> unfortunately, you can&#x27;t use it if you intend to meditate using aromatherapy is too noisy because of the fan, saying it if you want to use it just as a vaporizer is a good product.</li>
            <li> evaporate rather quickly and does not last long.</li>
            <li> It came with a small bottle of lavender essential oil, a nice touch as Aura Cacia has the finest essential oils.</li>
            <li> It does release the smell and works fine if you have a small room.</li>
            <li> I would love to return and get my money back but not sure if I can at this time</li>
            <li> Have a low and high level.</li>
            <li> This vaporizer has a high and low setting and the low is barely noticeable and the high still not considered loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a diffuser before, through Young Life, and you could barely hear the fan.</li>
            <li> The scent pad is large, so you can use it for several different scents.</li>
            <li> It has two operating speeds the lower of which works very well not only for dispersing aromatherapy oils, but as a &#x27;white noise&#x27; generator at night to help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for small rooms like a small bedroom or small living room.</li>
            <li> It has a slight rattle and is pretty loud.</li>
            <li> This little device is definitely powerful when you need it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had spent a little more for something bigger.  </li>
            <li> This one the scent doesn&#x27;t last long no matter how much oil you put on the pad.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would need to buy several, but I see now that the scent gets completely diffused, so reusing the pad it came with will not be a problem.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quiet and small enough to put it in just about any room.</li>
            <li> I will be sending it back and requesting a new, quiet unit.</li>
            <li> There is one in my main living area &amp; one on the other side of the house in my bedroom with &amp;#34;relaxing oils&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Also, the discs seem wasteful, if you reuse it too many times it leaks oil, if you only put a little bit on it&#x27;s pointless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not super loud, but loud enough to disguise household noises while my twin babies are sleeping.</li>
            <li> Too bad I don&#x27;t have enough $ to get another good one.</li>
            <li> The filter gets dirty pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it would have come with a replacement filter as I can tell this one won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I do like this however the scents don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> fragrances doesnt  last long at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not great either.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I do find the Aura Cacia Diffuser doe&#x27;s not produce \\&quot;lasting\\&quot; aroma for too long.</li>
            <li> the fan is not loud at all.</li>
            <li> but I expected the aroma to last a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> This unit replaced one that I had for about 15 years, and this one actually cost less than what I paid back in the day.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out after 5-10 minutes and no longer gives off aroma.</li>
            <li> Like the different speeds of the fan, a few drops of the essential oil fills the room with the scent.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I anticipated</li>
            <li> I used peppermint and lemon one night and could not sleep a wink, my bad, I know better.</li>
            <li> The essential oil is placed onto a disc on the underside and a small fan circulates air up through the device and the scent is distributed.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I spent.  </li>
            <li> I always had a hard time using essential oils.</li>
            <li> I am also easily pleased, so for me to even be considering returning it, you know it must be annoying.  </li>
            <li> My wife had been slowly filling up the house with aromatic candles to the point where it started to look like a Catholic Church.  </li>
            <li> I am surprisingly disappointed in this diffuser due to the sound of the fan.</li>
            <li> However once I received it I was a little let down.</li>
            <li> - the plastic smell is still too strong for me to use - very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also, if you use different scents of oil, you need to wash the pad or the aroma you get is not good.</li>
            <li> If you do not clean the pad after every use it gets a funky smell.</li>
            <li> I misplaced the instructions so it took me a little while to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> I feel like you put a few drops on and it smells for an hour or so</li>
            <li> Place a few drops on the pad and the air passes through it.</li>
            <li> This unit does not hold the aroma past a few hours.</li>
            <li> very disappointed - unless I don&#x27;t know how to use it - I get more fragrance from applying the oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a small plastic fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to replace as they start leaking.  </li>
            <li> I fear I may have to return it, which I dread doing because I&#x27;m pretty lazy and hate to return things.</li>
            <li> This product, however is a little questionable.</li>
            <li> The cord was also wrapped in a sloppy way - I think perhaps it was someone else&#x27;s return.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult.  </li>
            <li> And to get any scent I basically need to have it in my face...and the fan makes me really cold.</li>
            <li> The instructions that come with the product are very vague.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I chose this diffuser, thinking it was used w/water, it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s well made and ok - not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great  have really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I am used to a window fan over the summer and love the quiet hum that drowns out other noises. I wanted something to throw a soothing scent in the air as well as have a nice noise over the colder months. This vaporizer has a high and low setting and the low is barely noticeable and the high still not considered loud. I have a small master bedroom (11 x 13) and it emits a nice fragrance into the air while we sleep throughout the night. I used peppermint and lemon one night and could not sleep a wink, my bad, I know better. It is nice soothing fragrances from now on, lavender being a favorite and Thieves Oil if anyone is feeling under the weather.</li>
            <li> Good product, it is not noisy, it works well, but we need to put several drops for a big room.</li>
            <li> I love this little vaporizer! It works really well--the scent is strong and pure from one single drop. It is safe, as there is no heat. And it serves as a white noise generator if you put it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting...it&#x27;s not super loud, but loud enough to disguise household noises while my twin babies are sleeping. The low setting is quiet and diffuses the scent just as well. The scent pad is large, so you can use it for several different scents. I thought I would need to buy several, but I see now that the scent gets completely diffused, so reusing the pad it came with will not be a problem. This is exactly what I wanted for my twins&#x27; room.</li>
            <li> It is just o.k.  Not bad, but not great either.  It seems to be a little cheaply made for the price.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this item. It looked very promising. However once I received it I was a little let down. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price. It&#x27;s just a small plastic fan. The essential oil is placed onto a disc on the underside and a small fan circulates air up through the device and the scent is distributed. The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This will make your house smell nice but it doesn&#x27;t actually diffuse the oils so it&#x27;s kind of a waste.</li>
            <li> The filter clogs up in one week of use, only comes with one filter. Contacted the company they stated we have to buy more filters.Why couldnt they give us more than one filter? especially if it stops working in 1 week?  The instructions that come with the product are very vague. Overall im very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser; mine is identical but branded as a Fan Fuser.  It works perfectly except that the fan mechanism broke loose inside the unit when it was dropped; that&#x27;s my fault, but that did knock my rating down a star for fragility.  I need to get out the gorilla glue and do some reconstructive surgery... it was relatively easy to pry apart the glued housing to see what the problem was.  This one&#x27;s especially nice for children&#x27;s rooms, as there&#x27;s no heat involved (which is also good for the therapeutic qualities of your oils) and no way to over-saturate the room with oil.  Put on the number of drops you want diffused, turn it on, and leave the room for the entire night if you&#x27;d like.    I have two pads and have never used the second; as another reviewer mentioned, pure essential oils will evaporate almost entirely... leaving the pad ready to be used again.  Users should not expect the scent to last forever, as once the oil has evaporated, the scent will be gone as well, and reapplication of the oil will be needed.  Price shopping might save you a bit over the Aura Cacia price... hint, hint. ;)</li>
            <li> Have a low and high level. It is quiet. Came with Eucalyptus. ..It seems last awhile. It works great for traveling. I like this product.</li>
            <li> I use my diffuser with Lavendar essential oil. It is so soothing and relaxing. I use about 10 drops instead if the 3 or 4 drops suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister enjoys using her diffuser with Breathe Right blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a second filter to try with the Breathe Right blend.</li>
            <li> I am surprisingly disappointed in this diffuser due to the sound of the fan. It has a slight rattle and is pretty loud. I&#x27;ve had a diffuser before, through Young Life, and you could barely hear the fan. This is so loud I fear I may have to return it, which I dread doing because I&#x27;m pretty lazy and hate to return things. I am also easily pleased, so for me to even be considering returning it, you know it must be annoying.  Bummer. If there were no rattle, I&#x27;d have no problem.  It is pretty large, and the insert to add the oil is at the bottom, underneath, which is different for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I spent.  I wish I had spent a little more for something bigger.  It does release the smell and works fine if you have a small room.</li>
            <li> The unit works very well.  Be sure to use a good quality oil to give the stronger scent.  Cheaper oils do not work well.</li>
            <li> I do like this however the scents don&#x27;t last long and you really need to use a lot of oil with it to make it last. But other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I anticipated but it is very quiet and works quite well. A great deal and can&#x27;t beat the free lavender oil that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I have two of these, one for the living room and one for the bedroom, so wonderful. I use the lavender oil, so relaxing and smells delicious.. would love to have one for every room... just love this diffuser it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser- it is lightweight and easy to handle. Its compact size makes for quick portability from one area to another, and finding a place to set it is a snap. I like that the essential oils are diffused by just a fan, rather than through heat. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy. This unit does not hold the aroma past a few hours. If you do not clean the pad after every use it gets a funky smell. Also, if you use different scents of oil, you need to wash the pad or the aroma you get is not good. I also own the type that uses water which is 100% better and very quite.</li>
            <li> After putting in 1-2 drops of oil the machine works but after 5 mintues there is no longer any vapors or any oil smell.  I should have purchased a diffuser instead.  I would love to return and get my money back but not sure if I can at this time</li>
            <li> Love it! The diffuser has been wonderful. It has met all my expectations. It is easy to use and simple.</li>
            <li> We love these so much we ended up buying another one for our daughter&#x27;s room. They are perfect for small rooms like a small bedroom or small living room. If you have big room, high ceilings or a large house, these probably won&#x27;t do much for you unless you use more than 10+ drops of oil on the pads. This has been great in helping our toddler get to sleep. We use lavender oil and keep it on low so there&#x27;s a night quiet humming of the fan.</li>
            <li> I am always very delighted with all my purchases from Amazon. This product, however is a little questionable. I so enjoy the scents of essential oils. I do find the Aura Cacia Diffuser doe&#x27;s not produce \\&quot;lasting\\&quot; aroma for too long.</li>
            <li> I have 2 young kids and I can&#x27;t have candles lit all the time.  This is such a great option to candles or airfreshners.  I highly recommend it.  I actually discovered it at work.  I work at a nursing home and our Rec department uses one of these for their sensory programs.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Save your money, buy a REAL diffuser. This is nothing more than saturating a pad and blowing air over it. Young Living has good diffusers but tend to be $$ but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quiet and small enough to put it in just about any room. I use it in my baby&#x27;s room while she sleeps so it is doubling as a whit noise machine too.</li>
            <li> The filter gets dirty pretty quick.  I also wish there was a timer so it turned off after a certain amount of time.  It does its job, but i wish i would&#x27;ve purchased a different one.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL--FEEL MUCH BETTER--CALMS ME</li>
            <li> When I was in the hospital they used this exact same machine. It is awesome!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The lavender oil that&#x27;s included isn&#x27;t realm potent by itself and  I had to keep applying more drops to try to achieve a real noticable fragrant effect.  My geranium oil filled the air though!  It blends well with the lavender.  The vaporizer is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 1 week and so far, I am loving it!! It is easy to use and gives the room a nice smell. I may have to get more for other rooms.</li>
            <li> This is okay for what it is. I feel like you put a few drops on and it smells for an hour or so and then its gone.</li>
            <li> Works great at filling an entire floor of our home with scent.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, you can&#x27;t use it if you intend to meditate using aromatherapy is too noisy because of the fan, saying it if you want to use it just as a vaporizer is a good product.</li>
            <li> Would be better if I could get replacement filters. Like the different speeds of the fan, a few drops of the essential oil fills the room with the scent.</li>
            <li> very disappointed - unless I don&#x27;t know how to use it - I get more fragrance from applying the oil then the actual vaporizer</li>
            <li> SUPER QUIET!!!!  Forgot it was on several times.  Very happy with it and would recommend to all.[[ASIN:B002Q4UCLK Aura Cacia Diffuser - Aromatherapy Vaporizer with Oil, 1.64]]</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and ordering extra filters is easy too.  It works exactly the way I needed it to for the essential oils.</li>
            <li> The product works just ok.. the smell of essentials oils disappears within 20 minutes or so.  It works pretty well for the first 20 but then it stops diffusing the aroma.  Did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find the perfect essential oil diffuser.  I&#x27;ve had various expensive ones.  The water ones work much better than this one but they don&#x27;t last very long.  I usually have to replace as they start leaking.  This one the scent doesn&#x27;t last long no matter how much oil you put on the pad.  It seems to dry out after 5-10 minutes and no longer gives off aroma.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser and the price was GREAT! I had looked at purchasing one earlier but couldn&#x27;t find a good price. The low hum is easy to get used to. I wish it had come with an extra pad, if it had I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It always works consistently, the smell is always consistent, no fuzz just reliable, simple, easy to maintain and replace filter.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use so far.  It has successful dispersed fragrance. I left it on for a couple of days and it hasn&#x27;t over heated.</li>
            <li> Nice little machine. The only thing I noted is that with a good quality essential oil it fades out after about an hour or so. Is that normal?</li>
            <li> Perfect.  I always had a hard time using essential oils. You&#x27;re not supposed to heat them, but so many people do.  You&#x27;re not supposed to use cookware you put them in afterward for food.  It&#x27;s difficult.  This makes it much easier.</li>
            <li> RETAIN SCENT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME!</li>
            <li> I misplaced the instructions so it took me a little while to figure out how to use it. I almost broke it until I read on another website that the filter fits INTO THE BOTTOM. Just turn it clockwise and it locks into place. After that it was easy. Seems to work quite well. I bought replacement filters from the Frontier Co-op website (same as Aura Cacia), so I can keep certain things separate. They say the scent dies out and you can put another scent on the same place, but I am picky. Actually, since you don&#x27;t use that many drops of most oils, you can also mark the side of the filter and use one filter for more than one scent at different times.</li>
            <li> I have an older version of this diffuser and like the simplicity and effectiveness of it.  However I was surprised at the strong smell of plastic this new one has.  It&#x27;s been outgasing for several weeks now and the smell is still too strong for me to use.  Will give it another month of airing.  I would not recommend this item to someone who has chemical sensitivities. May 2014 Update - the plastic smell is still too strong for me to use - very disappointing. It is now March 2015 and the diffuser is finally free of the plastic odor. Ordered another but it is not quiet like the first.  The cord was also wrapped in a sloppy way - I think perhaps it was someone else&#x27;s return.  I will be sending it back and requesting a new, quiet unit.</li>
            <li> I got this to use in my office. I have a fancy diffuser at home that uses water and puts out a stream and works great, puts out a lot of scent. I was super excited when this came, but it hardly puts out any aroma at all. And to get any scent I basically need to have it in my face...and the fan makes me really cold. Also, the discs seem wasteful, if you reuse it too many times it leaks oil, if you only put a little bit on it&#x27;s pointless. I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted so much oil trying to get this to work. Too bad I don&#x27;t have enough $ to get another good one. If you&#x27;re looking for a really good diffuser, I highly recommend the h2eo ultrasonic diffuser.</li>
            <li> My wife had been slowly filling up the house with aromatic candles to the point where it started to look like a Catholic Church.  I normally like church but I didn&#x27;t want to give my fire insurance a test so I decided to buy this.  For me, it takes the place of about 20 candles and when you set it next to a cooling fan (something you can&#x27;t do with a candle) it can make the whole house smell however you want it to.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you buy several oil application filters as you won&#x27;t want to mix the oils but that&#x27;s my personal choice.  This item will work with any oil so experiment with whatever you have.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. I love the first one so much I have 2 in my home. There is one in my main living area &amp; one on the other side of the house in my bedroom with &amp;#34;relaxing oils&amp;#34;. Works great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Although I can hear it humming, unlike an older unit (no longer made) I bought years ago, This is my favorite diffuser. Delivery was on time and item well packaged.</li>
            <li> Been looking for something safe and not have to worry  about water levels .&lt;br /&gt;This was a good find.  I have allergies, with this machine turned on and it&#x27;s vapors spreading my room( I like eucalyptus ) I sleep like a baby: wake up with no congestion whatsoever ever and I feel great!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this for kids ir adults who have allergies.</li>
            <li> This unit replaced one that I had for about 15 years, and this one actually cost less than what I paid back in the day. It has two operating speeds the lower of which works very well not only for dispersing aromatherapy oils, but as a &#x27;white noise&#x27; generator at night to help me fall asleep. It came with a small bottle of lavender essential oil, a nice touch as Aura Cacia has the finest essential oils.</li>
            <li> This was very fast turn around time. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this diffuser. I excited to get to use it!</li>
            <li> This little device is definitely powerful when you need it. Especially having a dog, I can turn on the diffuser and in only minutes the room smells like a spa. I only wish it would have come with a replacement filter as I can tell this one won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> First I really like the diffuser, it puts out alot of scent for only about 2 hrs. I have 4 dogs and like to have it run longer. I add a few drops more and get the strength I want. the fan is not loud at all. so all and all I like the product and have actuallythinking of getting another on for our bedroom.</li>
            <li> It does not diffuse fast enough. Almost better to put a cotton ball with essential oil on your bed stand</li>
            <li> I love the concept but whatever essentiel oil is put on the filter is dispersed into&lt;br /&gt;the air virtually in the first 10 minutes leaving nothing left.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift but as soon as my friend opened it we plugged it in and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this diffuser. The one thing that did surprise me is the recommendation to just put 1-3 drops on the filter, but it took quite a bit more to actually smell it in the air. Went through the included oil very quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice machine. Fair price. Good quality. Only problem is whatever oils you put on the pad underneath evaporate rather quickly and does not last long.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!! I use it daily at my office. The filter that came with the unit is still fine, and I haven&#x27;t even considered replacing it with the extra filter I bought.</li>
            <li> Works great, and smells wonderful but the aroma does not last long ..have to keep adding oil drops thruout day</li>
            <li> I really like this product and that it came with an essential oil so I could use it right away.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is not what I thought it would be. But it&#x27;s really cool and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the amazing smells of essential oils throughout my home!</li>
            <li> This is a nice unit but I expected the aroma to last a bit longer.  I have not tried a variety of oils yet, perhaps I will hit one that make the use of electricity worth while.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these. I needed another after I got the first and liked it so much. They are a very dependable air diffuser. It helps me sleep much better at night with the soft sound and aroma from the Essential oils.</li>
            <li> The Aroma smells good and clean. Dissipates odors like smoke and animal odors.  I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to burn candles or spray chemicals in the air.</li>
            <li> Great filter and fan combo for aromatherapy.  Heated plug in diffusers were causing my allergies to kick-in.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this since I burn candles all the time for that &amp;#34;Spa&amp;#34; smell.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was on except for the quiet fan. I used countless drops to see if that would do it and I could only smell it if I was right over it and even then after about an hour, close up I couldn&#x27;t smell anything.  I have only tried the oil that  came with it and will try another one to see if its the oil.  If that&#x27;s the case then I will repost a new review.</li>
            <li> Product is a fan with a pad insert.  Place a few drops on the pad and the air passes through it. The aroma lasts about 15 minutes and then dissipates. It works okay but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Did not realize that you have to you pads with it. Now I will have to buy more pads just to use this product. Would not buy this again. It does not work very well either.</li>
            <li> I think the oil vanishes or drys out before runs through machine.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrances doesnt  last long at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Quick shipping!</li>
