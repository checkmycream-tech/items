            <li>but it is ok.</li>
            <li>It does more than slouch, it engulfs.  </li>
            <li>This is a really cute hat.</li>
            <li>this has a great thickness to it which will really provide warmth along with your fashion.  </li>

            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>The button detail with leather cord makes it very unique.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable shipping and of course I loved the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and the color is true.</li>
            <li>as I expected :) nice colour, looks great  :)</li>
            <li>I super like the color and quality!</li>
            <li>and now I have a super cute hat.</li>
            <li>Super cute, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>Super cute - looks just like the pic.  </li>
            <li>Super cute and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very cute and not tight like many winter hats</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit that well.</li>
            <li>It came apart at the seams within a week of light use</li>
            <li>Nice vibrant color.  </li>
            <li>Will buy another color for this winter because I love it sooooo much!</li>
            <li>price was very good so also got one in black.</li>
            <li>color is true to picture.  </li>
            <li>And the color is true to the picture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to itchy hats and wear this very comfortably.</li>
            <li>I am very stylish, so I look for things that are different.  </li>
            <li>Overall highly satisfied!</li>
            <li>I kind of bought it assuming it would be fairly low quality because of the price.  </li>
            <li>It fit as expected and is so flattering and warm.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly small head and it fits just great...</li>
            <li>the thickness of it means the back slouch doesn&#x27;t have much slouch/give but doesn&#x27;t need it cuz it has shape of its own.</li>
            <li>My first beanie hat and</li>
            <li>The weave is much top coarse.  </li>
            <li>The deliver took longer than it should have, and winter was basically over, so I have only been able to wear once.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it fits and how you can slouch it to the back.</li>
            <li>it looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>This beanie is thick and very warm.</li>
            <li>It took a little time to arrive, but it looks very well made, and is very cute.</li>
            <li>Faster than normal shipping, especially since this item comes from China and most things that ship form China take over a month to get to you.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep during a wash cycle.</li>
            <li>Not as much slouch as I wanted</li>
            <li>And the ivory/beige color much easier to take.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this hat.</li>
            <li>Very well made</li>
            <li>Thought it would be cheap looking, but it was thick and made a lovely gift for my grandchild.  </li>
            <li>It is really true to it&#x27;s color it is the same as in the picture.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast it arrived!</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t need a hat like this because i live in miami</li>
            <li>I wear it constantly, even in the summer...and it has held up SUPER well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft!!</li>
            <li>I figured that as long as I could even wear it a couple of times that I was getting my money&#x27;s worth, but the hat has far surpassed my expectations!  </li>
            <li>But I fixed it with some superglue</li>
            <li>I am constantly getting compliments on it too, which makes it all that much better knowing how little I actually paid for it.  </li>
            <li>The hat is just as big as it looks in the picture, but if you fiddle with it a little it fits just fine.</li>
            <li>The color was not the soft pink portrayed but a birghter cheap-looking candy pink, and the braded band is a cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fine as long as it came before the heavy snow.</li>
            <li>The other one which I bought from a different distributor was actually a bit tight, but more wearable.  </li>

            <li> It did take a few weeks to arrive so prepare for that.  </li>
            <li> I had looked at a lot of other hats before I bought this one, and every one of them was at least $18-20, for the price</li>
            <li> It fits my head and I have extremely thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to have a very small head for this to be a &amp;#34;slouch beanie.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> so I wear it in winter or on cold days.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My first beanie hat and I super like the color and quality! Will recommend to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to have a very small head for this to be a &amp;#34;slouch beanie.&amp;#34;  It fits me snuggly, but it&#x27;s still quite nice</li>
            <li> Adorable hat.  Great deal for the money.  Very soft, cushy fabric.  Nice vibrant color.  A super good deal. It did take a few weeks to arrive so prepare for that.  But it&#x27;s an adorable hat.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit that well.</li>
            <li> Very cute ! I ordered two of these in different colors. Keeps my head very warm and I love the design.</li>
            <li> This one is a cute hat. I purchased this pink color and another one in black.  It&#x27;s so strange that the black was too small &amp; not baggy at all even for my 10 yr old daughter! I bought them both from the same seller! Shipping was faster than I expected,  though.</li>
            <li> Love it. Looks just like the photo. Delivery was fine as long as it came before the heavy snow.</li>
            <li> as I expected :) nice colour, looks great  :) I love it :)</li>
            <li> This item fits tight on my head &amp; not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cute as it can be!  Thought it would be cheap looking, but it was thick and made a lovely gift for my grandchild.  Quite stylish.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Not as much slouch as I wanted but it is ok.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this hat! I got 2, 1 for me and 1 for my daughter who is 7 and has very long hair.  It fits her well</li>
            <li> This souch beanie was made for a pumpkin head. It does more than slouch, it engulfs.  The color was not the soft pink portrayed but a birghter cheap-looking candy pink, and the braded band is a cheap plastic.  The weave is much top coarse.  I have no intention of wearing this thing.  It might make a good cover for a basketball, but I don&#x27;t own a basketball.  It didn&#x27;t cost much, but it was still a waste of money.  The other one which I bought from a different distributor was actually a bit tight, but more wearable.  And the ivory/beige color much easier to take.  However, I have learned me lesson about shopping for hats online..</li>
            <li> The hat is just as big as it looks in the picture, but if you fiddle with it a little it fits just fine. Also, be careful when you wash it because the glue holding the straps to the buttons isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep during a wash cycle. But I fixed it with some superglue and now I have a super cute hat. Faster than normal shipping, especially since this item comes from China and most things that ship form China take over a month to get to you. I got this in two weeks. Very reasonable shipping and of course I loved the price. Definitely recommend, even after a little maintenance. Super cute, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a really cute hat. My husband loved how it looked on me. I really liked it also.</li>

I figured that as long as I could even wear it a couple of times that I was getting my money&#x27;s worth, but the hat has far surpassed my expectations!  I am constantly getting compliments on it too, which makes it all that much better knowing how little I actually paid for it.  I had looked at a lot of other hats before I bought this one, and every one of them was at least $18-20, for the price this was probably one of the best bargains I have ever found!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that say that this hat looks just as pictured. I have a fairly small head and it fits just great... even with a ponytail under it. It&#x27;s warm and the color is true. Yes, the brown band is just &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; hot-glued on, but what do you want at this price. I&#x27;m very sensitive to itchy hats and wear this very comfortably. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I am very stylish, so I look for things that are different.  I can get away with wearing any kind of hat, and this one is beautiful on, not as slouchy as I thought it would be, but I suspect once I wear it a couple of times it will be.  The deliver took longer than it should have, and winter was basically over, so I have only been able to wear once.  Great hat!</li>
            <li> This beanie is thick and very warm. It&#x27;s well made. The button detail with leather cord makes it very unique. Love the way it fits and how you can slouch it to the back. Perfect color and fit for me!</li>
            <li> Love this hat!! I have used it for one year. Got a lot of compliments! Even got on TV wearing it during NEWS interview. It is still in good shape! Will buy another color for this winter because I love it sooooo much!</li>
            <li> I love this hat! It fits great and the color is really pretty too. However it is warm so I wear it in winter or on cold days.</li>
            <li> this has a great thickness to it which will really provide warmth along with your fashion.  color is true to picture.  the thickness of it means the back slouch doesn&#x27;t have much slouch/give but doesn&#x27;t need it cuz it has shape of its own.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this hat to any and all my friends and family. I love this hat because it looks great, is warm and stays on my head.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great hat and it covers my entire head too.  And the color is true to the picture and it&#x27;s great quality.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Slouch Beanie it&#x27;s cute it&#x27;s soft!! It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. It fits great i really don&#x27;t need a hat like this because i live in miami but i got it anyway to go with outfits. It is really true to it&#x27;s color it is the same as in the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this hat! it looks exactly as pictured. I was surprised at how fast it arrived! I got it in 2 weeks.I will definitely be buying again in maybe a different color. It&#x27;s extremely warm and well made for the price. It fits my head and I have extremely thick and curly hair. Overall highly satisfied! I would recommend this hat to anyone.</li>
