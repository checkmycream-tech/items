            <li>the info-mercial says, but I get excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Best price all around</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s works WONDERFULLY!!!  </li>
            <li>It is one of the best things I have ever done for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great gifts!</li>

            <li>The volume it gives me is great!</li>
            <li>I will post as soon as I know more!!!</li>
            <li>Incredible.  </li>
            <li>The sellers of the InStyler curling iron gave me very exceptional service I feel.</li>
            <li>but once again seller was great...</li>
            <li>This product seems like a good idea if it worked like they show on the commercials.  </li>
            <li>, the Instyler seems to be a well-made, good hair straightening product.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>BUT, after watching the instructional DVD and giving it another go, this is by far the best straightening/curling/waving hair appliance to date, and I&#x27;ve been through many.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are good for -mild- detangling,</li>
            <li>the steam seems to straighten my hair better.</li>
            <li>We have really enjoyed the product</li>
            <li>As soon as my hair would contact the barrel, the unit&#x27;s light would start blinking as if it had to warm up all over again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes your hair more dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip on thermal shield scratched my unit all up when I put it on</li>
            <li>More like a gimmick&lt;</li>
            <li>More like a gimmick    </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Okay for giving body</li>
            <li>Sure hope the instyler itself makes up for the delay.</li>
            <li>My daughter was (is) pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>A kind of whirring or buzzing sound.  </li>
            <li>My twelve-year-old is able to maneuver it without a problem.  </li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need any styling products.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out shiny and smooth!    </li>
            <li>I love my in styler.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I got my 2 daugher in laws and daughter one each too, and they love them.  </li>
            <li>This could not be more from the truth.  </li>
            <li>I love the instyler.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE $$!!</li>
            <li>very nice flip and body for fine straight hair&lt;</li>
            <li>The bristles held my fine hair in place where my hair would otherwise slip out of the iron.</li>
            <li>, I flip the ends out, and it feels as smooth as glass.  </li>
            <li>BTW, for my kind of hair, if I would want it to be REALLY straight</li>
            <li>Enjoy....</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that I was able to do the back of my head on my own down to the waist end part of my hair.</li>
            <li>The vendor was very easy to work with and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited after seeing all the commericals.</li>
            <li>There IS a learning curve, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great tool!  </li>
            <li>The Instyler is easy to use, heats up in no time and is definatly worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I achieved a more polished look in the end and it was pretty quick to do.</li>
            <li>and it arrived well packaged, with full instructions and warranteed, with a storage bag for when it&#x27;s not in</li>
            <li>This product just seemed too good to be true, but after viewing a short video on youtube I decided to just buy it.</li>
            <li>Pretty solid unit, doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made    Adds very nice flip and body for fine straight hair    </li>
            <li>I loved the fact that unlike a flat iron which just flattens my hair (sometimes even the tangles), this separated and defined.</li>
            <li>finish your head quickly and go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a heat shield now</li>
            <li>Can finish your head quickly and go    </li>
            <li>Good bye days of flat hair!!</li>
            <li>She has tried many straighteners in her life and was very excited to finally get to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than my flat iron because it gives more height at the roots</li>
            <li>I have used other straightening products, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it and went to work I got tons of compliments!</li>
            <li>I have very thick, wavy hair, and it&#x27;s incredible!  </li>
            <li>It also really does shine your hair up and smooth damaged ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product imaginable over the years with varying success.  </li>
            <li>It curled her hair in a nice way - very natural-looking, but then, my daughter has naturally wavy hair to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually more into the &#x27;natural look&#x27; and prefer my hair curly/wavy, but when I want to straighten it, this is definately the product.</li>
            <li>and i love how soft it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li>but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>but as long as you are careful it is the best straighting tool on the market and DEFINATELY worth the price</li>
            <li>Its a great product, just missing some very important &amp; necessary concepts.  </li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my new straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked it that much that I&#x27;m planning to buy one for me (or request it as a bday present ^_^)  </li>
            <li>product was exactly as described, quickly delivered and i saved a large percentage of even the lowest priced deals that i could find....</li>
            <li>Bristles are good for -mild- detangling, not much more    </li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that tames my unruly mop and makes it look like I&#x27;ve just been to the beauty parlor.  </li>
            <li>so I only use it once a week at most.  </li>
            <li>My first one was defective, but the dealer immediately sent me another one when I contacted her.</li>
            <li>I had the rotating iron on the lowest setting, and it was still too hot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great on very long hair especially if you can&#x27;t reach your hair in the</li>
            <li>I tried this on my hair dry and unwashed and it did a decent job of detangling and creating a nice flip at the end.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using a good moisturizing conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, if this product is used on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the Instyler hoping to see me hair straight for the first time in years</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry and then use it, and the next day it still looks good.    </li>
            <li>My hair is fairly short and this works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair more dry!    </li>
            <li>I have medium length fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>OK so let me begin by saying that my hair is long and thin, but also very abundant and curly.  </li>
            <li>This is superior to a flat iron and doesn&#x27;t dry out hair the way an iron does.  </li>
            <li>This was bought as a gift for my daughter who has very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty solid unit, doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li>but it is supposed to give some curl too, except it really does not.</li>
            <li>Careful attention to the enclosed instructions will keep the user safe.  </li>
            <li>, I watched the whole thing in about 15 minutes), and practice.  </li>
            <li>Once I received it, I realized the reviews and blogs were absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li>and it was ready for me to pick up at my post office just a couple of days after that.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my wife who has very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The following review reflects her experience and my observations, not my own personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It straightens her hair better than any other straightener she has used.</li>
            <li>Works great on very long hair especially if you can&#x27;t reach your hair in the back    </li>
            <li>The Instyler does a great job of straightening it, in a natural-looking way, unlike the way the hair looks when straightened with the ceramic flat iron she has used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I paid extra for priority processing and paid full price, not trial $.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be curious to see how well it curls for someone with really straight, fine</li>
            <li>Its a decent product probably if it lasts.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft each time!</li>
            <li>To those who have been having problems - even my course, curly hair gets soft, straight and shiny</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was ready to pack it up and bring it back.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, limp,  straight hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not hot enough on high setting</li>
            <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to anyone&#x27;s expectations.  </li>
            <li>Just to let everyone know, the newly packaged Instyler does come with a clip on, plastic shield, called a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; that they call a training aid.</li>
            <li>This curling iron gets hot, and when I say hot, I mean HOT!</li>
            <li>The only problem i have had is it gets really hot</li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday - easy to learn to use.</li>
            <li>She has tried and tried but can&#x27;t get it to work on her hair which is not very thick or unmanagable at all.  </li>
            <li>If the sections are too big the iron will stop for a while and your hair won&#x27;t get as straight.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this product is meant for a professional.</li>
            <li>I bought this product direct from [...]</li>
            <li>And I worry that frequent use will fry my hair</li>
            <li>- this sucker is hot!!!  </li>
            <li>Plus, I noticed that daily use of the Instyler quickly stripped my daughter&#x27;s hair of its natural oils and gave it a dry flyaway aspect - I&#x27;ve had to restrict her use to once a week.  </li>
            <li>burns are inevitable if your a novice     There is no way to use 2 hands when using this curling iron, the ENTIRE barrel is HOT</li>
            <li>Seemed okay to straighten shorter hair, but with longer hair, it was not good at all.</li>
            <li>Yikes, who wants to wait that long?</li>
            <li>I normally still have to use a flat iron when I&#x27;m done but the flat iron makes it stick straight</li>
            <li>I had to go over my damp hair over and over to get it dry, resulting in very frizzy hair and flyaways.</li>
            <li>I had to go over my damp hair over and over to get it dry, resulting in very frizzy hair and flyaways.</li>
            <li>Unit is very loud, and the electric cord is too short.</li>
            <li>seller was awesome but disappointed in product/seller sent a replacement that only works a short time</li>
            <li>and I have straight soft hair that I can actually run my fingers through when it is dry.  </li>
            <li>but at least it wasnt burned like with most flat irons.</li>
            <li>I have long, coarse and very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The barrel gets just as hot as others but has an illusion of being more dangerous because of the bare metal.</li>
            <li>and I barely got it to even steam when my hair contacted the plate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like saying running your hair through a bare metal plate over and over again makes it shiny..</li>
            <li>and I barely got it to even steam when my hair contacted the plate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like saying running your hair through a bare metal plate over and over again makes it shiny..</li>
            <li>I have super thick, long, curly hair and blowing it straight is a 45 minute process.  </li>
            <li>It does not work nearly as well as a flat iron</li>
            <li>(The other flat irons were just as hot and untouchable).</li>
            <li>2 weeks later, it finally stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>daughter has a full, thick head of wavy (not curly), shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li>, it worked pretty well, left my hair a little frizzy</li>
            <li>and I hit the top of my ear with it and burnt it pretty bad</li>
            <li>The commercial for the Instyler showed a woman with hair similar to my wifes hair becomming very straight and silky in only a few strokes of the iron.  </li>
            <li>Not hot enough on high setting    </li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t pull too hard, although I have noticed that if you flip the iron and put the bristle side towards your head it pulls a little more.</li>

            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that tames my unruly mop and makes it look like I&#x27;ve just been to the beauty parlor.  </li>
            <li> so I only use it once a week at most.  </li>
            <li> My first one was defective, but the dealer immediately sent me another one when I contacted her.</li>
            <li> I had the rotating iron on the lowest setting, and it was still too hot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great on very long hair especially if you can&#x27;t reach your hair in the</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair dry and unwashed and it did a decent job of detangling and creating a nice flip at the end.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using a good moisturizing conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, if this product is used on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the Instyler hoping to see me hair straight for the first time in years</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry and then use it, and the next day it still looks good.    </li>
            <li> My hair is fairly short and this works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair more dry!    </li>
            <li> I have medium length fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> OK so let me begin by saying that my hair is long and thin, but also very abundant and curly.  </li>
            <li> This is superior to a flat iron and doesn&#x27;t dry out hair the way an iron does.  </li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my daughter who has very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty solid unit, doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li> but it is supposed to give some curl too, except it really does not.</li>
            <li> Careful attention to the enclosed instructions will keep the user safe.  </li>
            <li> , I watched the whole thing in about 15 minutes), and practice.  </li>
            <li> Once I received it, I realized the reviews and blogs were absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li> and it was ready for me to pick up at my post office just a couple of days after that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who has very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The following review reflects her experience and my observations, not my own personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It straightens her hair better than any other straightener she has used.</li>
            <li> Works great on very long hair especially if you can&#x27;t reach your hair in the back    </li>
            <li> The Instyler does a great job of straightening it, in a natural-looking way, unlike the way the hair looks when straightened with the ceramic flat iron she has used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I paid extra for priority processing and paid full price, not trial $.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be curious to see how well it curls for someone with really straight, fine</li>
            <li> Its a decent product probably if it lasts.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft each time!</li>
            <li> To those who have been having problems - even my course, curly hair gets soft, straight and shiny</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was ready to pack it up and bring it back.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, limp,  straight hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not hot enough on high setting</li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to anyone&#x27;s expectations.  </li>
            <li> Just to let everyone know, the newly packaged Instyler does come with a clip on, plastic shield, called a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; that they call a training aid.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets hot, and when I say hot, I mean HOT!</li>
            <li> The only problem i have had is it gets really hot</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday - easy to learn to use.</li>
            <li> She has tried and tried but can&#x27;t get it to work on her hair which is not very thick or unmanagable at all.  </li>
            <li> If the sections are too big the iron will stop for a while and your hair won&#x27;t get as straight.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this product is meant for a professional.</li>
            <li> I bought this product direct from [...]</li>
            <li> And I worry that frequent use will fry my hair</li>
            <li> - this sucker is hot!!!  </li>
            <li> Plus, I noticed that daily use of the Instyler quickly stripped my daughter&#x27;s hair of its natural oils and gave it a dry flyaway aspect - I&#x27;ve had to restrict her use to once a week.  </li>
            <li> burns are inevitable if your a novice     There is no way to use 2 hands when using this curling iron, the ENTIRE barrel is HOT</li>
            <li> Seemed okay to straighten shorter hair, but with longer hair, it was not good at all.</li>
            <li> Yikes, who wants to wait that long?</li>
            <li> I normally still have to use a flat iron when I&#x27;m done but the flat iron makes it stick straight</li>
            <li> I had to go over my damp hair over and over to get it dry, resulting in very frizzy hair and flyaways.</li>
            <li> I had to go over my damp hair over and over to get it dry, resulting in very frizzy hair and flyaways.</li>
            <li> Unit is very loud, and the electric cord is too short.</li>
            <li> seller was awesome but disappointed in product/seller sent a replacement that only works a short time</li>
            <li> and I have straight soft hair that I can actually run my fingers through when it is dry.  </li>
            <li> but at least it wasnt burned like with most flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse and very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The barrel gets just as hot as others but has an illusion of being more dangerous because of the bare metal.</li>
            <li> and I barely got it to even steam when my hair contacted the plate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like saying running your hair through a bare metal plate over and over again makes it shiny..</li>
            <li> and I barely got it to even steam when my hair contacted the plate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like saying running your hair through a bare metal plate over and over again makes it shiny..</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long, curly hair and blowing it straight is a 45 minute process.  </li>
            <li> It does not work nearly as well as a flat iron</li>
            <li> (The other flat irons were just as hot and untouchable).</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later, it finally stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> daughter has a full, thick head of wavy (not curly), shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li> , it worked pretty well, left my hair a little frizzy</li>
            <li> and I hit the top of my ear with it and burnt it pretty bad</li>
            <li> The commercial for the Instyler showed a woman with hair similar to my wifes hair becomming very straight and silky in only a few strokes of the iron.  </li>
            <li> Not hot enough on high setting    </li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t pull too hard, although I have noticed that if you flip the iron and put the bristle side towards your head it pulls a little more.</li>
            <li> and it lies flat against my head.    </li>
            <li> excuse my typing/broke my left wrist.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this could do the job especially if your hair is dry and</li>
            <li> I did my hair by myself with no previous knowledge (meaning I&#x27;m have no clue on how to straighten my hair by other means) and it did wonders!  </li>
            <li> have extremely long, waist length, straight hair that is hard to curl.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t find this iron any more dangerous than the other flat irons I have had.</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions and am careful with it, as I am with any similar product, and it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> it takes a bit too long to straighten my hair which is wavy.</li>
            <li> frizz your hair up if your hair is already dry</li>
            <li> Can frizz your hair up if your hair is already dry    </li>
            <li> I did nothing for her hair but friz and dry it out.  </li>
            <li> Even following the directions, it is not worth the cost of it.  </li>
            <li> as I read before, I am only one person, so what am I going to do with the other other Instyler?</li>
            <li> A little pricey to use only once though!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I believe it uses less heat than a flat iron</li>
            <li> This product works well on wet hair though...</li>
            <li> The instyler, was received sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> YEARS of products and sleeping in a hat or the leg of a stocking and crying, this totally works.  </li>
            <li> I was careful about getting too close to my head and never engaged even the plastic thermal shield on my skin.</li>
            <li> not much more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product was shipped and received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I used the curling iron once a wk (to avoid frying my hair) and after using it for all of 6 weeks the barrel would spin nonstop, even when it wasn&#x27;t closed    </li>
            <li> Well the Instyler is not like some of the other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> USE EXTREME CAUTION when using this product - it will literally rip patches of hair out of your head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other people are having the same type of problems or not, but for the price this thing costs you figure you would get some type of quality item.</li>
            <li> Holy cow.  </li>
            <li> The up and down in heat did nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> The up and down in heat did nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> 8 Q $99 bucks + SH down the drain.</li>
            <li> IF I take my time and only do very small sections at a time.  </li>
            <li> also tried this after washing my hair and leaving it slightly damp.</li>
            <li> , the rotating brush seems much less damaging.</li>
            <li> Given this I do have to wonder how someone with extremely tight, curly hair could use this to detangle their hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and frizzy and just plain crazy at times.  </li>
            <li> Before buying the instyler (for a friend) I saw the videos and was kinda skeptical and didn&#x27;t thought it will work on me, but I had the chance to use it once, and it actually worked!  </li>
            <li> It has a thick handle, and is somewhat clumsy to hold (I think), but it&#x27;s probably no more clumsy than any other hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this item to anyone, due to being poorly made.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week</li>
            <li> I had looked all over for this curling iron for my daughter for a Christmas present when she inferred about this item from seeing it advertised on television, but it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> And the design made it a little difficult to get to the roots.</li>
            <li> And the design made it a little difficult to get to the roots.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Instyler is a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT be turned off by the bad reviews here, or anywhere else... you need to watch the DVD (it&#x27;s in short segments</li>
            <li> but since I have purchased other items that I was disappointed in, I tried not to get my hopes up.  </li>
            <li> This is just bad customer service.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing service.</li>
            <li> would have given it four stars, but I think the whirring noise the barrel makes while spinning is somewhat annoying.  </li>
            <li> It was very disappointing!</li>

            <li> This was bought as a gift for my daughter who has very curly hair.  She loves this.  It straightens her hair better than any other straightener she has used.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I was really excited after seeing all the commericals. Well I used it once, it worked pretty well, left my hair a little frizzy but at least it wasnt burned like with most flat irons. The second time I went to use it I plugged it in and it clicked and turned off and will not turn back on. I contacted Instyler and they wont replace it since it was purchased through Amazon. I contacted the 3rd party that actually sold it via Amazon and we will see if they replace it. Its a decent product probably if it lasts. A little pricey to use only once though!</li>
            <li> This product seems like a good idea if it worked like they show on the commercials.  But, it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to anyone&#x27;s expectations.  Even following the directions, it is not worth the cost of it.  Seemed okay to straighten shorter hair, but with longer hair, it was not good at all.</li>
            <li> This is superior to a flat iron and doesn&#x27;t dry out hair the way an iron does.  It does take some time to heat up, and requires some experience to achieve the look you want.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> We bought this item for our daughter for christmas.  It works but in mid January it stopped working.  I called the number on the warranty card and the manufacturer refused to honor the warranty because the InStyler was not bought through their website.  This is just bad customer service.</li>
            <li> product was exactly as described, quickly delivered and i saved a large percentage of even the lowest priced deals that i could find....what else is there to say.....Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse and very frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve tried every product imaginable over the years with varying success.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that tames my unruly mop and makes it look like I&#x27;ve just been to the beauty parlor.  It straightens, curls, smooths, whatever I want.  I follow the instructions and am careful with it, as I am with any similar product, and it works like a charm.  I plan to order a spare one just in case as I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this again.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for Christmas.  She has tried and tried but can&#x27;t get it to work on her hair which is not very thick or unmanagable at all.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish this product could get hotter.... it takes a bit too long to straighten my hair which is wavy. This product works well on wet hair though... the steam seems to straighten my hair better.</li>
            <li> The instyler, was received sooner than expected.  We have really enjoyed the product and i would recommend anyone to utilize this vender.</li>
            <li> Holy cow.  After years.  YEARS of products and sleeping in a hat or the leg of a stocking and crying, this totally works.  Almost too well, but OMG I have hair that moves.  My hair is fairly short and this works just fine.  Haven&#x27;t burned myself.  Yet.</li>
            <li> I bought my In Styler about a month ago and like it.  It takes longer to straighten my hair than the info-mercial says, but I get excellent results.  To those who have been having problems - even my course, curly hair gets soft, straight and shiny IF I take my time and only do very small sections at a time.  If the sections are too big the iron will stop for a while and your hair won&#x27;t get as straight.  The video tells you this.  Just follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Instyler is a major disappointment. It does not work nearly as well as a flat iron and I burned myself several times using it. Maybe this product is meant for a professional.</li>
            <li> Just to let everyone know, the newly packaged Instyler does come with a clip on, plastic shield, called a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; that they call a training aid. This clips onto the handle and somewhat protects you from burns on the barrel side. It looks like they are addressing the burn issues people are complaining about. Personally I don&#x27;t find this iron any more dangerous than the other flat irons I have had. The barrel gets just as hot as others but has an illusion of being more dangerous because of the bare metal. (The other flat irons were just as hot and untouchable). I was careful about getting too close to my head and never engaged even the plastic thermal shield on my skin. With that said...on to the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely long, waist length, straight hair that is hard to curl. It tends to frizz and have flyaways and for this reason I actually limit the amount of brushing that I do. I tried this on my hair dry and unwashed and it did a decent job of detangling and creating a nice flip at the end. I achieved a more polished look in the end and it was pretty quick to do. The best thing about it is that I was able to do the back of my head on my own down to the waist end part of my hair. The bristles held my fine hair in place where my hair would otherwise slip out of the iron. I loved the fact that unlike a flat iron which just flattens my hair (sometimes even the tangles), this separated and defined. The bristles don&#x27;t pull too hard, although I have noticed that if you flip the iron and put the bristle side towards your head it pulls a little more. Given this I do have to wonder how someone with extremely tight, curly hair could use this to detangle their hair. I don&#x27;t think this could do the job especially if your hair is dry and unhealthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this after washing my hair and leaving it slightly damp. It was very disappointing! As soon as my hair would contact the barrel, the unit&#x27;s light would start blinking as if it had to warm up all over again. Not only did the temperature immediately drop, it took forever to get it back up to operating temperature. The up and down in heat did nothing for my hair and I barely got it to even steam when my hair contacted the plate. Inconsistent temperature on a $100 iron? That&#x27;s unacceptable especially when every $100+ iron specifically makes a big deal about how that will never happen. I had to go over my damp hair over and over to get it dry, resulting in very frizzy hair and flyaways. Ugh! And the design made it a little difficult to get to the roots. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on very long hair especially if you can&#x27;t reach your hair in the back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty solid unit, doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds very nice flip and body for fine straight hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can finish your head quickly and go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a heat shield now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes forever to heat up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat fluctuates, especially if you are working on damp hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not hot enough on high setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are good for -mild- detangling, not much more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can frizz your hair up if your hair is already dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair more dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip on thermal shield scratched my unit all up when I put it on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box states uses ceramic heating element...but I don&#x27;t see it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spinning barrel polishing your hair? More like a gimmick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and last, it&#x27;s just way too overpriced for what it is. There&#x27;s no reason for the spinning barrel...it&#x27;s like saying running your hair through a bare metal plate over and over again makes it shiny..and the bristles are just nylon not boar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, buy a Chi..

            <li> the product was shipped and received sooner than expected. had no problem with the seller. will prob do business with again</li>
            <li> I ordered the Instyler hoping to see me hair straight for the first time in years but since I have purchased other items that I was disappointed in, I tried not to get my hopes up.  Well the Instyler is not like some of the other products I have tried.  I LOVE it.  My hair is naturally curly and frizzy and just plain crazy at times.  With the Instyler, I spend about 15 minutes in the morning and I have straight soft hair that I can actually run my fingers through when it is dry.  Incredible.  I have received so many compliments on my new straight hair.  The Instyler is easy to use, heats up in no time and is definatly worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted this hair styler, and it works well. I use it almost everyday - easy to learn to use. It makes my hair very soft each time!</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out on this one.  Best price all around but it does not give shine like I thought it would.  Okay for giving body but it is supposed to give some curl too, except it really does not.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 2 Instylers as advertised at $119.00 yet only got 1!!!!! Waiting for response!! I will post as soon as I know more!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received my Instyler as yet but be warned before purchasing, standard delivery time from the Instlyer official website is 4-6 weeks!! Yikes, who wants to wait that long? I paid extra for priority processing and paid full price, not trial $. I ordered on Jan 4th and product is still sitting in warehouse waiting to be processed. Sure hope the instyler itself makes up for the delay. Very disappointing service.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Instyler as a gift for my daughter.  The following review reflects her experience and my observations, not my own personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has a full, thick head of wavy (not curly), shoulder-length hair.  The Instyler does a great job of straightening it, in a natural-looking way, unlike the way the hair looks when straightened with the ceramic flat iron she has used in the past.  My daughter was (is) pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two not-so-nice points are that the Instyler is noisy - while in use, it makes a noise that sounds similar to a toy remote-control car.  A kind of whirring or buzzing sound.  Plus, I noticed that daily use of the Instyler quickly stripped my daughter&#x27;s hair of its natural oils and gave it a dry flyaway aspect - I&#x27;ve had to restrict her use to once a week.  I would definitely recommend using a good moisturizing conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, if this product is used on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler is weighty.  It has a thick handle, and is somewhat clumsy to hold (I think), but it&#x27;s probably no more clumsy than any other hair straightener.  My twelve-year-old is able to maneuver it without a problem.  Careful attention to the enclosed instructions will keep the user safe.  I bought this product direct from [...] and it arrived well packaged, with full instructions and warranteed, with a storage bag for when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have only tried to curl her hair once, as a test.  It curled her hair in a nice way - very natural-looking, but then, my daughter has naturally wavy hair to begin with.  I&#x27;d be curious to see how well it curls for someone with really straight, fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it four stars, but I think the whirring noise the barrel makes while spinning is somewhat annoying.  Other than that, the Instyler seems to be a well-made, good hair straightening product.</li>
            <li> I recently found the In-styler on sale at a local store here, and picked one up.    The first time I used it, I was ready to pack it up and bring it back.  BUT, after watching the instructional DVD and giving it another go, this is by far the best straightening/curling/waving hair appliance to date, and I&#x27;ve been through many.    Please DO NOT be turned off by the bad reviews here, or anywhere else... you need to watch the DVD (it&#x27;s in short segments, I watched the whole thing in about 15 minutes), and practice.  There IS a learning curve, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great tool!  Once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it, you&#x27;ll look like you just came out of the salon EVERY day.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long, curly hair and blowing it straight is a 45 minute process.  I normally still have to use a flat iron when I&#x27;m done but the flat iron makes it stick straight and it lies flat against my head.    With the Instlyer I get lots of body and bounce, I flip the ends out, and it feels as smooth as glass.  I don&#x27;t know if I believe it uses less heat than a flat iron - this sucker is hot!!!  And I worry that frequent use will fry my hair so I only use it once a week at most.  I love that you don&#x27;t need any styling products.  I let my hair air dry and then use it, and the next day it still looks good.    It does take some practice but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.  I like it better than my flat iron because it gives more height at the roots and I can also make curls with it.  I got it as a Christmas present and didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The first time I used it and went to work I got tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> OK so let me begin by saying that my hair is long and thin, but also very abundant and curly.  Before buying the instyler (for a friend) I saw the videos and was kinda skeptical and didn&#x27;t thought it will work on me, but I had the chance to use it once, and it actually worked!  I did my hair by myself with no previous knowledge (meaning I&#x27;m have no clue on how to straighten my hair by other means) and it did wonders!  I liked it that much that I&#x27;m planning to buy one for me (or request it as a bday present ^_^)  BTW, for my kind of hair, if I would want it to be REALLY straight I might need to use an iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 6 months ago after reading tons of reviews. This product just seemed too good to be true, but after viewing a short video on youtube I decided to just buy it. Once I received it, I realized the reviews and blogs were absolutely correct.  This product worked well for me, just like what was shown in the infomercial, but here is what the informercial doesn&#x27;t tell you:     This product WILL NOT work FOR YOU if your hair is short    This curling iron gets hot, and when I say hot, I mean HOT! - burns are inevitable if your a novice     There is no way to use 2 hands when using this curling iron, the ENTIRE barrel is HOT even the tip...BEWARE!     USE EXTREME CAUTION when using this product - it will literally rip patches of hair out of your head. It gets caught between the barrel &amp; handle    I used the curling iron once a wk (to avoid frying my hair) and after using it for all of 6 weeks the barrel would spin nonstop, even when it wasn&#x27;t closed    SOMEHOW I KNEW THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END...    2 weeks later, it finally stopped working completely. 8 Q $99 bucks + SH down the drain. Its a great product, just missing some very important &amp; necessary concepts.  All in all, BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> Did not work as described or as shown on the video. Did not straighten my hair as stated. Unit is very loud, and the electric cord is too short.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product off the tv as the 2 for 1 deal, and I have to say, it&#x27;s works WONDERFULLY!!!  I have very thick, wavy hair, and it&#x27;s incredible!  I&#x27;m usually more into the &#x27;natural look&#x27; and prefer my hair curly/wavy, but when I want to straighten it, this is definately the product. I have used other straightening products, and this one is by far the best. I don&#x27;t like the idea of the &#x27;2 straightening ceramic plates&#x27; burning my hair, the rotating brush seems much less damaging. My hair comes out shiny and smooth!    My only problem with the product is the price, as I read before, I am only one person, so what am I going to do with the other other Instyler? Sell it independently! Enjoy....</li>
            <li> I love my in styler.  My first one was defective, but the dealer immediately sent me another one when I contacted her. I could not be more pleased. It is one of the best things I have ever done for my hair.  I got my 2 daugher in laws and daughter one each too, and they love them.  Great gifts!</li>
            <li> excuse my typing/broke my left wrist.  seller was awesome but disappointed in product/seller sent a replacement that only works a short time and i have to give it a break.  but once again seller was great...</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase. I had looked all over for this curling iron for my daughter for a Christmas present when she inferred about this item from seeing it advertised on television, but it was very expensive. The sellers of the InStyler curling iron gave me very exceptional service I feel. I got the email that it was sent out the same night I made the purchase and it was ready for me to pick up at my post office just a couple of days after that. Thank You so much.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Instyler for my wife for christmas. During the second time of use the Instyler quit working properly. I would keep shutting itself off and the rotating head would quit rotating. I&#x27;m not sure if other people are having the same type of problems or not, but for the price this thing costs you figure you would get some type of quality item. I would not recommend this item to anyone, due to being poorly made.</li>
            <li> I have medium length fine blonde hair.  I had the rotating iron on the lowest setting, and it was still too hot.  Also, it did not create any volume at all.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with my instyler hair straightener.  The vendor was very easy to work with and fast shipping.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who has very curly hair.  She has tried many straighteners in her life and was very excited to finally get to try this product.  The commercial for the Instyler showed a woman with hair similar to my wifes hair becomming very straight and silky in only a few strokes of the iron.  This could not be more from the truth.  I did nothing for her hair but friz and dry it out.  I am about to try to sell the product.</li>
            <li> I order my instyler from the infomercial and got 2 for 1.  I have fine, limp,  straight hair and this is wonderful!  The volume it gives me is great! Good bye days of flat hair!! It also really does shine your hair up and smooth damaged ends. Will absolutely be an essential for me and my daughter from now on!  This product is also avail @ ulta for the same price.  Might as well order it from here...WORTH THE $$!!</li>
            <li> I love the instyler. I use it at least once a week and i love how soft it makes my hair feel and how shiny it makes my hair look. The only problem i have had is it gets really hot and it doesnt have any guards on the rotating barrel and I hit the top of my ear with it and burnt it pretty bad but as long as you are careful it is the best straighting tool on the market and DEFINATELY worth the price</li>
