            <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>As someone with colored hair, you&#x27;d think a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; product wouldn&#x27;t leave me with hair that feels more damaged by the conditioner than it ever did after coloration, but that&#x27;s what happened!  </li>
            <li>nice size bottle for travel.&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li>It arrived with plastic around the top – which was good since it had exploded.  </li>

            <li>This product is ok</li>
            <li>I remembered it to be better than it was,unfortunately.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product (from reputable salons)</li>
            <li>I think I finally found my perfect shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and the conditioner decreases frizzes and makes my curls nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it more for a de-tangler before i get in the shower than anything else.</li>
            <li>Like B&amp;B Seaweed Shampoo, I am absolutely in love with the Seaweed conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love B&amp;B, but I have no idea</li>
            <li>I used it twice to make sure.  </li>
            <li>I am sure.  </li>
            <li>I am very familiar with this line</li>
            <li>Lovely smell and leaves your hair feeling soft without heaviness...very nice!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is fantastic for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>does not take the knots out of your hair and does not make your hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble Seaweed Conditioner at a fabulous price.  </li>
            <li>It might be great for a different hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner does help but not as much as I hoped and it seems to takes alot more to get the coverage I need for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Good product; works well with b and b shampoo especially the sea weed produce.  </li>
            <li>Great for my fine, limp hair...</li>
            <li>It is a mild conditioner and is intended to be.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for quality shampoo and conditioner that will be gentle and kind to your hair and scalp, then I highly recommend Bumble and Bumble products.</li>
            <li>I also like the very light, natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair which is easily weighed down by most, creamier conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Getting Bumble and Bumble conditioner for less than $20 *is* too good to be true.</li>
            <li>MY hair always come out right with this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells kind of strange, but what can you expect from seaweed?</li>
            <li>That is a big thing for me as my hair is thinning and getting very fine.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair healthy shiny soft full not heavy.</li>
            <li>many times in the past, and this product is nothing the conditioner I know and love.</li>
            <li>This product was pretty neutral for my hair in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the pair of them for shiny, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Rinses away clean but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as it did before I conditioned.  </li>
            <li>It conditions nicely without weighing down your hair or feeling greasy, and the smell is very ocean spray (the real thing, not the cranberry juice cocktail).</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair, and after using this, along with the shampoo, I find that my hair is super soft, shiny and not at all weighed down.</li>
            <li>This product does not work for my type of hair, and I pulled some much hair out from how tangled it became.  </li>
            <li>It does&#x60;not smell, feel, or work like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I went to Target and bought a real bottle for $22.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I smelled it I new</li>
            <li>I was new to B&amp;B, and this was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its really gentle and can be used everyday!!</li>
            <li>I use the Seaweed shampoo, to, but this is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have fine lifeless hair that needs to washed everyday cause in the morning</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I thought that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t going to make my hair soft (because,when I use other conditioners my hair is already silky and soft in the shower once I rinse it off) but after drying my hair, it was so soft and manageble!!</li>
            <li>I hardly use a drop and yet all my hair feels relaxed and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair ended up super-frizzy and just generally icky-looking.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to actually make the hair soft either.  </li>
            <li>similar, but quite different from my old containers purchased at both Sephora and Target.</li>
            <li>Hard to find at stores but worth the hunt</li>

            <li> Hard to find at stores but worth the hunt</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that is rather long.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair, and I found that this conditioner is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and it is hard to find a product that isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> Not sure which one was worse, but I showered one night and woke up the next morning to find my hair appearing more greasy than it probably would have been if I had not showered at all.</li>
            <li> For the price this is just OK, equal to a much less expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Being a long time user of this product line, I knew immediately upon receiving this item it was a knockoff.  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair amd</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it gets very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have found if you use too much, it causes your hair to be heavy and limp.  </li>
            <li> , I remove tangles in the shower with a wide tooth comb and rinse.</li>
            <li> This is a very light conditioner, I am disappointed with the product and do not feel as though it moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li> One thing, leave just a little in if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Never weighed down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the difference in the outward look of the container at first, but when I used the product I immediately noticed the unpleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It was entirely too expensive to have this issue.</li>
            <li> I would hardly even call this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I complained and Amazon immediately refunded my money and promised to investigate.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm, not a good decision on my part.</li>
            <li> this was not a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> Not a great smell either..</li>
            <li> It might work for other types of hair, or maybe I got a bad batch, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Seriously?!</li>
            <li> it was wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I think this was fake.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers it had a horrible chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this conditioner and the shampoo that went along with it.</li>
            <li> I have this and the B&amp;B Seaweed shampoo, and I&#x27;m disappointed with both.  </li>
            <li> horrible....just horrible.  </li>
            <li> The worst I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> BUT after using this my hair looks disgusting</li>
            <li> There is a horrible chemical smell coming from it.</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I have used.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Like other reviewers it had a horrible chemical smell. I was hoping it was a fluke but it wasn&#x27;t. I sent it back. Don&#x27;t bother buying it here.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic for fine hair.  It is a mild conditioner and is intended to be.  I have fine hair which is easily weighed down by most, creamier conditioners.  This one works perfectly.  I also like the very light, natural fragrance.  My husband even likes it.  The matching shampoo is also a winner.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble have the best smelling hair products out there, and the seaweed condition is no exception.  It conditions nicely without weighing down your hair or feeling greasy, and the smell is very ocean spray (the real thing, not the cranberry juice cocktail).</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for a few weeks now and I love the shampoo although I have not been as impressed with this conditioner.  I have thick hair and it gets very frizzy.  This conditioner does help but not as much as I hoped and it seems to takes alot more to get the coverage I need for my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to actually make the hair soft either.  Rinses away clean but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as it did before I conditioned.  This product is ok but I will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best conditioner. Leaves hair healthy shiny soft full not heavy. Never a build up. It is a perfect product</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;This is a great conditioner. I have super fine hair, and after using this, along with the shampoo, I find that my hair is super soft, shiny and not at all weighed down. It also has a great, clean smell, which I love. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the price this is just OK, equal to a much less expensive brand. I remembered it to be better than it was,unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Bumble + Bumble seaweed shampoo and conditioner are excellent products. I have fine hair, and it is hard to find a product that isn&#x27;t too heavy. These products are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product (from reputable salons) many times in the past, and this product is nothing the conditioner I know and love.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  I use the Seaweed shampoo, to, but this is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  That it is also basically scent-free is also a plus.  I would prefer to smell like my perfume than a hair care product.</li>
            <li> I think I finally found my perfect shampoo and conditioner!! I have fine lifeless hair that needs to washed everyday cause in the morning it&#x27;s always oily. When I first used this product I thought that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t going to make my hair soft (because,when I use other conditioners my hair is already silky and soft in the shower once I rinse it off) but after drying my hair, it was so soft and manageble!! It created volume and shine!!    I love the fact that its really gentle and can be used everyday!! 5 STARS!!</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and leaves your hair feeling soft without heaviness...very nice! Great for my fine, limp hair...</li>
            <li> That is a big thing for me as my hair is thinning and getting very fine. It conditions, I remove tangles in the shower with a wide tooth comb and rinse. One thing, leave just a little in if you have dry hair. Don&#x27;t rinse all the way out. MY hair always come out right with this stuff. Never weighed down. It&#x27;s light but good. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble makes really good hair products. We use the seaweed shampoo and this is the conditioner that goes along with it. If you are looking for quality shampoo and conditioner that will be gentle and kind to your hair and scalp, then I highly recommend Bumble and Bumble products.</li>
            <li> horrible....just horrible.  does not take the knots out of your hair and does not make your hair smooth.  The worst I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Bumble products are great. I have curly hair and the conditioner decreases frizzes and makes my curls nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great price and works on all hair types. Have been using for years. Hard to find at stores but worth the hunt</li>
            <li> This is a very light conditioner, I am disappointed with the product and do not feel as though it moisturizes my hair. Not a great smell either..</li>
            <li> This is the very best conditioner for my hair I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy With This.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this conditioner and the shampoo that went along with it. Not sure which one was worse, but I showered one night and woke up the next morning to find my hair appearing more greasy than it probably would have been if I had not showered at all. It was horrible. It was entirely too expensive to have this issue. Will not recommend to others or purchase again.</li>
            <li> Getting Bumble and Bumble conditioner for less than $20 *is* too good to be true. Being a long time user of this product line, I knew immediately upon receiving this item it was a knockoff.  The container label was already wiping away, the scent was off and the texture of the conditioner was gritty. Seriously?!</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that is rather long.  I was looking for something that would deep condition and minimize tangles.  This product does not work for my type of hair, and I pulled some much hair out from how tangled it became.  It might work for other types of hair, or maybe I got a bad batch, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Good product; works well with b and b shampoo especially the sea weed produce.  nice size bottle for travel.&lt;br /&gt;excellent feeling in my head when using.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This conditioner is HORRINBLE. You have to use a ton and even after your hair is like starw. I ahve very healthy hair BUT after using this my hair looks disgusting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years.  As soon as I smelled it I new it was wrong.  It does&#x60;not smell, feel, or work like the real thing.  I complained and Amazon immediately refunded my money and promised to investigate.  I hope they did.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble Seaweed Conditioner at a fabulous price.  Don&#x27;t shop, just order and be done with it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair, and I found that this conditioner is a bit heavy. It might be great for a different hair type.&lt;br /&gt;It smells kind of strange, but what can you expect from seaweed?</li>
            <li> Been using for years and will continue to use it for years to come.  I have found if you use too much, it causes your hair to be heavy and limp.  Just a dime size is the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and makes our hair feel so nice. BB are perfect products. This is an excellent conditioner; well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product was pretty neutral for my hair in my opinion. I use it more for a de-tangler before i get in the shower than anything else. I don&#x27;t think i will ever purchase it again, but i also don&#x27;t regret getting it either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bb Seaweed conditioner for a good while, therefore I&#x27;m very familiar with the product. However, the product that arrived from Amazon was decidedly different.  I didn&#x27;t notice the difference in the outward look of the container at first, but when I used the product I immediately noticed the unpleasant fragrance.  Then I looked back at the container: similar, but quite different from my old containers purchased at both Sephora and Target.</li>
            <li> Feels like I am putting liquid plastic in my hair and it did not help with tangles at all.</li>
            <li> This was runny, and smelled funky. It did not do anything for my hair. I was new to B&amp;B, and this was recommended to me. I tried it and used it twice, I just couldn&#x27;t get used to it. The smell, the texture, the way my hair felt and smelled after. Hmmm, not a good decision on my part.</li>
            <li> Like B&amp;B Seaweed Shampoo, I am absolutely in love with the Seaweed conditioner. I hardly use a drop and yet all my hair feels relaxed and silky smooth. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m throwing chemicals in my hair either. I would definitely recommend the pair of them for shiny, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what this is – but it’s not Bumble &amp; Bumble Seaweed!  I love B&amp;B, but I have no idea what’s in this bottle.  It arrived with plastic around the top – which was good since it had exploded.  There is a horrible chemical smell coming from it. It does not feel or act like B&amp;B in your hair. I used it twice to make sure.  I am sure.  This is NOT B&amp;B.  The code on the bottom of the bottle is “ H47A”.  It’s going in the trash if I can’t return it.  I went to Target and bought a real bottle for $22.  I guess if the price is too good to be true….well, you know the rest.</li>
            <li> I have this and the B&amp;B Seaweed shampoo, and I&#x27;m disappointed with both.  Considering the cost, I would hope it would perform like a salon product.  As someone with colored hair, you&#x27;d think a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; product wouldn&#x27;t leave me with hair that feels more damaged by the conditioner than it ever did after coloration, but that&#x27;s what happened!  My hair ended up super-frizzy and just generally icky-looking.  I recommend [[ASIN:B003KLV8DE Redken Redken Color Extend Set (Shampoo 10.1oz &amp; Conditioner 8.5oz)]] instead of this product for anyone with colored hair.</li>
            <li> I believe this was not the actual product. I would hardly even call this conditioner. I am very familiar with this line and I think this was fake.</li>
            <li> Could not even comb through my hair after conditioning it. One of the worst products I have used. Ever. I have long, curly hair amd this was not a good choice for me.</li>
