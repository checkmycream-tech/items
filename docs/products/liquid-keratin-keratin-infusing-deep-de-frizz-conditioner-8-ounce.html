            <li>And I have excellent eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>, good price</li>
            <li>This is a fairly good conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product is just wonderful, it helps with my curly, baby fine hair more than anything else I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like seaweed at the beach, but the good kind of smell, the rotten seaweed smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product line!</li>
            <li>Great for my baby fine, wavy hair, but the smell literally makes me gag...</li>
            <li>it smells great and leaves your hair smooth.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people liked it, but it literally turned my stomach.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t believe its not the most popular product in the world.</li>
            <li>I mix it in with another better smelling conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain keratin.  </li>
            <li>Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff......</li>
            <li>When you buy hair products with Keratin make sure its is NOT hydrolyzed.</li>
            <li>My hair is more shiny, smooth, soft, and smells so good after using this product.</li>
            <li>best hair product i have ever used, hands down, ever.  </li>
            <li>As part of this line of products, this conditioner works perfectly without making my hair feel greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li>The results were great, after 2 uses, left it in 15 min, my hair was smooth</li>
            <li>smooth, shiny frizz free curls.</li>
            <li>, I think it is def worth the money!</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad though.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself doesn&#x27;t feel right in your hand.</li>
            <li>This made my hair soft and smooth, but the smell.</li>
            <li>It really leaves hair super soft and supple!</li>
            <li>It may just be me, because I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells...</li>
            <li>My hair is blond/wavy/frizzy and it tames it as much as anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Do not pay big bucks at a salon for smooth.</li>
            <li>I now alternate this conditioner with a moisturizing hair mask and my hair is now soft and strong.</li>
            <li>It does seem to make my hair feel strong, but not very moisturized.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have used liquid keratin and it will not be the last.</li>
            <li>This condition is good in de-frizzing my hair, and you only need a little to condition short hair, so a bottle will last a long time .  </li>
            <li>I am nearsighted and the print is so small and light that I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the shampoo and the conditioner when I am in the shower unless I put my glasses on.</li>
            <li>I did leave it on about 30 minutes and my hair was extra soft and shiny</li>
            <li>As a Lady with curly hair, I am always on the lookout for a really smoothing conditioner that does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>For long lasting manageable hair....I can actually let my hair dry naturally without being self conscious. ...</li>

            <li> Great for my baby fine, wavy hair, but the smell literally makes me gag...I mix it in with another better smelling conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain keratin.  It may just be me, because I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells...I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for results though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product love all of their products</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great! It smells great and I can use it as a co-wash or a leave-in depending entirely on what I feel my hair needs.</li>
            <li> This product is just wonderful, it helps with my curly, baby fine hair more than anything else I have ever used!</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably smoother and softer, and it smells good.  My hair is blond/wavy/frizzy and it tames it as much as anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Not a good product! Does not deliver as advertised</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The results were great, after 2 uses, left it in 15 min, my hair was smooth</li>
            <li> I like the product- it smells great and leaves your hair smooth. My dislikes are in the packaging. I am nearsighted and the print is so small and light that I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the shampoo and the conditioner when I am in the shower unless I put my glasses on. The bottle itself doesn&#x27;t feel right in your hand. It is too wide and pointy and doesn&#x27;t dispense well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times. It does seem to make my hair feel strong, but not very moisturized. I&#x27;ll probably use it up but not sure if I will buy it again.    Update: I&#x27;ve decided that I will continue to use this product. I now alternate this conditioner with a moisturizing hair mask and my hair is now soft and strong. I&#x27;ve also noticed a decrease in breakage.</li>
            <li> Hope they never stop making this stuff! It help with frizz and make hair lay nicely!&lt;br /&gt;Takes the puff out of my hair and adds such shine!</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and smooth, but the smell. A lot of people liked it, but it literally turned my stomach. It just robbed the wrong way. It&#x27;s like seaweed at the beach, but the good kind of smell, the rotten seaweed smell. Salty and strange smell.</li>
            <li> As a Lady with curly hair, I am always on the lookout for a really smoothing conditioner that does not weigh my hair down. This is one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism, and it is a big one, is that the packaging uses gold lettering on a brown bottle and it is impossible to read when one is in the showerl  The shampoo has the exact same bottle so they are hard to tell apart. It is actually very difficult to read when one is in broad daylight.

            <li> This conditioner works well, good price</li>
            <li> AMAZING.  best hair product i have ever used, hands down, ever.  and my hair is notoriously problematic. no hairdresser has ever known what to do with my mop until someone passed this little gem along.  i can&#x27;t believe its not the most popular product in the world.</li>
            <li> This is a keratin product that will smooth the cuticle of the hair without irritating my scalp.  I use it a couple of times a week.  I have extremely wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> There is not much product in the bottle and I found it to be drying to my hair. The smell is not bad though.</li>
            <li> skip this- not worth the money spent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell but it isn&#x27;t bad like some of the other reviews stated.  I did leave it on about 30 minutes and my hair was extra soft and shiny, I think it is def worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works great! Saved me $150 every 2 months</li>
            <li> As part of this line of products, this conditioner works perfectly without making my hair feel greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any deep conditioner that works as well as this product. It really leaves hair super soft and supple!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff......the bottle is tiny and so expensive :( my hair is really long so I use a lot of it</li>
            <li> Awesome product and shipping/packaging was good.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have used liquid keratin and it will not be the last. This conditioner smells so so good! It also made my hair so shiny, I have gotten tons of compliments. My hair is more shiny, smooth, soft, and smells so good after using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product line! Do not pay big bucks at a salon for smooth. hair!! For long lasting manageable hair....I can actually let my hair dry naturally without being self conscious. ...</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the raving reviews. Unfortunately it makes no difference for my hair at all. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> Silky. smooth, shiny frizz free curls. Hair finally feels conditioned after trying everything. When you buy hair products with Keratin make sure its is NOT hydrolyzed. It won&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly good conditioner. However, it did not moisturize my hair as well as I would have expected it to, based on the advertising.</li>
