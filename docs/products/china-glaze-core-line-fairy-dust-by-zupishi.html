            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t broken or anything.  </li>
            <li> A very subtle sparkle.  </li>

            <li> this is a great topper just love it.looks great on top any color and it is easy remove.a silver shimmer just very pry pretty.</li>
            <li> i thought it was clear but it is a blue unsatisfied</li>
            <li> Perfect, works as an accent to any color.</li>
            <li> This review won&#x27;t show up as an Amazon Verified Purchase because I actually ordered China Glaze \\&quot;Stem Unit Delta\\&quot; and the seller \\&quot;XPRESSURSELF\\&quot; sent this instead.  I was initially put off because they didn&#x27;t even bother to inform me of the substitution.  It&#x27;s not acceptable because I could have already owned \\&quot;Fairy Dust\\&quot; - but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I decided to keep this and try it out (but I will never order from XPRESSURSELF again).  Happily I can say I love this glitter top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little goopy, buy it leveled itself and dried very nice and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One light coat was all that was needed to achieve a healthy coating of glitter over the top of my dark purple polish (China Glaze \\&quot;Shape Shifter\\&quot; with a top coat).  A second coat would be far too much glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to find a seller who will really send me \\&quot;Stem Unit Delta\\&quot; - because I still want the stainless steel colored glitter.  I&#x27;m just happy to say this is great too.  I wouldn&#x27;t even want to attempt a return with this seller</li>
            <li> Perfect for adding some holographic glitter to any manicure for a little extra sparkle without it being too over the top</li>
            <li> I had waiting a long time to purchase this polish and I am so glad I finally bought it. This polish provides the perfect dusting of fairy dust sparkle on any manicure. It really does add a beautiful finish!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect polish to add a little extra sparkle in your life! Perfect consistency and easy to apply. This polish is also great to hide any imperfections in your mani. Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this to add to my China Glaze collection and I love it. The polish is nice and thick, so it lays down smooth and only needs a coat or 2 to be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap has a nice size and feel so it is easy to control.</li>
            <li> This is a great glitter polish with strong silver color and sparks of green, red and purple which is great for holiday manicures. It looks great on the nail and over another color.</li>

            <li> The perfect addition to almost any manicure.  A very subtle sparkle.  The delivery was right on time and the price was typical.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> Stunning!  Every nail girl needs this in her collection!  The name fits this polish perfectly, it adds a beautiful classy shimmer to any manicure without covering or changing the base color!  Dries nice and smooth... I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this gorgeous glitter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I had imagined fairy dust to be like.  A subtle yet beautiful shimmer topcoat that adds a magical sparkle to any color manicure. If you&#x27;re looking for a subtle shimmer you should get this polish since it is discontinued and won&#x27;t be able to find it in the stores!</li>
            <li> Fairy Dust is a bunch of holographic glitter in a clear base.  If you like holo glitter (and really, who doesn&#x27;t), this is a fantastic polish for layering.  The glitter can&#x27;t be worn on its own but it still has fantastic coverage and looks really great on anything you might want to jazz up.  The seller shipped this to me really fast and it wasn&#x27;t broken or anything.  The one complaint I have is that the suspension base was a little thick, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for awesome glitter.</li>
            <li> I wish I had learned this had been discontinued before I ordered. I would have ordered more! The fine holographic glitter looks great over almost any color.</li>
            <li> Completely in love with this nail polish, works so well as a base coat for a french style mani, or over top of absolutely any nail color,even over just one or two nails for an accent . Need to buy more of this asap because for some terrible reason it is discontinued....which makes me sad. But def recommend to glitter lovers like me!!</li>
            <li> FAIRY. DUST. EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much sparkle.  Came to me days before I was expecting it.</li>
            <li> This us so sparkly. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this color because it is perfect for every occasion and I can wear it in a professional setting and not feel like a small child because it&#x27;s too glittery. It is a beautiful subtle sparkle.</li>
            <li> I am a huge China Glaze fan girl because the brand is so affordable even if some of my previous purchases had to be replaced because of them drying out. Aside from not getting the full use from bottles of China Glaze everything else I love. This polish glides on so easily  the color is a clear polish with a small grade silver glitter through out. You can play it safe with just one coat or really go for the wow factor and do multiple coats to make your nails really SPARKLE. Fairy Dust can be worn on it&#x27;s own and be just as pretty as can be or try it as a top coat to add sparkle to other polishes. That is what I love most about Fairy Dust is it&#x27;s versatility.  Glitter isn&#x27;t just for little girls. I wear this to the office regularly.</li>
            <li> It has great sparkle and seems to ba making my polish last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it but it&#x27;s definitely not new bottles as they say. Only 90% full</li>
            <li> Very elegant, simple look to this polish. Not too opaque, though,but I wish it were. Nonetheless, this is a nice glitter polish to improve the look of your nails, and goes with almost any base coat!&lt;br /&gt;Heres a tip: put a base coat of any bright color (red, purple, green, blue, etc). Get a sponge and put some of this polish on the sponge and dab it on the tips of your nails first halfway, then a quarter way up. The end effect will be gorgeous!</li>
