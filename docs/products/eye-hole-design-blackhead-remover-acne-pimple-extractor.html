            <li> I love these black head removers and it&#x27;s hard to find them in a store.</li>
            <li> She hardly ever breaks out in the first place.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I expected but still work well.</li>
            <li> These little gems work wonders and actually save my skin from excess damage trying to use just my fingers.  </li>
            <li> and it was by far the least inexpensive.</li>
            <li> i expected them to be plastic and disposable.</li>

            <li> It is supposed to work the way it was designed, rememeber to be gentle with your skin or you will hurt very badly...</li>
            <li> but this is nothing but a painful waste of time.</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t go wrong,  in the stores</li>
            <li> My wife is Colombian so at worst, this could have been some sort of cocain related device.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love that so many came for such a good price. I have some to my coworkers.</li>
            <li> Maybe I would like it if it showed up</li>
            <li> As odd as this particular item is, it works perfect and has helped me out a lot. 10/10, would order again.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew how to use it.  No insturstions at all.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I expected but still work well.</li>
            <li> Too big... makes a crater in your face before it could be used.&lt;br /&gt;Regret buying it. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I have friends who have something like this that they have gotten from a dermatologist. I thought I found a steal but this is nothing but a painful waste of time. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I ordered 10, only received Inez thought about calling Customer Service but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle. I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any better than the ones you get at the drug store. They also sent and charged me for several (that they sent). There were no instructions in the package for returning. Everything was in Chinese and it took over 2 weeks to come.</li>
            <li> Ordered a pack of ten. Only recieved one. They dont work. .....  Wouldnt waste your money on this. Your fingers work better.</li>
            <li> These little gems work wonders and actually save my skin from excess damage trying to use just my fingers.  Only gave 4 stars since some of these items had some nasty burrs on them that could cut the face badly if not dealt with.  Considering the price I can understand the quality.</li>
            <li> I love these black head removers and it&#x27;s hard to find them in a store. They got here earlier than I thought they would and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Good price and product. They are just very painful to use.</li>
            <li> Took weeks to get and had no instructions</li>
            <li> Between the price &amp; how many you get u can&#x27;t go wrong,  in the stores beauty isle u couldn&#x27;t buy 1 for this price &amp; this work just as good as the big beauty brand name.love em</li>
            <li> For some reason when i ordered these and it said 10pc, i expected them to be plastic and disposable. These things are some of the sturdiest metal i have ever held in my hand. They have the loopy thing, and the cone extractor, both work, both hurt. They are really good quality, and shipping was actually fairly decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And heck, with 10 of these suckers, you could use your extra ones as throwing weapons.</li>
            <li> Okay, I had no idea what these were when she asked me to buy them. I assumed they were for threading or sewing. My wife is Colombian so at worst, this could have been some sort of cocain related device. Well the other day I found out what these stainless steal sadomasochistic torture tool of unholy pain does!!! Why!?!? Just why would you do this?! I guess I can see how this would be better than the good old fashioned squeeze it until it explodes method but man......this just looks like something you would use to get a terrorist to talk. And why did she have me buy her 10 of these? She hardly ever breaks out in the first place. I&#x27;m just venting here people. For the real portion of the review, they work. They extract face invaders with stainless steal precision all the while making out look like you are performing major surgery on your face.........</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and on time.  Great price for the bundle.</li>
            <li> The design is very simple yet effective. However the amount purchased #10 is a bit much so share with your friends and family. Look at the you tube videos to see how to uses these wonderful tools.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to work the way it was designed, rememeber to be gentle with your skin or you will hurt very badly...</li>
            <li> they are okay. took 2 months to be delivered</li>
            <li> Honestly, this works almost as well as any other blackhead/pimple remover that I have and it was by far the least inexpensive. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY HELPFULL... IT WORKS SO GREAT... I LIKE IT SO MUCH...</li>
