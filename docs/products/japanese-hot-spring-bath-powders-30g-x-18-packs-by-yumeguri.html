            <li>All of the bath salts from Japan we ordered are good and leave skin smooth</li>
            <li>These not only smell amazing, but my skin feels lovely and I smell wonderful when I get out of a bath.</li>
            <li>Like the smell very much!!!</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough -- aromatherapy and relaxation at best!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love taking baths.</li>
            <li>What a delightful way to sample different scents.</li>
            <li>If you have not tried it, give it a try, you lost nothing but having a smooth kin and soothing senses.</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>Even in very hot water it makes me feel cool inside.</li>
            <li>makes it more enjoyable while taking a hot bath after a rather long day</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the functions they put on the package (it said that these are &amp;#34;not for reproducing the real spring&amp;#34; in Japanese), but they smell really good and really good to use.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I bought it for the pretty box, and its really just a treat to use a packet in a bath after a long day.</li>
            <li>Color is fun (but not sure if it is good for skin/health in long term:/ ).</li>
            <li>It seems like very little product in each packet, but once you pour it in the water, the aroma and color are very strong.</li>
            <li>Each one smells amazing and is supposed to offer something a little different in each bath.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no issues</li>
            <li>My 90 year old Mother uses them for her shoulders (arthritis) and it also makes her skin so silky she does not have to use any lotion for days.</li>
            <li>Strange that it is made in China despite being &amp;#34;Japanese Hot Spring Bath Powders&amp;#34;, though.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my Doctor, who is a medical Dr and practices natural healing.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had a label in English since a few scents are familiar</li>

            <li> I get this for my mom and boy she loves them.... She gonna keep buying them</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough -- aromatherapy and relaxation at best!  I have sensitive skin and had no issues -- This is now my go-to treat for myself!</li>
            <li> but I wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> This is great. Even in very hot water it makes me feel cool inside.</li>
            <li> Cool. Different colors and soothing smells</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Doctor, who is a medical Dr and practices natural healing. My 90 year old Mother uses them for her shoulders (arthritis) and it also makes her skin so silky she does not have to use any lotion for days.</li>
            <li> Softened my skin. Smell is great. Color is fun (but not sure if it is good for skin/health in long term:/ ). If you have not tried it, give it a try, you lost nothing but having a smooth kin and soothing senses. I&#x27;ll try other brands to do comparison.</li>
            <li> Like the smell very much!!! I am not sure about the functions they put on the package (it said that these are &amp;#34;not for reproducing the real spring&amp;#34; in Japanese), but they smell really good and really good to use.</li>

            <li> Love it. Strange that it is made in China despite being &amp;#34;Japanese Hot Spring Bath Powders&amp;#34;, though.</li>
            <li> May have been fake...</li>
            <li> This was an impulse purchase that I am very glad I bought. It comes with 18 packets of four different kinds of bath powder. Each one smells amazing and is supposed to offer something a little different in each bath. To be honest, I bought it for the pretty box, and its really just a treat to use a packet in a bath after a long day. It seems like very little product in each packet, but once you pour it in the water, the aroma and color are very strong. I love using them!</li>
            <li> not a Japanese bath powder -- it is made in China</li>
            <li> These not only smell amazing, but my skin feels lovely and I smell wonderful when I get out of a bath. I only wish they had a label in English since a few scents are familiar but I can&#x27;t figure out what they are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in China therefore it&#x27;s not Japanese bath powders but Chinese bath powders.  I use a wide array of Japanese bath powders and not one of them ever fell to the bottom of the tub and sat there like toxic waste in colors that come from nightmares.  Very little scent and the warning label on the package basically says if you have skin don&#x27;t use this product.  I&#x27;m throwing it out.  A waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japanese bath powders must come from Japan or they&#x27;re not Japanese bath powders.&lt;br /&gt;Period.</li>
            <li> love taking baths. this was a great product and I even brought with me on my business trips! makes it more enjoyable while taking a hot bath after a rather long day</li>
            <li> good after a stressful day</li>
            <li> What a delightful way to sample different scents.</li>
