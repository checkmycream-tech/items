            <li>Love this scrub!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame because you lose some of the nice moisturizing properties of the scrub by doing so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product...if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a shortbread cookie.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it seems like a nice scrub, but I would not have bought it if the packaging had been correct.  </li>

            <li>First, I absolutely love the smell!</li>
            <li>this one easily tops the charts.  </li>
            <li>I received my PURE coconut scrub yesterday and I love love LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is fabulous ...</li>
            <li>It also has a wonderfully light fragerance.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was fantastic and the speed of delivery was also.  </li>
            <li>product specifically smells nice (a little strong, I have since ordered the White Peach which I like better, this one is almost like a candle type smell) and does a great job of exfoliating and leaves my skin with a nice moisturized sheen.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it leaves my skin SOFT!!  </li>
            <li>Ok this is the first time using any products by this company</li>
            <li>This is a really nice body scrub that leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m more sensitive to scents than most, so maybe it won&#x27;t be as bothersome to others.</li>
            <li>It smells like coconuts, and it&#x27;s a very clean smell, and I also LOVE the fact that this company uses all natural products.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it has a light smell.. not too strong and my skin feels soft and moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li>I use a number of 100% Pure products and love the line and Suzy&#x27;s philosophy .</li>
            <li>In love with this Pure Coconut Body Scrub.  </li>
            <li>love the smell and love the fact that it really is 100% pure....</li>
            <li>is definitely good but does not even come close to the honey almond variety of the same brand.</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>I am not afraid to put this on my body because it is chemical free.  </li>
            <li>It is not a bad smell,</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li>Not coarse enough for the feet, unless you have baby feet :D</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this scrub, it&#x27;s so fresh and leaves my body feeling so smooth</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but so worth it.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that the oil kind of evaporates from the product</li>
            <li>My dry winter skin is replenished and exfoliated every time I use this, which is becoming everyday because it just feels (and smells) so wonderful.</li>
            <li>The oil is also the right weight...</li>
            <li>Fantastic scrub, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My husband used this on his extremely dry hands and it worked like magic to smooth his hands.  </li>
            <li>leaves you silky smooth and moisturized after you shower and gentle enough to use more than once a week if you want to.</li>
            <li>Pure heaven!</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for exfoliating facial skin.</li>
            <li>; when I first used it.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, it&#x27;s 100% pure</li>
            <li>, this is a guy writing this review ;-)</li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>In fine print it says that it is 100% pure natural and vegan.  </li>
            <li>leaves skin very supple and soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It comes in a large jar and lasts for a month or so.</li>
            <li>What the heck is 100% pure vegan anyway?</li>
            <li>It is just the right combination of pleasant fragrance (not too much), necessary grittiness (not too harsh) and moisturizing agent (not too greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the oiliness of the product, not so much.</li>
            <li>smells devine and works really well</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, no need to use lotion after the shower if you use this.  </li>
            <li>I really wish that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>just too much-</li>
            <li>She fell in love with how soft it left her skin after using it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>% pure is my new go to company for skin care, make-up, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone looking to have smooth soft skin and to see its contains only natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have found I can use every single 100% pure product I have tried with success.  </li>
            <li>but I choose to purchase from amazon as I have a new baby and getting out of the house</li>
            <li>New shower time staple.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because Im pregnant and during the winter I get really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of skin issues and this has helped to clear them up too!</li>
            <li>I would love to see this product improve or refine the excessive oiliness ...</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky with just a little smell of coconut.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>eventually before it&#x27;s actually finished, which causes it to be ineffective before the whole container is done.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what someone who is sensitive to smells would think of this.</li>
            <li>Only buy if you really really like coconuts.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves little tiny beads on the skins.</li>
            <li>Just like most other scrubs is left my tub slippery, but that was expected.</li>
            <li>So amazing, but so expensive.  </li>
            <li>testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive and the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>That includes other all natural or sensitive skin products (like Aveeno, Tarte, Clinique, etc).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body scrub and coconut so far is my fav (its a little thicker than some I&#x27;ve tried, so less goes down the shower).  </li>
            <li>Smells divine and it makes my dry skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>Not too much or not too little.</li>

            <li> New shower time staple.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because Im pregnant and during the winter I get really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of skin issues and this has helped to clear them up too!</li>

            <li> My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky with just a little smell of coconut.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> eventually before it&#x27;s actually finished, which causes it to be ineffective before the whole container is done.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite body scrub and coconut so far is my fav (its a little thicker than some I&#x27;ve tried, so less goes down the shower).  </li>

            <li> Not too much or not too little.</li>
            <li> The texture of this scrub is just right...just enough &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; to get the dry skin gone but not so coarse to scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is there isn&#x27;t much scrub in it...</li>

            <li> /&gt;Wanting to rid myself of some dry dead skin, while moisturizing for the summer, I happened across this.</li>
            <li> I gave this scrub 4 stars instead of 5 because the scent is a little stronger than expected causing me to feel the need to remove it with soap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll just have to get used to using a little less.</li>
            <li> Not even a little.</li>
            <li> (BTW,  If anyone has trouble getting the oil out of the shower I recommend a steam cleaner.)</li>
            <li> I received this in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> One jar usually lasts me 3 days, so I stock up with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>

            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase-</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I no longer have to buy soap, scrub and body lotion separate.  </li>

            <li> if thats how all of them are shipped or if I got a bad tub.</li>

            <li> This was a gift to me and it is a WINNER!!!  I have spent TONS of money on scrubs and they have either been too harsh, too oily, smelly or dry.  This one is a great blend.  HOWEVER, if using in the shower BE CAREFUL -- you may slip because of the coconut oil.  I almost &amp;#34;met my maker&amp;#34; when I first used it.  But I was cautious the following times and used every single drop.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> What an INCREDIBLE coconut fragrance!!!  This is a really nice body scrub that leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth.  I did find that the oil seems to separate from the granules, but mixes right back in with a few stirs of a small wood spatula.  I would love to see this product improve or refine the excessive oiliness ... the fragrance is fabulous ... the oiliness of the product, not so much.</li>
            <li> I gave this scrub 4 stars instead of 5 because the scent is a little stronger than expected causing me to feel the need to remove it with soap. That&#x27;s a shame because you lose some of the nice moisturizing properties of the scrub by doing so. Granted, I&#x27;m more sensitive to scents than most, so maybe it won&#x27;t be as bothersome to others. It&#x27;s a nice product...if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a shortbread cookie.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub ! The ingredients are top notch &amp; the fragrance is intoxicating. Pairs perfectly with their coconut lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for exfoliating facial skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft! I love it! And I don&#x27;t need any lotion after I get out of the shower!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have found I can use every single 100% pure product I have tried with success.  Not one of them has caused a reaction... and understand that 99% of products I try cause a rash/hives/a break out of some sort.  That includes other all natural or sensitive skin products (like Aveeno, Tarte, Clinique, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pure is my new go to company for skin care, make-up, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product specifically smells nice (a little strong, I have since ordered the White Peach which I like better, this one is almost like a candle type smell) and does a great job of exfoliating and leaves my skin with a nice moisturized sheen.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells wonderful and makes my skin feel wonderful.  It also does not sting like some salt scrubs tend to when applying.</li>
            <li> Body scrub just does not get better than this!&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil free!! smells devine and works really well but not overly abrasive like salt scrubs can be.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few of the different scents and the coconut is one of my faves. leaves you silky smooth and moisturized after you shower and gentle enough to use more than once a week if you want to. Does require stirring as like most oil scubs separation does occur. you won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase- price same as a local store that carries it, but I choose to purchase from amazon as I have a new baby and getting out of the house is just not always feasible! lol</li>
            <li> Perfect product...quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body scrub and coconut so far is my fav (its a little thicker than some I&#x27;ve tried, so less goes down the shower).  I use a number of 100% Pure products and love the line and Suzy&#x27;s philosophy . (BTW,  If anyone has trouble getting the oil out of the shower I recommend a steam cleaner.)</li>
            <li> is definitely good but does not even come close to the honey almond variety of the same brand. The coconut didn&#x27;t smell the way I expected i&#x27;m def staying with the honey one.</li>
            <li> Then, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to rid myself of some dry dead skin, while moisturizing for the summer, I happened across this. And I&#x27;m glad I did. It is just the right combination of pleasant fragrance (not too much), necessary grittiness (not too harsh) and moisturizing agent (not too greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. The price is right, it&#x27;s 100% pure and you&#x27;ll love your skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is a guy writing this review ;-)</li>
            <li> I love it and it has a light smell.. not too strong and my skin feels soft and moisturized after I use it. Would def. Purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the best discovery I have ever made.  It is expensive, but I no longer have to buy soap, scrub and body lotion separate.  One jar usually lasts me 3 days, so I stock up with Amazon.  I use it twice a day in the shower and my skin looks, feels and smells dreamy all day.  It makes me feel like I am in a tropical escape all year.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try for KP- I have been using it for just 2 days. First, I absolutely love the smell! It smells good enough to eat! It goes on smooth and leaves little tiny beads on the skins. The texture is so creamy. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the KP yet (it will take some time) but I can say it feels luxurious!</li>
            <li> This product is great and smells delicious! My skin feels silky smooth with a bit of oil that leaves a beautiful sheen on your skin. It was given to me as a gift and I&#x27;ve since purchased 2 more jars!</li>
            <li> In love with this Pure Coconut Body Scrub.  It smells amazing and it leaves my skin SOFT!!  Will definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely matter, was exactly what I ordered amazon was awesome in this, I would highly recommended this order to anyone and I would buy this again anytime. Great purchase and smell and texture was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scrub, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best sugar scrub I&#x27;ve used in a while. I love that it smells divine and leaves my skin silky smooth. It comes in a large jar and lasts for a month or so. The scent is not overpowering, which I like. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Pure heaven! My dry winter skin is replenished and exfoliated every time I use this, which is becoming everyday because it just feels (and smells) so wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub! Smells great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to be without this scrub!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural product.  Love love love the smell.  Boyfriend is obsessed with this too!  Made of sugar and oils and no chemicals.  Great for sensitive skin.  Very moisturizing, no need to use lotion after the shower if you use this.  I received this in just a few days.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell, but for the price I wasnt impressed. It came as a soil rock and it took me mixing in some water to even get it to a point where I could get some out. Im not sure if thats how all of them are shipped or if I got a bad tub. Just like most other scrubs is left my tub slippery, but that was expected.I ordered it because Im pregnant and during the winter I get really dry skin. I only needed to use this scrub a few times a week and it really helped.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for dry skin!! Smells amazing!! The only complaint I have is there isn&#x27;t much scrub in it... its mostly oils. I definitely recommend this to people with dry skin though!</li>
            <li> Love this....love the smell and love the fact that it really is 100% pure....it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> My husband used this on his extremely dry hands and it worked like magic to smooth his hands.  The smell is incredible.  I like it for the end result -- VERY smooth skin.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut scrub. Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky with just a little smell of coconut. Not too much or not too little. I feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product line is awesome!</li>
            <li> The best for dry skin</li>
            <li> This is my indulgence.  It is a bit pricey but so worth it.  It lasts forever, smells great and makes your skin so soft without feeling greasy.  I have a lot of skin issues and this has helped to clear them up too!</li>
            <li> excellent product for dry skin.  leaves skin very supple and soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scrub. Smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas as she likes scrubs.  She fell in love with how soft it left her skin after using it. The fragrance is also subtle and pleasant. I will most definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub for one reason. I wanted one that was 100% coconut to replace one I had.  This is not! In fine print it says that it is 100% pure natural and vegan.  That is quite a difference.  Aside from that, it seems like a nice scrub, but I would not have bought it if the packaging had been correct.  What the heck is 100% pure vegan anyway?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it or hate it.  I have used better scrubs.  The smell is great so that is a plus</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!  New shower time staple. It leaves my skin so soft. I&#x27;m really loving the products I&#x27;ve gotten from this company.</li>
            <li> So amazing, but so expensive.  I just ran out of this and wanted to buy more, but forgot how spendy it was.  I have used a handful of other coconut oil scrubs and this one easily tops the charts.  I guess I&#x27;ll just have to get used to using a little less.</li>
            <li> The texture of this scrub is just right...just enough &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; to get the dry skin gone but not so coarse to scratch your skin. The oil is also the right weight...it absorbs quickly and makes your skin glow. It also has a wonderfully light fragerance. Great for elbows and knees. Not coarse enough for the feet, unless you have baby feet :D</li>
            <li> I received my PURE coconut scrub yesterday and I love love LOVE it.  Smells divine and it makes my dry skin so soft.  Ok this is the first time using any products by this company but I will be definitely trying their others.  Please please don&#x27;t ever change this formula.  I recommend this product for anyone looking to have smooth soft skin and to see its contains only natural ingredients is a definite win win.</li>
            <li> Love, this body scrub. It&#x27;s amazing on the skin and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and leaves your skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this scrub. It smells like coconuts, and it&#x27;s a very clean smell, and I also LOVE the fact that this company uses all natural products.  I am not afraid to put this on my body because it is chemical free.  The price on Amazon was fantastic and the speed of delivery was also.  I am so happy that Amazon carry&#x27;s this product now!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great body scrub, but not digging the smell.  Reminds me of a burnt cookie?  I do like the fact that the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; part dissolves, leaving the coconut oil behind.  I use it at night after my workouts, so I can rinse the smell off in the morning before work. It does wonders for my skin.  It would of gotten 5 stars, except for the smell, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this scrub, it&#x27;s so fresh and leaves my body feeling so smooth</li>
            <li> Love this scrub, it&#x27;s literally everything I have been looking for. The only downside to this is that the oil kind of evaporates from the product eventually before it&#x27;s actually finished, which causes it to be ineffective before the whole container is done. I really wish that didn&#x27;t happen. But in the beginning, this did its job incredibly well.</li>
            <li> I expected this to smell like coconut. Nope. Not even a little. Smells like creme brûlée which is great in a dessert but didn&#x27;t work for me here. At all. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Pros: skin feels great after using and no harsh chemicals or animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive and the smell is very strong. The product label says that it does not have any artificial fragrances which I find hard to believe. It is not a bad smell, just too much- and this even though I like the smell of coconuts and have a terrible sense of smell. I can&#x27;t imagine what someone who is sensitive to smells would think of this. Only buy if you really really like coconuts.</li>
