            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance!</li>
            <li>very precise!!</li>
            <li>great eyeliner for beginners</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Great precision liner.</li>
            <li>Great for cat-eyes and winged looks.</li>
            <li>The felt tip is great-</li>
            <li>It does a GREAT job of getting in between the lashes, though.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal and Revlon have great color payoff and longevity, but both get cakey and sting.</li>
            <li>but once she got the hang of it, she looked great.  </li>
            <li>I tried this because it got great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great purchase price, and how it applys.</li>

            <li>Makes a great line and is inexpensive.  </li>

            <li>Great value for the price paid.</li>
            <li>What a happy accident, I&#x27;ve used this ever since.</li>
            <li>But it looks great if you leave it alone.</li>
            <li>Great colors, but don&#x27;t sharpen well.</li>
            <li>Must be applied twice to stay all day but otherwise great.</li>
            <li>Great eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Great for the cat eye look.</li>

            <li>Maybelline has great eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Well, I already knew this product was great because I&#x27;ve purchased it before from Walgreens or something.</li>
            <li>It works great .</li>
            <li>Still, it did a great job at creating an even line.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner looks great, thank you</li>
            <li>you can also take product from the tip onto to a eyeliner brush and get a great effect also</li>

            <li>Goes on really smoothly!</li>
            <li>the pointed tip you will make precise and near perfect lines (with practice of course).&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this type of applicator.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

            <li>This has to be my favorite eyeliner pen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my make-up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly glad I found this product :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the two maybellines, I like the gel liner better.  </li>
            <li>for the gel liner if you don&#x27;t mind 15 seconds more of applying time.</li>
            <li>I would be sure to give this a 10 out of 10.  </li>

            <li>I really love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already in love with it.</li>
            <li>What is awesome about it is that it&#x27;s cheaper than ones like stila and tarte, but makes the same lines.</li>
            <li>It is even better than I thought it is.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>but sometimes I want to use eyeliner to help play up my eyes even more</li>
            <li>my favorite go-to eyeliner</li>
            <li>I really love this liner.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and i love maybelline</li>
            <li>so decided to try this and love it so much more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I always make sure to keep this in my makeup stash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>I do like this product because it&#x27;s easier than continually dipping your wand into a tube for more.  </li>
            <li>I would look for a better product.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner out there.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I guess it was to make it more heavier.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and lasts all day and night!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t crack or look lumpy like most eyeliners.  </li>
            <li>I love how this goes on and stays on.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, wish it was a waterproof formula.</li>
            <li>The actual liner pencils just hurt to put on, an irritate my eye, so these marker-like liners are awesome.</li>
            <li>She wears contacts, too, for whatever that is worth information wise.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The one I ordered from Amazon even more</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it love it</li>
            <li>I love the felt pen.</li>
            <li>This liner is PRECISE!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I can tell you for sure, 100%, that this makes me apply eyeliner like a PRO.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay on longer than most I have used.</li>
            <li>I saved the applicator and bought another favorite eyeliner and put it on the Mabelline applicator liner.</li>
            <li>I tried almost all brands of liquid eye liners to find the best, and I finally found this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product, just not the one from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Have been using eyeliner for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my top lids.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>but I was able to use this quite well.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>but this one has more color and is more durable against sweat and moister, without having the painstaking difficulty to remove factor that the waterproof eyeliners have.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>but overall i&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>Definitely the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Applies nicely and accurately.</li>
            <li>Price is great compared to Stila which also works very well.  </li>
            <li>It ends up on the top of my eyelids and smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li>It will smudge nicely while it is still drying if you don&#x27;t want a really precise look</li>
            <li>I love this brand and the texture of this pen.  </li>
            <li>This product was okay, nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>I have tried several eyeliners to get that perfect line</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I find using short strokes across my lash line works best.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the better drug store options.</li>
            <li>Your love this eyeliner too if u buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Matte for the most part.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite liquid eyeliner...</li>
            <li>Make sure you realize</li>
            <li>I like the gel better.</li>
            <li>You will get a nice and precise line with this liner.</li>
            <li>If your eyes don&#x27;t water much, this would be great for you.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>Sign up for subscribe and save to get an even better price.  </li>
            <li>This is an ok eyeliner but for the price</li>
            <li>I like Stila&#x27;s better, although it is pricier...</li>
            <li>awesome eyeliner, does smear a bit onto upper eyelid though.</li>
            <li>but I have found that to be the case with most liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to be triggering my skin itching like many eye makeup items do.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Will be buying some more</li>
            <li>I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as good, but I figured it was worth a shot</li>
            <li>Well, I fell in love with this liner almost quicker than I did with the Stila one.</li>
            <li>Maybelline&#x27;s isn&#x27;t waterproof, but it still does an excellent job at staying put on my Asian eyelids.</li>
            <li>I also think the Maybelline one has more pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I’m upset that I can’t be one of the many people out there who gave it 5 stars and swear by it.</li>
            <li>So I like that I am able to get</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had better eyeliners where even if you apply some pressure the tip won&#x27;t get flattened like the Maybelline one.</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift and it seems okay, didn&#x27;t hear any complaining about it.</li>
            <li>My favorite choice in eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It helps that most of the liner stays on my face not wiped off on a q tip because it went everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(mostly) waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite eyeliners.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic eyeliner pen!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Sure, maybe it&#x27;s not rub-proof but what do you expect from a 7 dollar eyeliner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s liquid in a pen form.</li>
            <li>I really love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The color is lovely to look at.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t hold up in that area, but is excellent outside the lash line.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I was even able to do a &amp;#34;winged&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>really love this product.</li>
            <li>Favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love the product because it accents your eyes</li>
            <li>Just saying I really  do love it and will continue to wear it.  </li>
            <li>I wear mostly Mary Kay</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think it is better than a brush eye liner.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>and it automatically became my favorite eyeliner</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and I can make a nice tapered line across my lid.  </li>
            <li>Package box was ok.</li>
            <li>personallt just like a pencil better</li>
            <li>I love the tip to this pen</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it and will be buying a bazillion more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite drug store brand marker eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li>And cheap!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth application.</li>
            <li>These are my all time favorite drugstore eyeliner and when my drugstore run out</li>
            <li>(I love this)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Though I love the pen idea</li>
            <li>Not waterproof, but that is sometimes better when you need to make corrections.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using liquid eyeliner for years and this is not even close to my favorite.</li>
            <li>most recommended:</li>
            <li>con - halfway through the day, I had liner on the top of my lids because I have oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite eye liner.</li>
            <li>More like a stain than a liner.</li>
            <li>I always have to tap the top on my vanity to get more product out.</li>
            <li>If I dont, it smudges on to the top of my lid.</li>
            <li>Love this liner.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>eye liner is okay.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t like a pen, more like a flexible paintbrush.</li>
            <li>Gifted it to my sis</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Im in love :)</li>
            <li>This eye liner works best for the upper eye line.</li>
            <li>Precise Liquid Eyeliner!</li>
            <li>LOVE this liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>so if you like a matte finish you may want to apply an eyeshadow or another pencil on top.</li>
            <li>I started with this product, but now I use Revlon Colorstay Eyeliner (crayon eyeliner) to draw my cat eye because it lasts longer and is more resistant to smudges.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I have better ones.</li>
            <li>Everything is safe delivered..</li>
            <li>I love how it just glides on any eye makeup</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner 😍</li>
            <li>So I held the pen at the end and shook it to see if there was more mascara in the pencil...</li>
            <li>I will buy more of it for the price and the ease of application</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>so it goes on smooth!</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find an eyeliner to replace my favorite... stilla eyeliner...</li>
            <li>I wish there were more colors, I&#x27;d buy all of them.</li>
            <li>Not the best-flowing eye pen I&#x27;ve used, but at this price I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I am many decades older &amp; she is 22, so it&#x27;s great for any age.</li>
            <li>Easy application, easy to remove if mistakes are made!</li>
            <li>However, the applicator makes it easy to create a nice fine line; just wish the makeup would not wear off.</li>
            <li>I was surprised I was able to get a perfect cat eye look without having to fix anything on the very first try.</li>
            <li>It looks great and soooo easy to apply as the tip gets really skinny.</li>
            <li>Its very precise and easy to use</li>
            <li>I have another eyeliner pen like this one which feels heavy on my eyelid and kind of causes irritation, but this one is great, lightweight with good pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Once you do that it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>but once you do, its pretty good.</li>
            <li>but the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t do as good as the first</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Very precise for fine lines.</li>
            <li>I will be happy to return the defective one for a new one.</li>
            <li>The applicator is great for beginners who are new to the cat eye.</li>
            <li>I can see how it is awesome for someone with dry skin around their eyes or who uses some sort of primer or foundation</li>
            <li>I love it,, it don&#x27;t smugde, and drys very quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is easily comparable to the Stila eyeliner, but with a much better price tag.</li>
            <li>I completely love it -- it&#x27;s easy to use and goes on so well.</li>
            <li>and I love how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and so precise!</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly.nice eyeliner pencil that looks like liquid eyeliner but goes on more neatly and easily than liquid.  </li>
            <li>love how it glides on and easy to handle</li>
            <li>I love it, is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>, it has the sharpest, most precise tip I&#x27;ve ever used, and it love that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t draw a straight, perfect line very well</li>
            <li>Very easy to get a clean line &amp; wing.</li>
            <li>if one does not have good hand, is very soft and easy to use, I love I can delineate perfectly my eyes on different styles</li>

            <li>Perfect, easy to apply, and lasts long!</li>

            <li>Bottom line: if you&#x27;re not ready to make the jump to $20 eyeliner, this is the best in this price range.</li>
            <li>I have tried lightly dabbing a q-tip with powder over it to set it better in the humidity and that seems to help.  </li>

            <li>Extremely smooth and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>The liquid is not runny at all and you will most likely get a perfect line on your first try every time :) pretty water resistant, but not water proof.</li>
            <li>It has a fine tip.  </li>
            <li>I used to use gel liner but bought this because I thought it would be an inexpensive option to get a fine point winged eye look.</li>

            <li>The tip is so fine</li>
            <li>The fine tip on the end doesn&#x27;t hold over time for the wing liner look.</li>

            <li>First and second use was great!</li>
            <li>Takes more than one application for the eyes if you want a bold outline.</li>

            <li>So far so good, really easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still loyal to my Stila and MAC, but I&#x27;ll definetlly be buying more of these to have spares available.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, creates a perfect wing, the color is just intense enough for me, it doesn&#x27;t smudge,</li>
            <li>This is the first eye liner I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If they can just make the tip a little thinner, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is great and it gives a fine line for extra detail.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and simple to apply, and makes for very cute eyeliner looks.</li>
            <li>I did manage to master a great cat eye and my sexy little flicks have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Very dark and flawless after a night out of dancing.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING - allows you to apply a perfect, thin line of eye liner.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Stila&#x27;s waterproof eyeliner, so when my wallet emptied I had to resort to a cheaper option.</li>
            <li>this eyeliner goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li>but it is really light in color (brown) and seems to be drying out within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Took a shower and washed my face and eye area with light soap.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly</li>
            <li>The Maybelline master precise eyeliner stays on longer than my MAC one.</li>
            <li>TENDS TO RUN, BUT HAS SMOOTH APPLICATION</li>
            <li>Gives precise application.</li>
            <li>The pen liner does glide smooth and precise (like the name), will not hurt or pull your lid at all.  </li>
            <li>Like the smooth way it goes on</li>
            <li>Even it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice intense color, and application.</li>
            <li>Does not go on smoothly seems to dot along.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>My eyeliner has never looked so precise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so precise</li>
            <li>If you like precise eyeliner and &amp;#34;wing tips&amp;#34; on your eyelids (Amy Winehouse style)</li>
            <li>but it is no longer available at stores.</li>
            <li>the application is comfortable, one apply it once a day.</li>
            <li>Got this as an add on item to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>I have to redraw those areas and cover it up to make a smooth again.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t blob.  </li>
            <li>it has a smooth line and a felt tip</li>
            <li>so I stick with a light pencil liner.</li>
            <li>The formula flows nicely onto the felt dispenser tip but not so much that the liner gets all over.  </li>
            <li>would like to see it available in brown.</li>
            <li>I just wish the liner applied by that great tip actually stayed put.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and precise.  </li>
            <li>The lines are smooth and precise.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it smudges</li>
            <li>It also goes over the tattooed areas smoothly.</li>
            <li>Precise, yes...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s precise indeed.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really tell I have it on but makes my eyes look really nice like my eyelashes are thicker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s precise</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on smoothly and precisely, but it smudges if your eyes run with tears or eyedrops.</li>
            <li>It smears after 4 hours or so but overall its great.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I like that it goes on well, smoothly and accurately.  </li>
            <li>so its makes it more worth it.</li>
            <li>and vey cheap.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>liner is extremely precise, and I am no longer terrified to use liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great starter liquid eyeliner, but I&#x27;ll probably try a different brand once it runs out.</li>
            <li>Smooth application.  </li>
            <li>Great eyeliner, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>it gives me a great starting point for my wing and I can go over it with a darker liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li>Precise line, but smudges throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to lightly push the tip on a piece of paper or something to make the liquid liner come out some, but all and all</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, over make up or on clean skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great liquid liner especially for the price..</li>
            <li>Smooth lines.</li>
            <li>I was using regular liquid liner before this and used to have to correct my cat eye almost every time I drew it, but this draws a straight line perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>It seems to have continuous flow and makes a good clear line.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>this still isn&#x27;t as good as my old one</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The felt tip easily glides across my eyelid as I like and the formula is smooth and consistent for the most part.</li>
            <li>Better yet: I love that it&#x27;s a drug store eyeliner that WORKS and is better than any other kind of eyeliner out</li>
            <li>The line is incredibly thin, which is great unless you want a bolder look (that is, again, currently very popular).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply on your eye.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommended this product to any one wants a good and easy EYELINER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and looks great and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>This is a somewhat tricky eyeliner to master, but when you achieve the right hold, it is super effective and quick.</li>
            <li>Overall, this eyeliner is a nice product that is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and it applies really smoothly.</li>
            <li>While the eyeliner itself is fine (nothing special), the lid kept coming off while the eye liner was in my makeup bag -</li>
            <li>Still, it goes on smoothly and looks great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Good product goes on smooth and easy and last all day</li>
            <li>Drys quick and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It does tend to get gunked up when applied over eyeshadow but a quick wash easily restores it</li>
            <li>Super easy to aply, just one time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to wipe it off and inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You wont wanna go back to normal liner its great!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but it was super easy.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the liquid comes out easily and bold.  </li>
            <li>It does go on easily, looks natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate - which is more than I can say for many liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>This pen is easy to use and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and is very precise.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to liquid eye-liner and I love this product!</li>
            <li>My new favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li>look good, I can easily remove a tiny portion with a damp q-tip if I made a mistake.</li>
            <li>I used the Kat Von D Tatoo Liner in Trooper for a long time but this is a wonderful drugstore alternative, and it&#x27;s definitely worth the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it lasts long and it has a rich and nice color!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner and really recommend it!</li>
            <li>Can make the line as fine or bold as my mood takes me.</li>
            <li>this eyeliner will not fail you!&lt;br /&gt;After trying pencils and crayons and liquids for many years</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup of any kind, but I needed this for a sugar skull makeup design for Halloween.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner so much that I never thought of changing to another brand ever!</li>
            <li>This works really well, the felt nub at the top has clean angles which makes even winged liner really easy.</li>
            <li>But in general it is good.</li>
            <li>Strange how it stays on sometimes, but great product nonetheless.</li>
            <li>But for something that I&#x27;m thinking twice of using, this is pretty comfortable!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve found that turning this pen at an angle and lightly pressing the tip even along the top of lash line gives me a perfect thin line.</li>
            <li>pretty good, as long as you keep a steady hand lol.</li>
            <li>Still good, strong, consistent after months of frequent use (3-4 times a week, ~4 months already)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love maybelline products this eyeliner makes it very easy to apply to the eye and has a beautiful smooth finish and it came earlier than expected..</li>
            <li>It applies so super smooth and the applicator is super precise.</li>
            <li>Works well over shadows which is super important</li>
            <li>This eyeliner pen provides bold precise lines.</li>
            <li>I bought this eyeliner after trying several brush and felt tip eyeliners and this is by far the best value.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve come across next to Milani&#x27;s infinite liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Nice fine application, easy to create different designed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner for about a week, and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance and ease of use!</li>
            <li>Great product, so dark and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and the tip is fine that you can get it exactly where you want it to go.</li>
            <li>Also the price is very competitive with other brands and the quality is great!!</li>
            <li>It stays on all day, it&#x27;s the right color, and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I never had a good experience with the older liquid liners, but this one is like a pen so the application process is so much easier.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily in a nice fine line, and I was happy, since I&#x27;m not very great with drawing fine, straight lines.  </li>
            <li>and I was super duper excited to try  it.</li>
            <li>Love the eyeliner, like a skinny marker..easy to apply (with a steady hand!)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s super beginner friendly.</li>
            <li>Applicator tip is nice and fine so you can make a great thin &amp;#34;close to the eyelashes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love it, I recommend it very highly..</li>
            <li>The tip is easy to use and you always get a clean crisp line.</li>
            <li>I always use this liner and its great as expected</li>
            <li>The formula itself I love because it is very pigmented and matte.</li>
            <li>I only use too eyeliner once in a good while and when I do this eyeliner does the trick .</li>
            <li>Finally a liquid eyeliner that has a good applicator.</li>
            <li>Longevity - Good for simple cat eye.</li>
            <li>Overall good product though.</li>
            <li>I love the Stila liner so much, but because it&#x27;s quite pricey, have been on the look out for a cheaper drugstore alternative.</li>
            <li>Also, the tube lasted me a good 5 months with daily use.  </li>
            <li>It really make them stand out more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier for precieion, it doesn&#x27;t come off on top lid when closing eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product from my local target and loved it</li>
            <li>I use it mostly to fill in my bottom lash line now, as I can dot it between lashes and get very close to my lash line.</li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Five years later, I decided to try the Stila Stay All Day eyeliner, and I instantly loved it for its ease in application.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, I really did.</li>
            <li>most of the eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried as liquid pen the tip dries out fairly fast.</li>
            <li>Product is long-lasting - makes it through the work day, but sometimes have to reapply in the evening if I&#x27;ve been touching my eyes too much.  </li>
            <li>It washes off fairly well without too much extra wiping.  </li>
            <li>The color goes on smooth and solid, I wear a cat eye daily and this liner is perfect!</li>
            <li>Has a nice soft, yet sturdy tip.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented love it</li>
            <li>I cannot recommended it more highly!</li>
            <li>Whats more when you got tears on it(not too much), you will become a panda.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not bad.  </li>
            <li>I consider myself a bit of an eyeliner connoisseur and, for the price, this is not bad.  </li>
            <li>It was super cheap as an add-on item, so I&#x27;m not mad that I bought it from the mistake of thinking it was waterproof.</li>
            <li>Woks the same as one that costs 40%  more, easy to use!</li>
            <li>I love this eye liner works amazing and stays on long!</li>
            <li>The Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love the color and it gives as clean a line as a steady hand will provide.</li>
            <li>I have never had much luck with liquid liners but this one is so easy and smooth to work with and lasts without need for touch ups</li>
            <li>I ordered one, but got an extra one, which is fantastic because I love it!</li>
            <li>Love the texture and feel, It doesn&#x27;t have a dry or clumpy feeling, goes on extremely smooth and is very precise.</li>
            <li>Stays pretty much all day and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t peel or something oily or fade like other eyeliners I&#x27;ve used its great.</li>
            <li>Allows for sharp wings and great control.</li>
            <li>No feathering like I&#x27;ve experienced with other liquids.</li>
            <li>I wish the tip would stay pointy longer, but it has good color payoff, glides on easy, and gives sharp lines.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for anyone who has a shaky hand when doing eyeliner like me</li>
            <li>Beautiful bold line on the first try,  but be careful,  </li>
            <li>I was worried about it drying out quickly</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect cross between a liquid eyeliner and a pencil</li>
            <li>I love using this for the classic cat eye or smokey eye.</li>
            <li>You need a steady hand on this one, but I like it better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It works super well and is way easier to apply than I would have thought.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Kind of recommend this product only if you want sort of cheap liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>It finished really quickly, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li>It had a super pointy tip, and as I&#x27;m used to using a pencil eyeliner, it took a while for me to get used to the change.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to go back several times to make the lines look perfect.  </li>
            <li>Found a quick tutorial video and have been a fan since.</li>
            <li>One day of mildly laborous work (a lot of work) and this stuff was embarrassingly smudged under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it starts out bold and ample and then goes away....</li>
            <li>I love the chunky size - it makes it easier for me to hold steady.</li>
            <li>like I do with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s infallible the super slim liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does not smudge.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my daughter and with some practice she was able to get this to work for her, although she only lines her top eyelids not the bottom along the water line.</li>
            <li>darker than expected but easy to handle and great for those cat eye make-up looks or any top eyeliner look from regular to pin-up style</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and never runs  Dark color and looks attractive</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li>I have fallen asleep after a long day and woke up to gorgeous lines.</li>
            <li>Bought this because of the great reviews, but even storing upside down</li>
            <li>It is not messy and it is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>product is great for drawing liner shapes and fine lines(when steady and careful).</li>
            <li>so I was surprised at how easily I was able to do it on the first try.</li>
            <li>New favorite eye liner</li>
            <li>My sister love the maybelline new York liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>New found favorite..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall this was a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Super pleasantly surprised by how excellent this black liquid eyeliner is.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine--it wipes off easily, but doesn&#x27;t really wear off during the day if you don&#x27;t touch it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get a straight line.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the color lasts all day, very seldom I need  retouch</li>
            <li>I thought it would be very flimsy and would not be easy to put on.</li>
            <li>And it has a very good price compared to some other high end brands</li>
            <li>It stays pretty dang well too!</li>
            <li>Also, this liner is garbage (I bought it in the past) - you&#x27;re better off with Body Shop&#x27;s liquid liner (amazing reviews &amp; cruelty free co.)</li>
            <li>Sofar its lasted months and never failed me!</li>
            <li>I swear the first time I applied it I quite suck at it!</li>
            <li>Thinking that I perhaps got a defective one, I purchased another--it was so good the first times it was worth a second try.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for first time user!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this liner, as I don&#x27;t have the steadiest hand, and this makes it so easy to line my upper lids.</li>
            <li>The felt tip makes it very easy to apply and you can customize the line (thick or super fine), and allows you to be very precise in your application.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly</li>
            <li>i love how this looks on, so easy to apply and create different looks.</li>
            <li>Good consistency, the narrow tip makes it easy for a liquid eyeliner beginner like myself</li>
            <li>Great &#x27;tight liner&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>very easy to apply and clean up later</li>
            <li>Not quite as long-lasting as some of my other liquid eyeliners, but for the price this is suitable :)</li>
            <li>This is a great eye liner for the perfect thin black line.</li>
            <li>However, I liked it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Stila definitely better than this one but more expensive</li>
            <li>This is a great little pen.</li>
            <li>This definitely takes more skill to apply than my cream pencil (so smooth and easy) and regular pencil eyeliners (don&#x27;t love).</li>
            <li>Lasts all day as is easy to control thickness - which is perfect for me because I use a very thin line for work, and a thicker line for going out in the evenings</li>
            <li>Works well, nice and dark and super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to find a cheap alternative to Stila, but this did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this one for a few months and it still works great, and I use it almost every day.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice eyeliner, and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Works nice but wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li>The color is darker than expected in a good way.</li>
            <li>I am not heavy on eyeliners and this works okay for me.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I might start using this daily, really surprised and happy.</li>
            <li>A steady hand helps but it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>As this takes away any ease it once had, it just doesn&#x27;t feel worth it to use.</li>
            <li>I was even able to wear eye makeup in a pool, and after getting splashed in the face from my kids, it was completely in tact and no run.</li>
            <li>I occasionally use it as an under-eye liner, but it doesn&#x27;t really blend well, (which is perfect for upper lid.)</li>
            <li>The price seems to fluctuate, but I always get it when I am buying $25 worth of stuff</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>It brings out added dimension to my eyes without turning me into a vampire or somebody fresh out of an Egyptian tomb.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Now, I am not anywhere near sophisticated with makeup, but I can apply a cat eye with no problem.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth that price.</li>
            <li>It makes even the clueless in makeup appear professional , i have used around 5 different brands since JAN and Maybelline by far was the best</li>
            <li>right on my first try too!</li>
            <li>I originally started buying this eyeliner several years ago at my local drug store, and seeing it available cheaper on Amazon made it all the more better.</li>
            <li>your money on this one and go with the L&#x27;Oreal Lineur Intense liquid liner instead - it still has a felt tip for easy application and dries to a crisp matte finish, without running throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to smudge away any errors when applied over a primer, and lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the coverage, and the beautiful glide of the pen, however, I cant believe the whole bottle was ruined, b/c I left the top off for such a short time.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and by far my new favorite go to eyeliner &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Dark and precise, love it!</li>
            <li>Application is super easy with a nice firm brush on the end</li>
            <li>so I see the no black eyes in the morning as way better than the rub off.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as other brands, however it is useful</li>
            <li>I find the pen skips and seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes a clean line, and it does stay put -- most especially when you use an eyelid primer, which I like to follow with a bit of finishing powder on the lid.</li>
            <li>Other liners wear off and if I go out after work I need to reapply, this product looks as good as it did when I applied it.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using this product- goes on easy , stays all day, dries instantly, doesn&#x27;t take a super steady hand</li>
            <li>so i just use nutragena makeup wipes, and it come right of</li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get the right shape.</li>
            <li>It dries right when you put it on.</li>
            <li>but... It never dries, wipe your eye and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>; It turned out to be a right decision.</li>
            <li>However, it still may take some practice to do it right.</li>
            <li>New to liquid mascaras, and this one is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner draws a smooth, bold line that dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smear or flake and gives your eyes that WOW factor seen on runway models.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this eyeliner, I was happy with it for the first few days.</li>
            <li>Went on nice and smooth dried up quickly tho</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly if I can hold my hand steady.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and dark as a gel liner would be, and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>luckily the tip of this eyeliner is so fine that i have complete control over the level of thickness</li>
            <li>I like this liner, the way it applies, but notice that it comes off very easy on my upper lid.  </li>
            <li>I just make sure I keep the pen standing somewhere, while not in use, with the tip facing down to make sure I get plenty of liquid when I use it.</li>
            <li>Today, I was out in the rain for two hours, and it still looks exactly like how it was when I first applied it seven hours ago!</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth, but I feel it like the tip dries a little fast, so I have to shake it to get the liquid to the tip, which is also good when applying it, so it won&#x27;t run  or smudge all over.</li>
            <li>It dries up pretty quickly and lasts the whole day for me!</li>
            <li>I can barely see any of it on top of my eye shadow.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best liquid liner in the world, I am sure, but it works just as well as other much more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>It seemed really rich and dark and glided on nicely.</li>
            <li>For one week it worked great - very fine lines and then the next week it dried up!  </li>
            <li>If you are not an eyeliner expert, it will take a very steady hand and some practice, but it CAN be done!</li>
            <li>I have not always been a fan of other eyeliners, mostly because it was so hard to apply and get a perfect line.  </li>
            <li>Creates a beautiful dark line with sharp edges, and I love the pen style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many others and not a single one beats this.</li>
            <li>It might be great if used doubled up with a standard pencil to get the look that I was going for - I&#x27;ll actually have to try that.</li>
            <li>Great even compared to the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>A great alternative to the more expensive stila version.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you are careful applying it because it&#x27;s that precise.</li>
            <li>Typical good liquid liner.</li>
            <li>It came super fast .</li>
            <li>Then it dries out super fast.</li>
            <li>its a great liner for such low cost!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not waterproof, but on a regular day, it stays put great.</li>
            <li>it is easy to hold stays on even though I&#x27;m  a frequent eye toucher.</li>
            <li>but this stuff stays put and is a rich dark black and the tip is perfect for the cateye -- YOU will not regret buying this..</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this eyeliner so far!</li>
            <li>sorry it&#x27;s great and even seems darker when applied at first, but no competition to the Stila stick I got, love it.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Eye Precise gives you the absolute easiest application ever!</li>
            <li>For dates or notching up the drama, Maybelline New York Precise is just as consistent.</li>
            <li>I had expected the top of this to be cumbersome to use, but I am pleasantly surprised by how easy the liner glides on!</li>
            <li>Super smooth and easy to make sharp well defined lines.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is perfect for those who are not very good with eyeliner in general.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>It dries out very fast and over all</li>
            <li>I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t wash off and that I&#x27;d look like a floral racoon for a week, but it washed off cleanly (from everywhere except the places along your eyelids that you&#x27;d normally put eyeliner).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super dark and pigmented and it glides on so easily, plus the fine tip makes cat eyes a breeze.</li>
            <li>The tip is the perfect size to make thin lines but is flexible enough to make thicker ones and it’s so easy to flick off the ends of your eye to make a cateye.</li>
            <li>The color is amiably dark, it goes on smoothly and without skipping just like the claims state, and the lines it creates are indeed very precise.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is perfect for drawing in your winged tip shapes ,the color is rich black.it hardly ever smudges and it lasts for pretty long hours (wish it were longer though) .No</li>
            <li>Although I would prefer a little thicker tip, it was a good bargain</li>
            <li>The tip is not quite as thin as they show in the ads/commercials, but you have very good control of the application.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, smooth, and goes on dark.</li>
            <li>Really pigmented, a nice rich black.</li>
            <li>No running, no fading, crisp lines, all day wear.</li>
            <li>So far, I have problems with almost all eyeliners even if they say smudge free.  </li>
            <li>Once it dries, the liner stays put pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used eyeliner that was a pencil.</li>
            <li>Its exactly how a liner should be.</li>
            <li>There are no reasons not to have this product if you are obsessed with liquid eyeliner and the perfect cat-eye!</li>
            <li>the product was exactly as described</li>
            <li>One of my favorite low price eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I totally suggest this product because it creates of lovely finish after applying your desired eye shadow.</li>
            <li>First bought this when I lived overseas.</li>
            <li>I put it only on my top lid and it lasts all day</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself &amp; one for my former foster daughter, Breanna, &amp; we both love this product.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge after first being applied.</li>
            <li>and I smile a lot (haha).</li>
            <li>cos first.</li>
            <li>I would say this rivals with many high-end pigmented liquid liners, such as the KVD Tattoo Liner.</li>
            <li>Makes liquid eyeliner so much easier!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as the description of the seller.</li>
            <li>I would buy better quality one next time...</li>
            <li>you are a first timer or a beginner, this is the liquid eyeliner for you to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:</li>
            <li>This was actually my first liquid eyeliner I had ever used</li>
            <li>However, it was overall an okay product.</li>
            <li>(if I want to bother) is not difficult.</li>
            <li>I have used potted gel liner in the past (Stila and Maybelline) and liked them for their smooth application and how they stay all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only okay...</li>
            <li>Such precise lines!</li>
            <li>after first time using it, i feel like it&#x27;s already running out of liquid in it.</li>
            <li>I can do a cat eye every day, and it doesn&#x27;t budge even when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
            <li>My first time applying liquid eyeliner is with this product, and I think I&#x27;ve converted.</li>
            <li>I first tried it when I was at a friend&#x27;s house</li>
            <li>I cut the tip a bit to access the product better and will use it most likely as a last resort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but the color fades on my upper eye lid.</li>
            <li>Shipped out fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and this eyeliner is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear liquid eyeliner very often, but when I do I use this!</li>
            <li>I ordered it and have used it once on a really hot humid day, seemed to stay in place.</li>
            <li>It has a consistent flow.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner pen, but it seems to run out/dry up quickly, especially when applied over eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I apply it with ease and the color payoff is very true-meaning one application is all I need!</li>
            <li>Comes on smooth and dark, love it</li>
            <li>My first liquid liner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sucked at applying eyeliner since the first time I tried it in the 9th grade.</li>
            <li>In the same breath, you can go over a line as many times as you want with this pen</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m more than likely never going to purchase another eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to buy more later too~</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve tried numerous tricks to get more ink to come out.</li>
            <li>i love it and would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that I do NOT wear it on my lower eye; only the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to give this eyeliner a 5, but I have noticed it smudging and transferring after only 3-4 hours at my part time job, powder does the trick sometimes.</li>
            <li>I tried this eyeliner for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>First time trying this product</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Comes out with a bang the first 5-7 uses but then kinda lackluster after.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra $$ on a Stila eye liner, loads better.</li>
            <li>EVEN the expensive stuff doesn&#x27;t hold up against this awesome liner!</li>
            <li>I love my eyeliners but am a low maintenance girl.</li>
            <li>and i find myself reaching for this liner wayyyy more than my urban decay.</li>
            <li>but i feel like the first eye it works</li>
            <li>Had the same thing happen with many kinds of eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s essentially a drug store eyeliner.</li>
            <li>As any liquid eyeliner it can get messy but the end result is always good .</li>
            <li>Good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I owned this eyeliner for two weeks and loved it when it worked, but it dried out.</li>
            <li>I considered giving this 4 stars because I kind of fail at applying liquid-type liners, but it doesn&#x27;t seem right to fault an amazing eye liner for my unpracticed hands.</li>
            <li>I wear super thick eyeliner and this stuff lasts ALL day and looks just as good as when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>but I think they dry out kind of fast.</li>
            <li>I have never liked a eye product of this type, BUT I love this!!</li>
            <li>The color was a nice, intense, solid black and it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and the color stays on for a really long time.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed after the first use, but it dried out or was empty</li>
            <li>It applies nicely, but due to my eyelid shape, it transfers my eye shadow over this immediately and it turns gray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other liquid eye liner and never found one i liked, until this one.</li>
            <li>Great product, it last long time and the color is very black.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is rich and the brush is soft.</li>
            <li>Try rimmel scandleyes liner or if you want to spend more try Urban Decay glide on liners they work better and stay long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super black and really easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is great for someone who finds it hard to wear eyeliner or too much make-up like me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably still use this if I wanted something very temporary and easy to remove, but for the most part it&#x27;s just a waste and ends up making me look like a panda.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re no expert in makeup like I am, it will take a few tries to master the perfect size line you want.</li>
            <li>10 years late I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Loved it SOO much more than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It has the best, thin tip that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>love this product; really goes on well and last all day.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, not straight line.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s beautiful and the sharp tip really allows for beginners to better shape their eyeliner, it&#x27;s not easy to make mistakes with this one!</li>
            <li>much.&lt;br /&gt;i am a free lance artist and i use this on my prom clients, they love how black it is!</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, I very much appreciate it&#x27;s staying powder, and the waterproof aspect of it is very convenient.</li>
            <li>(so many others are black for the first 5ish uses and then quickly start fading/thinning out after that.</li>
            <li>Worked great, getting harder to use after a few months, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>This one has such a precise tip that it does stay right there at the lash line.</li>
            <li>Bought after seeing a positive review on YouTube.</li>
            <li>The application is smooth and easy but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s easy to use, lasts practically all day, as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes, &amp; it easily washes off with a little water.</li>
            <li>The color is dark, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>Stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>She has since pretty much given up eye make up.</li>
            <li>Runs out if you use daily but other than that it is great</li>
            <li>The black is bold, and the application is super smooth.</li>
            <li>I was very intimidated when I first pulled off the cap.</li>
            <li>I gave this a try after my long time favorite was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I usually like waterproof products, i bought this one because of the good reviews and because i thought it was waterproof...</li>
            <li>Nice dark color-</li>
            <li>this is very easy to use and very precise, its so black and last all day i really like this product</li>
            <li>Smooth, easy applicator, nice dark black line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it because I can never keep my hand steady enough to draw my liner before, I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li>I cant say anything bad about this product, very easy to use and of great quality.</li>
            <li>Love it, last long and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Shooters turn out equal and beautiful with little effort</li>
            <li>Tip is bigger than some more high end brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of high and low-end eyeliners, and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Dark black,easy to apply,smudge-proof,,wears on long:)Would strongly recommend it to anyone who likes using black eyeliners and wants it to look perfect and last!</li>
            <li>The very tip is to light which makes it hard to to fine clean lines.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love the Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner in Black and in Brown.</li>
            <li>I am not super amazing at applying liner to the lid but this makes it a bit easier.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner....seemed to dry out faster than the shore bought ones.</li>
            <li>I do like the intensity of the color, it is a nice black matte</li>
            <li>But overall, extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but so easy to apply I have only done it once.  </li>
            <li>Rubs really really really easily,  I put it on, and not even an hour later it is smudged all over my eye</li>
            <li>Nice slight line.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it is so easy to apply that reapplication</li>
            <li>Got it the next day with Amazon Prime and it is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I have only purchased this once, but will again as soon as I run out, because it is so easy to use and lasts.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would dry out like most eyeliners do when not kept correctly, but it hasn&#x27;t been showing signs of drying out any time soon.</li>
            <li>This liner is really easy to use, especially for a beginner when liquid eyeliners can be daunting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t run or fade throughout the day but does come off fairly easy with facial soap.</li>
            <li>On the lower eye line I feel like I have to pull on my eye and press for the black ink to show nicely.</li>
            <li>I switched to this product recently because I found that the color is darker and the felt tip does not ware out as easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but transfers to my upper lid.</li>
            <li>does the job, stays on fairly well and last a long time in terms of duration of use.&lt;br /&gt;i have had it for a couple months now</li>
            <li>Easy to be precise with a little practice.</li>
            <li>I read a large number of reviews stating that this Maybelline liner was it</li>
            <li>I used this liner to fill in large circles that covered up all the around my eyes, and hid my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and does not cause any irritations like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Makes cat eyes super easy and wears extremely well.</li>
            <li>That being said the eyeliner is very precise and thin lines will get absorbed into the fine creases of my eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe the other comments at first, but this truly stays on even the most oily lids.</li>
            <li>Fine enough to enhance my mole.</li>
            <li>Extra fine tip.</li>
            <li>Gives you a pretty decent lined look.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner lasts the whole day and is good for thinly lining my eyes and/or drawing bold cat eye.  </li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The color is pigmented and dark and applies onto your eyelids very easily.</li>
            <li>However, the color is super dark and glides easily.</li>
            <li>Probably because my city is extremely hot and I often stay outdoor with high heat.</li>
            <li>Love how it&#x27;s got a felt tip for application- easy to make thin lines right against my lash line.</li>
            <li>Sure,  it&#x27;ll flow out fine in the *middle * of the brush,  but not really at the end.</li>
            <li>Liner usually is hard for me to make look good</li>
            <li>I prefer a more natural look with my liner and was able to pull off a very thin line with this, but you can also easily created thicker or winged liner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of felt tip liquid liners, I had tried similar products, but saw this one here</li>
            <li>But overall, I really like the product glides on smoothly for a winged tip eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping I found a product that worked well with my watery eye problem.  </li>
            <li>I purchased eye shadow primer (NYX)  to use under this eyeliner because I really like the application.  </li>
            <li>It remained smudge free for a couple of hours but by the time I checked it again later in the day, Panda Eyes!  </li>
            <li>so eyeliners don&#x27;t work very well on me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to someone else who is finding a liquid liner!</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>I know the real struggles of trying to make both eyes match.</li>
            <li>The liquid is very watery.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping but</li>
            <li>I do like the liner except it really feels like it wears out fast so that I do not like.</li>
            <li>it stays on very well the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>much cheaper and easier for applying.</li>
            <li>I just received my package and opened it up to find the Loreal Lineur Intense brush tip liquid eyeliner instead of the Maybelline one I had ordered.</li>
            <li>the price means I can practice as much as I want without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>I really like the price.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Lynne</li>
            <li>Also very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>(really depends on skin oil and how your eye fold is) but</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like t his product.</li>
            <li>However, I prefer this formula over Stila because I think you can layer on the color much easier.  </li>
            <li>I really like this pen</li>
            <li>I dries fast and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>, I have all sorts of allergies and sensitivities to chemicals, but this didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>Drys out fast, smudges.</li>
            <li>It is much easier</li>
            <li>The eyeliner does not smudge and lasts me the whole day without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li>Also, if you make a mistake and try to remove it with a wet qtip it will smear and you wont be able to get the smear off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If you know of a better wet liner LET ME KNOW.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it for my whole eye, just the flick</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is worth it already for me, because I don&#x27;t smell like I painted household cleansers on my sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li>I then switched to retractable pencil eyeliner and found that it smudged way too much on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like done too much</li>
            <li>Any mess-ups could be wiped away with a make-up wipe without much effort.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve mastered it, you can do anything really</li>
            <li>I have spent more on the Clinique brand</li>
            <li>Really like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>The felt tip is &amp;#34;longer&amp;#34; and product is on the whole length of the tip so that you can rest the edge of the tip against your lid to get a smoother looking line.  </li>
            <li>Also, the very tip of the liner does not hold makeup.</li>
            <li>Does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product</li>
            <li>I really like this liquid eye liner-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very convenient for when I&#x27;m in a hurry for work, which is like always.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much it smudged and ran until my husband called me &amp;#34;Mommy Dearest.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Stays put the whole day.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Fiancé says it is much easier to apply than others she has tried.</li>
            <li>really get close to my lashes with the pointy design of the pen.</li>
            <li>&amp; it doesn&#x27;t even smudge much at all without primer) and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner isn&#x27;t very smudge-proof either.</li>
            <li>such a precise line.</li>
            <li>You have to shake it a bit between applications, but it goes on smoothly, and for me, it stays on throughout the day without smearing to the upper lid.</li>
            <li>REALLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>The packaging is practical and convenient because you dont have to worry about spilling any of it and its really lightweight.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner, and its very convenient to use</li>
            <li>the color isn&#x27;t too intense either.</li>
            <li>tip makes precise lines (may depends on the users)&lt;br /&gt;- Possible to control the intensive like painting with ink and brush on paper</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.</li>
            <li>its so much easier and lasts for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like waterproof liners anyways</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Also it dries fast</li>
            <li>In fact, the applicator is the same as my favorite liquid eyeliner made by Stila (which is more expensive, but has a much better, waterproof formula.</li>
            <li>was upset because i really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner and the precision you can get with it.</li>
            <li>It pays not to look like you&#x27;re ready for Halloween.</li>
            <li>I just use pencils but those smudge too much and end up on my eyelid.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and even and will last all day and night.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I do get a tiny big of fall out if it&#x27;s warm out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different liquid liners in the &amp;#60;$10 varieties, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Wish this, I can get right to the root for a close line, and I can easily create a sharp wing.</li>
            <li>so I searched high and low for an easy to apply liquid eyeliner that stays put.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very accurate unlike other liquid eyeliners that have the brush separate from the liquid, I like that it&#x27;s all in one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most certainly not water proof</li>
            <li>Instead of the beautiful solid black line of yesterday, I got a water-down, diluted, nearly clear line.</li>
            <li>If it stays dry you&#x27;re good all day long.</li>
            <li>I was able to line my eyes so easily i almost can&#x27;t believe it haha also its a nice black thin line and not too shiny.</li>
            <li>the application is phenomenal and precise if you like sharp cat eye liner then definitely get this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing the same eyeliner method for the past 15 years, so my hands are pretty steady but this would be a great liner for beginners.</li>
            <li>It resembles a felt tip pen, nice and stiff.</li>
            <li>If you ever like doing cat eyes or just a thin simple top layer of eye liner, Try This!!!</li>
            <li>i apply liner daily and it does have a good sharp pointer .</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try an eyeliner that didn&#x27;t require a brush I had to clean off after but this simply do NOT hold up compared to my gel eye liner from MAC.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and dark!</li>
            <li>Smears and falls off after a few hours but is very easy to apply and create a straight line.</li>
            <li>The tip can be used to make a very fine line on your eyelids or turned slightly on</li>
            <li>Overall, definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Other than that i love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything - Stila&#x27;s, Kat Von D&#x27;s brand, and many other liquid, pencil and marker liners.</li>
            <li>Love the brand and the sharp lines.  </li>
            <li>I will probably order again, since the color was dark like I love, and had that wet look, like I love.</li>
            <li>However, this may be due in part to my own failings, but I feel the black color doesn&#x27;t come on as strong as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>The color is very dark and is very easy yo apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for getting that dramatic wingtip that is all over</li>
            <li>I never have to touch up my eyeliner and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily after it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>The only small downside is that because it&#x27;s super precise, the tip bends easily.</li>
            <li>This pen has a much nicer soft, straight, felt tip!</li>
            <li>It will give you the same, clean look every time.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and crisp and stays on as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, but it also flakes off leaving chunks of eyeliner missing.</li>
            <li>but great for thin or thick precise lines!!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s very much a dupe for MAC&#x27;s Penultimate liner) and it works great with a continuous stream of product, the liner product itself is VERY poorly made.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and a nice dark black.</li>
            <li>like my conventional liquid one better</li>
            <li>The tip doesn&#x27;t dry up fast like others and it goes on incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>So I need something that is easy to apply with my clumsy hands and sometime that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a cheap clown.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s extremely easy to apply a thin line</li>
            <li>just really wish that this eyeliner were waterproof since my eyes seem to have an uncanny knack for getting wet easily.</li>
            <li>This Maybelline eyeliner is very precise and black.</li>
            <li>I love it, it is very easy to use, and it is a dark black which I needed!</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner by FAR&lt;br /&gt;you can easily make a very thin, fine line that is barely visible but adds just a bit of depth to your lashes</li>
            <li>lasts a long time and smooth application</li>
            <li>I love how dark the colour is.</li>
            <li>It going on well and leaves a nice small line</li>
            <li>Now I just need to get better with applying this eyeliner, but it shows up dark, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to apply with NO mess and it last ALL day.</li>
            <li>and I have to wait for more to make it&#x27;s way down.</li>
            <li>I wear on my top eyelid and after washing my face, some transferred down to my lower lid and ended up having raccoon eyes...</li>
            <li>While this eyeliner really applies well and removes easily, it was not a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li>My new eyeliner of choice!  </li>
            <li>Good eyeliner for a decent price my only problem is sometimes it faded a little bit</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was great but the second time I used it, it was as if it was empty and just a little would come out at a time where the first time it was like a paint brush.</li>
            <li>The liner part was very tall, but I love the color it comes out with, very dark.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out this as much as I like their gel eyeliner, this is also a must.</li>
            <li>Made cute doll eye look with a slight flare at the end.</li>
            <li>My previous purchase of this product was 10x better...</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of liquid eyeliners, but they do not go on smooth and will dry out at the tips.  </li>
            <li>Rest elbow on a table for a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I use several different brands of cosmetics, but Maybelline&#x27;s eye liners are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I do not consider my lids to be particularly oily, so that is not the problem.</li>
            <li>it is sooooo good~&lt;br /&gt;i can hardly find an eyeliner which i can apply smoothly on my eyelids, but this is an exception!!</li>
            <li>but if I take it slow it turns out great and last all day!</li>
            <li>I love this product, but the last one I received appears to be counterfeit as the formulation and tip are completely different.</li>
            <li>I still goof sometimes because my hands just aren&#x27;t that steady</li>
            <li>It has decent staying power.</li>
            <li>Needed a more sturdy applicator tip, rather than the narrow brush type that is too flexible and doesn&#x27;t allow for as much control.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for those with a steady hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it for quick eye makeup but not for big parties and wedding parties or so.</li>
            <li>DECENT.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is worthy of the same ranks in my book.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been frightened of liquid liner because my hand is not all that steady.</li>
            <li>I prime my eyes with eye shadow primer and a bit of powder, but that&#x27;s only because my lids get super oily.</li>
            <li>I was even getting ready with one of my friends who uses mostly high end makeup brands and loaned it to her because she was getting annoyed with her liquid eyeliner and even she LOVED it.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have a very steady hand when it comes to applying eyeliner, but this one is easy to control and only requires one swipe across the eyelid for a solid line.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little darker, but other than that, its a great product.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a quick cheap fix in between the eyeliner brands I usually wear.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Even when using a high end primer it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay put.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews on here I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of high end make up</li>
            <li>(I was in high humidity at the time as well).&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on smooth and makes a lovely line that can be smudged slightly when still wet to help you make smokey eyes.</li>
            <li>But I find the formula a bit sheer, I would have to go over it a few time before it&#x27;s the perfect black.</li>
            <li>The site would not let me return or exchange it though due to it being a &#x27;hazardous material&#x27; even though I didn&#x27;t even open it yet.</li>
            <li>This product is far better than any other eye liners I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is really something that all women must have, easy to use, last longer and the quality OMG amazing,&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely keep buying when I&#x27;m run out of it!</li>
            <li>Plus, the tip isn&#x27;t as fine as the Stila one, so it&#x27;s harder to make cat eyes.</li>
            <li>The felt tip gives you good control over where the juicy black stuff goes, but the fun only lasts for so long.</li>
            <li>I just prefer something a little more stable.</li>
            <li>but I apply eyeshadow over it to help it set a little better.</li>
            <li>dried out super quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take it off when still wet!</li>
            <li>The brush is stiff and very precise, as advertised.</li>
            <li>While this looked great and stayed in place all day, I again had a hard time applying it because the bush was so long and flimsy.</li>
            <li>You only have to wait a few seconds for it to dry, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s good for making sharp thin lines but it smears REALLY easily and does&#x27;t stay put, even with a eyelid primer.</li>
            <li>My old ones kept smearing so much and by the end of the day its gone.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to apply than a pencil, and looks really professional.  </li>
            <li>I picked this eyeliner up one day at Walmart not expecting a great product, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t drag or pull at the skin and applies as smoothly as a gel liner.</li>
            <li>it goes over old eyeliner very well.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope I got a dried up one by mistake,</li>
            <li>The felt tips on this eyeliner and Stila are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try using it normally once, but it was bascially out of ink and wouldn&#x27;t go on</li>
            <li>Okay, but not a smooth apply.</li>
            <li>It gets a nice dark line above my lashes and does not budge until I need to remove makeup and wash my face.</li>
            <li>My liner will last the whole day, even in hot TX weather.</li>
            <li>love it it dosnt smuge and last a long time on also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several so far, especially some of the top sellers/</li>
            <li>With the exception of Eyeko (which I also love), this eyeliner was the only one that has stayed on without smudging for as long as it did on my oily lids.</li>
            <li>It looks ok, but just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly or last as long as Kat Von D&#x27;s Tattoo liner.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to wait more then a few seconds before opening my eye.</li>
            <li>This is nice - not too thick or too think.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the cap is on tight however because I feel it may dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have sufficient money to buy 50-bucks worth sets, I highly recommend this eye-liner not only because of its cheap price, but also because of its organic components which prevents allergic reactions and other skin-related ailments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does start to smudge and not look as sharp at the end of the day, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>I find the formula doesn&#x27;t spider into all the fine lines in the surface of the skin like some other products.  </li>
            <li>It also was not hard to wash off.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.the point makes applying it easy and this very pigmented and long lasting..</li>
            <li>This liner is really easy to use, and you can actually use it several ways.  </li>
            <li>Easy peasy to go back over your initial line.</li>
            <li>Easy to add a wing effect because the liner is so thin and precise.</li>
            <li>Now if only I could find the right lipstick...</li>
            <li>This is the only one that gets everything right.</li>
            <li>I had to rub some mascara off right next to the end of the line on my outer eye</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is much easier to put on than the kind with a wand, at least for me!</li>
            <li>Easy to draw on and goes on dark.  </li>
            <li>Lasts long and if I wear it to sleep and need a quick touch up</li>
            <li>They are sending me a new order of the Maybelline one, I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it&#x27;s going to be the right one this time.. not a totally different brand of liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth, this is my second one first one lasted me almost two months until I noticed it was starting to dry out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to draw such a thin line direcy above my lash line.</li>
            <li>I am really new at this too</li>
            <li>Doubted this product could possibly live up to my Stila-high standards.</li>
            <li>I have been using maybelline lash stiletto liquid eyeliner for awhile, but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>So I searched for a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new one after I ran out</li>
            <li>I found it in Maybelline New York Eye Studio</li>
            <li>I wore it on New Years Eve</li>
            <li>Easy to use black liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li>Has a very bold, black color.</li>
            <li>Hope it doesn&#x27;t dry up too quickly</li>
            <li>I was careful at work to avoid touching my eyes, and I was only there for about six hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and great for making thin or thick eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It is precise, draws a narrow line very well.</li>
            <li>It seemed to dry quickly and look flaky before it started to peel off.</li>
            <li>The tip isn&#x27;t as narrow as Stila&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s still just as easy to create a classic winged look.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t dislike this Precise Liquid Eyeliner enough to rate it lower than 3 stars, I have a feeling that you can find a longer lasting product.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft, but substantial bendable tip, with plenty of &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; to do whatever you want on your eyes.</li>
            <li>However, because the tip is flexible its very hard to do the winged eyeliner that&#x27;s currently so popular with this particular eye liner.</li>
            <li>Stays on for a long time through all weather, only comes off when you want it off but easy removal.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner stays on well and is easy to use, but it did not last long.</li>
            <li>The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t stay on well for long and easily rubs off.</li>
            <li>easy to use, last long.</li>
            <li>the pen seem to dry up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>the tip also makes for a very sharp line, making it effortless to build it out into a fine cat eye.</li>
            <li>n gives such a pretty look.</li>
            <li>I never had an eyeliner as fine and black as this.</li>
            <li>My eyelids get pretty oily so this eyeliner did need to be reapplied occasionally.</li>
            <li>first off it runs all day and somehow gets on upper eyelids.</li>
            <li>sorry..do not waste your money..!</li>
            <li>I usually use Stila&#x27;s eye liner pen, which, works admittedly better and longer, but for the price this works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something exactly like this and FINALLY found it.  </li>
            <li>It’s not worth it to me because you don’t get a precise line.</li>
            <li>Dark, precise lines.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and dark.</li>
            <li>If it can stay on my oily lids, I&#x27;m sure it can last on other skin types as well.</li>
            <li>When you apply the second coat, you need to wait until the first coat dries otherwise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply but it will smear a little by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>SUPER BLACK very liquidy</li>
            <li>It says the color is black but shows up more like a grey and the applicator brush is very EHH.</li>
            <li>It not only makes applying liner to my eyes pretty easy, I also used it to do a Day of the Dead face paint for Halloween</li>
            <li>It allows for much greater precision than other brushes due to the long, tapered end, and draws smooth lines.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s high rating and review, I took a chance to get this one to try, with NYX mechanical pencil and Maybelline lasting drama gel liner.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how long this will last before it dries out, lets hope it lasts awhile, even if not, its a good price and so much cheaper than MAC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really easy to use, very dark.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, Ive bought a few of these now</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and stayed on all day, however, it dried up after just a couple applications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good at putting on eyeliner, but I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Precise but dries out, I also didn&#x27;t care too much for the texture, very messy when trying to fix mistakes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any issues with it as of yet The color black is the Blackest of black which i lOve and glides right on without any eye irritation.</li>
            <li>You do need to apply more than one layer, however, in order to get a solid black color.</li>
            <li>Love it definitely will buy it again goes on black</li>
            <li>However, this is the sharpest tip and draws a super precise, thin line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to create a winged eyeliner shape with this, however it&#x27;s not a nice, clean black line because it smears and it isn&#x27;t really a traditional liquid liner</li>
            <li>very black, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Thin, precise, very black (just how I like it), lasting, easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Supper easy to apply, very black, and stays put.</li>
            <li>the only downside is that it tends to smear more than I expected, but I live in humid Florida, so I probably just need to get a waterproof liner next time.</li>
            <li>I also put a large shape on the end of my nose, and intricate flower designs on different parts of my face.</li>
            <li>The felt tip sometimes is bothersome to use over eyeshadow, especially if you have layered colour to build a certain look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little light</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what the fuss is about, this other eyeliner I bought from the pharmacy for $2 was actually easier to apply and it stayed for a long time without smudging, and it wasn&#x27;t even a popular brand.</li>
            <li>The brush gets dry easily but it lasts a decently long time so that seems fair.&lt;br /&gt;Storing</li>
            <li>Even after leaving it closed for weeks, I would come back to it and it would still work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I personally think that&#x27;s a little ridiculous, but its a small price to pay for the best cheap liquid eyeliner on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition to that neat little trick, the eyeliner also manages to smear everywhere, magically transferring itself from your upper eyelid to accentuate the bags under your lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I have my eyeliner tattooed on, but occasionally I want a little more for evening.  </li>
            <li>For the price, its hard to find a much better liner.</li>
            <li>It actually looks decent!  </li>
            <li>I am terrible at applying liquid eyeliner but love the look; this is the easiest application I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>But it starts fade away later and mass up your whole eye make-up after 5-8 hours.</li>
            <li>No luck so far.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again based only on the fact that it transfers too much.</li>
            <li>I ignored it, fixed my eyes, and went to work.</li>
            <li>but I am going back to Stila as it really lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and this product created no irritation what so ever.</li>
            <li>Maybe old</li>
            <li>The tip allows for thicker or thinner lines depending on your preference and so far has not caused me any irritation (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner since I was 14 years old,</li>
            <li>no..sadly that one didnt last much longer</li>
            <li>I perly can draw a complete line.</li>
            <li>I like to wear it defined or smudged by a lighter soft color.</li>
            <li>I keep them around just in case, but I&#x27;ll only attempt to use them if I have absolutely nothing else.</li>
            <li>My only issue is it sometimes tugs at my eyelid as it goes on causing a bumpy line rather than a straight one..</li>
            <li>Throwing out my old ones.</li>
            <li>I also find the felt tip soft then others.  </li>
            <li>You have to hold it horizontally and use the whole side of the pen to get it to go on properly.</li>
            <li>Everything a busy working mom needs in an eyeliner.</li>
            <li>liquid liner so far, plus</li>
            <li>I work in an office and feel that make up is a requirement for appearing professional.  </li>
            <li>It is really the only make up I wear.</li>
            <li>when my old eye liner was discontinued..the search was on.</li>
            <li>but it is a very close second.</li>
            <li>was really surprised.</li>
            <li>idk, this one might be  old or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for 2 days,  and not only do the wings on the corners of my eyes smudge if my eyes get watery,  but the ink doesn&#x27;t flow out at the very tip,  where you need it.</li>
            <li>Info About Me: 23 yrs old, I have oily skin, including oily lids and naturally tan</li>
            <li>It must be old product, would like to return but the return product section wont let me.</li>
            <li>However, it smudges easily when it gets wet (like eyes watering when you yawn) and of the few tubes I bought, they all seemed to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this frequently from here on out.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the money that I spent on this product.&lt;br /&gt;--Prasanthi.</li>
            <li>I think this is just as good as an expensive department store brand.  </li>
            <li>Nice thin line.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner has a really nice thin tip.</li>
            <li>Nice, thin applicator.</li>
            <li>You can do a thick wing or a thin one, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>You can create thin or thick lines perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li>this product is a plus, I didnt put a 5 star rate cause even though it lasts all day, it fades a little and looks like some eye shadow made eyeliner, but my intentions on this products are pretty positive</li>
            <li>I especially didnt like much this one because when u sweat or when u put ur hand over your eyes it makes a huge black messs,,,, i would prefer it to wash away completely rather than having a big huge black spot of eyeliner.....</li>
            <li>It allows me to get right up next to the last line so it brings out my eyes without looking like I smeared a line of color across my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so black and lasts for long, even away better than Mac&#x27;s liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I mean its ok .</li>
            <li>There are many other eye liners in this form from different brands that do not have the same effect.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more to stash in my purse and various other places for emergencies.</li>
            <li>At first I was frightened it would dry out</li>
            <li>After turning 40, I realized it was getting harder to evenly apply liquid liner close to my top lashes (due to softening of eyelid).</li>
            <li>Long lasting and is still a vibrant black, even after being placed on top of eye shadow.</li>
            <li>BUT, I find that not enough of the liner ink comes through the applicator so while you get a fine line, you don&#x27;t get a dark line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Very easy to control the brush on this without the liquidy mess you get with some other liquid liners.</li>
            <li>So far the first time I used it it came out very liquidy, however it did try after a few minutes in front of the fan.</li>
            <li>I think I typically can get 2-3 months out of this applying it every single day (sometimes more than once).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for someone who is inexperienced with liquid liner as it can be applied in a thin or thick line and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper, completely black and matte, and works a hundred times better!</li>
            <li>Does not skip and looks fresh as well as long lasting results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really black in my eye</li>
            <li>It is SUPER black.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner has a nice dark black color that barely fades throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much unusable after a few uses.</li>
            <li>The color is super black.  </li>
            <li>It will fade color slightly with extreme humidity and mositure but adding a little powder with it helps with this to a great degree.</li>
            <li>I used a very similar, but highly priced brand name product belonging to my mother.</li>
            <li>Used it and loved instantly how smooth and thin to thick</li>
            <li>I choose this over high end liquid liners regularly.</li>
            <li>It is so thin I am able to do a nice wing especially coming from a beginner that sucks at doing wings</li>
            <li>Should have expected that, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lighter black.  </li>
            <li>I use this one to outline the cat-eye that I go back and color in with a darker but less precise liner.</li>
            <li>It has good stain power (very black) and has a small tip</li>
            <li>Not a good feel, so I tried to press it on top of my hand to get it to flow..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not good at applying eyeliner. :-)</li>
            <li>I usually use it lightly.</li>
            <li>I akways buy this same brand found it here cheaper than where i normally buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with these types of eyeliners because normally the tip would be too big</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It still works but it is not dark.</li>
            <li>I love how dark it is, and it&#x27;s thicker than other eye liners I&#x27;ve used, too.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so nice to be able to get this only since we live in a very small town which makes it frustrating when you run out and can&#x27;t find anyone locally who carries it.</li>
            <li>I must have got a dry one because it&#x27;s NOTHING like the commercials (dark, easy to apply)</li>
            <li>Smooth eyeliner,but a little deep color .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought plenty of other eyeliners but due to my oily lids, they smudge super fast.</li>
            <li>The products runs really easy and the felt tip is really hard.</li>
            <li>I had previously been solely a eyeliner pencil user, but wanted to give liquid a try for more sharp wings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this eye liner over the hard pencil liners that never sharpen properly.</li>
            <li>This is my new eyeliner regular.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any smudging; but it should be noted that I do have somewhat of a dry skin.</li>
            <li>because it seems to dry out a bit fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out fast, and I can apply this with precision.</li>
            <li>Like everything about it but doesn&#x27;t dry up as fast as I would like</li>
            <li>I recently bought a cheap brand from Silvercell and it didn&#x27;t smear at all, but it cracks and disappears after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re not able to use the tip for anything pretty much.</li>
            <li>For less than $5 it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not black, barely shows on the eyelids.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have sometimes is that the very tip will sometimes run out once I get to the second eye</li>
            <li>have also tried the NYX curve ergonomic type liner and it was no superior to just the nice long handle</li>
            <li>It dried out really quick and the too got bent.</li>
            <li>It dried up relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>The tip gets a little dry when drawing the line, but super dark and precise.</li>
            <li>nothing major.  </li>
            <li>There’s really no other way to use this eyeliner without the tip soaking up product/drying out.</li>
            <li>Very solid fine lines gives my eyes a little touch of perfection!</li>
            <li>It is easy to wear, but a little dry.</li>
            <li>What really works well about this item is the precision it offers due to the shape and construct of the tip..  </li>
            <li>Make fine or thick lines.</li>
            <li>albeit infrequently)&lt;br /&gt;- not as quick dry as expected</li>
            <li>it smudges easily and it becomes very messy!</li>
            <li>i like the shape of the brush, but with my old liquid i could just wipe it and it come right off, but if you mess up with this and wipe it off, it will leave a large smear down oyur face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for the quality and the price is better than any expensive brand.</li>
            <li>, I really love this product, saw on commercial and could not find in any local drug store or Walmart and its really hard for me to find stuff anyway, I have to use a magnifying glass</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m obsessed with creating a wing on my outer eyelid and this does the job amazingly.</li>
            <li>Generally cheaper in the stores,</li>
            <li>If you put too much moisturizer on, it will bleed some, so be careful with that.</li>
            <li>Does not drag skin.</li>
            <li>I have hooded (barely visible) eyelids</li>
            <li>The tip of it barely works at all</li>
            <li>Apparently they don&#x27;t make it in brown....</li>
            <li>My loreal and maybelline stiletto barely smudge when water comes into play.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t wash away completely with just facial cleanser and water.  </li>
            <li>Three hours later, I went into the bathroom at my man&#x27;s house to find that it was completely smudged</li>
            <li>This is the BEST LIQUID EYELINER EVER ,it goes on smooth, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t crackle after a few hours of having it on , I&#x27;m the worst on putting on eyeliner</li>
            <li>I love this ultra thin felt tip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had success drawing a line that extended beyond my eye lid without it looking messy.</li>
            <li>and I can actually apply it, I had quit wearing eyeliner because I could not see good enough to put it on, I know its not perfect sometimes</li>
            <li>I am able to create thin or think lines with this liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Other times, I get that strong, opaque black</li>
            <li>only complaint about this product is that it runs out VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Unlike my other experiences with felt liners where it gets worse after more uses, I found that the product went on much smoother after awhile.</li>
            <li>I wear it all day long, and it won&#x27;t smudge, even though wear I live</li>
            <li>Very dark, intense and bold black.</li>
            <li>It has to be replied a few times throughout the day and you can&#x27;t rub your eyes - it will come right off.</li>
            <li>If it is a hot humid day it may still leave a slight racoon eye.  </li>
            <li>so I usually set it with black shadow pretty quickly to prevent it from being all over my face.</li>
            <li>I usually wear Urban Decay pencil eyeliners, and haven&#x27;t used waterproof in awhile, but I think this stuff looks just as good (if not better) than some of my Urban Decay liners.</li>
            <li>Without that tip staying wet and putting out product, the only part of the felt brush that works is the middle; which is great if you want a thick line or don’t mind using half the brush.</li>
            <li>The color is very black, more intensely black than the Stilla eyeliner, but this one is not water proof at all...</li>
            <li>The tip of the liner is a little pointier than I prefer making it harder to be precise</li>
            <li>I normally have multiple different tubes from different companies at a time.</li>
            <li>It was more on the matte side but still dark enough to show up without any streaks or missing spots of product.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday (only a medium line on my top lid) and I usually have to get a new after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>it is solid black unlike some other pens with very light coverage, showing up grey.</li>
            <li>Creating a dramatic cat eye hasn&#x27;t been easier :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s side to create a thicker more dramatic line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only downside is that it can be easily overdone with the flick of your wrist (seriously)</li>
            <li>My Kat Von D tattoo liner ran out and ive been too busy to get another one, and i actually have this and the urban decay liquid liner at home</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter really liked this its comparable to expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Love the dark color, however, I&#x27;m not sure I will ever get the hang of liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Great staying power, you can make it as thick or as thin as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first liquid eye liners I&#x27;ve owned, and after trying several other drug store and beauty supply store brands, I&#x27;m back to get this one again.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few months, I did notice that the liquid wasn&#x27;t coming out very well right at the tip but after tilting the pen slightly so that part of the side of the felt tip was against my skin</li>
            <li>Definitely dries to a darker grey rather than a black, and then it fades even lighter quickly.</li>
            <li>My another eyeliner last long hours and still feel like a new one after 6 months</li>
            <li>I am giving this product only 3 stars because, I left the top off for about a half day, by mistake, and the eyeliner dried up.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that when I use it, I draw one streak from my inner corner of my eye to the outer corner, and this eyeliner does not make a smooth line.</li>
            <li>tried this on a few days ago for the first time.</li>
            <li>expensive but worth it ,help you stay in line and shape your eyes contour , definitely recommended this eyeliner its worth the price.</li>
            <li>it couldn&#x27;t last more than one hour, then it blurs, but It&#x27;s thin enough</li>
            <li>item arrived promptly however the ink is almost dried upon first application -</li>
            <li>which is pretty much a waste to me.</li>
            <li>For the very first time in many years, I finally found an eyeliner that goes on as thin or as thick as you like  </li>
            <li>I made sure to put the cap on tightly once I was done and then stored it how I usually do: horizontally.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and the precision-tip makes it difficult to mess up, even when moving quickly.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks use then pretty much seem dry and hard to use afterward</li>
            <li>The volume is pretty small compared to other options so if you wear eyeliner every day be prepared to replace it reasonably often.</li>
            <li>I wore this every day for months, and once I stopped wearing it daily, it did not dry up.</li>
            <li>You can easily make a thin or thicker line.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it is very easy with the semi rigid tip and the side of this pen to make a straight thin or thick line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from a hot weather area, pencil eyeliner is a mess at the end of the day, this eyeliner resisted intact!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re open to other brands, stick with Loreal&#x27;s classic liquid liner.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not cool is how much this smears and gets on the bottom of my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply due the very fine tip and thicker base.</li>
            <li>It is not exactly a long lasting liner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, also a lot less messy than gel eyeliners or the kind that come in little bottles.</li>
            <li>I have a serious case of shaky-hands, but this long pen with fine tip makes applying eyeliner easier than ever before.</li>
            <li>Finally applying eyeliner is easy and you can make the line thin for daywear and thicken it up dramatically for evening looks.</li>
            <li>The tip is thin enough that it&#x27;s easy to work with and no smudging when you go to draw the cat eye.</li>
            <li>Especially the wings, it never made drawing a thin line so easy and fixing up any mistakes to even it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am awful with regular liquid eye liner and pencils and gel don&#x27;t give the same crisp and narrow lines you need to do the flick on winged eyeliner - this is the perfect tool!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fair to rate a product badly because you don&#x27;t like how they test their products.  </li>
            <li>Nothing specifically bad or good about it.</li>

            <li> So both are good, but Stila is awesome.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance!</li>
            <li> very precise!!</li>
            <li> great eyeliner for beginners</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Great precision liner.</li>
            <li> Great for cat-eyes and winged looks.</li>
            <li> The felt tip is great-</li>
            <li> It does a GREAT job of getting in between the lashes, though.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal and Revlon have great color payoff and longevity, but both get cakey and sting.</li>
            <li> but once she got the hang of it, she looked great.  </li>
            <li> I tried this because it got great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great purchase price, and how it applys.</li>

            <li> Makes a great line and is inexpensive.  </li>

            <li> Great value for the price paid.</li>
            <li> What a happy accident, I&#x27;ve used this ever since.</li>
            <li> But it looks great if you leave it alone.</li>
            <li> Great colors, but don&#x27;t sharpen well.</li>
            <li> Must be applied twice to stay all day but otherwise great.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Great for the cat eye look.</li>
            <li> It glides on great and lasts all day.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not into liquid eyeliners but this works great and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The applicator is great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is a great price when you&#x27;re looking for drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Keep these things in mind and you&#x27;ve got yourself a quality liquid liner at a great price.</li>
            <li> Maybelline has great eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Well, I already knew this product was great because I&#x27;ve purchased it before from Walgreens or something.</li>
            <li> It works great .</li>
            <li> Still, it did a great job at creating an even line.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner looks great, thank you</li>
            <li> you can also take product from the tip onto to a eyeliner brush and get a great effect also</li>

            <li> This is really easy to apply and fix mistakes on!</li>
            <li> This is a very fine line, however, can also be layered for a thicker cat eye look.  </li>

            <li> Love how sleek this went on, and in one coat.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smoothly!</li>
            <li> the pointed tip you will make precise and near perfect lines (with practice of course).&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this type of applicator.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

            <li> I freaking LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite eyeliner pen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my make-up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly glad I found this product :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the two maybellines, I like the gel liner better.  </li>
            <li> for the gel liner if you don&#x27;t mind 15 seconds more of applying time.</li>
            <li> I would be sure to give this a 10 out of 10.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many many eye liners.  </li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already in love with it.</li>
            <li> What is awesome about it is that it&#x27;s cheaper than ones like stila and tarte, but makes the same lines.</li>
            <li> It is even better than I thought it is.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> but sometimes I want to use eyeliner to help play up my eyes even more</li>
            <li> my favorite go-to eyeliner</li>
            <li> I really love this liner.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> and i love maybelline</li>
            <li> so decided to try this and love it so much more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I always make sure to keep this in my makeup stash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> I do like this product because it&#x27;s easier than continually dipping your wand into a tube for more.  </li>
            <li> I would look for a better product.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner out there.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I guess it was to make it more heavier.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and lasts all day and night!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t crack or look lumpy like most eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> I love how this goes on and stays on.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, wish it was a waterproof formula.</li>
            <li> The actual liner pencils just hurt to put on, an irritate my eye, so these marker-like liners are awesome.</li>
            <li> She wears contacts, too, for whatever that is worth information wise.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The one I ordered from Amazon even more</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it love it</li>
            <li> I love the felt pen.</li>
            <li> This liner is PRECISE!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I can tell you for sure, 100%, that this makes me apply eyeliner like a PRO.</li>
            <li> Seems to stay on longer than most I have used.</li>
            <li> I saved the applicator and bought another favorite eyeliner and put it on the Mabelline applicator liner.</li>
            <li> I tried almost all brands of liquid eye liners to find the best, and I finally found this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product, just not the one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have been using eyeliner for many many years.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my eyes pop.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my top lids.  </li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li> but I was able to use this quite well.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> but this one has more color and is more durable against sweat and moister, without having the painstaking difficulty to remove factor that the waterproof eyeliners have.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> but overall i&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Applies nicely and accurately.</li>
            <li> Price is great compared to Stila which also works very well.  </li>
            <li> It ends up on the top of my eyelids and smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li> It will smudge nicely while it is still drying if you don&#x27;t want a really precise look</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the texture of this pen.  </li>
            <li> This product was okay, nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li> I have tried several eyeliners to get that perfect line</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I find using short strokes across my lash line works best.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the better drug store options.</li>
            <li> Your love this eyeliner too if u buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Matte for the most part.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite liquid eyeliner...</li>
            <li> Make sure you realize</li>
            <li> I like the gel better.</li>
            <li> You will get a nice and precise line with this liner.</li>
            <li> If your eyes don&#x27;t water much, this would be great for you.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Sign up for subscribe and save to get an even better price.  </li>
            <li> This is an ok eyeliner but for the price</li>
            <li> I like Stila&#x27;s better, although it is pricier...</li>
            <li> awesome eyeliner, does smear a bit onto upper eyelid though.</li>
            <li> but I have found that to be the case with most liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to be triggering my skin itching like many eye makeup items do.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Will be buying some more</li>
            <li> I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as good, but I figured it was worth a shot</li>
            <li> Well, I fell in love with this liner almost quicker than I did with the Stila one.</li>
            <li> Maybelline&#x27;s isn&#x27;t waterproof, but it still does an excellent job at staying put on my Asian eyelids.</li>
            <li> I also think the Maybelline one has more pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I’m upset that I can’t be one of the many people out there who gave it 5 stars and swear by it.</li>
            <li> So I like that I am able to get</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had better eyeliners where even if you apply some pressure the tip won&#x27;t get flattened like the Maybelline one.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and it seems okay, didn&#x27;t hear any complaining about it.</li>
            <li> My favorite choice in eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It helps that most of the liner stays on my face not wiped off on a q tip because it went everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (mostly) waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic eyeliner pen!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Sure, maybe it&#x27;s not rub-proof but what do you expect from a 7 dollar eyeliner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s liquid in a pen form.</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The color is lovely to look at.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t hold up in that area, but is excellent outside the lash line.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I was even able to do a &amp;#34;winged&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> really love this product.</li>
            <li> Favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love the product because it accents your eyes</li>
            <li> Just saying I really  do love it and will continue to wear it.  </li>
            <li> I wear mostly Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think it is better than a brush eye liner.</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> and it automatically became my favorite eyeliner</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and I can make a nice tapered line across my lid.  </li>
            <li> Package box was ok.</li>
            <li> personallt just like a pencil better</li>
            <li> I love the tip to this pen</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and will be buying a bazillion more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drug store brand marker eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li> And cheap!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth application.</li>
            <li> These are my all time favorite drugstore eyeliner and when my drugstore run out</li>
            <li> (I love this)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Though I love the pen idea</li>
            <li> Not waterproof, but that is sometimes better when you need to make corrections.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using liquid eyeliner for years and this is not even close to my favorite.</li>
            <li> most recommended:</li>
            <li> con - halfway through the day, I had liner on the top of my lids because I have oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liner.</li>
            <li> More like a stain than a liner.</li>
            <li> I always have to tap the top on my vanity to get more product out.</li>
            <li> If I dont, it smudges on to the top of my lid.</li>
            <li> Love this liner.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> eye liner is okay.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t like a pen, more like a flexible paintbrush.</li>
            <li> Gifted it to my sis</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Im in love :)</li>
            <li> This eye liner works best for the upper eye line.</li>
            <li> Precise Liquid Eyeliner!</li>
            <li> LOVE this liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> so if you like a matte finish you may want to apply an eyeshadow or another pencil on top.</li>
            <li> I started with this product, but now I use Revlon Colorstay Eyeliner (crayon eyeliner) to draw my cat eye because it lasts longer and is more resistant to smudges.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I have better ones.</li>
            <li> Everything is safe delivered..</li>
            <li> I love how it just glides on any eye makeup</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner 😍</li>
            <li> So I held the pen at the end and shook it to see if there was more mascara in the pencil...</li>
            <li> I will buy more of it for the price and the ease of application</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> so it goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find an eyeliner to replace my favorite... stilla eyeliner...</li>
            <li> I wish there were more colors, I&#x27;d buy all of them.</li>
            <li> Not the best-flowing eye pen I&#x27;ve used, but at this price I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I am many decades older &amp; she is 22, so it&#x27;s great for any age.</li>
            <li> Easy application, easy to remove if mistakes are made!</li>
            <li> However, the applicator makes it easy to create a nice fine line; just wish the makeup would not wear off.</li>
            <li> I was surprised I was able to get a perfect cat eye look without having to fix anything on the very first try.</li>
            <li> It looks great and soooo easy to apply as the tip gets really skinny.</li>
            <li> Its very precise and easy to use</li>
            <li> I have another eyeliner pen like this one which feels heavy on my eyelid and kind of causes irritation, but this one is great, lightweight with good pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Once you do that it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> but once you do, its pretty good.</li>
            <li> but the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t do as good as the first</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very precise for fine lines.</li>
            <li> I will be happy to return the defective one for a new one.</li>
            <li> The applicator is great for beginners who are new to the cat eye.</li>
            <li> I can see how it is awesome for someone with dry skin around their eyes or who uses some sort of primer or foundation</li>
            <li> I love it,, it don&#x27;t smugde, and drys very quickly</li>

            <li> I completely love it -- it&#x27;s easy to use and goes on so well.</li>
            <li> and I love how easy it is to apply.</li>

            <li> Very easy to get a clean line &amp; wing.</li>

            <li> Extremely smooth and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> The liquid is not runny at all and you will most likely get a perfect line on your first try every time :) pretty water resistant, but not water proof.</li>
            <li> It has a fine tip.  </li>
            <li> I used to use gel liner but bought this because I thought it would be an inexpensive option to get a fine point winged eye look.</li>

            <li> The tip is so fine</li>
            <li> The fine tip on the end doesn&#x27;t hold over time for the wing liner look.</li>
            <li> I use MAC&#x27;s black pod and then go over it with this to add a defined wing and perfect the look.</li>
            <li> First and second use was great!</li>
            <li> Takes more than one application for the eyes if you want a bold outline.</li>
            <li> hello fine fine the proces and buy il like a model for empled fine fine fine fine fine it likd</li>
            <li> Apparently this is very popular among her age group.  </li>

            <li> So far so good, really easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still loyal to my Stila and MAC, but I&#x27;ll definetlly be buying more of these to have spares available.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, creates a perfect wing, the color is just intense enough for me, it doesn&#x27;t smudge,</li>
            <li> This is the first eye liner I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> If they can just make the tip a little thinner, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great and it gives a fine line for extra detail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and simple to apply, and makes for very cute eyeliner looks.</li>
            <li> I did manage to master a great cat eye and my sexy little flicks have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Very dark and flawless after a night out of dancing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING - allows you to apply a perfect, thin line of eye liner.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Stila&#x27;s waterproof eyeliner, so when my wallet emptied I had to resort to a cheaper option.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li> but it is really light in color (brown) and seems to be drying out within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Took a shower and washed my face and eye area with light soap.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly</li>
            <li> The Maybelline master precise eyeliner stays on longer than my MAC one.</li>
            <li> TENDS TO RUN, BUT HAS SMOOTH APPLICATION</li>
            <li> Gives precise application.</li>
            <li> The pen liner does glide smooth and precise (like the name), will not hurt or pull your lid at all.  </li>
            <li> Like the smooth way it goes on</li>
            <li> Even it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice intense color, and application.</li>
            <li> Does not go on smoothly seems to dot along.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> My eyeliner has never looked so precise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so precise</li>
            <li> If you like precise eyeliner and &amp;#34;wing tips&amp;#34; on your eyelids (Amy Winehouse style)</li>
            <li> but it is no longer available at stores.</li>
            <li> the application is comfortable, one apply it once a day.</li>
            <li> Got this as an add on item to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have to redraw those areas and cover it up to make a smooth again.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t blob.  </li>
            <li> it has a smooth line and a felt tip</li>
            <li> so I stick with a light pencil liner.</li>
            <li> The formula flows nicely onto the felt dispenser tip but not so much that the liner gets all over.  </li>
            <li> would like to see it available in brown.</li>
            <li> I just wish the liner applied by that great tip actually stayed put.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and precise.  </li>
            <li> The lines are smooth and precise.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it smudges</li>
            <li> It also goes over the tattooed areas smoothly.</li>
            <li> Precise, yes...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s precise indeed.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really tell I have it on but makes my eyes look really nice like my eyelashes are thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s precise</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smoothly and precisely, but it smudges if your eyes run with tears or eyedrops.</li>
            <li> It smears after 4 hours or so but overall its great.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on well, smoothly and accurately.  </li>
            <li> so its makes it more worth it.</li>
            <li> and vey cheap.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is fantastic.</li>
            <li> liner is extremely precise, and I am no longer terrified to use liquid liner.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great starter liquid eyeliner, but I&#x27;ll probably try a different brand once it runs out.</li>
            <li> Smooth application.  </li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> it gives me a great starting point for my wing and I can go over it with a darker liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li> Precise line, but smudges throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to lightly push the tip on a piece of paper or something to make the liquid liner come out some, but all and all</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, over make up or on clean skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a great liquid liner especially for the price..</li>
            <li> Smooth lines.</li>
            <li> I was using regular liquid liner before this and used to have to correct my cat eye almost every time I drew it, but this draws a straight line perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> It seems to have continuous flow and makes a good clear line.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> this still isn&#x27;t as good as my old one</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The felt tip easily glides across my eyelid as I like and the formula is smooth and consistent for the most part.</li>
            <li> Better yet: I love that it&#x27;s a drug store eyeliner that WORKS and is better than any other kind of eyeliner out</li>
            <li> The line is incredibly thin, which is great unless you want a bolder look (that is, again, currently very popular).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to apply on your eye.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommended this product to any one wants a good and easy EYELINER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and looks great and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat tricky eyeliner to master, but when you achieve the right hold, it is super effective and quick.</li>
            <li> Overall, this eyeliner is a nice product that is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The color is rich and it applies really smoothly.</li>
            <li> While the eyeliner itself is fine (nothing special), the lid kept coming off while the eye liner was in my makeup bag -</li>
            <li> Still, it goes on smoothly and looks great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Good product goes on smooth and easy and last all day</li>
            <li> Drys quick and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It does tend to get gunked up when applied over eyeshadow but a quick wash easily restores it</li>
            <li> Super easy to aply, just one time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to wipe it off and inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You wont wanna go back to normal liner its great!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> but it was super easy.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the liquid comes out easily and bold.  </li>
            <li> It does go on easily, looks natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate - which is more than I can say for many liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This pen is easy to use and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and is very precise.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to liquid eye-liner and I love this product!</li>
            <li> My new favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> look good, I can easily remove a tiny portion with a damp q-tip if I made a mistake.</li>
            <li> I used the Kat Von D Tatoo Liner in Trooper for a long time but this is a wonderful drugstore alternative, and it&#x27;s definitely worth the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, it lasts long and it has a rich and nice color!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner and really recommend it!</li>
            <li> Can make the line as fine or bold as my mood takes me.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner will not fail you!&lt;br /&gt;After trying pencils and crayons and liquids for many years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup of any kind, but I needed this for a sugar skull makeup design for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner so much that I never thought of changing to another brand ever!</li>
            <li> This works really well, the felt nub at the top has clean angles which makes even winged liner really easy.</li>
            <li> But in general it is good.</li>
            <li> Strange how it stays on sometimes, but great product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> But for something that I&#x27;m thinking twice of using, this is pretty comfortable!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve found that turning this pen at an angle and lightly pressing the tip even along the top of lash line gives me a perfect thin line.</li>
            <li> pretty good, as long as you keep a steady hand lol.</li>
            <li> Still good, strong, consistent after months of frequent use (3-4 times a week, ~4 months already)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love maybelline products this eyeliner makes it very easy to apply to the eye and has a beautiful smooth finish and it came earlier than expected..</li>
            <li> It applies so super smooth and the applicator is super precise.</li>
            <li> Works well over shadows which is super important</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pen provides bold precise lines.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner after trying several brush and felt tip eyeliners and this is by far the best value.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve come across next to Milani&#x27;s infinite liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Nice fine application, easy to create different designed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner for about a week, and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance and ease of use!</li>
            <li> Great product, so dark and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply and the tip is fine that you can get it exactly where you want it to go.</li>
            <li> Also the price is very competitive with other brands and the quality is great!!</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, it&#x27;s the right color, and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I never had a good experience with the older liquid liners, but this one is like a pen so the application process is so much easier.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily in a nice fine line, and I was happy, since I&#x27;m not very great with drawing fine, straight lines.  </li>
            <li> and I was super duper excited to try  it.</li>
            <li> Love the eyeliner, like a skinny marker..easy to apply (with a steady hand!)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s super beginner friendly.</li>
            <li> Applicator tip is nice and fine so you can make a great thin &amp;#34;close to the eyelashes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it, I recommend it very highly..</li>
            <li> The tip is easy to use and you always get a clean crisp line.</li>
            <li> I always use this liner and its great as expected</li>
            <li> The formula itself I love because it is very pigmented and matte.</li>
            <li> I only use too eyeliner once in a good while and when I do this eyeliner does the trick .</li>
            <li> Finally a liquid eyeliner that has a good applicator.</li>
            <li> Longevity - Good for simple cat eye.</li>
            <li> Overall good product though.</li>
            <li> I love the Stila liner so much, but because it&#x27;s quite pricey, have been on the look out for a cheaper drugstore alternative.</li>
            <li> Also, the tube lasted me a good 5 months with daily use.  </li>
            <li> It really make them stand out more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier for precieion, it doesn&#x27;t come off on top lid when closing eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from my local target and loved it</li>
            <li> I use it mostly to fill in my bottom lash line now, as I can dot it between lashes and get very close to my lash line.</li>
            <li> and I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> My absolute favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Five years later, I decided to try the Stila Stay All Day eyeliner, and I instantly loved it for its ease in application.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, I really did.</li>
            <li> most of the eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried as liquid pen the tip dries out fairly fast.</li>
            <li> Product is long-lasting - makes it through the work day, but sometimes have to reapply in the evening if I&#x27;ve been touching my eyes too much.  </li>
            <li> It washes off fairly well without too much extra wiping.  </li>
            <li> The color goes on smooth and solid, I wear a cat eye daily and this liner is perfect!</li>
            <li> Has a nice soft, yet sturdy tip.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented love it</li>
            <li> I cannot recommended it more highly!</li>
            <li> Whats more when you got tears on it(not too much), you will become a panda.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly not bad.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself a bit of an eyeliner connoisseur and, for the price, this is not bad.  </li>
            <li> It was super cheap as an add-on item, so I&#x27;m not mad that I bought it from the mistake of thinking it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> Woks the same as one that costs 40%  more, easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner works amazing and stays on long!</li>
            <li> The Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love the color and it gives as clean a line as a steady hand will provide.</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck with liquid liners but this one is so easy and smooth to work with and lasts without need for touch ups</li>
            <li> I ordered one, but got an extra one, which is fantastic because I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and feel, It doesn&#x27;t have a dry or clumpy feeling, goes on extremely smooth and is very precise.</li>
            <li> Stays pretty much all day and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel or something oily or fade like other eyeliners I&#x27;ve used its great.</li>
            <li> Allows for sharp wings and great control.</li>
            <li> No feathering like I&#x27;ve experienced with other liquids.</li>
            <li> I wish the tip would stay pointy longer, but it has good color payoff, glides on easy, and gives sharp lines.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for anyone who has a shaky hand when doing eyeliner like me</li>
            <li> Beautiful bold line on the first try,  but be careful,  </li>
            <li> I was worried about it drying out quickly</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect cross between a liquid eyeliner and a pencil</li>
            <li> I love using this for the classic cat eye or smokey eye.</li>
            <li> You need a steady hand on this one, but I like it better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It works super well and is way easier to apply than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Kind of recommend this product only if you want sort of cheap liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> It finished really quickly, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It had a super pointy tip, and as I&#x27;m used to using a pencil eyeliner, it took a while for me to get used to the change.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to go back several times to make the lines look perfect.  </li>
            <li> Found a quick tutorial video and have been a fan since.</li>
            <li> One day of mildly laborous work (a lot of work) and this stuff was embarrassingly smudged under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it starts out bold and ample and then goes away....</li>
            <li> I love the chunky size - it makes it easier for me to hold steady.</li>
            <li> like I do with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s infallible the super slim liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and does not smudge.  </li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter and with some practice she was able to get this to work for her, although she only lines her top eyelids not the bottom along the water line.</li>
            <li> darker than expected but easy to handle and great for those cat eye make-up looks or any top eyeliner look from regular to pin-up style</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and never runs  Dark color and looks attractive</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li> I have fallen asleep after a long day and woke up to gorgeous lines.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the great reviews, but even storing upside down</li>
            <li> It is not messy and it is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li> product is great for drawing liner shapes and fine lines(when steady and careful).</li>
            <li> so I was surprised at how easily I was able to do it on the first try.</li>
            <li> New favorite eye liner</li>
            <li> My sister love the maybelline new York liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> New found favorite..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall this was a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Super pleasantly surprised by how excellent this black liquid eyeliner is.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine--it wipes off easily, but doesn&#x27;t really wear off during the day if you don&#x27;t touch it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get a straight line.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the color lasts all day, very seldom I need  retouch</li>
            <li> I thought it would be very flimsy and would not be easy to put on.</li>
            <li> And it has a very good price compared to some other high end brands</li>
            <li> It stays pretty dang well too!</li>
            <li> Also, this liner is garbage (I bought it in the past) - you&#x27;re better off with Body Shop&#x27;s liquid liner (amazing reviews &amp; cruelty free co.)</li>
            <li> Sofar its lasted months and never failed me!</li>
            <li> I swear the first time I applied it I quite suck at it!</li>
            <li> Thinking that I perhaps got a defective one, I purchased another--it was so good the first times it was worth a second try.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for first time user!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this liner, as I don&#x27;t have the steadiest hand, and this makes it so easy to line my upper lids.</li>
            <li> The felt tip makes it very easy to apply and you can customize the line (thick or super fine), and allows you to be very precise in your application.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly</li>
            <li> i love how this looks on, so easy to apply and create different looks.</li>
            <li> Good consistency, the narrow tip makes it easy for a liquid eyeliner beginner like myself</li>
            <li> Great &#x27;tight liner&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> very easy to apply and clean up later</li>
            <li> Not quite as long-lasting as some of my other liquid eyeliners, but for the price this is suitable :)</li>
            <li> This is a great eye liner for the perfect thin black line.</li>
            <li> However, I liked it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Stila definitely better than this one but more expensive</li>
            <li> This is a great little pen.</li>
            <li> This definitely takes more skill to apply than my cream pencil (so smooth and easy) and regular pencil eyeliners (don&#x27;t love).</li>
            <li> Lasts all day as is easy to control thickness - which is perfect for me because I use a very thin line for work, and a thicker line for going out in the evenings</li>
            <li> Works well, nice and dark and super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to find a cheap alternative to Stila, but this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for a few months and it still works great, and I use it almost every day.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice eyeliner, and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Works nice but wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> The color is darker than expected in a good way.</li>
            <li> I am not heavy on eyeliners and this works okay for me.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I might start using this daily, really surprised and happy.</li>
            <li> A steady hand helps but it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> As this takes away any ease it once had, it just doesn&#x27;t feel worth it to use.</li>
            <li> I was even able to wear eye makeup in a pool, and after getting splashed in the face from my kids, it was completely in tact and no run.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use it as an under-eye liner, but it doesn&#x27;t really blend well, (which is perfect for upper lid.)</li>
            <li> The price seems to fluctuate, but I always get it when I am buying $25 worth of stuff</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> It brings out added dimension to my eyes without turning me into a vampire or somebody fresh out of an Egyptian tomb.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now, I am not anywhere near sophisticated with makeup, but I can apply a cat eye with no problem.</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth that price.</li>
            <li> It makes even the clueless in makeup appear professional , i have used around 5 different brands since JAN and Maybelline by far was the best</li>
            <li> right on my first try too!</li>
            <li> I originally started buying this eyeliner several years ago at my local drug store, and seeing it available cheaper on Amazon made it all the more better.</li>
            <li> your money on this one and go with the L&#x27;Oreal Lineur Intense liquid liner instead - it still has a felt tip for easy application and dries to a crisp matte finish, without running throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Easy to smudge away any errors when applied over a primer, and lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the coverage, and the beautiful glide of the pen, however, I cant believe the whole bottle was ruined, b/c I left the top off for such a short time.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and by far my new favorite go to eyeliner &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Dark and precise, love it!</li>
            <li> Application is super easy with a nice firm brush on the end</li>
            <li> so I see the no black eyes in the morning as way better than the rub off.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as other brands, however it is useful</li>
            <li> I find the pen skips and seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes a clean line, and it does stay put -- most especially when you use an eyelid primer, which I like to follow with a bit of finishing powder on the lid.</li>
            <li> Other liners wear off and if I go out after work I need to reapply, this product looks as good as it did when I applied it.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product- goes on easy , stays all day, dries instantly, doesn&#x27;t take a super steady hand</li>
            <li> so i just use nutragena makeup wipes, and it come right of</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get the right shape.</li>
            <li> It dries right when you put it on.</li>
            <li> but... It never dries, wipe your eye and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> ; It turned out to be a right decision.</li>
            <li> However, it still may take some practice to do it right.</li>
            <li> New to liquid mascaras, and this one is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner draws a smooth, bold line that dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smear or flake and gives your eyes that WOW factor seen on runway models.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this eyeliner, I was happy with it for the first few days.</li>
            <li> Went on nice and smooth dried up quickly tho</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly if I can hold my hand steady.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and dark as a gel liner would be, and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> luckily the tip of this eyeliner is so fine that i have complete control over the level of thickness</li>
            <li> I like this liner, the way it applies, but notice that it comes off very easy on my upper lid.  </li>
            <li> I just make sure I keep the pen standing somewhere, while not in use, with the tip facing down to make sure I get plenty of liquid when I use it.</li>
            <li> Today, I was out in the rain for two hours, and it still looks exactly like how it was when I first applied it seven hours ago!</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth, but I feel it like the tip dries a little fast, so I have to shake it to get the liquid to the tip, which is also good when applying it, so it won&#x27;t run  or smudge all over.</li>
            <li> It dries up pretty quickly and lasts the whole day for me!</li>
            <li> I can barely see any of it on top of my eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best liquid liner in the world, I am sure, but it works just as well as other much more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> It seemed really rich and dark and glided on nicely.</li>
            <li> For one week it worked great - very fine lines and then the next week it dried up!  </li>
            <li> If you are not an eyeliner expert, it will take a very steady hand and some practice, but it CAN be done!</li>
            <li> I have not always been a fan of other eyeliners, mostly because it was so hard to apply and get a perfect line.  </li>
            <li> Creates a beautiful dark line with sharp edges, and I love the pen style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many others and not a single one beats this.</li>
            <li> It might be great if used doubled up with a standard pencil to get the look that I was going for - I&#x27;ll actually have to try that.</li>
            <li> Great even compared to the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to the more expensive stila version.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are careful applying it because it&#x27;s that precise.</li>
            <li> Typical good liquid liner.</li>
            <li> It came super fast .</li>
            <li> Then it dries out super fast.</li>
            <li> its a great liner for such low cost!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not waterproof, but on a regular day, it stays put great.</li>
            <li> it is easy to hold stays on even though I&#x27;m  a frequent eye toucher.</li>
            <li> but this stuff stays put and is a rich dark black and the tip is perfect for the cateye -- YOU will not regret buying this..</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this eyeliner so far!</li>
            <li> sorry it&#x27;s great and even seems darker when applied at first, but no competition to the Stila stick I got, love it.  </li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Eye Precise gives you the absolute easiest application ever!</li>
            <li> For dates or notching up the drama, Maybelline New York Precise is just as consistent.</li>
            <li> I had expected the top of this to be cumbersome to use, but I am pleasantly surprised by how easy the liner glides on!</li>
            <li> Super smooth and easy to make sharp well defined lines.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect for those who are not very good with eyeliner in general.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> It dries out very fast and over all</li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t wash off and that I&#x27;d look like a floral racoon for a week, but it washed off cleanly (from everywhere except the places along your eyelids that you&#x27;d normally put eyeliner).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super dark and pigmented and it glides on so easily, plus the fine tip makes cat eyes a breeze.</li>
            <li> The tip is the perfect size to make thin lines but is flexible enough to make thicker ones and it’s so easy to flick off the ends of your eye to make a cateye.</li>
            <li> The color is amiably dark, it goes on smoothly and without skipping just like the claims state, and the lines it creates are indeed very precise.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect for drawing in your winged tip shapes ,the color is rich black.it hardly ever smudges and it lasts for pretty long hours (wish it were longer though) .No</li>
            <li> Although I would prefer a little thicker tip, it was a good bargain</li>
            <li> The tip is not quite as thin as they show in the ads/commercials, but you have very good control of the application.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, smooth, and goes on dark.</li>
            <li> Really pigmented, a nice rich black.</li>
            <li> No running, no fading, crisp lines, all day wear.</li>
            <li> So far, I have problems with almost all eyeliners even if they say smudge free.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries, the liner stays put pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used eyeliner that was a pencil.</li>
            <li> Its exactly how a liner should be.</li>
            <li> There are no reasons not to have this product if you are obsessed with liquid eyeliner and the perfect cat-eye!</li>
            <li> the product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> One of my favorite low price eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I totally suggest this product because it creates of lovely finish after applying your desired eye shadow.</li>
            <li> First bought this when I lived overseas.</li>
            <li> I put it only on my top lid and it lasts all day</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself &amp; one for my former foster daughter, Breanna, &amp; we both love this product.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge after first being applied.</li>
            <li> and I smile a lot (haha).</li>
            <li> cos first.</li>
            <li> I would say this rivals with many high-end pigmented liquid liners, such as the KVD Tattoo Liner.</li>
            <li> Makes liquid eyeliner so much easier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as the description of the seller.</li>
            <li> I would buy better quality one next time...</li>
            <li> you are a first timer or a beginner, this is the liquid eyeliner for you to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:</li>
            <li> This was actually my first liquid eyeliner I had ever used</li>
            <li> However, it was overall an okay product.</li>
            <li> (if I want to bother) is not difficult.</li>
            <li> I have used potted gel liner in the past (Stila and Maybelline) and liked them for their smooth application and how they stay all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only okay...</li>
            <li> Such precise lines!</li>
            <li> after first time using it, i feel like it&#x27;s already running out of liquid in it.</li>
            <li> I can do a cat eye every day, and it doesn&#x27;t budge even when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
            <li> My first time applying liquid eyeliner is with this product, and I think I&#x27;ve converted.</li>
            <li> I first tried it when I was at a friend&#x27;s house</li>
            <li> I cut the tip a bit to access the product better and will use it most likely as a last resort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the color fades on my upper eye lid.</li>
            <li> Shipped out fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and this eyeliner is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear liquid eyeliner very often, but when I do I use this!</li>
            <li> I ordered it and have used it once on a really hot humid day, seemed to stay in place.</li>
            <li> It has a consistent flow.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner pen, but it seems to run out/dry up quickly, especially when applied over eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I apply it with ease and the color payoff is very true-meaning one application is all I need!</li>
            <li> Comes on smooth and dark, love it</li>
            <li> My first liquid liner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sucked at applying eyeliner since the first time I tried it in the 9th grade.</li>
            <li> In the same breath, you can go over a line as many times as you want with this pen</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m more than likely never going to purchase another eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to buy more later too~</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve tried numerous tricks to get more ink to come out.</li>
            <li> i love it and would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that I do NOT wear it on my lower eye; only the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would love to give this eyeliner a 5, but I have noticed it smudging and transferring after only 3-4 hours at my part time job, powder does the trick sometimes.</li>
            <li> I tried this eyeliner for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> First time trying this product</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Comes out with a bang the first 5-7 uses but then kinda lackluster after.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra $$ on a Stila eye liner, loads better.</li>
            <li> EVEN the expensive stuff doesn&#x27;t hold up against this awesome liner!</li>
            <li> I love my eyeliners but am a low maintenance girl.</li>
            <li> and i find myself reaching for this liner wayyyy more than my urban decay.</li>
            <li> but i feel like the first eye it works</li>
            <li> Had the same thing happen with many kinds of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s essentially a drug store eyeliner.</li>
            <li> As any liquid eyeliner it can get messy but the end result is always good .</li>
            <li> Good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I owned this eyeliner for two weeks and loved it when it worked, but it dried out.</li>
            <li> I considered giving this 4 stars because I kind of fail at applying liquid-type liners, but it doesn&#x27;t seem right to fault an amazing eye liner for my unpracticed hands.</li>
            <li> I wear super thick eyeliner and this stuff lasts ALL day and looks just as good as when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> but I think they dry out kind of fast.</li>
            <li> I have never liked a eye product of this type, BUT I love this!!</li>
            <li> The color was a nice, intense, solid black and it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and the color stays on for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed after the first use, but it dried out or was empty</li>
            <li> It applies nicely, but due to my eyelid shape, it transfers my eye shadow over this immediately and it turns gray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other liquid eye liner and never found one i liked, until this one.</li>
            <li> Great product, it last long time and the color is very black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is rich and the brush is soft.</li>
            <li> Try rimmel scandleyes liner or if you want to spend more try Urban Decay glide on liners they work better and stay long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super black and really easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is great for someone who finds it hard to wear eyeliner or too much make-up like me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably still use this if I wanted something very temporary and easy to remove, but for the most part it&#x27;s just a waste and ends up making me look like a panda.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re no expert in makeup like I am, it will take a few tries to master the perfect size line you want.</li>
            <li> 10 years late I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Loved it SOO much more than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It has the best, thin tip that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> love this product; really goes on well and last all day.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, not straight line.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s beautiful and the sharp tip really allows for beginners to better shape their eyeliner, it&#x27;s not easy to make mistakes with this one!</li>
            <li> much.&lt;br /&gt;i am a free lance artist and i use this on my prom clients, they love how black it is!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, I very much appreciate it&#x27;s staying powder, and the waterproof aspect of it is very convenient.</li>
            <li> (so many others are black for the first 5ish uses and then quickly start fading/thinning out after that.</li>
            <li> Worked great, getting harder to use after a few months, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> This one has such a precise tip that it does stay right there at the lash line.</li>
            <li> Bought after seeing a positive review on YouTube.</li>
            <li> The application is smooth and easy but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s easy to use, lasts practically all day, as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes, &amp; it easily washes off with a little water.</li>
            <li> The color is dark, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> Stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> She has since pretty much given up eye make up.</li>
            <li> Runs out if you use daily but other than that it is great</li>
            <li> The black is bold, and the application is super smooth.</li>
            <li> I was very intimidated when I first pulled off the cap.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try after my long time favorite was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I usually like waterproof products, i bought this one because of the good reviews and because i thought it was waterproof...</li>
            <li> Nice dark color-</li>
            <li> this is very easy to use and very precise, its so black and last all day i really like this product</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy applicator, nice dark black line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it because I can never keep my hand steady enough to draw my liner before, I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I cant say anything bad about this product, very easy to use and of great quality.</li>
            <li> Love it, last long and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Shooters turn out equal and beautiful with little effort</li>
            <li> Tip is bigger than some more high end brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of high and low-end eyeliners, and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Dark black,easy to apply,smudge-proof,,wears on long:)Would strongly recommend it to anyone who likes using black eyeliners and wants it to look perfect and last!</li>
            <li> The very tip is to light which makes it hard to to fine clean lines.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love the Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner in Black and in Brown.</li>
            <li> I am not super amazing at applying liner to the lid but this makes it a bit easier.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner....seemed to dry out faster than the shore bought ones.</li>
            <li> I do like the intensity of the color, it is a nice black matte</li>
            <li> But overall, extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but so easy to apply I have only done it once.  </li>
            <li> Rubs really really really easily,  I put it on, and not even an hour later it is smudged all over my eye</li>
            <li> Nice slight line.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it is so easy to apply that reapplication</li>
            <li> Got it the next day with Amazon Prime and it is so easy to use</li>
            <li> I have only purchased this once, but will again as soon as I run out, because it is so easy to use and lasts.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would dry out like most eyeliners do when not kept correctly, but it hasn&#x27;t been showing signs of drying out any time soon.</li>
            <li> This liner is really easy to use, especially for a beginner when liquid eyeliners can be daunting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t run or fade throughout the day but does come off fairly easy with facial soap.</li>
            <li> On the lower eye line I feel like I have to pull on my eye and press for the black ink to show nicely.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product recently because I found that the color is darker and the felt tip does not ware out as easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but transfers to my upper lid.</li>
            <li> does the job, stays on fairly well and last a long time in terms of duration of use.&lt;br /&gt;i have had it for a couple months now</li>
            <li> Easy to be precise with a little practice.</li>
            <li> I read a large number of reviews stating that this Maybelline liner was it</li>
            <li> I used this liner to fill in large circles that covered up all the around my eyes, and hid my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply and does not cause any irritations like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Makes cat eyes super easy and wears extremely well.</li>
            <li> That being said the eyeliner is very precise and thin lines will get absorbed into the fine creases of my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the other comments at first, but this truly stays on even the most oily lids.</li>
            <li> Fine enough to enhance my mole.</li>
            <li> Extra fine tip.</li>
            <li> Gives you a pretty decent lined look.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner lasts the whole day and is good for thinly lining my eyes and/or drawing bold cat eye.  </li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> The color is pigmented and dark and applies onto your eyelids very easily.</li>
            <li> However, the color is super dark and glides easily.</li>
            <li> Probably because my city is extremely hot and I often stay outdoor with high heat.</li>
            <li> Love how it&#x27;s got a felt tip for application- easy to make thin lines right against my lash line.</li>
            <li> Sure,  it&#x27;ll flow out fine in the *middle * of the brush,  but not really at the end.</li>
            <li> Liner usually is hard for me to make look good</li>
            <li> I prefer a more natural look with my liner and was able to pull off a very thin line with this, but you can also easily created thicker or winged liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of felt tip liquid liners, I had tried similar products, but saw this one here</li>
            <li> But overall, I really like the product glides on smoothly for a winged tip eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping I found a product that worked well with my watery eye problem.  </li>
            <li> I purchased eye shadow primer (NYX)  to use under this eyeliner because I really like the application.  </li>
            <li> It remained smudge free for a couple of hours but by the time I checked it again later in the day, Panda Eyes!  </li>
            <li> so eyeliners don&#x27;t work very well on me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to someone else who is finding a liquid liner!</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> I know the real struggles of trying to make both eyes match.</li>
            <li> The liquid is very watery.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but</li>
            <li> I do like the liner except it really feels like it wears out fast so that I do not like.</li>
            <li> it stays on very well the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Got here fast</li>
            <li> much cheaper and easier for applying.</li>
            <li> I just received my package and opened it up to find the Loreal Lineur Intense brush tip liquid eyeliner instead of the Maybelline one I had ordered.</li>
            <li> the price means I can practice as much as I want without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I really like the price.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Lynne</li>
            <li> Also very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> (really depends on skin oil and how your eye fold is) but</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like t his product.</li>
            <li> However, I prefer this formula over Stila because I think you can layer on the color much easier.  </li>
            <li> I really like this pen</li>
            <li> I dries fast and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> , I have all sorts of allergies and sensitivities to chemicals, but this didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> Drys out fast, smudges.</li>
            <li> It is much easier</li>
            <li> The eyeliner does not smudge and lasts me the whole day without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> Also, if you make a mistake and try to remove it with a wet qtip it will smear and you wont be able to get the smear off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you know of a better wet liner LET ME KNOW.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it for my whole eye, just the flick</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is worth it already for me, because I don&#x27;t smell like I painted household cleansers on my sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li> I then switched to retractable pencil eyeliner and found that it smudged way too much on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like done too much</li>
            <li> Any mess-ups could be wiped away with a make-up wipe without much effort.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve mastered it, you can do anything really</li>
            <li> I have spent more on the Clinique brand</li>
            <li> Really like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> The felt tip is &amp;#34;longer&amp;#34; and product is on the whole length of the tip so that you can rest the edge of the tip against your lid to get a smoother looking line.  </li>
            <li> Also, the very tip of the liner does not hold makeup.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> I really like this liquid eye liner-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very convenient for when I&#x27;m in a hurry for work, which is like always.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much it smudged and ran until my husband called me &amp;#34;Mommy Dearest.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Stays put the whole day.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Fiancé says it is much easier to apply than others she has tried.</li>
            <li> really get close to my lashes with the pointy design of the pen.</li>
            <li> &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even smudge much at all without primer) and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner isn&#x27;t very smudge-proof either.</li>
            <li> such a precise line.</li>
            <li> You have to shake it a bit between applications, but it goes on smoothly, and for me, it stays on throughout the day without smearing to the upper lid.</li>
            <li> REALLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> The packaging is practical and convenient because you dont have to worry about spilling any of it and its really lightweight.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner, and its very convenient to use</li>
            <li> the color isn&#x27;t too intense either.</li>
            <li> tip makes precise lines (may depends on the users)&lt;br /&gt;- Possible to control the intensive like painting with ink and brush on paper</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.</li>
            <li> its so much easier and lasts for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like waterproof liners anyways</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> Also it dries fast</li>
            <li> In fact, the applicator is the same as my favorite liquid eyeliner made by Stila (which is more expensive, but has a much better, waterproof formula.</li>
            <li> was upset because i really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner and the precision you can get with it.</li>
            <li> It pays not to look like you&#x27;re ready for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I just use pencils but those smudge too much and end up on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and even and will last all day and night.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I do get a tiny big of fall out if it&#x27;s warm out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different liquid liners in the &amp;#60;$10 varieties, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Wish this, I can get right to the root for a close line, and I can easily create a sharp wing.</li>
            <li> so I searched high and low for an easy to apply liquid eyeliner that stays put.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very accurate unlike other liquid eyeliners that have the brush separate from the liquid, I like that it&#x27;s all in one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most certainly not water proof</li>
            <li> Instead of the beautiful solid black line of yesterday, I got a water-down, diluted, nearly clear line.</li>
            <li> If it stays dry you&#x27;re good all day long.</li>
            <li> I was able to line my eyes so easily i almost can&#x27;t believe it haha also its a nice black thin line and not too shiny.</li>
            <li> the application is phenomenal and precise if you like sharp cat eye liner then definitely get this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the same eyeliner method for the past 15 years, so my hands are pretty steady but this would be a great liner for beginners.</li>
            <li> It resembles a felt tip pen, nice and stiff.</li>
            <li> If you ever like doing cat eyes or just a thin simple top layer of eye liner, Try This!!!</li>
            <li> i apply liner daily and it does have a good sharp pointer .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try an eyeliner that didn&#x27;t require a brush I had to clean off after but this simply do NOT hold up compared to my gel eye liner from MAC.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and dark!</li>
            <li> Smears and falls off after a few hours but is very easy to apply and create a straight line.</li>
            <li> The tip can be used to make a very fine line on your eyelids or turned slightly on</li>
            <li> Overall, definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Other than that i love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything - Stila&#x27;s, Kat Von D&#x27;s brand, and many other liquid, pencil and marker liners.</li>
            <li> Love the brand and the sharp lines.  </li>
            <li> I will probably order again, since the color was dark like I love, and had that wet look, like I love.</li>
            <li> However, this may be due in part to my own failings, but I feel the black color doesn&#x27;t come on as strong as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> The color is very dark and is very easy yo apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for getting that dramatic wingtip that is all over</li>
            <li> I never have to touch up my eyeliner and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily after it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> The only small downside is that because it&#x27;s super precise, the tip bends easily.</li>
            <li> This pen has a much nicer soft, straight, felt tip!</li>
            <li> It will give you the same, clean look every time.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and crisp and stays on as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply, but it also flakes off leaving chunks of eyeliner missing.</li>
            <li> but great for thin or thick precise lines!!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very much a dupe for MAC&#x27;s Penultimate liner) and it works great with a continuous stream of product, the liner product itself is VERY poorly made.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and a nice dark black.</li>
            <li> like my conventional liquid one better</li>
            <li> The tip doesn&#x27;t dry up fast like others and it goes on incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> So I need something that is easy to apply with my clumsy hands and sometime that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a cheap clown.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s extremely easy to apply a thin line</li>
            <li> just really wish that this eyeliner were waterproof since my eyes seem to have an uncanny knack for getting wet easily.</li>
            <li> This Maybelline eyeliner is very precise and black.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is very easy to use, and it is a dark black which I needed!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner by FAR&lt;br /&gt;you can easily make a very thin, fine line that is barely visible but adds just a bit of depth to your lashes</li>
            <li> lasts a long time and smooth application</li>
            <li> I love how dark the colour is.</li>
            <li> It going on well and leaves a nice small line</li>
            <li> Now I just need to get better with applying this eyeliner, but it shows up dark, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to apply with NO mess and it last ALL day.</li>
            <li> and I have to wait for more to make it&#x27;s way down.</li>
            <li> I wear on my top eyelid and after washing my face, some transferred down to my lower lid and ended up having raccoon eyes...</li>
            <li> While this eyeliner really applies well and removes easily, it was not a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li> My new eyeliner of choice!  </li>
            <li> Good eyeliner for a decent price my only problem is sometimes it faded a little bit</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was great but the second time I used it, it was as if it was empty and just a little would come out at a time where the first time it was like a paint brush.</li>
            <li> The liner part was very tall, but I love the color it comes out with, very dark.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out this as much as I like their gel eyeliner, this is also a must.</li>
            <li> Made cute doll eye look with a slight flare at the end.</li>
            <li> My previous purchase of this product was 10x better...</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of liquid eyeliners, but they do not go on smooth and will dry out at the tips.  </li>
            <li> Rest elbow on a table for a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I use several different brands of cosmetics, but Maybelline&#x27;s eye liners are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I do not consider my lids to be particularly oily, so that is not the problem.</li>
            <li> it is sooooo good~&lt;br /&gt;i can hardly find an eyeliner which i can apply smoothly on my eyelids, but this is an exception!!</li>
            <li> but if I take it slow it turns out great and last all day!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the last one I received appears to be counterfeit as the formulation and tip are completely different.</li>
            <li> I still goof sometimes because my hands just aren&#x27;t that steady</li>
            <li> It has decent staying power.</li>
            <li> Needed a more sturdy applicator tip, rather than the narrow brush type that is too flexible and doesn&#x27;t allow for as much control.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those with a steady hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it for quick eye makeup but not for big parties and wedding parties or so.</li>
            <li> DECENT.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is worthy of the same ranks in my book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been frightened of liquid liner because my hand is not all that steady.</li>
            <li> I prime my eyes with eye shadow primer and a bit of powder, but that&#x27;s only because my lids get super oily.</li>
            <li> I was even getting ready with one of my friends who uses mostly high end makeup brands and loaned it to her because she was getting annoyed with her liquid eyeliner and even she LOVED it.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have a very steady hand when it comes to applying eyeliner, but this one is easy to control and only requires one swipe across the eyelid for a solid line.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little darker, but other than that, its a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a quick cheap fix in between the eyeliner brands I usually wear.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Even when using a high end primer it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay put.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on here I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of high end make up</li>
            <li> (I was in high humidity at the time as well).&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth and makes a lovely line that can be smudged slightly when still wet to help you make smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> But I find the formula a bit sheer, I would have to go over it a few time before it&#x27;s the perfect black.</li>
            <li> The site would not let me return or exchange it though due to it being a &#x27;hazardous material&#x27; even though I didn&#x27;t even open it yet.</li>
            <li> This product is far better than any other eye liners I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is really something that all women must have, easy to use, last longer and the quality OMG amazing,&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely keep buying when I&#x27;m run out of it!</li>
            <li> Plus, the tip isn&#x27;t as fine as the Stila one, so it&#x27;s harder to make cat eyes.</li>
            <li> The felt tip gives you good control over where the juicy black stuff goes, but the fun only lasts for so long.</li>
            <li> I just prefer something a little more stable.</li>
            <li> but I apply eyeshadow over it to help it set a little better.</li>
            <li> dried out super quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take it off when still wet!</li>
            <li> The brush is stiff and very precise, as advertised.</li>
            <li> While this looked great and stayed in place all day, I again had a hard time applying it because the bush was so long and flimsy.</li>
            <li> You only have to wait a few seconds for it to dry, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s good for making sharp thin lines but it smears REALLY easily and does&#x27;t stay put, even with a eyelid primer.</li>
            <li> My old ones kept smearing so much and by the end of the day its gone.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to apply than a pencil, and looks really professional.  </li>
            <li> I picked this eyeliner up one day at Walmart not expecting a great product, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t drag or pull at the skin and applies as smoothly as a gel liner.</li>
            <li> it goes over old eyeliner very well.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope I got a dried up one by mistake,</li>
            <li> The felt tips on this eyeliner and Stila are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try using it normally once, but it was bascially out of ink and wouldn&#x27;t go on</li>
            <li> Okay, but not a smooth apply.</li>
            <li> It gets a nice dark line above my lashes and does not budge until I need to remove makeup and wash my face.</li>
            <li> My liner will last the whole day, even in hot TX weather.</li>
            <li> love it it dosnt smuge and last a long time on also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several so far, especially some of the top sellers/</li>
            <li> With the exception of Eyeko (which I also love), this eyeliner was the only one that has stayed on without smudging for as long as it did on my oily lids.</li>
            <li> It looks ok, but just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly or last as long as Kat Von D&#x27;s Tattoo liner.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wait more then a few seconds before opening my eye.</li>
            <li> This is nice - not too thick or too think.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the cap is on tight however because I feel it may dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have sufficient money to buy 50-bucks worth sets, I highly recommend this eye-liner not only because of its cheap price, but also because of its organic components which prevents allergic reactions and other skin-related ailments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does start to smudge and not look as sharp at the end of the day, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> I find the formula doesn&#x27;t spider into all the fine lines in the surface of the skin like some other products.  </li>
            <li> It also was not hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.the point makes applying it easy and this very pigmented and long lasting..</li>
            <li> This liner is really easy to use, and you can actually use it several ways.  </li>
            <li> Easy peasy to go back over your initial line.</li>
            <li> Easy to add a wing effect because the liner is so thin and precise.</li>
            <li> Now if only I could find the right lipstick...</li>
            <li> This is the only one that gets everything right.</li>
            <li> I had to rub some mascara off right next to the end of the line on my outer eye</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is much easier to put on than the kind with a wand, at least for me!</li>
            <li> Easy to draw on and goes on dark.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long and if I wear it to sleep and need a quick touch up</li>
            <li> They are sending me a new order of the Maybelline one, I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it&#x27;s going to be the right one this time.. not a totally different brand of liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth, this is my second one first one lasted me almost two months until I noticed it was starting to dry out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to draw such a thin line direcy above my lash line.</li>
            <li> I am really new at this too</li>
            <li> Doubted this product could possibly live up to my Stila-high standards.</li>
            <li> I have been using maybelline lash stiletto liquid eyeliner for awhile, but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> So I searched for a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new one after I ran out</li>
            <li> I found it in Maybelline New York Eye Studio</li>
            <li> I wore it on New Years Eve</li>
            <li> Easy to use black liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li> Has a very bold, black color.</li>
            <li> Hope it doesn&#x27;t dry up too quickly</li>
            <li> I was careful at work to avoid touching my eyes, and I was only there for about six hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and great for making thin or thick eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It is precise, draws a narrow line very well.</li>
            <li> It seemed to dry quickly and look flaky before it started to peel off.</li>
            <li> The tip isn&#x27;t as narrow as Stila&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s still just as easy to create a classic winged look.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t dislike this Precise Liquid Eyeliner enough to rate it lower than 3 stars, I have a feeling that you can find a longer lasting product.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft, but substantial bendable tip, with plenty of &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; to do whatever you want on your eyes.</li>
            <li> However, because the tip is flexible its very hard to do the winged eyeliner that&#x27;s currently so popular with this particular eye liner.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time through all weather, only comes off when you want it off but easy removal.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner stays on well and is easy to use, but it did not last long.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t stay on well for long and easily rubs off.</li>
            <li> easy to use, last long.</li>
            <li> the pen seem to dry up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> the tip also makes for a very sharp line, making it effortless to build it out into a fine cat eye.</li>
            <li> n gives such a pretty look.</li>
            <li> I never had an eyeliner as fine and black as this.</li>
            <li> My eyelids get pretty oily so this eyeliner did need to be reapplied occasionally.</li>
            <li> first off it runs all day and somehow gets on upper eyelids.</li>
            <li> sorry..do not waste your money..!</li>
            <li> I usually use Stila&#x27;s eye liner pen, which, works admittedly better and longer, but for the price this works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something exactly like this and FINALLY found it.  </li>
            <li> It’s not worth it to me because you don’t get a precise line.</li>
            <li> Dark, precise lines.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and dark.</li>
            <li> If it can stay on my oily lids, I&#x27;m sure it can last on other skin types as well.</li>
            <li> When you apply the second coat, you need to wait until the first coat dries otherwise</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply but it will smear a little by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> SUPER BLACK very liquidy</li>
            <li> It says the color is black but shows up more like a grey and the applicator brush is very EHH.</li>
            <li> It not only makes applying liner to my eyes pretty easy, I also used it to do a Day of the Dead face paint for Halloween</li>
            <li> It allows for much greater precision than other brushes due to the long, tapered end, and draws smooth lines.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s high rating and review, I took a chance to get this one to try, with NYX mechanical pencil and Maybelline lasting drama gel liner.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how long this will last before it dries out, lets hope it lasts awhile, even if not, its a good price and so much cheaper than MAC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, very dark.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, Ive bought a few of these now</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and stayed on all day, however, it dried up after just a couple applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at putting on eyeliner, but I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Precise but dries out, I also didn&#x27;t care too much for the texture, very messy when trying to fix mistakes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any issues with it as of yet The color black is the Blackest of black which i lOve and glides right on without any eye irritation.</li>
            <li> You do need to apply more than one layer, however, in order to get a solid black color.</li>
            <li> Love it definitely will buy it again goes on black</li>
            <li> However, this is the sharpest tip and draws a super precise, thin line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to create a winged eyeliner shape with this, however it&#x27;s not a nice, clean black line because it smears and it isn&#x27;t really a traditional liquid liner</li>
            <li> very black, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Thin, precise, very black (just how I like it), lasting, easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Supper easy to apply, very black, and stays put.</li>
            <li> the only downside is that it tends to smear more than I expected, but I live in humid Florida, so I probably just need to get a waterproof liner next time.</li>
            <li> I also put a large shape on the end of my nose, and intricate flower designs on different parts of my face.</li>
            <li> The felt tip sometimes is bothersome to use over eyeshadow, especially if you have layered colour to build a certain look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little light</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the fuss is about, this other eyeliner I bought from the pharmacy for $2 was actually easier to apply and it stayed for a long time without smudging, and it wasn&#x27;t even a popular brand.</li>
            <li> The brush gets dry easily but it lasts a decently long time so that seems fair.&lt;br /&gt;Storing</li>
            <li> Even after leaving it closed for weeks, I would come back to it and it would still work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I personally think that&#x27;s a little ridiculous, but its a small price to pay for the best cheap liquid eyeliner on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition to that neat little trick, the eyeliner also manages to smear everywhere, magically transferring itself from your upper eyelid to accentuate the bags under your lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I have my eyeliner tattooed on, but occasionally I want a little more for evening.  </li>
            <li> For the price, its hard to find a much better liner.</li>
            <li> It actually looks decent!  </li>
            <li> I am terrible at applying liquid eyeliner but love the look; this is the easiest application I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> But it starts fade away later and mass up your whole eye make-up after 5-8 hours.</li>
            <li> No luck so far.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again based only on the fact that it transfers too much.</li>
            <li> I ignored it, fixed my eyes, and went to work.</li>
            <li> but I am going back to Stila as it really lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this product created no irritation what so ever.</li>
            <li> Maybe old</li>
            <li> The tip allows for thicker or thinner lines depending on your preference and so far has not caused me any irritation (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner since I was 14 years old,</li>
            <li> no..sadly that one didnt last much longer</li>
            <li> I perly can draw a complete line.</li>
            <li> I like to wear it defined or smudged by a lighter soft color.</li>
            <li> I keep them around just in case, but I&#x27;ll only attempt to use them if I have absolutely nothing else.</li>
            <li> My only issue is it sometimes tugs at my eyelid as it goes on causing a bumpy line rather than a straight one..</li>
            <li> Throwing out my old ones.</li>
            <li> I also find the felt tip soft then others.  </li>
            <li> You have to hold it horizontally and use the whole side of the pen to get it to go on properly.</li>
            <li> Everything a busy working mom needs in an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> liquid liner so far, plus</li>
            <li> I work in an office and feel that make up is a requirement for appearing professional.  </li>
            <li> It is really the only make up I wear.</li>
            <li> when my old eye liner was discontinued..the search was on.</li>
            <li> but it is a very close second.</li>
            <li> was really surprised.</li>
            <li> idk, this one might be  old or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 days,  and not only do the wings on the corners of my eyes smudge if my eyes get watery,  but the ink doesn&#x27;t flow out at the very tip,  where you need it.</li>
            <li> Info About Me: 23 yrs old, I have oily skin, including oily lids and naturally tan</li>
            <li> It must be old product, would like to return but the return product section wont let me.</li>
            <li> However, it smudges easily when it gets wet (like eyes watering when you yawn) and of the few tubes I bought, they all seemed to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this frequently from here on out.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the money that I spent on this product.&lt;br /&gt;--Prasanthi.</li>
            <li> I think this is just as good as an expensive department store brand.  </li>
            <li> Nice thin line.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner has a really nice thin tip.</li>
            <li> Nice, thin applicator.</li>
            <li> You can do a thick wing or a thin one, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> You can create thin or thick lines perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li> this product is a plus, I didnt put a 5 star rate cause even though it lasts all day, it fades a little and looks like some eye shadow made eyeliner, but my intentions on this products are pretty positive</li>
            <li> I especially didnt like much this one because when u sweat or when u put ur hand over your eyes it makes a huge black messs,,,, i would prefer it to wash away completely rather than having a big huge black spot of eyeliner.....</li>
            <li> It allows me to get right up next to the last line so it brings out my eyes without looking like I smeared a line of color across my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so black and lasts for long, even away better than Mac&#x27;s liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I mean its ok .</li>
            <li> There are many other eye liners in this form from different brands that do not have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more to stash in my purse and various other places for emergencies.</li>
            <li> At first I was frightened it would dry out</li>
            <li> After turning 40, I realized it was getting harder to evenly apply liquid liner close to my top lashes (due to softening of eyelid).</li>
            <li> Long lasting and is still a vibrant black, even after being placed on top of eye shadow.</li>
            <li> BUT, I find that not enough of the liner ink comes through the applicator so while you get a fine line, you don&#x27;t get a dark line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Very easy to control the brush on this without the liquidy mess you get with some other liquid liners.</li>
            <li> So far the first time I used it it came out very liquidy, however it did try after a few minutes in front of the fan.</li>
            <li> I think I typically can get 2-3 months out of this applying it every single day (sometimes more than once).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for someone who is inexperienced with liquid liner as it can be applied in a thin or thick line and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper, completely black and matte, and works a hundred times better!</li>
            <li> Does not skip and looks fresh as well as long lasting results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really black in my eye</li>
            <li> It is SUPER black.  </li>
            <li> The eyeliner has a nice dark black color that barely fades throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much unusable after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The color is super black.  </li>
            <li> It will fade color slightly with extreme humidity and mositure but adding a little powder with it helps with this to a great degree.</li>
            <li> I used a very similar, but highly priced brand name product belonging to my mother.</li>
            <li> Used it and loved instantly how smooth and thin to thick</li>
            <li> I choose this over high end liquid liners regularly.</li>
            <li> It is so thin I am able to do a nice wing especially coming from a beginner that sucks at doing wings</li>
            <li> Should have expected that, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lighter black.  </li>
            <li> I use this one to outline the cat-eye that I go back and color in with a darker but less precise liner.</li>
            <li> It has good stain power (very black) and has a small tip</li>
            <li> Not a good feel, so I tried to press it on top of my hand to get it to flow..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not good at applying eyeliner. :-)</li>
            <li> I usually use it lightly.</li>
            <li> I akways buy this same brand found it here cheaper than where i normally buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with these types of eyeliners because normally the tip would be too big</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It still works but it is not dark.</li>
            <li> I love how dark it is, and it&#x27;s thicker than other eye liners I&#x27;ve used, too.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so nice to be able to get this only since we live in a very small town which makes it frustrating when you run out and can&#x27;t find anyone locally who carries it.</li>
            <li> I must have got a dry one because it&#x27;s NOTHING like the commercials (dark, easy to apply)</li>
            <li> Smooth eyeliner,but a little deep color .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought plenty of other eyeliners but due to my oily lids, they smudge super fast.</li>
            <li> The products runs really easy and the felt tip is really hard.</li>
            <li> I had previously been solely a eyeliner pencil user, but wanted to give liquid a try for more sharp wings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this eye liner over the hard pencil liners that never sharpen properly.</li>
            <li> This is my new eyeliner regular.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any smudging; but it should be noted that I do have somewhat of a dry skin.</li>
            <li> because it seems to dry out a bit fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out fast, and I can apply this with precision.</li>
            <li> Like everything about it but doesn&#x27;t dry up as fast as I would like</li>
            <li> I recently bought a cheap brand from Silvercell and it didn&#x27;t smear at all, but it cracks and disappears after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re not able to use the tip for anything pretty much.</li>
            <li> For less than $5 it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not black, barely shows on the eyelids.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have sometimes is that the very tip will sometimes run out once I get to the second eye</li>
            <li> have also tried the NYX curve ergonomic type liner and it was no superior to just the nice long handle</li>
            <li> It dried out really quick and the too got bent.</li>
            <li> It dried up relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> The tip gets a little dry when drawing the line, but super dark and precise.</li>
            <li> nothing major.  </li>
            <li> There’s really no other way to use this eyeliner without the tip soaking up product/drying out.</li>
            <li> Very solid fine lines gives my eyes a little touch of perfection!</li>
            <li> It is easy to wear, but a little dry.</li>
            <li> What really works well about this item is the precision it offers due to the shape and construct of the tip..  </li>
            <li> Make fine or thick lines.</li>
            <li> albeit infrequently)&lt;br /&gt;- not as quick dry as expected</li>
            <li> it smudges easily and it becomes very messy!</li>
            <li> i like the shape of the brush, but with my old liquid i could just wipe it and it come right off, but if you mess up with this and wipe it off, it will leave a large smear down oyur face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for the quality and the price is better than any expensive brand.</li>
            <li> , I really love this product, saw on commercial and could not find in any local drug store or Walmart and its really hard for me to find stuff anyway, I have to use a magnifying glass</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with creating a wing on my outer eyelid and this does the job amazingly.</li>
            <li> Generally cheaper in the stores,</li>
            <li> If you put too much moisturizer on, it will bleed some, so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> Does not drag skin.</li>
            <li> I have hooded (barely visible) eyelids</li>
            <li> The tip of it barely works at all</li>
            <li> Apparently they don&#x27;t make it in brown....</li>
            <li> My loreal and maybelline stiletto barely smudge when water comes into play.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t wash away completely with just facial cleanser and water.  </li>
            <li> Three hours later, I went into the bathroom at my man&#x27;s house to find that it was completely smudged</li>
            <li> This is the BEST LIQUID EYELINER EVER ,it goes on smooth, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t crackle after a few hours of having it on , I&#x27;m the worst on putting on eyeliner</li>
            <li> I love this ultra thin felt tip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had success drawing a line that extended beyond my eye lid without it looking messy.</li>
            <li> and I can actually apply it, I had quit wearing eyeliner because I could not see good enough to put it on, I know its not perfect sometimes</li>
            <li> I am able to create thin or think lines with this liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Other times, I get that strong, opaque black</li>
            <li> only complaint about this product is that it runs out VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Unlike my other experiences with felt liners where it gets worse after more uses, I found that the product went on much smoother after awhile.</li>
            <li> I wear it all day long, and it won&#x27;t smudge, even though wear I live</li>
            <li> Very dark, intense and bold black.</li>
            <li> It has to be replied a few times throughout the day and you can&#x27;t rub your eyes - it will come right off.</li>
            <li> If it is a hot humid day it may still leave a slight racoon eye.  </li>
            <li> so I usually set it with black shadow pretty quickly to prevent it from being all over my face.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Urban Decay pencil eyeliners, and haven&#x27;t used waterproof in awhile, but I think this stuff looks just as good (if not better) than some of my Urban Decay liners.</li>
            <li> Without that tip staying wet and putting out product, the only part of the felt brush that works is the middle; which is great if you want a thick line or don’t mind using half the brush.</li>
            <li> The color is very black, more intensely black than the Stilla eyeliner, but this one is not water proof at all...</li>
            <li> The tip of the liner is a little pointier than I prefer making it harder to be precise</li>
            <li> I normally have multiple different tubes from different companies at a time.</li>
            <li> It was more on the matte side but still dark enough to show up without any streaks or missing spots of product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday (only a medium line on my top lid) and I usually have to get a new after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it is solid black unlike some other pens with very light coverage, showing up grey.</li>
            <li> Creating a dramatic cat eye hasn&#x27;t been easier :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s side to create a thicker more dramatic line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside is that it can be easily overdone with the flick of your wrist (seriously)</li>
            <li> My Kat Von D tattoo liner ran out and ive been too busy to get another one, and i actually have this and the urban decay liquid liner at home</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter really liked this its comparable to expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Love the dark color, however, I&#x27;m not sure I will ever get the hang of liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Great staying power, you can make it as thick or as thin as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first liquid eye liners I&#x27;ve owned, and after trying several other drug store and beauty supply store brands, I&#x27;m back to get this one again.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months, I did notice that the liquid wasn&#x27;t coming out very well right at the tip but after tilting the pen slightly so that part of the side of the felt tip was against my skin</li>
            <li> Definitely dries to a darker grey rather than a black, and then it fades even lighter quickly.</li>
            <li> My another eyeliner last long hours and still feel like a new one after 6 months</li>
            <li> I am giving this product only 3 stars because, I left the top off for about a half day, by mistake, and the eyeliner dried up.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I use it, I draw one streak from my inner corner of my eye to the outer corner, and this eyeliner does not make a smooth line.</li>
            <li> tried this on a few days ago for the first time.</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it ,help you stay in line and shape your eyes contour , definitely recommended this eyeliner its worth the price.</li>
            <li> it couldn&#x27;t last more than one hour, then it blurs, but It&#x27;s thin enough</li>
            <li> item arrived promptly however the ink is almost dried upon first application -</li>
            <li> which is pretty much a waste to me.</li>
            <li> For the very first time in many years, I finally found an eyeliner that goes on as thin or as thick as you like  </li>
            <li> I made sure to put the cap on tightly once I was done and then stored it how I usually do: horizontally.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply and the precision-tip makes it difficult to mess up, even when moving quickly.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks use then pretty much seem dry and hard to use afterward</li>
            <li> The volume is pretty small compared to other options so if you wear eyeliner every day be prepared to replace it reasonably often.</li>
            <li> I wore this every day for months, and once I stopped wearing it daily, it did not dry up.</li>
            <li> You can easily make a thin or thicker line.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it is very easy with the semi rigid tip and the side of this pen to make a straight thin or thick line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from a hot weather area, pencil eyeliner is a mess at the end of the day, this eyeliner resisted intact!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re open to other brands, stick with Loreal&#x27;s classic liquid liner.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not cool is how much this smears and gets on the bottom of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply due the very fine tip and thicker base.</li>
            <li> It is not exactly a long lasting liner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, also a lot less messy than gel eyeliners or the kind that come in little bottles.</li>
            <li> I have a serious case of shaky-hands, but this long pen with fine tip makes applying eyeliner easier than ever before.</li>
            <li> Finally applying eyeliner is easy and you can make the line thin for daywear and thicken it up dramatically for evening looks.</li>
            <li> The tip is thin enough that it&#x27;s easy to work with and no smudging when you go to draw the cat eye.</li>
            <li> Especially the wings, it never made drawing a thin line so easy and fixing up any mistakes to even it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am awful with regular liquid eye liner and pencils and gel don&#x27;t give the same crisp and narrow lines you need to do the flick on winged eyeliner - this is the perfect tool!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t fair to rate a product badly because you don&#x27;t like how they test their products.  </li>
            <li> Nothing specifically bad or good about it.</li>
            <li> It applied easily, but irritated my eyes pretty badly.</li>
            <li> You have to go over the line a few times to make the liner full on opaque black.</li>
            <li> It goes on SUPER black and it won&#x27;t wipe itself away as you&#x27;re applying it like Kat Von D&#x27;s or Stila&#x27;s (think dry erase marker, when when you go over to catch a missed spot it rubs the other stuff away)</li>
            <li> With Stila, if you try to draw on top of of your previous line to make it thicker or whatever, I almost feel like the previous color peels off as my felt tip glides over it, like pulling off dried paint.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented and very black with just one swipe</li>
            <li> The other liquid eyeliners that I have tried do not flow as smoothly and the liner brush is too thick.</li>
            <li> or so I find a new smudge of black under my eyes and sometimes even back onto my temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Decent little eyeliner pen</li>
            <li> I have experimented in the past with both pencil and powder black eyeliners, but this has been the only one that allows me to get a really clean look.  </li>
            <li> The only ones that work so far is the waterproof liquid eyeliner made by MAC (they stop carrying the dark brown) and the waterproof eyeliner (felt tip) from Stila -</li>
            <li> I like to do a small cateye on a daily basis and this liner makes my whole routine flow faster.</li>
            <li> The only con would be its durability and long lasting wear (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li> Works well for the first few tries and</li>
            <li> You need a steady hand to make s narrow line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok because I usually draw my lines medium to thick.</li>
            <li> If the ink gets on the eyelashes, when you blink, they will print down on the skin under your eyes &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; I blink several times to check, if it happens, I simply clear it with a Q-tip and makeup removal.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Jordana brand of these from Walgreens for $2, but those smell like heavy chemicals, and don&#x27;t keep fine lines for long after purchase.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to build up the pigmentation to get a true black.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that it smudges when it gets hot.</li>
            <li> From the expensive &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brands, to the basic sharpened pencil, but for a precise, defined line, this can&#x27;t be beat, and so I always come back.</li>
            <li> Long lasting!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review if it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Once applied, it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Although this product isn&#x27;t waterproof it will last all day as long as you aren&#x27;t too teary and you don&#x27;t smudge it.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star because it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as Stila but for the price, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner isn&#x27;t all that long lasting</li>
            <li> I like how long it lasts ... seems to last for days.</li>
            <li> Its not bad and its not great either.</li>
            <li> Line is a little thin but better than a blob.</li>
            <li> Brush was hard initially but applies really well.</li>
            <li> then it is very strange because it doesnt have any liquid in it to last .</li>
            <li> It did not last very long on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I only had to wait a couple of seconds for it to dry.</li>
            <li> It is super thin</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to use unless you&#x27;re a body builder and are insanely strong..</li>
            <li> but with this, you get a super thin line or thicker</li>
            <li> You can go super thin with this pen.</li>
            <li> It actually scared me a bit, such a big box that was clearly empty, wondered if it was some kind of sick joke until I saw Amazon and relaxed a</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does usually take going over twice to get a super black line, and I have to sit with my eyes closed while it dries if I do a thicker line on my upper lid.</li>
            <li> Thin lines are really light, and to get the dark black color, you have to press down on the tip, which makes the line much thicker than I want, so it&#x27;s definitely not something I can use day-to-day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone loves this product so much, I have bought it twice and each time it seems so dry.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this eyeliner four instead of five stars is because the very tip of the pen isn&#x27;t as sensitive as it used to be, and it has become a little more difficult for me to draw thin lines as I now have to tilt the pen in order for the liquid to come out.</li>
            <li> This is very easy for me to tight line my upper lid since I have small eyes and a thick line is not really for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the rating on this eyeliner is so high.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply to make either thin or thick lines.</li>
            <li> Very easy to draw any type of thin or thick line.</li>
            <li> Not dark black.</li>
            <li> I am not a girly girl and had a hard time with liquid eyeliner- couldn&#x27;t get it to go on straight.  </li>
            <li> I have tried liquid eyeliner in the past with little success, so I was a bit nervous to try this.</li>
            <li> I have curly lashes that make it difficult to apply liner precisely, but this helps me line my lids perfectly/</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago because I was in desperate need of some more liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smear and holds all day long.</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline for a long time and plan to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> and it stays that way all day long.</li>
            <li> so the process takes a bit long.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how long you wear makeup per day, it may need a reapplication</li>
            <li> But will see how long it lasts me and will update.</li>
            <li> was dried out and didnt have any liner in it its old expired makeup</li>
            <li> For the price though, a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> It seemed old and dried up.  </li>
            <li> this is one of those products that once you have it, you wonder how you survived without it for so long.</li>
            <li> I spent the day outside in 80 degree weather helping my boyfriend change my car oil</li>
            <li> I started noticing that by lunch everyday it was smudging and making it look like a 5 year old put it on.</li>
            <li> Some of the more expensive brands are a waste of extra cash.</li>
            <li> was worried they it would look grey</li>
            <li> And stays on almost all night as long as you don&#x27;t smudge it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump up when wearing for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> This stuff stayed put all day long.  </li>
            <li> You can draw out your liner without leaving those strange trace marks or gaps from lower quality liners.</li>
            <li> ; It has a long pen tip</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t rub it, it&#x27;ll stay put.</li>
            <li> long lasting&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts long on the eyes</li>
            <li> It looks like a long tapered felt pen.  </li>
            <li> run as long as you keep the liner in a cup tip up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it from a long time.</li>
            <li> Might want to use an eyeliner gel to keep it in place if you plan on using all day long</li>
            <li> The formula is long wearing, doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge.</li>
            <li> Flows well, doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This will be my liner as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> No eye irritation and a very user-friendly applicator that keeps you from applying too thick of a line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black and long lasting but last only a month (I mean, dries up so fast..)</li>
            <li> Liquid Liner in Black religiously for several years and wanted to find a cheaper alternative since those are about $21.00-$22.00 each and the expense was racking up.  </li>
            <li> and it doesnt dry out and doesnt smudge and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought it would last a long time like what the other people said but after maybe 2-3 weeks it started to fade.</li>
            <li> and it takes too long to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will end up lasting me, but I will definitely be replacing it with the same liner after it runs out.</li>
            <li> Very thin and precise.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately, you have to spend a little more to get that.</li>
            <li> The gel liner, on the other hand, shall last forever ane ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh....and it lasts a really long time before drying out!  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this eyeliner as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> I would get this again, but I would be open to trying other products as well.</li>
            <li> This product gives some irritation but it is only due to leaving it over night, sometimes I don&#x27;t bother to wash my face or the eye makeup area.</li>
            <li> The only other eyeliner I can think of</li>
            <li> I have a very long and varied history with eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time for liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The intensity of blackness fades after the ink starts to dry out from the pen.  </li>
            <li> takes awhile to dry</li>
            <li> It WILL dry out if you leave the cap off.  </li>
            <li> So I let it dry and put some shadow over</li>
            <li> 2 Stars because it wasn&#x27;t dry and didn&#x27;t ooze out either.</li>
            <li> The tip is dry</li>
            <li> I will warn that it takes a bit to dry</li>
            <li> I just wish the tip didn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too runny or too dry.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts, so on occasion I add tears to my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> The tip can get dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Tip hasn&#x27;t gone dry, I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks now.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry, smudges before it does.</li>
            <li> I used another liner before that seemed like the felt tip would get dry as I was trying to apply it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> I think it runs into my eye before it gets a chance to dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was worth trying for 6 bucks, but unfortunately, didn&#x27;t work for me personally.</li>
            <li> The super thin application tip makes apply a thick or thin line extremely easy.</li>
            <li> I also like how you can make the line very thin; it just takes a little more time.</li>
            <li> The black is dark and opaque, it wears all day even on my oily eyelids, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is long lasting and a dense black, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The tip is a bit long, making it a little more difficult that some other applicators.</li>
            <li> ;. Might be bad quotes, but this is soso accurate, thin and precise just like it promised.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last with daily use.</li>
            <li> It also sortof melts around my eye, creating a dark color around them that settles in my creases (which need wiping away regularly).</li>
            <li> and I need to go over my line over and over again to get it dark enough.</li>
            <li> and it usually comes off completely.</li>
            <li> Also the tip is quite long and it makes it a bit harder to make a line and fill it in.</li>
            <li> I normally wear thick winged eyeliner and this product does not hold up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Definitely would suggest this over any of the other &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; brands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to my other eyeliner again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not high on makeup maintenence</li>
            <li> 3: Allow to dry before blinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila!</li>
            <li> Its dry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so dry, does not apply as described!</li>
            <li> It takes a while for it to dry and if you blink, you will look like a racoon!</li>
            <li> I am a total fan of The felt tip eyeliners when it comes to the cat eyes, less so with lining the eyelid itself.</li>
            <li> I had some Mabelline Eye Liner similar to this previously, but I ordered the &amp;#34;Precision&amp;#34; Eye Liner this time around not realizing there was a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never wear makeup on a regular basis (and you wouldn&#x27;t, either, if you looked up all the awful chemicals in 99% of makeup! :P )</li>
            <li> so the black looks like I&#x27;m trying to fool people that I&#x27;m younger, which doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so tiny that I worry about it running out; but I do have a bottle of black liquid liner on hand, and when this runs out, I will still use this point with the liquid liner that I have.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how everyone has such luck with it lasting all day...!</li>
            <li> It only lasted me less then a  month.</li>
            <li> But actually the black liquid did come out.</li>
            <li> They seemed to last about a month with 5-7x/week use before they would start drying out, making the liner not as black and skip while applying.</li>
            <li> The downside for me is that I find it extremely difficult to apply at times because if not held downwards it dries out quickly...</li>
            <li> It puts down solid color with every stroke - no skipping or thinning - and doesn&#x27;t dry out from one eye to the other.</li>
            <li> but since i have hooded eyes this eyeliner smudges everywhere and creates a big mess.</li>
            <li> Easiest eyeliner to apply, finally can do it without mess.</li>
            <li> When I come home after work, my eyeliner hasn&#x27;t moved a single bit!</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting the tip off at an angle, then using the tip of the angle for fine lines.</li>
            <li> I used to use another major brand eyeliner and decided to try this one on a whim when my usual was out of stock.</li>
            <li> So it shake it a little the second time.</li>
            <li> I let it dry about 5 minutes before applying other eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> also the felt tip is harder than expected, so it&#x27;s a little difficult to draw a smooth line where the skin is looser.</li>
            <li> now lets see how long it lasts!!!</li>
            <li> Great product - horrible experience.</li>
            <li> It smeared in just a few hours and left me with racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Mechanical pencil is for lash line fill threfore not really</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried a few times and finally had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> When the pen&#x27;s ink starts to wear out, you can wet the felt tip a bit, and the pen will start working again.  </li>
            <li> , I guess I didn&#x27;t read carefully....</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have a rough time learning how to apply this, because i heard liquid eyeliner is unforgiving.</li>
            <li> Not very smudgy either.</li>
            <li> Not really what i expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any luck with liquid, and seeing as how I am not very coordinated, I stuck to gel and an angled brush.</li>
            <li> Well I finally go to use the eyeliner and it is dried out.</li>
            <li> I have had the same pen for a bit over six months, and it still hasn&#x27;t dried out.  </li>
            <li> Once this one is empty, I won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> (I have to keep my eyes closed for anywhere from 15-30 seconds after applying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush pen-like felt tip makes it super easy to apply, fill in spaces and to create anything from subtle and thin to dramatic and thick looks, especially wings.</li>
            <li> I do feel like after a few hours, it might would smudge on the bottom, because I am constantly trying to get my contacts to stop moving around in my eyeballs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t budge even though I had only put it on a few minutes before.</li>
            <li> Have to go over the same line a few times.</li>
            <li> I have left it upside down after reading other reviews!</li>
            <li> Love myself a MAC eyeliner but was getting sick of carrying a pot and brush all the time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay dark very long.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It also has very little lasting power.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it ran out quick.</li>
            <li> And it stays moist, unlike other applicators.</li>
            <li> Never done liquid eyeliner before and this made it way easier than I expected!</li>
            <li> I would recommend other users to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely pigmented/dark.</li>
            <li> but I bought this due to the other reviews seen.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in brown- or any other color.</li>
            <li> At times I like to try other cheaper products on the market to help save a buck or two</li>
            <li> that any other type of eyeliner, whether it be pencil or gel.  </li>
            <li> I like the applicator, but the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t stay on like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I found it harder to apply!</li>
            <li> try other eyeliner......</li>
            <li> With other it was, you get what you get.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> None of the other felt tip liners I&#x27;ve used have ever done that.</li>
            <li> The pencil has to sharp of a line, I prefer a softer look.</li>
            <li> I use this every day now, I don&#x27;t even bother with other liners anymore.</li>
            <li> Its just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> after using the stilleto, switching to this makes me wanna quit the other one forever.</li>
            <li> other drugstore brand compares.</li>
            <li> Not exactly where I wanted the eyeliner to end up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeliner due to the feedback it had</li>
            <li> I have Never used a pen liquid liner before or any other for that matter.</li>
            <li> Plus other liquid liners ALWAYS smudged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and small eyelids.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected!</li>
            <li> A little dry.  </li>
            <li> tip is firm enough that you have control, very dark, and dries matte</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t smudge too badly by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> and I have to constantly wet it just to get the black liner to apply.</li>
            <li> only thing to keep in mind is it bleeds EVERYWHERE if it gets the least bit wet.</li>
            <li> It also started to dry out after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve found out to smear with relative ease if you get wet or a little sweaty</li>
            <li> However, it was difficult to get any out of the very tip, which made making fine lines with it impossible.  </li>
            <li> It also makes a really dark line and is easier for me to use than some other liquid liners.</li>
            <li> However, the cap was loose and it dried up in one day.</li>
            <li> But they are not smooth at all and the tips is always very dry.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this one is, it&#x27;s so hard to apply with the tip.</li>
            <li> Also, the pen tends to fray, and little strings have to be cut off every few days to keep it from making extra messy lines when applying.</li>
            <li> They use cheap felt for the tip, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dark and creamy as othets.</li>
            <li> , I find that this gave me dark smudgy under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in dark brown...and wider widths.</li>
            <li> and it is dark.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as dark as I would like</li>
            <li> Goes on dark, doesn&#x27;t bleed, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This creates a dark line, does not move or smudge, and can be applied in varying thicknesses.</li>
            <li> By hour 5, the edges are smudged and not as dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really dark.</li>
            <li> The color is ULTRA DARK.</li>
            <li> compares to the stila felt eye pencil in wear and dark color.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in dark brown too.</li>
            <li> This is not as dark as I&#x27;d like and tends to disappear over time.  </li>
            <li> you could do a thick, 60s style line with the same product!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> it tip down helps.</li>
            <li> so everything smudges down even tho its waterproof..</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it uncapped, store it upside down, &amp; shake before using.</li>
            <li> is you press down some.</li>
            <li> Liquid liner to me comes down to a matter of tip preference, felt tip, brush,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried storing it upside down.</li>
            <li> I always stored the tubes tip down</li>
            <li> I have done pencils, brushes, and other eyeliners-and this one tops them all!</li>
            <li> The price was a little steep too compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> I like to go over it with black or dark eye shadow to set</li>
            <li> I can do a thin line, or a more thick dramatic &amp;#34;cat-eye&amp;#34; with ease.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed , it was light and it would easily smear of within an hour it had almost completely faded away :(</li>
            <li> it was flaking off after a few hours and other areas faded away to gray.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week and a half before it dried up due to the lid not staying on -</li>
            <li> Came out and still had the black smudge look under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Color Payoff - Opaque Black, but shinier than I prefer.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t jet black, but that&#x27;s probably because I was expecting the color you get our of liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention this is less than 1/2 the price for 2x the product.</li>
            <li> There was a slight smudge on the corner</li>
            <li> Being 50 plus, my eyelids have thinner, slightly wrinkly skin.  </li>
            <li> Way easier than typical brushes.</li>
            <li> They quit carrying it where im from which is typical everything they sell out of</li>
            <li> But it also doesn&#x27;t look like I have a black eye in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use it to outline and fill in the details with the gel liner from maybelline (blackest black)</li>
            <li> It tends to run within a half hour of me putting it on and does not stop throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This thing is black</li>
            <li> Immediately after opening, my hands were stained with the black inky liquid that would NOT come off until I washed my hands.</li>
            <li> I almost use it every day that I need to reorder every month and half.</li>
            <li> My cheeks were black after sweating.</li>
            <li> Previous ones I have tried seem to pick up eyeshadow then stop working.  </li>
            <li> Mine is like faded and isn&#x27;t as black.</li>
            <li> I use this for thin lines and thick, the thin tip makes it easy to do the curve at the end of your eyelids.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the price a little</li>
            <li> Mine was almost dry and was not easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Not true black.</li>
            <li> I love doing a very thin winged-out eyeliner close to my lash line for my &amp;#34;wear-to-work&amp;#34; look and this delivers WITHOUT FAIL.</li>
            <li> Not a good look, especially at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> understand that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so your experience may be different from mine, but I hated this liner so much</li>
            <li> Takes a few passes to get it really dark if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li> ink doesn&#x27;t look as dark as it was in the beginning after using a few times.</li>
            <li> if you mess</li>
            <li> By the end of the day my eyes are a mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this marker-type liner for travel and on days that I just don&#x27;t have time to mess with cleaning the eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> But, when I start to tear a bit from yawning, its a smudging mess.</li>
            <li> Not cool maybelline, not cool.  </li>
            <li> That means little drying time and less risk for smudges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of liner before so it was a little awkward at first.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting wear, jet black, can never go wrong when drawing lines.</li>
            <li> The tip that is so small, does not give out any color what-so-ever, only the thicker area when pressed really hard.</li>
            <li> it works a little.</li>
            <li> It is a little lighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too watery, if it could be a tad thicker in formula</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34; in the sense that on my eyelid the eyeliner will draw little bumpy areas when the eyelid moves with the tip.</li>
            <li> and I looked like I had dark circles below my eyes and had worn the eyeliner all day!</li>
            <li> I will say it&#x27;s a little tricky to get a skinny line from this liner, so if that&#x27;s your thing</li>
            <li> It smudges a little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to remove and I would recommend an eye make up remover</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of smudge.</li>
            <li> but product is a little watery and smudges throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Smudges a little but stays on (almost too well)....</li>
            <li> Even with cap left on this item gets very hard to use.</li>
            <li> everyday makeup routine is very minimal - usually it&#x27;s just moisturizer, primer, lip balm, and this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little uneven.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t let me down yet!</li>
            <li> I like that the pigment is VERY dark.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very dark through.</li>
            <li> It comes out a very dark color.</li>
            <li> This helped a little, but I found I could only use it occasionally and could only apply using the base of the applicator.</li>
            <li> The only instances where I saw the eyeliner smudging or transferring were if my eyes were getting wet (and when I once put the eyeliner on my waterline just to see what would happen- unfortunately that didn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> then its gonna be completely dried out..</li>
            <li> It is not splotchy at all and doesn&#x27;t smudge unless you start crying.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t dried up yet.</li>
            <li> She had to practice with it a few times</li>
            <li> However, it is thin enough where you can give yourself the size you&#x27;re looking for without having to remove the excess with a swab.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of applying to my lid it is transferring up into my crease.</li>
            <li> When the liner is dried, there is a bit of a sheen and tackiness.</li>
            <li> I have had this liner for a few months now and it still does the job just as well as if I&#x27;d just got it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for a month or so everyday &amp; not even close to running out.  </li>
            <li> It looks a lot bolder if you go over your line a few times.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t dried out</li>
            <li> so I have not had trouble with that.</li>
            <li> Arrived dried out, no product to even use</li>
            <li> Dried out .quickly</li>
            <li> After a few hours you end up with panda eyes.</li>
            <li> But the cap is finniky on mine and it dried out a bit.</li>
            <li> I use everyday now.</li>
            <li> Mine dried out in like two months.</li>
            <li> It has completely dried to death in 2 weeks and return is not provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I adjusted after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I was so sad when the Target near my house ran out</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some practice to make a thin line that shows up well.</li>
            <li> It smears within just a few minutes of putting it on for me.</li>
            <li> I use this on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge after it has dried.  </li>
            <li> With lots of use, one pen lasted me a few months.</li>
            <li> Just practice with short thin strokes to build up your line.</li>
            <li> I onlt used the product a few times and it feel like it&#x27;s already running out of liquid in it.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth application.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I got the hang of this liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I like to wear eyeliner everyday</li>
            <li> even after a few months use with this it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to reapply a few times a day even using a primer.</li>
            <li> It dried up after about a month.</li>
            <li> or if you plan on crying.</li>
            <li> So if you like the thick, wet, liquid eyeliner look, this is the one for you</li>
            <li> Eyeliner dried out within 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday for school.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper than the Stila one.  </li>
            <li> it CAN&#x27;T be dried up yet!&amp;#34; a lot.</li>
            <li> I was tired of constantly having to wipe under my eyes to rub off eyeliner as the day wore on</li>
            <li> Dried out after ~5</li>
            <li> uses, smudges all over, and after a few hours it looks like either I slept in my makeup or am auditioning for the walking dead.</li>
            <li> Not longer stay , just few hour</li>
            <li> Dried out before I finished using it.</li>
            <li> Like it, used it for a few days before my Stila came in...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge make up wearer</li>
            <li> For me, it transfers to the top of my eyelid, which is annoying to say the least.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the formula.</li>
            <li> Can make very thin, thick, winged, straight, anything you want.</li>
            <li> End is not as flexible as my previous product!</li>
            <li> This smudged off within an hour, and I had black lines under my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I usually use Stila&#x27;s eyeliner pens, or MAC boot black liquid eyeliner...</li>
            <li> The tip is not fine and bends.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff.</li>
            <li> I think I like the stiff end rather than the flex.</li>
            <li> not easy for me to draw the line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color came out very black which was a plus for this.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use..</li>
            <li> Very black and glides on</li>
            <li> Smudges and fades easily, not water resistant</li>
            <li> The color is very black and opaque and a must have for those who like felt tip eyeliners.</li>
            <li> and I generally purchase the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because liquid eyeliner tends to be too dark and thick.</li>
            <li> I hardly have any mess ups or fixes.  </li>
            <li> I am a novice to liquid and it is a bit hard not to mess up</li>
            <li> I could never do winged eyeliner, and I previously used the NYC eyeliner pen-thing and it was too thick</li>
            <li> and I mean the blackest black.</li>
            <li> and my left eye is slit due to wind and cold air.</li>
            <li> as someone with hooded eyes, there is very little eyelid space for me to work with.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF HARD EARN MONEY</li>
            <li> - I thought it would be too hard to use or too messy.  </li>
            <li> Usually set it with MAC&#x27;s Carbon and 266 brush.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE.</li>
            <li> The tip is quite a bit skinnier than past products I had used.</li>
            <li> Use liner to make small dots along the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Connect the dots.</li>
            <li> The color applies evenly and it doesn&#x27;t smudge horrendously as others have for me in the past.</li>
            <li> the usual of Maybelline.</li>
            <li> but I get lazy sometimes and like to buy it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> the tip is so small you can make any design, don&#x27;t know how I lived my life without it.</li>
            <li> Without this product, I would not be able to wear liquid eyeliner because I&#x27;m so horrible at applying it.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and I am not sure about its durability.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I can now do wings in just a few seconds!</li>
            <li> When I use this, I usually wind up with a lot of smearing and traveling into my crease.</li>
            <li> however, I&#x27;m not sure I will ever get the hang of liquid eyeliner -</li>
            <li> I usually use Revlon&#x27;s ColorStay Liquid Liner (http://smile.amazon.com/Revlon-ColorStay-Liquid-Liner-Blackest/dp/B000H3I2N2) but thought I&#x27;d try this one to save money, but it doesn&#x27;t stay all day, it seems to bleed into the crease of my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I usually use a different liner when I want a very thin line&lt;</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really do a very thin wing at all without going back and fixing things with a moist cotton swab.</li>
            <li> Last week I bought my 5th one from Amazon, and they sent me a really weird one, the tip was so hard it hurts when applying to my eyes.</li>
            <li> The product dried in 2 weeks, cheap and awful.</li>
            <li> I like to wear a cat eye everyday, and I have shaky hands</li>
            <li> Rubs off a little too easily, not good for jobs/activities that require rigorous movement.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to get small lines.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s a defective one or just what I was expecting - I had to press very hard to get the ink to come out a little bit....</li>
            <li> Now I just get faint grey smudges out of it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get a thin, slightly translucent layer when I try to apply, and reapplying over</li>
            <li> I wear hard contact lenses and this eyeliner has never given me a problem with my eyes.  </li>
            <li> You have to press it kinda hard.</li>
            <li> it is meant to stay in the tube...pressing to hard on the eye lid or lower lid</li>
            <li> I also found it sort of hard to apply.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my skin tends to absorb this liquid liner the moment I supply it, so I can&#x27;t get a hard line with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a make-up user, or even that savvy with putting on eyeliner, and I was a bit worried that this would cause allergies to react, or even that I&#x27;d be hard to use -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find eye makeup that does not smudge in my eyelid crease.</li>
            <li> The tip is really thin with a thicker base which makes it easy for thin lines or even wing tips.</li>
            <li> But the point it a little to thin for me.</li>
            <li> Can do it all, thick, thin, cat eye, whatever your little hear desires.  </li>
            <li> I have watery eyes once I get outside in the cold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to buy my second one because I&#x27;m afraid of running out.</li>
            <li> It lasts the work day at least.</li>
            <li> I would say it lasts at least 8 or 9 hours.</li>
            <li> but at least it works.  </li>
            <li> the point is to thin have to run it a few times to get the look</li>
            <li> but I build it up to how thick I want it.  </li>
            <li> If you want a thick line or want to make a cat eye you have to keep adding to it to get the thickness.</li>
            <li> I kept it on the counter for a while (horizontally), and then the tip got too saturated causing me to put too thick of a layer on that ran in the heat</li>
            <li> less of course you rub your eyes real hard</li>
            <li> I like the very thin eyeliner look but this felt tip was a bit harder to maneuver for that.</li>
            <li> (by help I mean stand around and watch while I also played taylor swift on my phone to dance to).</li>
            <li> Trying to get the other liners to look normal and symmetrical can drive me INSANE and takes forever!  </li>
            <li> The brush allows you to do a thick line for evening, or one so thin it goes almost unnoticed behind your</li>
            <li> It is also jet black!!!</li>
            <li> it was wrong, I got both of the eyeliners and put them in a jar upside down.</li>
            <li> The 1 star reviews I see on here are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I got a creamy pencil liner instead of a liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Before she told me about it, she let herself get into some serious pain and now has some scars on her eye.</li>
            <li> but I do believe there should be some serious warning labels on the product.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have been a MAC girl for a long time and as we MAC girls know, our habit gets expensive!</li>
            <li> I used to buy it from Ulta or CVS, its my first time buying eyeliner from Amazon and I am really disappointed!</li>
            <li> If I only apply this over my eyeshadow it stays, but if it&#x27;s on my skin around my eyes it smudges really bad.</li>
            <li> This is not a good look for me.</li>
            <li> I tried another liquid eyeliner in brown and it was not good.</li>
            <li> It goes on thin or as thick as you want it.  </li>
            <li> so you have control to make the line either thin or thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> Stiff tip makes it difficult to get a thick line, and thin line is just too thin</li>
            <li> I might have received a bad batch because it took me a minute to get the solution thin enough to apply.</li>
            <li> It WILL transfer on to oily lids if doing a thick, dramatic line.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not easy to do a very thin line with this pen</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m really dumb when it comes to makeup application.</li>
            <li> Way too thick!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had one go bad on me and dry</li>
            <li> it smears like crazy if you mess up and smudge.</li>
            <li> But this stick lets you apply it as thin and as thick as you want!</li>
            <li> It also stays on extremely well, but isn&#x27;t impossible to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> and you can make really thin lines.</li>
            <li> I use this as a really thin liner for work.</li>
            <li> It allows you to start with a thin line and build up coverage.  </li>
            <li> tip is really really thin.</li>
            <li> You can make the lines as thin as you want with this.</li>
            <li> and she said she loves it, can be applied thinly or thicker if you prefer, and stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> ( I like thin).  </li>
            <li> Liner brush too thin for me</li>
            <li> No matter how tired I am, this always wakes up my eyes.</li>
            <li> My daughter is addicted to this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, you can choose to have a thin or thicker line.</li>
            <li> It does not make my eye lashes thin out either.</li>
            <li> I like how thin this liner tip is.  </li>
            <li> I use it to put a thin line under my lower eyelashes to define but not overpower my eyes.  </li>
            <li> So winged eyeliner or a thin line is out of the picture.</li>
            <li> and I was so annoyed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this.</li>
            <li> The tip is ultra thin.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on thinly.</li>
            <li> You can make a very thin line or a thick line on your lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eye liner pro and have tried a variety of drug store and high end eye liners and this product is awful.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, but it is absolutely awful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if you were using a pen: no more dripping or lumpy awkward brushes that end up everywhere</li>
            <li> Looks horrible with a completely matte eye look, then shiny liner.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> its like a really thin tip Sharpie- also like a Sharpie, its difficult to remove</li>
            <li> I am horrible at the &amp;#34;winged&amp;#34; eyeliner look, this made it look professional.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I didn&#x27;t believe that the tip would be as thin as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just received an old one, but this stuff is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> My husband saw me after wearing it for a few hours and asked in horror if I was sick, what was wrong with me.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I just wasted my money. :(</li>
            <li> so I was really disappointed that it was all over the place about an hour later :(.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the quality of this liner.</li>
            <li> But twice as expensive as in stores.</li>
            <li> however, the lasting power is awful.</li>
            <li> I have oily lids and a weird crease though and that causes it to smudge.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> but after a while it smudges unfortunately...</li>
            <li> I found this to be difficult to apply and it never looked the way I wanted.</li>
            <li> Sadly I will be purchasing it again, however I would recommend that you try for the price.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I throw them out at 3-4 months (nervous about germs)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the tip of the eyeliner dries out – like within 2 days.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find the waterproof in this liner.</li>
            <li> I read some comment about how difficult to use it, which made me nervous for a while.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was a bit of expensive since I have to reapply it during the course of a 8 hour day.</li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> SO SAD,</li>
            <li> False advertisement!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried other products like this and hated them.  </li>
            <li> It applies very thin</li>
            <li> I like a very thin line and with the precision of the tip on this one</li>
            <li> but I wear it very thin</li>
            <li> I am absolutely terrible at applying liquid eyeliner, but this one makes it easier than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have always wanted to start doing cat eyes, and I am terrible at using any form of black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The precision of the application is crazy.</li>
            <li> Smudges and smear like crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Smudges like crazy though</li>
            <li> Then when I went to take it off, it stuck, even with cold cream, which lifts off my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> the design is flawed.!</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!  </li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Needless to say YES,the eyeliner smeared and smudged off!</li>
            <li> So sad to say that I was a bit disappointed  :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bad with eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It does seem to smudge a bit throughout the day, but it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> grrrr.....</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I had been using gel for a while, but was sick of it.</li>
            <li> So bummed :-(   </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just not for me, but kinda disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m rather disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never buy cosmetics on Amazon now :( ...</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I hate liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> I apply eye shadow base and this stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any base on my eyelids and this still stays in place and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> so you will need to put on sufficient amount of eye shadow and base to prevent that.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting product.</li>
            <li> I have fallen asleep with it on (bad I know!)</li>
            <li> Once I used it I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this eyeliner</li>
            <li> If you do, take makeup remover on Q-tip, or lotion, anything else will leave horrible smudge marks.</li>
            <li> This is worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly terrible with gel liners and painting things on.  </li>
            <li> Somehow she got some of the eye liner in her eye and ended up with a terrible infection.</li>
            <li> Worst eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product!  </li>
            <li> My worst purchase ever in terms of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Product is awful.</li>
            <li> and I really hate that I did!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing. It&#x27;s kind of like a marker for your eyes. It&#x27;s so easy to make the lines where you want them to be (:</li>
            <li> Smooth eyeliner,but a little deep color .</li>
            <li> so fine and smooth! Drys quick and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bold line on the first try,  but be careful,  it smears like crazy if you mess up and smudge. If you do, take makeup remover on Q-tip, or lotion, anything else will leave horrible smudge marks.</li>
            <li> Amazing it makes amazing lines!</li>
            <li> Love this product. No running, no fading, crisp lines, all day wear.</li>
            <li> Love this liner. I used to use the gel liner that you would apply with an angled brush, I liked the gel liner but once I tried this liquid liner I fell in love. I never had a good experience with the older liquid liners, but this one is like a pen so the application process is so much easier. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> For an easy cat eye liner this is the best. It&#x27;s easy to glide on and won&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST LIQUID EYELINER EVER ,it goes on smooth, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t crackle after a few hours of having it on , I&#x27;m the worst on putting on eyeliner but this makes it all the more easier</li>
            <li> I never had any luck with liquid eye liner, but this product is VERY easy to use and looks great!!! Glides on effortlessly and does not smear.</li>
            <li> Best eye liner out there. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I loved how this went on and how great it looked when I first put it on.  I was really hoping I found a product that worked well with my watery eye problem.  I have watery eyes once I get outside in the cold.  This was not waterproof as advertised so I was really disappointed that it was all over the place about an hour later :(.  I would however recommend it if you don&#x27;t have my type of eye condition.</li>
            <li> Works well for the first few tries and then its gonna be completely dried out..</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner ☺and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> great eyeliner for beginners</li>
            <li> Good. It makes applying easy, so if you&#x27;re just learning how to do winged eyeliner or the likes, it&#x27;s good for that. Smudges easily though.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner goes on smooth and stays on. it does smug or crack. makes it easy to put on. I really love this</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews.  I just purchased it and received mine a couple of days ago.  This eyeliner applies very nicely and the color is great!  But after I came home from a date with my husband, I looked in the mirror and was dismayed.  I had panda eyes!  It smudged and was all over under my eyes.  I can see how it is awesome for someone with dry skin around their eyes or who uses some sort of primer or foundation (I don&#x27;t).  While this eyeliner really applies well and removes easily, it was not a good fit for me.  I guess I must have oily eyelids. So far, I have problems with almost all eyeliners even if they say smudge free.  The only ones that work so far is the waterproof liquid eyeliner made by MAC (they stop carrying the dark brown) and the waterproof eyeliner (felt tip) from Stila - but it is really light in color (brown) and seems to be drying out within 2 weeks.  I recently bought a cheap brand from Silvercell and it didn&#x27;t smear at all, but it cracks and disappears after a few hours.  Still, I prefer that over panda eyes.  Update: I purchased eye shadow primer (NYX)  to use under this eyeliner because I really like the application.  It remained smudge free for a couple of hours but by the time I checked it again later in the day, Panda Eyes!  So bummed :-(   Took a shower and washed my face and eye area with light soap.  Came out and still had the black smudge look under my eyes.  Had to use make up remover to take it off.</li>
            <li> The very tip is to light which makes it hard to to fine clean lines. I wished it fluid like a brush pen.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the quality of this liner. I was blown away!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great! I had been using eye pencils as well as creme eyeliner but this works much better at giving a clean line. I was worried about it drying out quickly but I&#x27;ve had it over a month and its still going strong. It does tend to get gunked up when applied over eyeshadow but a quick wash easily restores it</li>
            <li> Favorite eye liner ever!!! But twice as expensive as in stores.</li>
            <li> This rubs off like nothing, one touch and it is gone, does not last at all.</li>
            <li> Great precision liner. Great for cat-eyes and winged looks.</li>
            <li> Excellent eyeliner. Very precise for fine lines. I&#x27;ve stored mine vertically, and every use is flawless. I plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> I just got it ! I mean its ok . it works perfectly. but the thing is that it eiritates my eye lids when I put it on . its okay and I kinda like it . I reccemend it for u or a friend . but remember it only eiritates me . everyone is different . go ahead and try it out .</li>
            <li> easy to put on&lt;br /&gt;nice for beginners&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t smear</li>
            <li> Awesome eyeliner, I loved it... And it has a very good price compared to some other high end brands, this is amazing! you have to buy it, perfect cat eye</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope I got a dried up one by mistake, cuz if there&#x27;s all there is to it, then I don&#x27;t get the raving reviews. I can barely see any of it on top of my eye shadow.I have to go back and forth 10 times on the eyelid to make the line pop out some.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth trying for 6 bucks, but unfortunately, didn&#x27;t work for me personally.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> Very nice! I love this eyeliner and really recommend it!</li>
            <li> good quality, but the point is to thin have to run it a few times to get the look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black and long lasting but last only a month (I mean, dries up so fast..)</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth and makes a lovely line that can be smudged slightly when still wet to help you make smokey eyes. Once it dries, the liner stays put pretty well. If you put too much moisturizer on, it will bleed some, so be careful with that. I&#x27;m so pleased with this eye liner over the hard pencil liners that never sharpen properly.</li>
            <li> Really good liquid eyeliner, but I&#x27;m asian and my eyelid is quite different so eyeliners don&#x27;t work very well on me. I highly recommend it to someone else who is finding a liquid liner!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Easy to use. Long lasting!</li>
            <li> No good.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to draw.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used eyeliner that was a pencil. I bought this to paint my face for my Roaring 20&#x27;s Halloween costume. I was impressed with how easy it was to use. Unfortunately, I left it at my daughter&#x27;s house which means I&#x27;ll probably never see it again. I may have to buy another tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very black, and easy to apply. Worked very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using liquid eye liner for years. I know the real struggles of trying to make both eyes match. This eye liner took the struggle away! No extra bottle to juggle. I love this eye liner works amazing and stays on long!</li>
            <li> I do like the brush on this liner. You can make a very thin line or a thick line on your lids. It doesn&#x27;t smear and holds all day long.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found so far. It is very easy to get the cat eye look without messing up 90 times and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Just like Stila but way cheaper!</li>
            <li> Gives you a pretty decent lined look. I guess it helps when you have instructions from Youtube to guide you. Not a big makeup wearer but I have used this and liked it since purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product but the tip sometimes stops working and the eyeliner won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Amazing intense color and precision of the brush!  The felt tip is great- I don&#x27;t have the steadiest of hand when applying eyeliner, but have never had an issue with this one! Can make the line as fine or bold as my mood takes me. Stays on all day, but still easy to take off at night.</li>
            <li> The liquid is very watery. It&#x27;s not as dark and creamy as othets. But it&#x27;s very fine and works great for fine lines.</li>
            <li> Went on nice and smooth dried up quickly tho</li>
            <li> Even tho I did not buy this eyeliner from amazon it is the best hands down incredible precision  . if your new to liquid eyeliner it will take some practice to perfect the mater of eyeliner</li>
            <li> I love this baby! Its very easy to apply and has good pigmentation. I&#x27;m really impressed with this. Its exactly how a liner should be.</li>
            <li> There are no reasons not to have this product if you are obsessed with liquid eyeliner and the perfect cat-eye! I have purchased this several times and each time it is a pleasure. It does not run out too quickly, the fine felt tip allows the perfect precision, and it is very easy to use. The formula itself I love because it is very pigmented and matte. It is not splotchy at all and doesn&#x27;t smudge unless you start crying. Plus, it&#x27;s very affordable. Definitely the best drugstore liquid eyeliner pen I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> This is up there with the $25 &#x27;name-brand&#x27; stuff I was using from Sephora. I will re reordering!</li>
            <li> I love this product best eye liner by far</li>
            <li> Thank you.  My niece loved the item.</li>
            <li> It runs out during application and I have to wait a couple of minutes to retry</li>
            <li> Love this. So easy to achieve a great line. Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and I&#x27;m able to apply with precision. My only choice for liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I use liquid eyeliner to fill in my top lashes and I love it. It&#x27;s very pigmented and easy to use. This is my third tube.</li>
            <li> Perfect! So easy to apply to my top lid!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but the product was exactly as described but I didn&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> Talk about precision! . . As any liquid eyeliner it can get messy but the end result is always good . I only use too eyeliner once in a good while and when I do this eyeliner does the trick . Although I would prefer a little thicker tip, it was a good bargain</li>
            <li> I love it it works perfectly. It sweats off easy tho.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner lasts allday its very good</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the color and long-lasting effect of the product. However, because the tip is flexible its very hard to do the winged eyeliner that&#x27;s currently so popular with this particular eye liner. The line is incredibly thin, which is great unless you want a bolder look (that is, again, currently very popular). It does a GREAT job of getting in between the lashes, though. It might be great if used doubled up with a standard pencil to get the look that I was going for - I&#x27;ll actually have to try that.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! The precision of the application is crazy. Finally a liquid eyeliner that has a good applicator. And it stays moist, unlike other applicators. This hasn&#x27;t dried up yet. From what I can tell, it wont anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;A very good product for beginner makeup artists.</li>
            <li> easy to use, flawless application</li>
            <li> I hate liquid eyeliner and I&#x27;ve tried other products like this and hated them.  Not this one. This is the perfect eyeliner. Finally applying eyeliner is easy and you can make the line thin for daywear and thicken it up dramatically for evening looks. The 1 star reviews I see on here are ridiculous. I have no idea what they are talking about. It isn&#x27;t fair to rate a product badly because you don&#x27;t like how they test their products.  I&#x27;m about to buy my second one because I&#x27;m afraid of running out.</li>
            <li> This is my go to drugstore liquid eyeliner. I purchase when I suddenly run out of Stila Stay All Day or Eve Pearl Smudgeproof Liquid (HOLY GRAIL!). L&#x27;oreal and Revlon have great color payoff and longevity, but both get cakey and sting. N.Y.C flakes. E.L.F. is watery.  Applicator - Felt tip. Not too stiff. Does not drag skin. Glides with ease. Longevity - Good for simple cat eye. It WILL transfer on to oily lids if doing a thick, dramatic line. Washes off easily. Color Payoff - Opaque Black, but shinier than I prefer. Looks horrible with a completely matte eye look, then shiny liner. Gross. Usually set it with MAC&#x27;s Carbon and 266 brush.  PROS: Good value for price. Does not irritate eyes. Easy to remove. Recommend for beginners or last minute drugstore run when out of liner. CONS: Set to a shiny finish, transfers.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite low price eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I do like the liner except it really feels like it wears out fast so that I do not like.</li>
            <li> The brush gets dry easily but it lasts a decently long time so that seems fair.&lt;br /&gt;Storing it tip down helps.</li>
            <li> Ink flows well, it stays on very well the whole day.  No flaking or smudging.  This is the best liquid eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of liner before so it was a little awkward at first.  It lasted all day and I am now converted to liquid liner.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Girls out there, u have to buy this. I can&#x27;t live with out this as much as I like their gel eyeliner, this is also a must. Life saver if ur in a rush or traveling, life is just easier with this.</li>
            <li> This makes lining so easy for me. It applies very thin but I build it up to how thick I want it.  I am really new at this too so I was surprised at how easily I was able to do it on the first try.</li>
            <li> I am a total fan of The felt tip eyeliners when it comes to the cat eyes, less so with lining the eyelid itself. Overall good product though.</li>
            <li> this is the only liquid eyeliner that works for me. i have unnaturally oily eyelids so everything smudges down even tho its waterproof.. so i cant even wear mascara.. but this eyeliner pen works soooo well and its very bold and easy to apply. i can finish my eyeliner in 2 seconds with this. i love it. its my 3rd time purchasing this and it doesnt dry out and doesnt smudge and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> pretty good, as long as you keep a steady hand lol.</li>
            <li> The color is rich and it applies really smoothly. The tip is really thin with a thicker base which makes it easy for thin lines or even wing tips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply but it will smear a little by the end of the day. Probably because my city is extremely hot and I often stay outdoor with high heat.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and I love it all around... Thanx</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner....seemed to dry out faster than the shore bought ones.</li>
            <li> I had some Mabelline Eye Liner similar to this previously, but I ordered the &amp;#34;Precision&amp;#34; Eye Liner this time around not realizing there was a difference.  This product is AMAZING - allows you to apply a perfect, thin line of eye liner.  I am definitely going to switch to this from now on!</li>
            <li> Incredibly easy to use. This product surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner makes for a perfect line over your eyelashes. It goes on smooth and is easy to remove. The other liquid eyeliners that I have tried do not flow as smoothly and the liner brush is too thick.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this stuff.  She had to practice with it a few times but once she got the hang of it, she looked great.  Apparently this is very popular among her age group.  It does last all day and you&#x27;ll have to use makeup remover to get it off easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof eyeliner. I love the Stila liner so much, but because it&#x27;s quite pricey, have been on the look out for a cheaper drugstore alternative. I read a large number of reviews stating that this Maybelline liner was it and I was super duper excited to try  it. It smeared in just a few hours and left me with racoon eyes. Not a good look, especially at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so your experience may be different from mine, but I hated this liner so much I didn&#x27;t even give it a second try before I chucked it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Perfect, easy to apply, and lasts long!</li>
            <li> Nice liquid eyeliner that&#x27;s easy to apply. Takes a few passes to get it really dark if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after. The volume is pretty small compared to other options so if you wear eyeliner every day be prepared to replace it reasonably often. This eyeliner is easily removed at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tend to have difficulty applying liquid eyeliner accurately, this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. It goes on so smoothly and I got a monthly subscription so that I never run out of it!</li>
            <li> Best Liquid Eyeliner I have ever bought</li>
            <li> Love myself a MAC eyeliner but was getting sick of carrying a pot and brush all the time. The Maybelline master precise eyeliner stays on longer than my MAC one. Just took some getting use to a different brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> TENDS TO RUN, BUT HAS SMOOTH APPLICATION</li>
            <li> Nice fine application, easy to create different designed. It comes off really easy so you don&#x27;t have to try and scrub, warm water gets it off just fine. I totally suggest this product because it creates of lovely finish after applying your desired eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This has been the easiest eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> First bought this when I lived overseas. Was thrilled to find it here too. Easiest eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used and it lasts!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is excellent! I have hooded (barely visible) eyelids so I always struggle with finding an eyeliner that stays close enough to the lash line. This one has such a precise tip that it does stay right there at the lash line. Save your money and try this liner.</li>
            <li> Great eye liner for a good price. I usually wear Urban Decay pencil eyeliners, and haven&#x27;t used waterproof in awhile, but I think this stuff looks just as good (if not better) than some of my Urban Decay liners.</li>
            <li> This is my best eyeliner ever. I bought 3 of it until now and I intend to stuck with it. It&#x27;s the same greatness as Lancom&#x27;s but much cheaper and easier for applying. It&#x27;s so so black and lasts for long, even away better than Mac&#x27;s liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Never done liquid eyeliner before and this made it way easier than I expected! Just don&#x27;t rub your eyes, obviously. When not touched, it didn&#x27;t smudge or fade.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it got great reviews.  It goes on nice and smoothly.  It does stay on for most of the day, but it smudges and smears very easily.  Comes off easily with make up remover.</li>
            <li> I just received my package and opened it up to find the Loreal Lineur Intense brush tip liquid eyeliner instead of the Maybelline one I had ordered. The site would not let me return or exchange it though due to it being a &#x27;hazardous material&#x27; even though I didn&#x27;t even open it yet. I called customer service and told them the problem. They are sending me a new order of the Maybelline one, I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it&#x27;s going to be the right one this time.. not a totally different brand of liquid eyeliner! Just posting this as a warning.</li>
            <li> Really good product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth Maybelline Precise liquid eyeliner, I simply love it!! I&#x27;ve used many others and not a single one beats this. It is easy to apply, creates a perfect wing, the color is just intense enough for me, it doesn&#x27;t smudge, aaaaaand it&#x27;s just wayy too good for the price. I would recommend this to anyone over some of the more fancy pricey liquid eyeliners</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the bomb diggity. I had always been scared to try liquid liner but this is so forgiving and the price means I can practice as much as I want without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I had expected the top of this to be cumbersome to use, but I am pleasantly surprised by how easy the liner glides on! Makes winged linger a breeze, and stays put all day!</li>
            <li> I like it, but it smudges very easily</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for a couple of years now and it is the best I have found and definitely well worth the price!  I wear hard contact lenses and this eyeliner has never given me a problem with my eyes.  I put it only on my top lid and it lasts all day (I touch up in the evening if going out) without smudging.  It does, however, come off easily when washing up, I don&#x27;t even need to use an eye make-up remover!  The lines are precise as promised and I find it easy to work with.  I have actually received compliments on my eyeliner!</li>
            <li> All time favorite liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, not straight line.  Stays on all day and never runs  Dark color and looks attractive</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Does not skip and looks fresh as well as long lasting results.</li>
            <li> I am terrible at applying liquid eyeliner but love the look; this is the easiest application I have ever experienced. Also, it lasts all day. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This product works great! It makes the most perfect lines.Love this eyeliner</li>
            <li> Love!!!!!!!!!!! Smooth, easy applicator, nice dark black line. I use this for thin lines and thick, the thin tip makes it easy to do the curve at the end of your eyelids.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner,  will be purchasing more. Long lasting wear, jet black, can never go wrong when drawing lines. I love it,, it don&#x27;t smugde, and drys very quickly</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is long lasting and a dense black, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like the price. It is great for the first time use.Very easy to apply, and looks very nice in 8 hours. But it starts fade away later and mass up your whole eye make-up after 5-8 hours. I know another brand does much better job.&lt;br /&gt;The ink doesn&#x27;t look as dark as it was in the beginning after using a few times. My another eyeliner last long hours and still feel like a new one after 6 months use(almost everyday).&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find a cheap and good eyeliner replace the $20 one I am using. I have tried four brands. No luck so far.</li>
            <li> It is easy to wear, but a little dry. It is not worth the price a little</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff. Goes on smoothly if I can hold my hand steady. Stays on strong--won&#x27;t come off without makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This is worst. Smudges and smear like crazy. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner pen. I am not super amazing at applying liner to the lid but this makes it a bit easier. The tip is fine so it is easy to even out a line after it has been drawn. There is enough product that goes to the felt tip so that it puts enough on the lid during application.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It goes on very smooth and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Nice touch to my eyebrows. I like the darkness of color. It is super thin so if you&#x27;re no expert in makeup like I am, it will take a few tries to master the perfect size line you want. However, it is thin enough where you can give yourself the size you&#x27;re looking for without having to remove the excess with a swab. I will recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!!!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself &amp; one for my former foster daughter, Breanna, &amp; we both love this product.  I am many decades older &amp; she is 22, so it&#x27;s great for any age. Thanks, Lynne</li>
            <li> I think this is just as good as an expensive department store brand.  It&#x27;s super easy to apply and the tip is fine that you can get it exactly where you want it to go.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Love how sleek this went on, and in one coat. Eyeliner is apart of my make-up routine and this one works perfectly. Great purchase price, and how it applys.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is very easy to use, and it is a dark black which I needed! Will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smoothly! Love it!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is AMAZING. The tip is thin enough that it&#x27;s easy to work with and no smudging when you go to draw the cat eye. I was using regular liquid liner before this and used to have to correct my cat eye almost every time I drew it, but this draws a straight line perfectly every time. I was even getting ready with one of my friends who uses mostly high end makeup brands and loaned it to her because she was getting annoyed with her liquid eyeliner and even she LOVED it. I&#x27;d say this is easily comparable to the Stila eyeliner, but with a much better price tag.</li>
            <li> Save my time in the morning!</li>
            <li> Very good eyeliner. Even after I saw so many good reviews I did not expect it to be so good.</li>
            <li> This is great for perfecting the winged eyeliner look. Long lasting and is still a vibrant black, even after being placed on top of eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the great reviews, but even storing upside down I find the pen skips and seems to fade pretty quickly. Better than the Rimmel felt-tipped liner I bought, but still on the hunt for something perfect.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. works like a sketch pen..so smooth and easy to apply...n gives such a pretty look. I would recommend other users to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Another Maybelline product which works well. I have used Maybelline for a long time and plan to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Makes a great line and is inexpensive.  Hope it doesn&#x27;t dry up too quickly</li>
            <li> Dark and precise, love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Dark black,easy to apply,smudge-proof,,wears on long:)Would strongly recommend it to anyone who likes using black eyeliners and wants it to look perfect and last!</li>
            <li> I wish the tip would stay pointy longer, but it has good color payoff, glides on easy, and gives sharp lines. It is not waterproof, but it stays on fairly well. They use cheap felt for the tip, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Removes easily with face soap &amp; water. I have oily lids &amp; this works well for me. Kat Von D&#x27;s tattoo liner is much better, but this is good on a budget. Just don&#x27;t leave it uncapped, store it upside down, &amp; shake before using.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner will not fail you!&lt;br /&gt;After trying pencils and crayons and liquids for many years I finally found the perfect cross between a liquid eyeliner and a pencil eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I never have any issues of this eyeliner smudging, fading or peeling off. I can even sleep in this eyeliner and it will look like it was just applied.&lt;br /&gt;With the pointed tip you will make precise and near perfect lines (with practice of course).&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this eyeliner for several years and have no intention of discontinuing my use.</li>
            <li> This is really easy to apply and fix mistakes on! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever purchase a dip-liquid-eyeliner again. this is so much more convenient!!</li>
            <li> Lots of eyeliner causes me irritation. This one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never used this type of applicator before. Was always a MAC gel/brush user... NO MORE. I&#x27;m in love with this type of applicator.&lt;br /&gt;It has about the same staying-power as my MAC gel.</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried, including premium and drug store brands! I use it with a primer and it doesn&#x27;t smudge all day.  The applicator doesn&#x27;t tug or pull at the skin so the application is easy and smooth.  Also very pigmented.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried to draw a line on my hand, waited for 15mins, and dropped some water on it. It goes off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed when this is not waterproof. However, I liked it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Stila definitely better than this one but more expensive</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best liquid eyeliner I have ever owned! Goes on very smoothly! Very good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> gave me raccoon eyes.  It does smudge.. I wish it didn&#x27;t. Because it didn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!! Super easy to aply, just one time and it last ALL day. I&#x27;m from a hot weather area, pencil eyeliner is a mess at the end of the day, this eyeliner resisted intact!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend says: I generally like eyeliner in this form as it is easy to apply and great for creating a perfect wing. I do like the intensity of the color, it is a nice black matte however, the lasting power is awful. Within a few hours of applying to my lid it is transferring up into my crease. Even when using a high end primer it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay put. It&#x27;s most certainly not water proof and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again based only on the fact that it transfers too much. There are many other eye liners in this form from different brands that do not have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try an eyeliner that didn&#x27;t require a brush I had to clean off after but this simply do NOT hold up compared to my gel eye liner from MAC. It has to be replied a few times throughout the day and you can&#x27;t rub your eyes - it will come right off. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you want staying power. However, the applicator makes it easy to create a nice fine line; just wish the makeup would not wear off.</li>
            <li> i like how pigmented this eyeliner is but since i have hooded eyes this eyeliner smudges everywhere and creates a big mess. was hoping it wouldnt smudge so easily but it does so if you have hooded eyes beware!!</li>
            <li> Love it, I recommend it very highly..</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried. Even including dollar store ones . It smears after just 30 minutes and yet is a pain to take off at night. Try the stila one if u don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really black in my eye I have bronze skin</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner. Im not big on eyeliner since I can never figure out how to make it stay in place and not smudge. After searching for one I cane across this and it status in place.  Easy to apply.  Love it! !!!</li>
            <li> For the price, its hard to find a much better liner. If they can just make the tip a little thinner, it would be perfect. This is a great marker type eyeliner. Great even compared to the more expensive ones. I got mine from Amazon for $5. It&#x27;s a steal. There are a couple of things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Very pigmented and very black with just one swipe&lt;br /&gt;2. When the liner is dried, there is a bit of a sheen and tackiness. I like to go over it with black or dark eye shadow to set and/or blend out the edges&lt;br /&gt;3. This formula is not waterproof. I prefer non waterproof and don&#x27;t have any problems wearing all day. Stays put even when I mist my entire face to set my makeup. Just don&#x27;t rub it&lt;br /&gt;4. Gives precise application. Easier to apply if you pull your lids taught. Pen style liner gives great control&lt;br /&gt;5. Tip is bigger than some more high end brands. It&#x27;s ok because I usually draw my lines medium to thick. However, it&#x27;s not easy to do a very thin line with this pen and I can&#x27;t really do a very thin wing at all without going back and fixing things with a moist cotton swab. I usually use a different liner when I want a very thin line&lt;br /&gt;6. No eye irritation even when it gets in my eyes</li>
            <li> I freaking LOVE this eyeliner. It applies so super smooth and the applicator is super precise. I wear super thick eyeliner and this stuff lasts ALL day and looks just as good as when I first applied it. I can apply it over shadow without a problem and it never gunks up or dries out on me. This has to be my favorite eyeliner pen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have had this liner for a few months now and it still does the job just as well as if I&#x27;d just got it yesterday. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will end up lasting me, but I will definitely be replacing it with the same liner after it runs out. I&#x27;m a make-up junkie. I LOVE my make-up and I generally purchase the expensive stuff. I like quality that lasts and does it&#x27;s job and unfortunately, you have to spend a little more to get that. This liner was the exception to that rule. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to apply and it goes on smoothly over my eyeshadow. It stays all day with no \\&quot;chipping or flaking\\&quot;. I&#x27;m honestly glad I found this product :)</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s high rating and review, I took a chance to get this one to try, with NYX mechanical pencil and Maybelline lasting drama gel liner.  Mechanical pencil is for lash line fill threfore not really a liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the two maybellines, I like the gel liner better.  The pen liner does glide smooth and precise (like the name), will not hurt or pull your lid at all.  I have good control on how I want to line my  eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smudge-wise, my lids are oily therefore i do get a bit of shadow at the outter corner (really depends on skin oil and how your eye fold is) but nothing major.  I can&#x27;t blame the product for my genetic makeup.  To minimize running I always dust some face powder around my lash line (up and under) before applying.  This seems to prevent smudging effectively (in my case anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take off, I use coconut oil.  It&#x27;s super easy to wipe it off and inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intensity of blackness fades after the ink starts to dry out from the pen.  It is not exactly a long lasting liner.  The gel liner, on the other hand, shall last forever ane ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for the gel liner if you don&#x27;t mind 15 seconds more of applying time.</li>
            <li> really have nothing good to say about this product.....don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> New to liquid mascaras, and this one is easy to apply. No complaints, stays on as intended. Now to correct my semi-shakey hands...</li>
            <li> When I first applied the eyeliner, it worked amazingly, it&#x27;s very accurate and you can make really thin lines. I messed up on the corner of my eye, and went to rub it off, but it smudged EVERYWHERE instead of flaking off. I ignored it, fixed my eyes, and went to work. I was careful at work to avoid touching my eyes, and I was only there for about six hours. The package says that the liner lasts for \\&quot;12 hours!\\&quot; Yeahhhh no. I looked in the mirror when I got home and I had raccoon eyes from all the smudging. I never touched my eyes! It might have been from sweating but it was smudged all over my face. I can&#x27;t wear this liner ever again. Such a waste of money. Don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a fantastic price. Easy to use and looks great</li>
            <li> It is SUPER black.  Should have expected that, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lighter black.  Still, it goes on smoothly and looks great and lasts a long time.  I have not had any smearing, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have used in ages!  It goes on thin or as thick as you want it.  I would be sure to give this a 10 out of 10.  now lets see how long it lasts!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Easiest eyeliner to apply, finally can do it without mess. It&#x27;s easy to take it off when still wet!</li>
            <li> Like the smooth way it goes on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of felt tip liquid liners, I had tried similar products, but saw this one here and it said it was a best seller, so I decided to try it out. I was not disappointed! The tip is quite a bit skinnier than past products I had used. It&#x27;s extremely pigmented/dark. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, I use it probably 3 times a week and I still have not yet seen it lightening up/running out yet! (so many others are black for the first 5ish uses and then quickly start fading/thinning out after that. It stays pretty dang well too! Doesn&#x27;t smudge after first being applied. I do get a tiny big of fall out if it&#x27;s warm out and I smile a lot (haha). Definitely would suggest this over any of the other &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; brands!</li>
            <li> I completely love it -- it&#x27;s easy to use and goes on so well. The color isn&#x27;t jet black, but that&#x27;s probably because I was expecting the color you get our of liquid eyeliner. But overall, extremely easy to apply. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Decent little eyeliner pen</li>
            <li> This is a good eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge make up wearer but I bought this due to the other reviews seen. It is VERY easy to use and the precision is phenomenal. Great value for the price paid. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many eye liners.  This is a very fine line, however, can also be layered for a thicker cat eye look.  It stays on all day and when applied doesn&#x27;t tug on my eyelids like eye pencils do.  This is my go to and MUST HAVE addition to my makeup collection.  I highly recommend this for the quality and the price is better than any expensive brand.</li>
            <li> i like the shape of the brush, but with my old liquid i could just wipe it and it come right off, but if you mess up with this and wipe it off, it will leave a large smear down oyur face. so i just use nutragena makeup wipes, and it come right of</li>
            <li> I use this as a really thin liner for work. Lasts all day as is easy to control thickness - which is perfect for me because I use a very thin line for work, and a thicker line for going out in the evenings</li>
            <li> Alright peeps. I have to do a review of this product cos first. I never had an eyeliner as fine and black as this. This is some good stuff. Idk, how others put the eyeliner on their eyes causing it to smudge. But I definitely love how this thing works. So fine and easy to apply!!! (:</li>
            <li> takes awhile to dry so you have to hold your lid so it won&#x27;t smear</li>
            <li> Amazing pigment. I would say this rivals with many high-end pigmented liquid liners, such as the KVD Tattoo Liner. It stays on all day, or until you take it off. It&#x27;s easy to use and great for making thin or thick eyeliner. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have never been the greatest at applying liquid eyeliner, so I was a bit hesitant when purchasing this product; however, it is very easy to apply and quickly became my favorite liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.  I apply eye shadow base and this stays on all day.  Given that I&#x27;ve over 50, I need to raise my dropping eyelids a bit until it dries, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I used to swear by the line stiletto liquid eye liner, also maybelline... Then one time for some reason I couldn&#x27;t get it so I tried this instead... What a happy accident, I&#x27;ve used this ever since. Perfect lines every time!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. Faithful buyer. Makes liquid eyeliner so much easier! Stays on for a long time through all weather, only comes off when you want it off but easy removal.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product! Not quite as long-lasting as some of my other liquid eyeliners, but for the price this is suitable :)</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s exactly as the description of the seller.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST liquid eyeliner I have ever had! The super thin application tip makes apply a thick or thin line extremely easy. It&#x27;s not water proof, or smudge resistant, so don&#x27;t rub/touch your eyes after or you&#x27;ll ruin it. But it looks great if you leave it alone.</li>
            <li> It causes irritation and smudges! Not that easy to apply. I tried a few times and finally had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Great colors, but don&#x27;t sharpen well.</li>
            <li> If you wear winged eyeliner daily I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it lasts all day, but it runs out in like 1-2 weeks. So you&#x27;re not able to use the tip for anything pretty much. It just bends and dries out.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I plan to buy more</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and a nice color. Must be applied twice to stay all day but otherwise great.</li>
            <li> I love the precises tip, It makes it so much easier to get the perfect flick every time.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best liquid liner in the world, I am sure, but it works just as well as other much more expensive brands I have tried. The only gripe I have is that it tends to sort of melt or smear at the outside corners of my eyes after several hours. I bet that applying an eyeshadow prep before putting this on would help, but I&#x27;m not trying to add yet another cosmetic to my crowded makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I am not a girly girl and had a hard time with liquid eyeliner- couldn&#x27;t get it to go on straight.  This is a piece of cake- its like a really thin tip Sharpie- also like a Sharpie, its difficult to remove if you mess up- but so easy to apply I have only done it once.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge either.  It WILL dry out if you leave the cap off.  Wish it came in brown- or any other color.</li>
            <li> I would buy better quality one next time...It&#x27;s summer time, and this not water proofed eye liner is easy to get on and OFF! Even it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner.  Ive used it for a month or so everyday &amp; not even close to running out.  Doesn&#x27;t clump or bunch....</li>
            <li> Works great for wings and making precise lines.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Cheap. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and dark! I have oily lids and a weird crease though and that causes it to smudge.</li>
            <li> Nice intense color, and application. I ordered this because I read a review that said it was close to performing like Stila. I found this to totally not be the case. I know it does not claim to be waterproof- but even without water, I find that this gave me dark smudgy under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> I really like t his product. I have to say that it is very easy with the semi rigid tip and the side of this pen to make a straight thin or thick line. I wish it came in brown because I&#x27;d buy it, too.</li>
            <li> Great for the cat eye look.</li>
            <li> I have been a MAC girl for a long time and as we MAC girls know, our habit gets expensive! At times I like to try other cheaper products on the market to help save a buck or two and I have to say I love the Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner in Black and in Brown. They go on with a continuous flow and lasts all day without smudging. I love using this for the classic cat eye or smokey eye. I am not sure how long this will last before it dries out, lets hope it lasts awhile, even if not, its a good price and so much cheaper than MAC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a first timer or a beginner, this is the liquid eyeliner for you to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Use liner to make small dots along the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Connect the dots. Rest elbow on a table for a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Allow to dry before blinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila! The perfect eyeliner application.</li>
            <li> Worked great, getting harder to use after a few months, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> This product works great! It makes the most perfect lines, and I am always getting compliments on how good my eyeliner looks.  It lasts a pretty long time, about three months, considering I wear it almost everyday.  When the pen&#x27;s ink starts to wear out, you can wet the felt tip a bit, and the pen will start working again.  I wear it all day long, and it won&#x27;t smudge, even though wear I live it gets to 110 degrees outside.  Best eyeliner for cat-eyes also!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this eyeliner so far! I&#x27;ve only used it once (tonight/ out, dinner etc) and it&#x27;s now 1AM and it still hasn&#x27;t smudged a bit. It looks a lot bolder if you go over your line a few times. Creating a dramatic cat eye hasn&#x27;t been easier :) Love this and I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Lasts 12 hours? More like 12 minutes. Does not go on smoothly seems to dot along. So I let it dry and put some shadow over it didn&#x27;t even get to my mascara and it is under my eye already.  I thought maybe I could save some money but I am going back to Stila as it really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to like this because of price.  2 Stars because it wasn&#x27;t dry and didn&#x27;t ooze out either.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t smear.  Nice thin line.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s easy to use, lasts practically all day, as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes, &amp; it easily washes off with a little water. I like that the pigment is VERY dark.</li>
            <li> Amazing and easy to draw.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I got a creamy pencil liner instead of a liquid liner. Oh and the brand wasn&#x27;t even from maybeline</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner since I was a teenager, and this one must be one of the easiest to apply. It makes a clean line, and it does stay put -- most especially when you use an eyelid primer, which I like to follow with a bit of finishing powder on the lid. My one wish: that this came in an assortment of colors to experiment with. This is a really nice eyeliner, and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye liner I have ever used!!! It is so easy to apply and the precision-tip makes it difficult to mess up, even when moving quickly. I love it. It is also jet black!!! A huge win and great product,</li>
            <li> Great, great , great, great! This is my new eyeliner regular. (:</li>
            <li> I Love this eyeliner! it is perfection i truly recommend this product! it LASTS FOREVERi can truly appreciate this product and its affordable! i darw the best lines on my eyes with this marker pen..</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this product created no irritation what so ever. My eyelids get pretty oily so this eyeliner did need to be reapplied occasionally. It was really easy to use. This was actually my first liquid eyeliner I had ever used so this was really easy to used. I only had to wait a couple of seconds for it to dry. Overall this was a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> The felt tips on this eyeliner and Stila are pretty much the same.  However, I prefer this formula over Stila because I think you can layer on the color much easier.  With Stila, if you try to draw on top of of your previous line to make it thicker or whatever, I almost feel like the previous color peels off as my felt tip glides over it, like pulling off dried paint.  Pigment wise, they are both about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention this is less than 1/2 the price for 2x the product.</li>
            <li> It glides on great and lasts all day. I really love this eyeliner. I would def buy it again. A+</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she used this a lot.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday.  I&#x27;m already in love with it. It glides on so smooth and easy. I made my cat eye lines perfectly. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybelline TESTS ON ANIMALS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this company! Also, this liner is garbage (I bought it in the past) - you&#x27;re better off with Body Shop&#x27;s liquid liner (amazing reviews &amp; cruelty free co.)</li>
            <li> I really like this pen, it&#x27;s easily found at drugstores. I like to use the shape of the tip to make my wings. I would say the only downside is that the ink runs out in a month. What is awesome about it is that it&#x27;s cheaper than ones like stila and tarte, but makes the same lines.</li>
            <li> This makes a very fine line.  I use this after I have used my thicker liner to do the heavier lining. Then I use this to do the finer wing details to bring it to a point. I dries fast and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Love it, last long and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup of any kind, but I needed this for a sugar skull makeup design for Halloween. I used this liner to fill in large circles that covered up all the around my eyes, and hid my eyebrows. I also put a large shape on the end of my nose, and intricate flower designs on different parts of my face. All of the liner stayed put the entire day without smearing or budging even a bit. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t wash off and that I&#x27;d look like a floral racoon for a week, but it washed off cleanly (from everywhere except the places along your eyelids that you&#x27;d normally put eyeliner). I used up the entire thing of eyeliner just on one application of that Halloween makeup. I wanted to try using it normally once, but it was bascially out of ink and wouldn&#x27;t go on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have all sorts of allergies and sensitivities to chemicals, but this didn&#x27;t really bother me. I&#x27;d never wear makeup on a regular basis (and you wouldn&#x27;t, either, if you looked up all the awful chemicals in 99% of makeup! :P )</li>
            <li> For my first &amp;#34;pen style eye liner&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m super impressed on how easy this is to apply! Bravo L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> luv it!! I  will repurchase again</li>
            <li> A wonderful product and my wife loved him .. also a good price</li>
            <li> I love this one! It is even better than I thought it is. Stays all day and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Super pleasantly surprised by how excellent this black liquid eyeliner is. I am a devotee of Stila who&#x27;s gone on a budget. Doubted this product could possibly live up to my Stila-high standards. But it met and even maybe exceeded them, as I haven&#x27;t had to recut or trim the tip at all yet to keep the line. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this liner! It goes on smooth and stays on all day. It is very easy to apply. You need a good make up remover to get it to come off, that&#x27;s how good it stays on. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this. Its amazing.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to the more expensive stila version.</li>
            <li> My eyeliner has never looked so precise.</li>
            <li> The color is very black, more intensely black than the Stilla eyeliner, but this one is not water proof at all... I bought it because I thought it&#x27;s water proof, I guess I didn&#x27;t read carefully.... also the felt tip is harder than expected, so it&#x27;s a little difficult to draw a smooth line where the skin is looser.</li>
            <li> It applies nicely, but due to my eyelid shape, it transfers my eye shadow over this immediately and it turns gray. Dislike for myself. Good drugstore price.</li>
            <li> This is my far the best liquid eyeliner that gives me the best line every time. I love I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Stila/Smashbox for a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Rubs really really really easily,  I put it on, and not even an hour later it is smudged all over my eye</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great color, and the tip is perfect for wings. I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Love This!!! So easy to use, Ive bought a few of these now just so i have a back up when the one im using eventually dies out. Sofar its lasted months and never failed me! If you ever like doing cat eyes or just a thin simple top layer of eye liner, Try This!!! You wont wanna go back to normal liner its great!</li>
            <li> This is a great little pen. It not only makes applying liner to my eyes pretty easy, I also used it to do a Day of the Dead face paint for Halloween and it was the perfect thing. Very pleased with the ease and durability as well as the solidity of the color.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply! the organic composition of this eyeliner makes it very easy to wash also! the package was delivered in time and in perfect form.</li>
            <li> This product is far better than any other eye liners I have tried. It&#x27;s super easy to apply and does not cause any irritations like some other products I have tried. Great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Mine was almost dry and was not easy to apply! I don&#x27;t really know how it got all those good reviews</li>
            <li> For a liquid eyeliner, this product meets the marks. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, which is the best feature of this eyeliner (besides the price). However, this may be due in part to my own failings, but I feel the black color doesn&#x27;t come on as strong as I&#x27;d like. Sometimes I get a thin, slightly translucent layer when I try to apply, and reapplying over it works a little. Other times, I get that strong, opaque black I&#x27;m aiming for. Overall, definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I use several different brands of cosmetics, but Maybelline&#x27;s eye liners are my favorite.  Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner draws a smooth, bold line that dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smear or flake and gives your eyes that WOW factor seen on runway models.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> im in love with it great color and application</li>
            <li> I wish it came in dark brown...and wider widths.</li>
            <li> Works nice but wish it would last longer. Drys out after a couple months.</li>
            <li> It is a little lighter. I usually have to build up the pigmentation to get a true black. It comes off easily without primer. Good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use a couple a year.</li>
            <li> I usually like waterproof products, i bought this one because of the good reviews and because i thought it was waterproof... well... its not.. . I especially didnt like much this one because when u sweat or when u put ur hand over your eyes it makes a huge black messs,,,, i would prefer it to wash away completely rather than having a big huge black spot of eyeliner.....</li>
            <li> This Maybelline eyeliner is very precise and black. I have permanent eyeliner but sometimes I want to use eyeliner to help play up my eyes even more and this one will defiantly do it. I like a very thin line and with the precision of the tip on this one it makes it very easy to do. Just make sure you are careful applying it because it&#x27;s that precise. You could end up with eyeliner that&#x27;s a little uneven. I do recommend it though but that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Drys out fast, smudges.</li>
            <li> my favorite go-to eyeliner</li>
            <li> awesome liner! does the job, stays on fairly well and last a long time in terms of duration of use.&lt;br /&gt;i have had it for a couple months now and it hasn&#x27;t dried out much.&lt;br /&gt;i am a free lance artist and i use this on my prom clients, they love how black it is!</li>
            <li> yuck yuck yuck. unless you like the bride of frankenstein look, or are imitating a hung over raccoon, this eyeliner is not for you. It is very easy to apply, but it also flakes off leaving chunks of eyeliner missing. Making your eyelid look like a morse code essay.  In addition to that neat little trick, the eyeliner also manages to smear everywhere, magically transferring itself from your upper eyelid to accentuate the bags under your lower eyelid.  This is not a good look for me. My husband saw me after wearing it for a few hours and asked in horror if I was sick, what was wrong with me.  I would give it zero stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> Liked it somewhat at first but it didn&#x27;t last long at all. It dried out really quick and the too got bent. Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I really love this liner. It&#x27;s nice and dark as a gel liner would be, and goes on smoothly. Takes only a minute or so to apply, if that!</li>
            <li> Precise but dries out, I also didn&#x27;t care too much for the texture, very messy when trying to fix mistakes.</li>
            <li> Nice slight line.  You need a steady hand on this one, but I like it better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  It lasts the work day at least. And if anything is an affordable practice liner.</li>
            <li> Love this. I was using fabuliner and running out and i love maybelline so decided to try this and love it so much more.</li>
            <li> Smudge proof, the felt tip is great for beginners. The pigment isn&#x27;t matte its shiny ish might need 2 coats BUT its a nice liquid liner I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> It is precise, draws a narrow line very well.</li>
            <li> I love this ultra thin felt tip.  It allows you to start with a thin line and build up coverage.  I use it especially for cat-eyes.  Oh....and it lasts a really long time before drying out!  A good buy.</li>
            <li> The color is darker than expected in a good way. Super easy to use. Works well over shadows which is super important I think. I just make sure I keep the pen standing somewhere, while not in use, with the tip facing down to make sure I get plenty of liquid when I use it. Just bought it so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last with daily use. I&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday. By the reviews, I thought it would be great! However, it was overall an okay product. I don&#x27;t see what the fuss is about, this other eyeliner I bought from the pharmacy for $2 was actually easier to apply and it stayed for a long time without smudging, and it wasn&#x27;t even a popular brand. My only problem with this one is, it&#x27;s so hard to apply with the tip. You have to press it kinda hard. Maybe it&#x27;s just not for me, but kinda disappointed with this product. Hope this review helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item several, several times in stores such as Walmart. It was a bit more expensive there. It was about seven dollars. But this is the absolute best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m on my fifth tube already. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The tip is dry and I have to constantly wet it just to get the black liner to apply. Also the tip is quite long and it makes it a bit harder to make a line and fill it in. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product nor purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have not always been a fan of other eyeliners, mostly because it was so hard to apply and get a perfect line.  I have ordered this multiple times and is the only eyeliner I use.  This eyeliner is perfect for those who are not very good with eyeliner in general.  I am not a makeup expert, but the tip on this makes it very easy to apply and fool proof.  It is much easier that any other type of eyeliner, whether it be pencil or gel.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.  Also, the tube lasted me a good 5 months with daily use.  The eyeliner does not smudge and lasts me the whole day without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> I used a very similar, but highly priced brand name product belonging to my mother. This works just as well as hers does. I simply saved a fortune purchasing this one! I love it. It&#x27;s so precise and it stays that way all day long.</li>
            <li> Easy to use black liquid eye liner. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I akways buy this same brand found it here cheaper than where i normally buy. So decided to get it and it turn out nice ty</li>
            <li> Practical, precise, great! A wonderful eyeliner for a couple of bucks. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using maybelline lash stiletto liquid eyeliner for awhile, but wanted to try something new. This seems to be working just as well as the lash stiletto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tip is really really thin. If you want a thick line or want to make a cat eye you have to keep adding to it to get the thickness. Also, if you make a mistake and try to remove it with a wet qtip it will smear and you wont be able to get the smear off.</li>
            <li> I always make sure to keep this in my makeup stash. It&#x27;s very easy and simple to apply, and makes for very cute eyeliner looks.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! So easy to use and by far my new favorite go to eyeliner &amp;#60;3 must try</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and is very precise.&lt;br /&gt;The color comes out really nice and it is dark.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner in the world for less than $5.</li>
            <li> Man oh man, this eyeliner is great. I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends. it It&#x27;s super dark and pigmented and it glides on so easily, plus the fine tip makes cat eyes a breeze. I never have to touch up my eyeliner and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily after it&#x27;s dry (trust me, i tear up multiple times a day and it&#x27;s all good)</li>
            <li> I like the applicator, but the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t stay on like other brands do. By the end of the day my eyes are a mess.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy this is to use. I am horrible at the &amp;#34;winged&amp;#34; eyeliner look, this made it look professional. i start with making a guide with regular liner and go back over with this. Has a very bold, black color.</li>
            <li> The color is dark, which is amazing. What&#x27;s not cool is how much this smears and gets on the bottom of my eyes.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner has a really nice thin tip. It&#x27;s one of the best liquid eyeliners I have ever used. You can make the lines as thin as you want with this. Also, it lasts all day and it&#x27;s very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used traditional eyeliners, brush eyeliners, gels, etc. and this is my favorite! It works super well and is way easier to apply than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> I do like this product because it&#x27;s easier than continually dipping your wand into a tube for more.  The downside for me is that I find it extremely difficult to apply at times because if not held downwards it dries out quickly... so the process takes a bit long.  I&#x27;ve attached a photo of me wearing the product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she said she loves it, can be applied thinly or thicker if you prefer, and stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not a smooth apply. A little dry.  Maybe old</li>
            <li> Works great.  Easy to draw on and goes on dark.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to liquid eye-liner and I love this product! The color is pigmented and dark and applies onto your eyelids very easily. The tip allows for thicker or thinner lines depending on your preference and so far has not caused me any irritation (I have sensitive skin). Depending on how long you wear makeup per day, it may need a reapplication but I tend not to wear makeup longer than I need to so I have not had trouble with that. Will likely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much because it is very easy to apply, easy to control the line. It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it is so easy to apply that reapplication (if I want to bother) is not difficult.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have a rough time learning how to apply this, because i heard liquid eyeliner is unforgiving. however, this has been working great for me. Not very smudgy either.</li>
            <li> I swear the first time I applied it I quite suck at it! I am still trying to learn how to apply it with my maybelline eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I use a primer underneath and it will last all day and night!</li>
            <li> Arrived dried out, no product to even use</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner and loved it! It was easy to apply and stayed on all day, however, it dried up after just a couple applications. I would look for a better product.</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck with liquid liners but this one is so easy and smooth to work with and lasts without need for touch ups no transfer or smudge problems. I was surprised I was able to get a perfect cat eye look without having to fix anything on the very first try.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter really liked this its comparable to expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I am not heavy on eyeliners and this works okay for me.</li>
            <li> Line is a little thin but better than a blob.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and lasts good 8 hours! I will definitely get it again!</li>
            <li> Good product! I wear it on my top lid, it stays put!</li>
            <li> Not that great&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the product doesn&#x27;t come out as I want&lt;br /&gt;Its not easy for me to draw the line.&lt;br /&gt;I m going back to the gel one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; looks great! Bought this because I&#x27;ve always loved the look of liquid liner but never could do it with the brush type. This is great! Just like a marker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner since I was 14 years old, 10 years late I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect eyeliner. I love that it&#x27;s extremely easy to apply a thin line and it&#x27;s matte. Win Win!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner out there. It looks great and soooo easy to apply as the tip gets really skinny. Highly recommend! If you know of a better wet liner LET ME KNOW.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily, perfect shade for my eyes. and lasts for a good amount of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would use again.</li>
            <li> If you like precise eyeliner and &amp;#34;wing tips&amp;#34; on your eyelids (Amy Winehouse style) THIS is the eyeliner for you. Best precision eyeliner I have ever used. I also keep this as a stand by for face painting, and specialty artwork on face and body. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> why I chose this rating is because this product is really good. Although I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it came in a box with a bunch of paper I guess it was to make it more heavier. It&#x27;s way cheaper buying in-store but it is no longer available at stores. But overall, I really like the product glides on smoothly for a winged tip eyeliner. But will see how long it lasts me and will update. Kind of recommend this product only if you want sort of cheap liquid eyeliner it was like $6.54 somewhere around there.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! I have always been a pencil person and gave the liquid a try and I love how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li> For the very first time in many years, I finally found an eyeliner that goes on as thin or as thick as you like  ( I like thin).  It goes on so smooth and lasts all day and night!  It doesn&#x27;t crack or look lumpy like most eyeliners.  Love this product and will continue to purchase it through Amazon for great pricing.  In fact, I&#x27;ve put this on my Subscribe and Save orders to make sure I don&#x27;t run out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into liquid eyeliners but this works great and stays on all day. I tried another liquid eyeliner in brown and it was not good. I would like to find this one in brown.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner has a nice dark black color that barely fades throughout the day. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any smudging; but it should be noted that I do have somewhat of a dry skin. Overall, this eyeliner is a nice product that is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This marker is a life saver. I am awful with regular liquid eye liner and pencils and gel don&#x27;t give the same crisp and narrow lines you need to do the flick on winged eyeliner - this is the perfect tool! In the past I&#x27;ve found out to smear with relative ease if you get wet or a little sweaty so I don&#x27;t use it for my whole eye, just the flick but it is perfect for that use.</li>
            <li> was dried out and didnt have any liner in it its old expired makeup</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t stay where it should, but delivery and all that was great!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and feel, It doesn&#x27;t have a dry or clumpy feeling, goes on extremely smooth and is very precise. Tip: When I use this, I sort of pull on my eye lid to the side, to easily apply. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> End is not as flexible as my previous product! I found it harder to apply!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is easy to use, and works well. It stays on all day, and comes off easily with makeup remover. I did not have to replace it for about 3 months, when after daily use it had stopped working as well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this eyeliner twice now. I have used potted gel liner in the past (Stila and Maybelline) and liked them for their smooth application and how they stay all day. I bought this marker-type liner for travel and on days that I just don&#x27;t have time to mess with cleaning the eyeliner brush. I love how this goes on and stays on. This is very easy for me to tight line my upper lid since I have small eyes and a thick line is not really for me. I will continue to buy this eyeliner as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> The best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used. However, the cap was loose and it dried up in one day.</li>
            <li> Dried out .quickly ordered another same liner..thoght it may have been that one..no..sadly that one didnt last much longer</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price!!! Loved it SOO much more than the expensive brands. I will be using this product for good.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed , it was light and it would easily smear of within an hour it had almost completely faded away :(</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and its color is nice. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really loved this eyeliner. It allows me to do the wing of my eyeliner pointy because of the pointiness of the tip of the eyeliner. It allows me to be more precise. I also love that it is easy to apply and glides on smoothly. It also doesn&#x27;t smudge on my eyelids either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, wish it was a waterproof formula. After a few hours you end up with panda eyes. It&#x27;s a little too watery, if it could be a tad thicker in formula then it could actually stay on the eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only okay... Doesn&#x27;t stay dark very long. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very precise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly terrible with gel liners and painting things on.  The actual liner pencils just hurt to put on, an irritate my eye, so these marker-like liners are awesome. Trying to get the other liners to look normal and symmetrical can drive me INSANE and takes forever!  I usually use the Jordana brand of these from Walgreens for $2, but those smell like heavy chemicals, and don&#x27;t keep fine lines for long after purchase.  This has no scent, and the line stays thin and precise.  I&#x27;ll update my review if it doesn&#x27;t last long.  This is worth it already for me, because I don&#x27;t smell like I painted household cleansers on my sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and dries quick! I don&#x27;t see myself buying another eye liner! and I have tried a few here and there, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on behalf of my daughter who was using this liquid eye liner a lot. She wears contacts, too, for whatever that is worth information wise. Somehow she got some of the eye liner in her eye and ended up with a terrible infection. Before she told me about it, she let herself get into some serious pain and now has some scars on her eye. I don&#x27;t know if we should blame this liquid eye liner or not but I do believe there should be some serious warning labels on the product. Part of this is her fault but the eyeliner sure wasn&#x27;t meant to do good things in her eye. She has since pretty much given up eye make up. I don&#x27;t think it is very good for anybody. According to her, she only got a tiny bit in her eye and rinsed it out almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the other comments at first, but this truly stays on even the most oily lids. The applicator is great and you can&#x27;t beat the price. For less than $5 it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! But the cap is finniky on mine and it dried out a bit. No too big a deal it just doesn&#x27;t work as well now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for probably a year now. I love it. It has the best, thin tip that I&#x27;ve found so far. The one I ordered from Amazon even more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to keep in mind is it bleeds EVERYWHERE if it gets the least bit wet. If it stays dry you&#x27;re good all day long. It won&#x27;t bleed or &amp;#34;slip.&amp;#34; Just dont wear it to the pool. 😂</li>
            <li> Love this product!  The only Eyeliner I will ever use again.  the application is comfortable, one apply it once a day.</li>
            <li> Love it! You can do fine lines (like cat eye) so nicely and stays all day.</li>
            <li> I really liked this eyeliner I use it daily but it does smudge easily and it&#x27;s not as dark as I would like but  it&#x27;s one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s super easy to use. :)</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Very dark and flawless after a night out of dancing.</li>
            <li> Got this as an add on item to qualify for free shipping. It&#x27;s not black, barely shows on the eyelids. Not impressed. The tip is not fine and bends.</li>
            <li> Its dry! I perly can draw a complete line. Not dark black.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! Hasn&#x27;t let me down yet!</li>
            <li> I considered giving this 4 stars because I kind of fail at applying liquid-type liners, but it doesn&#x27;t seem right to fault an amazing eye liner for my unpracticed hands. This definitely takes more skill to apply than my cream pencil (so smooth and easy) and regular pencil eyeliners (don&#x27;t love). I suppose with practice, I&#x27;ll eventually get faster/better at this. I did manage to master a great cat eye and my sexy little flicks have never looked better. This was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> BEST EYELINER EVER! I love how dark the colour is.</li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. Once I used it I was very disappointed. It&#x27;s so dry, does not apply as described! False advertisement!</li>
            <li> The product dried in 2 weeks, cheap and awful.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is a great price when you&#x27;re looking for drug store brands. Obviously, quality is matched to its pricing. I bought this as a quick cheap fix in between the eyeliner brands I usually wear. The color applies evenly and it doesn&#x27;t smudge horrendously as others have for me in the past. My only complaint is that when I use it, I draw one streak from my inner corner of my eye to the outer corner, and this eyeliner does not make a smooth line. It &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34; in the sense that on my eyelid the eyeliner will draw little bumpy areas when the eyelid moves with the tip. I have to redraw those areas and cover it up to make a smooth again.</li>
            <li> Work well but after a while it smudges unfortunately...</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, stays on well.  Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Came here on time good eyeliner</li>
            <li> Liner brush too thin for me but I like it anyway. Takes more than one application for the eyes if you want a bold outline.</li>
            <li> I cant say anything bad about this product, very easy to use and of great quality. I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Love it, love it love it</li>
            <li> I love the felt pen. Such precise lines!</li>
            <li> Not really what i expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d order this again.  What really works well about this item is the precision it offers due to the shape and construct of the tip..  This is great for someone who finds it hard to wear eyeliner or too much make-up like me.  It allows me to get right up next to the last line so it brings out my eyes without looking like I smeared a line of color across my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner! Stays on no matter what!</li>
            <li> first off it runs all day and somehow gets on upper eyelids. then it is very strange because it doesnt have any liquid in it to last .</li>
            <li> This does not FLOW off the tip, you have to PRESS it so the eye liner will flow..have you ever tried to press something into your eye lid? Not a good feel, so I tried to press it on top of my hand to get it to flow..but it would not apply at all..it is a LOSER..sorry..do not waste your money..! it is meant to stay in the tube...pressing to hard on the eye lid or lower lid will HURT you to get it out of the container...the design is flawed.!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner! I use everyday now. Threw away the rest !</li>
            <li> this is a very good liner - and the price is great</li>
            <li> A very good eyeliner!  I am committed to finding alternatives to department store beauty picks, to save money.  This is not your Mom&#x27;s Maybelline so do give it a try.  BTW, I am a card carrying retired make up artist.</li>
            <li> This liner is PRECISE! I love it. I have curly lashes that make it difficult to apply liner precisely, but this helps me line my lids perfectly/</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pen provides bold precise lines. I love it! And I don&#x27;t have a very steady hand when it comes to applying eyeliner, but this one is easy to control and only requires one swipe across the eyelid for a solid line.</li>
            <li> i think i got a defective product! after first time using it, i feel like it&#x27;s already running out of liquid in it. it smudges easily and it becomes very messy!</li>
            <li> Love this! Easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Good product goes on smooth and easy and last all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bad with eyeliner. I can tell you for sure, 100%, that this makes me apply eyeliner like a PRO. I can do a cat eye every day, and it doesn&#x27;t budge even when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
            <li> Favorite eyeliner! Got it the next day with Amazon Prime and it is so easy to use and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m contemplating stocking up and buying hundreds of these because I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if Maybelline ever discontinues them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My everyday makeup routine is very minimal - usually it&#x27;s just moisturizer, primer, lip balm, and this eyeliner. No matter how tired I am, this always wakes up my eyes. The felt tip is very fine and draws a perfect line each time. I&#x27;ve been wearing the same eyeliner method for the past 15 years, so my hands are pretty steady but this would be a great liner for beginners. It&#x27;s so easy to draw a perfectly defined line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does start to smudge and not look as sharp at the end of the day, but I&#x27;m fine with that. I would say it lasts at least 8 or 9 hours. Also comes off easily with eye make up remover (I use Clinique).</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner!  it&#x27;s easy to use and never smears.  Application is super easy with a nice firm brush on the end</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to start doing cat eyes, and I am terrible at using any form of black eyeliner. No matter what your skill level, this thing gives you amazing control, and clean lines! It has a very soft, but substantial bendable tip, with plenty of &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; to do whatever you want on your eyes. Everything about this pen just works, the tip, the flow, the color, the consistency, the drying time, EVERYTHING!! Awesome product and will be buying from now on!</li>
            <li> Seems to stay on longer than most I have used.</li>
            <li> Smears and falls off after a few hours but is very easy to apply and create a straight line.</li>
            <li> Great product, lasts all day, and applies easily. The only issue I have sometimes is that the very tip will sometimes run out once I get to the second eye and I have to wait for more to make it&#x27;s way down. For the price though, a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time applying it which I am sure is just me.</li>
            <li> It finished really quickly, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks and it finished already.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use any form of liquid eyeliner, but I keep one around for some occasions and this made it easy to get it perfect! I might start using this daily, really surprised and happy.</li>
            <li> this product is a plus, I didnt put a 5 star rate cause even though it lasts all day, it fades a little and looks like some eye shadow made eyeliner, but my intentions on this products are pretty positive</li>
            <li> My new favorite!!  Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t blob.  Stays all day but washes off easy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner stays on well and is easy to use, but it did not last long. I saved the applicator and bought another favorite eyeliner and put it on the Mabelline applicator liner.</li>
            <li> Great product, looks good, easy to apply. Very happy :)</li>
            <li> this is an amazing eyeliner. it has a smooth line and a felt tip so it is easy to glide on. it is solid black unlike some other pens with very light coverage, showing up grey. i am in 7th grade and i wear this about once a week,(i am a makeup obsessor) and it is the best eyeliner i have!</li>
            <li> I have a very long and varied history with eyeliner. When I started using it around age 15, I used regular ol&#x27; pencil eyeliner. I found this to be difficult to apply and it never looked the way I wanted. I then switched to retractable pencil eyeliner and found that it smudged way too much on my eyes. It never looked the same at the end of the day. Somewhere along the line, I discovered liquid eyeliner. While this looked great and stayed in place all day, I again had a hard time applying it because the bush was so long and flimsy. I just couldn&#x27;t get the right shape. When I discovered gel eyeliner, I thought I had finally met my eyeliner soul mate. It was easy to apply and had the vibrant, wonderful look that I liked from liquid eyeliner. The only problem was that the brush was a bit too wide to do thin lines (and I love winged liner, so this was disappointing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY, I found this. I swear, I will never use another eyeliner again. This is it: the end of my journey. This liquid liner is PERFECT. It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and so precise! It stays on all day, never smudges or fades. I am in love! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I usually use Stila&#x27;s eye liner pen, which, works admittedly better and longer, but for the price this works well. I use it as a back up or when I&#x27;m doing makeup that I don&#x27;t want to fight off at the end of the night. Bottom line: if you&#x27;re not ready to make the jump to $20 eyeliner, this is the best in this price range.</li>
            <li> I would buy this liner again.  It seems to have continuous flow and makes a good clear line.  I like to wear it defined or smudged by a lighter soft color. A steady hand helps but it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner so much that I never thought of changing to another brand ever! Last week I bought my 5th one from Amazon, and they sent me a really weird one, the tip was so hard it hurts when applying to my eyes. I used to buy it from Ulta or CVS, its my first time buying eyeliner from Amazon and I am really disappointed! This might be a sign for me try other eyeliner......grrrr.....eyeliners are my second life you know..</li>
            <li> You need a steady hand to make s narrow line.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Quality over quantity. Keep these things in mind and you&#x27;ve got yourself a quality liquid liner at a great price. Also, consider an eyeshadow primer on the eyelids prior to application if you find it to fade during the day or if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I tried almost all brands of liquid eye liners to find the best, and I finally found this one. I&#x27;m totally in love with this product. This liquid eye liner is very easy to apply when compared to others and it enhanced the look of my eyes. It is totally worth the money that I spent on this product.&lt;br /&gt;--Prasanthi.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing! It&#x27;s super black and really easy to use! Best one I&#x27;ve had yet :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this eyeliner, I was happy with it for the first few days. It seemed really rich and dark and glided on nicely. After several weeks, the color just got lighter and lighter and I would have to reapply my eyeliner several times a day.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! it goes on smooth, but I feel it like the tip dries a little fast, so I have to shake it to get the liquid to the tip, which is also good when applying it, so it won&#x27;t run  or smudge all over. Also the price is very competitive with other brands and the quality is great!! Will definitely keep buying it!</li>
            <li> great but rubs off easily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS EYELINER!!  However, the one I ordered from Amazon was not as good of quality as what I have purchased at WalMart of drugstores.  It seemed old and dried up.  Love the product, just not the one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have been using eyeliner for many many years.  Love the way it makes my eyes pop.  It really make them stand out more.  Maybelline has great eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This is very nice liner. I use it on my top lids.  It didn&#x27;t stay on my bottom eye rim, but works great for the top, one can get a fine line or thicker line.</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very dark through.</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used. Love it and will keep getting this kind.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about. It dries right when you put it on. Stays on all day. It&#x27;s like a pen, easy on the go. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any luck with liquid, and seeing as how I am not very coordinated, I stuck to gel and an angled brush. Problem with gel is it smudges. My first time applying liquid eyeliner is with this product, and I think I&#x27;ve converted. It gets a nice dark line above my lashes and does not budge until I need to remove makeup and wash my face. Bottom lashes I don&#x27;t like done too much so I stick with a light pencil liner.</li>
            <li> I like this liner - the cost is great, the tip has a nice pointed tip and it&#x27;s very smooth... the only downside is that it tends to smear more than I expected, but I live in humid Florida, so I probably just need to get a waterproof liner next time.</li>
            <li> Well, I already knew this product was great because I&#x27;ve purchased it before from Walgreens or something. However I&#x27;m giving it a 5 stars on here because it&#x27;s A LOT cheaper on here and it&#x27;s still as great! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Works perfectly each time with no clumping and I&#x27;ve never had one go bad on me and dry up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so nice to be able to get this only since we live in a very small town which makes it frustrating when you run out and can&#x27;t find anyone locally who carries it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner 😜. It works great .</li>
            <li> The tip is a bit long, making it a little more difficult that some other applicators. Still, it did a great job at creating an even line. Can make very thin, thick, winged, straight, anything you want.</li>
            <li> The felt tip gives you good control over where the juicy black stuff goes, but the fun only lasts for so long. Mine dried out in like two months. Now I just get faint grey smudges out of it. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s easy to use, it lasts long and it has a rich and nice color! Amazing for the price</li>
            <li> Worked well and I am not a makeup person but I was able to use this quite well. I am completely satisfied with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m rather disappointed with this product. I first tried it when I was at a friend&#x27;s house and she lent me this. I loved it so I purchased one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it on my own, I loved it. The color was a nice, intense, solid black and it was very easy to apply. Any mess-ups could be wiped away with a make-up wipe without much effort. The color would stay the same throughout the day and it wouldn&#x27;t bleed or run. The next day when I went to use it, I was met with a surprise. Instead of the beautiful solid black line of yesterday, I got a water-down, diluted, nearly clear line. It didn&#x27;t look like eyeliner at all. Thinking that I perhaps got a defective one, I purchased another--it was so good the first times it was worth a second try. As before, the first day was perfect. I made sure to put the cap on tightly once I was done and then stored it how I usually do: horizontally. The same thing happened; it became diluted looking the next day. Thinking that maybe the way I was storing it was wrong, I got both of the eyeliners and put them in a jar upside down. This helped a little, but I found I could only use it occasionally and could only apply using the base of the applicator. The tip of the applicator would still only produce the off-white eyeliner. As this takes away any ease it once had, it just doesn&#x27;t feel worth it to use. I keep them around just in case, but I&#x27;ll only attempt to use them if I have absolutely nothing else.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to use unless you&#x27;re a body builder and are insanely strong..</li>
            <li> This was the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve bought, and it works really well, looks great, is easy to apply, and stays on you for hours..</li>
            <li> i was horrid at cat eyes before i got my hands on this eyeliner. as someone with hooded eyes, there is very little eyelid space for me to work with. luckily the tip of this eyeliner is so fine that i have complete control over the level of thickness i desire. the tip also makes for a very sharp line, making it effortless to build it out into a fine cat eye. this is one of those products that once you have it, you wonder how you survived without it for so long.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve mastered it, you can do anything really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eye liner pro and have tried a variety of drug store and high end eye liners and this product is awful. It says the color is black but shows up more like a grey and the applicator brush is very EHH. I cut the tip a bit to access the product better and will use it most likely as a last resort.</li>
            <li> my wife loving this product. would recommned</li>
            <li> Love maybelline products this eyeliner makes it very easy to apply to the eye and has a beautiful smooth finish and it came earlier than expected.. 👍</li>
            <li> For its inexpensive price, this eyeliner is rather impressive. The felt tip easily glides across my eyelid as I like and the formula is smooth and consistent for the most part. After using it for a few months, I did notice that the liquid wasn&#x27;t coming out very well right at the tip but after tilting the pen slightly so that part of the side of the felt tip was against my skin, the eyeliner worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just really wish that this eyeliner were waterproof since my eyes seem to have an uncanny knack for getting wet easily. The only instances where I saw the eyeliner smudging or transferring were if my eyes were getting wet (and when I once put the eyeliner on my waterline just to see what would happen- unfortunately that didn&#x27;t work). The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this eyeliner four instead of five stars is because the very tip of the pen isn&#x27;t as sensitive as it used to be, and it has become a little more difficult for me to draw thin lines as I now have to tilt the pen in order for the liquid to come out.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner after trying several brush and felt tip eyeliners and this is by far the best value. I have spent more on the Clinique brand but this one has more color and is more durable against sweat and moister, without having the painstaking difficulty to remove factor that the waterproof eyeliners have. The tip is the perfect size to make thin lines but is flexible enough to make thicker ones and it’s so easy to flick off the ends of your eye to make a cateye. After ten years of wearing makeup, I have finally found my go-to eyeliner. Now if only I could find the right lipstick...</li>
            <li> Really like this eyeliner.  Lasts all day.  However, it was difficult to get any out of the very tip, which made making fine lines with it impossible.  I ended up cutting the tip off at an angle, then using the tip of the angle for fine lines.</li>
            <li> It applied easily, but irritated my eyes pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Typical good liquid liner. Goes on dark, doesn&#x27;t bleed, stays on all day. My only issue is it sometimes tugs at my eyelid as it goes on causing a bumpy line rather than a straight one.. Good alternative to my go to E.L.F. liquid liner though.</li>
            <li> My previous favorite was almay but this one is the best. It&#x27;s like writing with a pen. Super smooth and easy to make sharp well defined lines. I&#x27;ve never had success drawing a line that extended beyond my eye lid without it looking messy. This make it so easy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product well enough to buy it again.  I prefer pencils.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product</li>
            <li> Best liner on the market. Love this</li>
            <li> My daughter is addicted to this eyeliner. She always adds it to her amazon wish list and I send it to her in care packages to college and put it in her stocking. I should set up an amazon subscription because it seems like she goes through it and uses it regularly enough.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s easy to apply and looks really good, but it smears reeeally easily. I don&#x27;t always touch my face but if my eye is bothering me if I&#x27;ll rub to the side of it (trying to avoid smearing my liner) but somehow I always end up smearing it. Plus side is it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This is great for lining the top eyelid but seems to run during the day if you line the lower eyelashes.  I dotted it on sparingly on the lower lash line and that helps.  If it is a hot humid day it may still leave a slight racoon eye.  I have tried lightly dabbing a q-tip with powder over it to set it better in the humidity and that seems to help.  I have my lashes tinted so I don&#x27;t wear mascara.  The racoon eyes had to come from the liner.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner looks great, thank you</li>
            <li> The product is nice BUTTTTTTTTTTTTT  It has completely dried to death in 2 weeks and return is not provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy cosmetics on Amazon now :( ... WASTE OF HARD EARN MONEY</li>
            <li> Rubs off a little too easily, not good for jobs/activities that require rigorous movement. However, nice felt tip point and fine liquid quality.</li>
            <li> I had previously been solely a eyeliner pencil user, but wanted to give liquid a try for more sharp wings. Smudges kind of easily throughout the day, but it goes on really easily which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other liquid eye liner and never found one i liked, until this one. The tip doesn&#x27;t dry up fast like others and it goes on incredibly smooth. Unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, you can choose to have a thin or thicker line. With other it was, you get what you get. but with this, you get a super thin line or thicker is you press down some. It creates a beautiful flawless line.</li>
            <li> Great product, it last long time and the color is very black.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply on your eye.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommended this product to any one wants a good and easy EYELINER.</li>
            <li> I borrowed this product from a friend( tried it before) and it works great! I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, I&#x27;d buy again!  The tip of the liner is a little pointier than I prefer making it harder to be precise but I adjusted after a few uses.  Def serves it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
            <li> Well I finally go to use the eyeliner and it is dried out. Not useable at all. I will be happy to return the defective one for a new one. Please let me know.</li>
            <li> Works great easy to use</li>
            <li> My new favorite eyeliner! My old ones kept smearing so much and by the end of the day its gone. So I searched for a new one. Found this one, read the reviews which prompted me to finally buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on a few days ago for the first time. Made cute doll eye look with a slight flare at the end. I spent the day outside in 80 degree weather helping my boyfriend change my car oil (by help I mean stand around and watch while I also played taylor swift on my phone to dance to). Then we went out for dinner and a movie. Before the movie started I went to the bathroom. When I looked into the mirror I was shocked. My eyeliner design was still there! It looked as if I had just put it on or retouched it. There was a slight smudge on the corner but it didn&#x27;t bother me. I just dabbed it away and I looked perfect! Stayed on all day even when I was sweaty and grimy. I came out of the bathroom and told my bf &amp;#34;Why didn&#x27;t you tell me that i looked gorgeous as hec! And that my eyeliner is still there!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy this again? Hec yea! Throwing out my old ones.</li>
            <li> Good eyeliner for a decent price my only problem is sometimes it faded a little bit but overall i&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is rich and the brush is soft. It&#x27;s super easy to use and the color stays on for a really long time. I was so sad when the Target near my house ran out and I tried the Revlon liquid pen but it just couldn&#x27;t compare. Definitely recommend..</li>
            <li> I love this formula and the pen&#x27;s felt tip!!!  I have had the same pen for a bit over six months, and it still hasn&#x27;t dried out.  The formula flows nicely onto the felt dispenser tip but not so much that the liner gets all over.  I find the formula doesn&#x27;t spider into all the fine lines in the surface of the skin like some other products.  The felt tip is &amp;#34;longer&amp;#34; and product is on the whole length of the tip so that you can rest the edge of the tip against your lid to get a smoother looking line.  I also find the felt tip soft then others.  I have only purchased this once, but will again as soon as I run out, because it is so easy to use and lasts.  This product lasts, but it isn&#x27;t one that you have to scrub off either (I might should say that I use it over primer).</li>
            <li> The best part about this eyeliner is how easy application is. You do need to apply more than one layer, however, in order to get a solid black color. It also has very little lasting power. After a couple of hours I need to touch it up. It also sortof melts around my eye, creating a dark color around them that settles in my creases (which need wiping away regularly). I do not consider my lids to be particularly oily, so that is not the problem. I&#x27;m not a fan of this eyeliner;  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> this is very easy to use and very precise, its so black and last all day i really like this product and i would totally repurchase it</li>
            <li> Excellent eyeliner for people who just can&#x27;t get the traditional liquid eyeliner quite right. Extremely smooth and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> Applies nicely and accurately. But not smudge proof at all.... And in all fairness  it does not tout itself as waterproof but any amount of moisture from rain to jumping In the pool results in raccoon eyes....</li>
            <li> Excellent make-up if one does not have good hand, is very soft and easy to use, I love I can delineate perfectly my eyes on different styles</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine--it wipes off easily, but doesn&#x27;t really wear off during the day if you don&#x27;t touch it. I&#x27;m not a fan of the applicator, though. It definitely takes some practice to make a thin line that shows up well. Thin lines are really light, and to get the dark black color, you have to press down on the tip, which makes the line much thicker than I want, so it&#x27;s definitely not something I can use day-to-day.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on here I had high hopes for this product. So far the first time I used it it came out very liquidy, however it did try after a few minutes in front of the fan. The color came out very black which was a plus for this. After a nine hour day it also cracked in two places per eyelid. Sadly I will be purchasing it again, however I would recommend that you try for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.the point makes applying it easy and this very pigmented and long lasting..you can also take product from the tip onto to a eyeliner brush and get a great effect also</li>
            <li> Long lasting.  Price is great compared to Stila which also works very well.  Would like in black/brown.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on throughout the day. I started noticing that by lunch everyday it was smudging and making it look like a 5 year old put it on. I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Love the liquid eyeliner pen you can effortlessly apply it beautifully!!! Very solid fine lines gives my eyes a little touch of perfection! I love eyeliner and this is seriously a great buy!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Easy to use on almond eyes. Can do a nice cat eye with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. The brush allows you to do a thick line for evening, or one so thin it goes almost unnoticed behind your curled lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 4 star... because it seems to dry out a bit fast.</li>
            <li> Nice line, easy to work with..wear eyeliner most days. Stays looking good all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something exactly like this and FINALLY found it.  Other liners wear off and if I go out after work I need to reapply, this product looks as good as it did when I applied it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the color fades on my upper eye lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone loves this product so much, I have bought it twice and each time it seems so dry. The tip of it barely works at all and it&#x27;s really hard to get small lines. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into organic make up sets and you don&#x27;t have sufficient money to buy 50-bucks worth sets, I highly recommend this eye-liner not only because of its cheap price, but also because of its organic components which prevents allergic reactions and other skin-related ailments. been using this for months and I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this item. It smears within just a few minutes of putting it on for me. It&#x27;s like using a child&#x27;s marker for an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I wish the product came in a brown. I am in my mid-60&#x27;s with fair skin so the black looks like I&#x27;m trying to fool people that I&#x27;m younger, which doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, very easy to apply for a beginner like me :)</li>
            <li> I normally wear thick winged eyeliner and this product does not hold up throughout the day. It ends up on the top of my eyelids and smudges everywhere. I also found it sort of hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a nice liquid eyeliner to use and I stumbled upon this. It leaves beautiful bold lines! It dries up pretty quickly and lasts the whole day for me! I use this on an everyday basis. It&#x27;s really nice for doing make-up in the morning, so if you&#x27;re looking for a helpful liner to get your day going, I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Good product, although, you need to have  fantastic pulse to draw the line</li>
            <li> I chose this liquid eyeliner after reading the great reviews. While the color looked nice, it did not go on smoothly at all! The description says it does not skip, but it did for me. Also, the very tip of the liner does not hold makeup. You have to hold it horizontally and use the whole side of the pen to get it to go on properly. Also, the pen tends to fray, and little strings have to be cut off every few days to keep it from making extra messy lines when applying. Once this one is empty, I won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I thought it would dry out like most eyeliners do when not kept correctly, but it hasn&#x27;t been showing signs of drying out any time soon. It&#x27;s very easy to apply to make either thin or thick lines. I&#x27;ll probably order another once I run out.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly.nice eyeliner pencil that looks like liquid eyeliner but goes on more neatly and easily than liquid.  Stays put.  would like to see it available in brown.</li>
            <li> This liner is really easy to use, especially for a beginner when liquid eyeliners can be daunting. The color was very black which is awesome and its the best felt tip liner I have used and is just as good as the pricier alternatives.</li>
            <li> This liner is really easy to use, and you can actually use it several ways.  It will smudge nicely while it is still drying if you don&#x27;t want a really precise look but it doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge after it has dried.  I don&#x27;t use any base on my eyelids and this still stays in place and lasts all day.  It&#x27;s easy to get off at night too.</li>
            <li> it is sooooo good~&lt;br /&gt;i can hardly find an eyeliner which i can apply smoothly on my eyelids, but this is an exception!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for anyone who has a shaky hand when doing eyeliner like me</li>
            <li> I love love love this!! The brush is super precise and the results are perfect. It comes out a very dark color. c: Would buy again</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.  Great color and consistency.  Smudges like crazy though so you will need to put on sufficient amount of eye shadow and base to prevent that.</li>
            <li> Worst eyeliner I have ever used. I was really impressed after the first use, but it dried out or was empty no idea, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the texture of this pen.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years.</li>
            <li> This product was okay, nothing outstanding. It did what is said it would do and nothing else. I might have received a bad batch because it took me a minute to get the solution thin enough to apply. Once applied, it didn&#x27;t last long at all. It seemed to dry quickly and look flaky before it started to peel off.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! It lasts a very long time for liquid eyeliner. I think I typically can get 2-3 months out of this applying it every single day (sometimes more than once). Stays on all day too!</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, smooth, and goes on dark. Everything a busy working mom needs in an eyeliner. I love it!</li>
            <li> Brush was hard initially but applies really well. My complaint is that it smudges when it gets hot. Does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using liquid liner for years, and this is one of my favorites. It has a felt tip that creates a nice line, and I like the pen-like shape, which makes it easier for me to use on myself and others. My liner will last the whole day, even in hot TX weather. With lots of use, one pen lasted me a few months. Sadly, I throw them out at 3-4 months (nervous about germs) even though it still had some use in it. :( I hate wasting product. Anyway, I like it, it&#x27;s a great product, and the price is great. Some of the more expensive brands are a waste of extra cash.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is as good as department store liner.</li>
            <li> Be careful! It takes a while for it to dry and if you blink, you will look like a racoon!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter.  This is her favorite and at the price point a good value.  My daughter is 31.</li>
            <li> smears too easily and the product does not come out well.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner and I tried a lot of them!</li>
            <li> Love it! the usual of Maybelline. I am still getting used to using a liquid eyeliner and I think the thikness of its brush is helping a lot. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy about this eyeliner. It&#x27;s so much easier for precieion, it doesn&#x27;t come off on top lid when closing eyes. I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> New favorite eye liner</li>
            <li> lasts for hours, very percise and draws on beautifully</li>
            <li> For some reason, my skin tends to absorb this liquid liner the moment I supply it, so I can&#x27;t get a hard line with it. None of the other felt tip liners I&#x27;ve used have ever done that. It just starts fading and the line breaks up. So weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it has the sharpest, most precise tip I&#x27;ve ever used, and it love that. I just wish the liner applied by that great tip actually stayed put.</li>
            <li> Shipped out fast! I ordered one, but got an extra one, which is fantastic because I love it! I&#x27;m not a make-up user, or even that savvy with putting on eyeliner, and I was a bit worried that this would cause allergies to react, or even that I&#x27;d be hard to use - but it was super easy. Would recommend for first time user!</li>
            <li> Good one, but not for beginners...</li>
            <li> I have tried several eyeliners to get that perfect line and this is the one.  I love this stuff.  I hardly have any mess ups or fixes.  It is smooth and precise.  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner.  Being 50 plus, my eyelids have thinner, slightly wrinkly skin.  I find using short strokes across my lash line works best.  I let it dry about 5 minutes before applying other eye makeup.  I&#x27;ve tried several and this eyeliner is my favorite.  It stays on until I remove it.</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it ,help you stay in line and shape your eyes contour , definitely recommended this eyeliner its worth the price.</li>
            <li> Take it from a novice. This made me Liquid eyeliner pro in no time. Just practice with short thin strokes to build up your line. And it comes out incredibly even and bold. Way easier than typical brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different liquid liners in the &amp;#60;$10 varieties, and this is by far my favorite. It puts down solid color with every stroke - no skipping or thinning - and doesn&#x27;t dry out from one eye to the other. It allows for much greater precision than other brushes due to the long, tapered end, and draws smooth lines. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. I&#x27;m obsessed with creating a wing on my outer eyelid and this does the job amazingly. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t stay on well for long and easily rubs off. You just need to touch it up every 4-5 hours. Other than that i love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Not smudge proof or waterproof.  but if your face is not that oily, it will stay longer time. suggest to upgrade this product to smudge proof and waterproof then I will continue buying this item.</li>
            <li> I like its precision and texture, but hoped it lasted longer</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have owned!</li>
            <li> Love it definitely will buy it again goes on black like I wanted it to I was worried they it would look grey</li>
            <li> If I only apply this over my eyeshadow it stays, but if it&#x27;s on my skin around my eyes it smudges really bad. Try rimmel scandleyes liner or if you want to spend more try Urban Decay glide on liners they work better and stay long.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a cosplay. I&#x27;m not an expert with make up but man, does this stuff glide on and look amazing! I got the eyeliner right on my first try too!</li>
            <li> Bought for my friend. Great product. Fast shipping and superior quality. What else can I expec? Recommended</li>
            <li> the liner did&#x27;nt last longer, it fades after a couple of hours. won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the BEST. Slap on a primer and this baby lasts ALLLLL day. I&#x27;ve bought plenty of other eyeliners but due to my oily lids, they smudge super fast. This is the only one that gets everything right. The flexibility of the brush, the formula, everything. Buy!</li>
            <li> it couldn&#x27;t last more than one hour, then it blurs, but It&#x27;s thin enough</li>
            <li> This is the best Eyeliner I have every bought. Very easy to draw any type of thin or thick line. Very easy for beginners. And stays on almost all night as long as you don&#x27;t smudge it. I would recommend this to any of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Natalie</li>
            <li> very easy to apply and clean up later</li>
            <li> When it says &amp;#34;Master Precise,&amp;#34; it means it! It had a super pointy tip, and as I&#x27;m used to using a pencil eyeliner, it took a while for me to get used to the change. The only small downside is that because it&#x27;s super precise, the tip bends easily. However, the color is super dark and glides easily. You only have to wait a few seconds for it to dry, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is everything you would want and expect from your eyeliner. It stays on all day, it&#x27;s the right color, and it lasts forever! I am always hesitant to try makeup purchased online, but you should have no concerns purchasing this. What you see is what you get!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and quick for use</li>
            <li> I had been using gel for a while, but was sick of it. I wanted to try liquid again. I think this is one of the better drug store options. It is easy to apply and a nice dark black.</li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> Nice bold lines with good control through the tip, but if it comes in contact with ANY water say goodbye cat eye and hello smokey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear liquid eyeliner very often, but when I do I use this! It&#x27;s very easy to apply and looks great and lasts pretty long. I would use it with an eyelid primer to make it last longer</li>
            <li> This is one of the first liquid eye liners I&#x27;ve owned, and after trying several other drug store and beauty supply store brands, I&#x27;m back to get this one again. I wore this every day for months, and once I stopped wearing it daily, it did not dry up. This one eye liner lasted me about a year. Even after leaving it closed for weeks, I would come back to it and it would still work perfectly fine. It goes on very easily. The lines are smooth and precise. The liquid is not runny at all and you will most likely get a perfect line on your first try every time :) pretty water resistant, but not water proof.</li>
            <li> Omg awesome!!! Tip is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner. I ordered it and have used it once on a really hot humid day, seemed to stay in place. Would recommend especially as an add on item.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the bestttt.. its easy to use and does stay on all day. its a perfect eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t peel or something oily or fade like other eyeliners I&#x27;ve used its great. Your love this eyeliner too if u buy it.</li>
            <li> I onlt used the product a few times and it feel like it&#x27;s already running out of liquid in it. It&#x27;s pretty much unusable after a few uses. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Easy application, easy to remove if mistakes are made! Doesn&#x27;t clump up when wearing for long periods of time. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Way too thick! Not a smooth application.</li>
            <li> I really like this liquid eye liner- I am a novice to liquid and it is a bit hard not to mess up but if I take it slow it turns out great and last all day! Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> item arrived promptly however the ink is almost dried upon first application - not sure if it&#x27;s a defective one or just what I was expecting - I had to press very hard to get the ink to come out a little bit....</li>
            <li> I am happy to buy an excellent product in the speed of delivery thanks to the seller</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing! You can easily make a thin or thicker line. It has a consistent flow. Best of all, it stays on with one application!  I was even able to wear eye makeup in a pool, and after getting splashed in the face from my kids, it was completely in tact and no run. I will definitely repurchase! Great product for contact wearers</li>
            <li> Terrible! I have oily lids so I figured after 5-6 hours it would start transferring to my lower lids but for the price, I decided to give it a try. Ugh...bad mistake! After applying it, it was only 30 minutes and I looked like I had dark circles below my eyes and had worn the eyeliner all day! Never again! I want a refund!</li>
            <li> I love this. The best thing about this eyeliner is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge no matter how sweaty I am.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I got the hang of this liquid eyeliner.  (I&#x27;d never used a marker/brush tip before.)  It&#x27;s very easy to apply, neat, and quick.  Looks great and stays all day.</li>
            <li> SUPER BLACK very liquidy so be careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from my local target and loved it so I ordered a replacement on Amazon when I ran out. The shipping details show it as &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; but it has never come. :( I&#x27;ve filed a claim with UPS but still no luck. Great product - horrible experience.</li>
            <li> the liner - a felt-tip pen - excellent means for the Hollywood arrows. Shooters turn out equal and beautiful with little effort</li>
            <li> Woks the same as one that costs 40%  more, easy to use!</li>
            <li> WARNING: I love this product, but the last one I received appears to be counterfeit as the formulation and tip are completely different. I have used this product for years and what I received was NOTHING like the actual product.   This product is the best marker style liquid liner out there. I&#x27;ve tried everything - Stila&#x27;s, Kat Von D&#x27;s brand, and many other liquid, pencil and marker liners. This one is the best. It won&#x27;t crack, flake, or fade throughout the day. I didn&#x27;t like Stila&#x27;s because it was too shiny and even though it was waterproof, the salt water in your eyes still eats through it. Although this product isn&#x27;t waterproof it will last all day as long as you aren&#x27;t too teary and you don&#x27;t smudge it. Still, it&#x27;s great, and easy to apply. It goes on SUPER black and it won&#x27;t wipe itself away as you&#x27;re applying it like Kat Von D&#x27;s or Stila&#x27;s (think dry erase marker, when when you go over to catch a missed spot it rubs the other stuff away)</li>
            <li> Love the eyeliner, like a skinny marker..easy to apply (with a steady hand!) doesn&#x27;t smudge or get under my eyes throughout the day. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with my purchase, the product was delivered in time and it is easy to use. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner pen, but it seems to run out/dry up quickly, especially when applied over eyeshadow. However, this is the sharpest tip and draws a super precise, thin line.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, very dark. Matte for the most part.</li>
            <li> Love it! Stays on real good.</li>
            <li> This glides on so smooth , it&#x27;s extremely easy to use I Love it !!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with my eyelids, but I&#x27;m unable to keep any makeup on my face for more than a couple hours.  This stuff stayed put all day long.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye liner I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s very easy to apply. It remove it using coconut oil. It does not make my eye lashes thin out either.</li>
            <li> While the eyeliner itself is fine (nothing special), the lid kept coming off while the eye liner was in my makeup bag - I used it for about a week and a half before it dried up due to the lid not staying on - which is pretty much a waste to me.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite liquid eyeliner...it has the most amazing tip and unlike some liquid eyeliners it does not ooze out uncontrollably, its perfect control makes it easy even an amateur could use it....I have never noticed a dif in eyeliners except some last longer than others and some don&#x27;t apply on the water line but this goes on the waterline easily and I&#x27;d say the length of time it stays on for is pretty darn awesome....it&#x27;s very convenient for when I&#x27;m in a hurry for work, which is like always. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing for sure! Recommended!</li>
            <li> It wears off on my upper lids immediately.  This item is garbage to me.</li>
            <li> This works really well, the felt nub at the top has clean angles which makes even winged liner really easy. Great for on the go</li>
            <li> Not easy to use..like my conventional liquid one better</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this eyeliner for the rest of my life.  I stink at putting on liquid eyeliner, but this pen makes it totally easy.</li>
            <li> this is amazing!! it doesnt comeoff without remover! pefect perfect! it is a bit smaller than i thought but its awes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for the past few years.  Love the brand and the sharp lines.  Eyeliner lasts the whole day and is good for thinly lining my eyes and/or drawing bold cat eye.  Also removes easy at night w/ my face wash.  Generally cheaper in the stores, but I get lazy sometimes and like to buy it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have to honestly say that this is the best, finest and most precise liquid eyeliner out there on the market! I have done pencils, brushes, and other eyeliners-and this one tops them all! I used to use another major brand eyeliner and decided to try this one on a whim when my usual was out of stock. I am ever so thankful I made the switch! Maybelline New York Eye Precise gives you the absolute easiest application ever! I love doing a very thin winged-out eyeliner close to my lash line for my &amp;#34;wear-to-work&amp;#34; look and this delivers WITHOUT FAIL. I apply it with ease and the color payoff is very true-meaning one application is all I need! When I come home after work, my eyeliner hasn&#x27;t moved a single bit! For dates or notching up the drama, Maybelline New York Precise is just as consistent. You can draw out your liner without leaving those strange trace marks or gaps from lower quality liners. Need to fill in a spot you missed? Easy peasy to go back over your initial line. The tip is very fine, meaning this eyeliner does wonders for cosmetic art or really bold looks. I&#x27;ve literally thrown out all my other liners because this one works so wonderfully, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye, stays put all day, and works wonderfully for the price point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with these types of eyeliners because normally the tip would be too big but this is perfect! amazing for beginners!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner for about a week, and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance and ease of use! I like to do a small cateye on a daily basis and this liner makes my whole routine flow faster. The color is amiably dark, it goes on smoothly and without skipping just like the claims state, and the lines it creates are indeed very precise. It lasts all day, I very much appreciate it&#x27;s staying powder, and the waterproof aspect of it is very convenient. Although its staying power is worthy of praise, I find it comes off easily with my favorite makeup wipes. I used the Kat Von D Tatoo Liner in Trooper for a long time but this is a wonderful drugstore alternative, and it&#x27;s definitely worth the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This creates a dark line, does not move or smudge, and can be applied in varying thicknesses. That said I just cannot get the hang of using this pen. I use it mostly to fill in my bottom lash line now, as I can dot it between lashes and get very close to my lash line.</li>
            <li> The pencil has to sharp of a line, I prefer a softer look. I don&#x27;t like looking like a chola.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a dupe for the Stila Stay All Day Eyeliner. But this one just did not meet my standards. The pen tip was a bit too big to be 100% precise for me, because I like a really thin line. Also, this is not waterproof and has no staying power... it was flaking off after a few hours and other areas faded away to gray. It also started to dry out after a few weeks of use. Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> Make sure you realize this isn&#x27;t a waterproof before you buy it. It was super cheap as an add-on item, so I&#x27;m not mad that I bought it from the mistake of thinking it was waterproof. I will say it&#x27;s a little tricky to get a skinny line from this liner, so if that&#x27;s your thing I&#x27;d get a different liner.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye liner for the perfect thin black line.</li>
            <li> Excellent, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> This is really something that all women must have, easy to use, last longer and the quality OMG amazing,&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely keep buying when I&#x27;m run out of it!</li>
            <li> It smears off in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> Very easy to control the brush on this without the liquidy mess you get with some other liquid liners.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> Its not bad and its not great either. It all depends on what you use it for. It did not last very long on my eyes. I like the gel better.</li>
            <li> You will get a nice and precise line with this liner. Good for beginners. I give it a 4 star because it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it smudges</li>
            <li> I used the gel that lasts 24 hrs before trying this. My eyes water a lot and this ran.  I didn&#x27;t know how much it smudged and ran until my husband called me &amp;#34;Mommy Dearest.&amp;#34; It has a long pen tip and I like that.  The color is super black.  If your eyes don&#x27;t water much, this would be great for you. If you aren&#x27;t good at drawing a steady line, this is not the pe for you.</li>
            <li> Bought after seeing a positive review on YouTube. Works really great for cat-eye and strong upper lid</li>
            <li> I love it. This is the on;ly eyeliner I have been using for years. No smudging and easy to apply and remove. Stays put the whole day.</li>
            <li> love it it dosnt smuge and last a long time on also it has diffrent lenghts and thickness that u can applay it in</li>
            <li> I like it very much. it is easy to use, and everything is good just I wish if it is water proved because when I wash my face I find all over my face.​</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  I am not, my any means, a girly girl.  I never would have thought that I would wear liquid eye liner - I thought it would be too hard to use or too messy.  I was so wrong!  The Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner is fantastic!  It is not messy and it is so easy to use!  The tip can be used to make a very fine line on your eyelids or turned slightly on it&#x27;s side to create a thicker more dramatic line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this eyeliner lasts me about two months when used daily.  Sign up for subscribe and save to get an even better price.  This is the only eyeliner I will use and I cannot say enough good things about it.  It&#x27;s also great for getting that dramatic wingtip that is all over Pinterest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t run or fade throughout the day but does come off fairly easy with facial soap.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner ever made. They quit carrying it where im from which is typical everything they sell out of they stop carrying it.</li>
            <li> This is an ok eyeliner but for the price it&#x27;s exactly what I expected. I will warn that it takes a bit to dry so I usually set it with black shadow pretty quickly to prevent it from being all over my face. It&#x27;s great for someone who is inexperienced with liquid liner as it can be applied in a thin or thick line and is easy to remove. For someone who wears it daily I would go with something waterproof such as the stila pens or something along those lines. This one comes off very easily with water, sweat, rubbing, ect.</li>
            <li> Had a themed party to go to and this is great to do the 60&#x27;s pinup look.  It has a fine tip.  Fine enough to enhance my mole.</li>
            <li> So amazing &amp; Presice!</li>
            <li> This eye-liner smudges on me. I like Stila&#x27;s better, although it is pricier...</li>
            <li> A really great and easy to use liquid liner!!</li>
            <li> I used to use gel liner but bought this because I thought it would be an inexpensive option to get a fine point winged eye look. Seems to be working well, easy to use and you get a controllable flow of product. The price was reasonable and it shipped fast. It does stay in place if you use an eyeliner primer. Shipped fast. I would get this again, but I would be open to trying other products as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this liner, as I don&#x27;t have the steadiest hand, and this makes it so easy to line my upper lids. I can do a thin line, or a more thick dramatic &amp;#34;cat-eye&amp;#34; with ease. It has great staying power, lasts all day easily and doesn&#x27;t run/smudge. I occasionally use it as an under-eye liner, but it doesn&#x27;t really blend well, (which is perfect for upper lid.) The price seems to fluctuate, but I always get it when I am buying $25 worth of stuff &amp; it&#x27;s an add-on item. (Saves $3-5 from drug store prices this way.)</li>
            <li> Very nice eyeliner. Nice, thin applicator.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and lasts</li>
            <li> I like how thin this liner tip is.  I use it to put a thin line under my lower eyelashes to define but not overpower my eyes.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have my eyeliner tattooed on, but occasionally I want a little more for evening.  This is so much easier to apply than a pencil, and looks really professional.  It also goes over the tattooed areas smoothly.</li>
            <li> awesome eyeliner, does smear a bit onto upper eyelid though. but great for thin or thick precise lines!! will repurchase</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is much easier to put on than the kind with a wand, at least for me! I still goof sometimes because my hands just aren&#x27;t that steady but it goes on fairly easily for me. It smudges a little but I have found that to be the case with most liquid eyeliners. It has decent staying power. For the price, it&#x27;s good. Not the best out there but easy to use and works well!</li>
            <li> Best for your money. It is easy to get a straight line. Use it all the time and I love it!</li>
            <li> Comes on smooth and dark, love it</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to be triggering my skin itching like many eye makeup items do. So far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to my favorite Urban Decay liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Great for the starters!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite eyeliner. Allows for sharp wings and great control. Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Went on great, full color. Smudges easily.</li>
            <li> Love it! The point is very precise and the eyeliner comes out very easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> Comes out smoothly and consistently, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Precise, yes...but it doesn&#x27;t last by ANY means. It doesnt last on the wing or the upper eyelid. My first liquid liner so it&#x27;s good for practice but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Only eyeliner i&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> love it!! very precise!! I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I loooooved this eyeliner. It&#x27;s perfect for making the perfect winged liner look. Glides on and stays put. Will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Lasts all day and it&#x27;s precise indeed. Absolutely love it. Will be buying some more</li>
            <li> love how it glides on and easy to handle</li>
            <li> The tip is a bit long but irs a very good eyeliner pen for a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sucked at applying eyeliner since the first time I tried it in the 9th grade. Five years later, I decided to try the Stila Stay All Day eyeliner, and I instantly loved it for its ease in application. I decided to give this a shot after repurchasing the Stila liner twice. I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as good, but I figured it was worth a shot (this is $6, and Stila&#x27;s is $20). Well, I fell in love with this liner almost quicker than I did with the Stila one. Maybelline&#x27;s isn&#x27;t waterproof, but it still does an excellent job at staying put on my Asian eyelids. Today, I was out in the rain for two hours, and it still looks exactly like how it was when I first applied it seven hours ago! As long as you don&#x27;t rub it, it&#x27;ll stay put. I also think the Maybelline one has more pigmentation. The tip isn&#x27;t as narrow as Stila&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s still just as easy to create a classic winged look. I&#x27;m glad I found a cheaper drugstore alternative!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the color lasts all day, very seldom I need  retouch it.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> extremely happy with the tip,quality and how this eyeliner goes on and stays on</li>
            <li> I heard so many great things about this eyeliner that I decided to give it a try. A friend of mine even wore it and it looked great on her so I thought, why not. I wanted to love this product, I really did. I’m upset that I can’t be one of the many people out there who gave it 5 stars and swear by it. Unfortunately, the tip of the eyeliner dries out – like within 2 days. Without that tip staying wet and putting out product, the only part of the felt brush that works is the middle; which is great if you want a thick line or don’t mind using half the brush. It’s not worth it to me because you don’t get a precise line. So winged eyeliner or a thin line is out of the picture. Granted, this eyeliner does stay on until you wash it off. It seemed to hold up even when my eyes got watery from allergies. Some eyeliners run into the lashes and disappear the second water or tears hit it. This one stayed put. It also was not hard to wash off. Soap and water did the trick. It never smudged, but then again I never rubbed my eyes or anything. The color is not shiny like a lacquer but still pigmented. It was more on the matte side but still dark enough to show up without any streaks or missing spots of product. In the same breath, you can go over a line as many times as you want with this pen and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or scrape off the underlying product already on your eye. So you can layer up the product for added pigment and protection from rain, tears, etc. I just wish the tip didn&#x27;t dry out. There’s really no other way to use this eyeliner without the tip soaking up product/drying out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to create a winged eyeliner shape with this, however it&#x27;s not a nice, clean black line because it smears and it isn&#x27;t really a traditional liquid liner, it&#x27;s more like a fine tip marker.</li>
            <li> Fiancé says it is much easier to apply than others she has tried. Extra fine tip. Apparently they don&#x27;t make it in brown....</li>
            <li> It came super fast . &amp; works perfect love it</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner, it&#x27;s great for its price</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product- goes on easy , stays all day, dries instantly, doesn&#x27;t take a super steady hand</li>
            <li> Amazing quality. Goes on very smooth, this is my second one first one lasted me almost two months until I noticed it was starting to dry out so I purchased a second one. I like to wear eyeliner everyday but I wear it very thin to were you can&#x27;t really tell I have it on but makes my eyes look really nice like my eyelashes are thicker. So I like that I am able to get really get close to my lashes with the pointy design of the pen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little light and I need to go over my line over and over again to get it dark enough. Not true black. Use a primer I guess? That&#x27;s what I do.</li>
            <li> good for making precision lines</li>
            <li> I thought it would last a long time like what the other people said but after maybe 2-3 weeks it started to fade. It still works but it is not dark.</li>
            <li> I picked this eyeliner up one day at Walmart not expecting a great product, but I was wrong. This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! I use this every day now, I don&#x27;t even bother with other liners anymore. I like to wear a cat eye everyday, and I have shaky hands but it doesn&#x27;t even matter with this liner. It&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smudge (if you use primer. &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even smudge much at all without primer) and lasts all day. I&#x27;ve been the same pen for months and I still haven&#x27;t ran out of it! I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> hello fine fine the proces and buy il like a model for empled fine fine fine fine fine it likd</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and has lasted me quit a while now!</li>
            <li> The very fine brush is everything I was looking for in a liner.</li>
            <li> Glides on smooth and easy. Love it.</li>
            <li> The Perfect Cat Eye!! Thank-you!!</li>
            <li> GREAT eyeliner ever! It is so thin I am able to do a nice wing especially coming from a beginner that sucks at doing wings</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s precise I guess, but I&#x27;ve had better eyeliners where even if you apply some pressure the tip won&#x27;t get flattened like the Maybelline one. This eyeliner isn&#x27;t very smudge-proof either.</li>
            <li> First time using this pencil and love it!! Like the name. Its very precise and easy to use and I&#x27;m not good at applying eyeliner. :-)</li>
            <li> such a precise line. most of the eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried as liquid pen the tip dries out fairly fast. even after a few months use with this it hasn&#x27;t. will be buying again once it runs out.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely terrible at applying liquid eyeliner, but this one makes it easier than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.  It actually looks decent!  Product is long-lasting - makes it through the work day, but sometimes have to reapply in the evening if I&#x27;ve been touching my eyes too much.  It washes off fairly well without too much extra wiping.  I recommend this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> i like it . i apply liner daily and it does have a good sharp pointer .</li>
            <li> This is the greatest eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever owned! So easy to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t smear like others have. Definitely buy this. It also is so easy to wing it. I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it yet. But it looks nice.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smoothly and precisely, but it smudges if your eyes run with tears or eyedrops. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and it seems okay, didn&#x27;t hear any complaining about it.</li>
            <li> Have to get used to this.  I think I like the stiff end rather than the flex.</li>
            <li> It smears after 4 hours or so but overall its great. It just needs to be cleaned up a bit and reapplied.</li>
            <li> this is a very good  eyeliner for an older person.  It going on well and leaves a nice small line</li>
            <li> Product is good. But I bought two and both of them are damaged.....</li>
            <li> My favorite choice in eyeliner. Goes on smoothly and lasts for hours. Great applicator!</li>
            <li> Liquid liner to me comes down to a matter of tip preference, felt tip, brush, whatever. As a felt tip girl I can verify the line is very fine and gives nice control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the NYX curve ergonomic type liner and it was no superior to just the nice long handle and this one hasn&#x27;t run out on me yet. It helps that most of the liner stays on my face not wiped off on a q tip because it went everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fav liquid liner so far, plus you&#x27;re paying drugstore brand prices.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ as precise as advertised&lt;br /&gt;+ great for eyeliner beginners&lt;br /&gt;+ easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;+ long lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ (mostly) waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the tip frays (albeit infrequently)&lt;br /&gt;- not as quick dry as expected (I have to keep my eyes closed for anywhere from 15-30 seconds after applying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more than likely never going to purchase another eyeliner. If you&#x27;re looking for an easy to use liquid eyeliner, your search is over!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great eyeliner. Very easy and apply and quick drying. Once applied it stays put and doesn&#x27;t transfer. It&#x27;s a little tricky to remove and I would recommend an eye make up remover and it usually comes off completely.</li>
            <li> A great liquid eyeliner for begginners. This was the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve bought, and it works really well, looks great, is easy to apply, and stays on for hours! :)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite eyeliners. You have to shake it a bit between applications, but it goes on smoothly, and for me, it stays on throughout the day without smearing to the upper lid. At night, when I wash my face, it comes off without having to use a makeup remover. For me, this is the perfect eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever. I&#x27;ve been looking for a new one after I ran out and this is so amazing. Dark, precise lines. Easy to apply with the applicator. REALLY RECOMMENDED. Also it isn&#x27;t a brush tip, it&#x27;s felt so it&#x27;s super beginner friendly.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic eyeliner pen! The black is dark and opaque, it wears all day even on my oily eyelids, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes. I&#x27;m no pro with liquid liners but I found this very easy to apply in an even line. It doesn&#x27;t drag or pull at the skin and applies as smoothly as a gel liner. I prefer a more natural look with my liner and was able to pull off a very thin line with this, but you can also easily created thicker or winged liner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want this order plz!</li>
            <li> Love it works perfect.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect eyeliner for beginners.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner. It&#x27;s much more precise than the Stiletto eyeliner and is perfect for that winged look. Sure, maybe it&#x27;s not rub-proof but what do you expect from a 7 dollar eyeliner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that it runs out VERY quickly. I use it everyday (only a medium line on my top lid) and I usually have to get a new after about 2 weeks. I personally think that&#x27;s a little ridiculous, but its a small price to pay for the best cheap liquid eyeliner on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also a lot less messy than gel eyeliners or the kind that come in little bottles.</li>
            <li> Really pigmented, a nice rich black. The tip is easy to use and you always get a clean crisp line. The packaging is practical and convenient because you dont have to worry about spilling any of it and its really lightweight. The only con would be its durability and long lasting wear (or lack thereof). By hour 5, the edges are smudged and not as dark. It could be because I have oily-combination skin but even with eye primer it will smudge/fade.</li>
            <li> Creates a beautiful dark line with sharp edges, and I love the pen style. It does seem to smudge a bit throughout the day, but it&#x27;s not that bad (of course, I wish it wouldn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I didn&#x27;t believe that the tip would be as thin as I was hoping for. But this eyeliner is amazing, the felt tip is very fine and easy to control. The color goes on smooth and solid, I wear a cat eye daily and this liner is perfect!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!  Needed a more sturdy applicator tip, rather than the narrow brush type that is too flexible and doesn&#x27;t allow for as much control.  This fits the bill!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. I love liquid eyeliner but it is hell applying it. This is the best of both worlds. I love how it&#x27;s liquid in a pen form. It&#x27;s super easy to apply and it lasts all day! I have another eyeliner pen like this one which feels heavy on my eyelid and kind of causes irritation, but this one is great, lightweight with good pigmentation. You can do a thick wing or a thin one, it&#x27;s great! In my picture you can see what i&#x27;m talking about. It goes on darker with primer. I use elf&#x27;s face primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube. I work in an office and feel that make up is a requirement for appearing professional.  It is really the only make up I wear. I like that it goes on well, smoothly and accurately.  You can definitely do a cat eye with no problems.  But and this is a 2 sided but... it smears and rubs off. Which means that I might look like I&#x27;m no longer wearing makeup at the end of the day. But it also doesn&#x27;t look like I have a black eye in the morning. I&#x27;m not high on makeup maintenence so I see the no black eyes in the morning as way better than the rub off.</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner. Super easy to apply. The only bad thing is that it ran out quick. Also applying it once you already have the eye shadow on messes up the eyeliner tip.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! Its just what I expected! I&#x27;m still trying to learn how to do the wing, but for now I&#x27;m just going to use it for my waterline.</li>
            <li> Very black and glides on but... It never dries, wipe your eye and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> I owned this eyeliner for two weeks and loved it when it worked, but it dried out. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> very easy to look like a panda</li>
            <li> It lasts long on the eyes so its makes it more worth it. The color is lovely to look at.</li>
            <li> when my old eye liner was discontinued..the search was on. this still isn&#x27;t as good as my old one but it is a very close second. it isn&#x27;t as good because i like to line my lower lid inside the lash line. this doesn&#x27;t hold up in that area, but is excellent outside the lash line. very precise for that cat eye look if you are into that.</li>
            <li> I like it. Very dark, intense and bold black. Has a nice soft, yet sturdy tip.</li>
            <li> This product was excelent the firts month that buy it but now no works very good .</li>
            <li> I love this the tip is so small you can make any design, don&#x27;t know how I lived my life without it.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented love it</li>
            <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s so easy to use. Without this product, I would not be able to wear liquid eyeliner because I&#x27;m so horrible at applying it. I was even able to do a &amp;#34;winged&amp;#34; thing! The color is great and it applies smoothly. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great control. Make fine or thick lines.</li>
            <li> Love it. Thin, precise, very black (just how I like it), lasting, easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The application is smooth and easy but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  I find myself having to reapply a few times a day even using a primer.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of smudge. But in general it is good.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. Probably the best liquid eyeliner I have used. It doesn&#x27;t dry out fast, and I can apply this with precision. Great for winged or cat eyes.</li>
            <li> Great! If u know how to use it works as best as Mac or sephora products but I lot cheaper great color</li>
            <li> was really surprised. Works well, nice and dark and super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> really love this product. darker than expected but easy to handle and great for those cat eye make-up looks or any top eyeliner look from regular to pin-up style</li>
            <li> Amazing felt-tip pen eyeliner. The color is very dark and is very easy yo apply.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Favorite eyeliner. Brush pen-like felt tip makes it super easy to apply, fill in spaces and to create anything from subtle and thin to dramatic and thick looks, especially wings. Make sure the cap is on tight however because I feel it may dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> My previous purchase of this product was 10x better...idk, this one might be  old or something.</li>
            <li> Really great eyeliner. I&#x27;ve had it a couple months now and while I don&#x27;t use it that often, it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of drying out, which is wonderful. It also makes a really dark line and is easier for me to use than some other liquid liners.</li>
            <li> It dried up after about a month.</li>
            <li> The felt tip sometimes is bothersome to use over eyeshadow, especially if you have layered colour to build a certain look. In this case, go for the maybelline gel liner.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for drawing liner shapes and fine lines(when steady and careful). I use it to outline and fill in the details with the gel liner from maybelline (blackest black)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I am legally blind and I can actually apply it, I had quit wearing eyeliner because I could not see good enough to put it on, I know its not perfect sometimes but everyone has been telling me how great I look, I really love this product, saw on commercial and could not find in any local drug store or Walmart and its really hard for me to find stuff anyway, I have to use a magnifying glass but at least it works.  I love the product because it accents your eyes and it doesn&#x27;t smear everywhere un less of course you rub your eyes real hard but that is your fault not the product.  Just saying I really  do love it and will continue to wear it.  I wear mostly Mary Kay but Maybelline is great on this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Doesn&#x27;t smudge .</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and dark.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> very good product. I love it. and vey cheap.</li>
            <li> very nice. I am a beginner, and its very convenient to use</li>
            <li> I got sent 2 of these! :D This eyeliner surprisingly stays on really well!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is really easy to control, you can draw eye-line in what shape or thickness you like really easy. I think it is better than a brush eye liner. I just received it today and I am not sure about its durability. I will let you know later.</li>
            <li> It is okay. Good condition.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. it&#x27;s the best, it doesn&#x27;t smudge, it&#x27;s really dark. the best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t cost much. it&#x27;s so easy for me to apply this onto my eyelids. I recommended to everyone</li>
            <li> I only put this on once and it automatically became my favorite eyeliner the application is phenomenal and precise if you like sharp cat eye liner then definitely get this. I also didn&#x27;t know two liners came in the package so that was a wonderful surprise. I&#x27;m probably going to buy more later too~</li>
            <li> This liner makes quite a fine line! And, you can hold it just like a pen. BUT, I find that not enough of the liner ink comes through the applicator so while you get a fine line, you don&#x27;t get a dark line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve tried numerous tricks to get more ink to come out. I&#x27;ve tried storing it upside down. I&#x27;ve tried putting it under running water. It still won&#x27;t line one entire eye! I use this one to outline the cat-eye that I go back and color in with a darker but less precise liner. Is it worth it? I&#x27;m not sure. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use a lot of high end make up but this is my go to eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner!! Can do it all, thick, thin, cat eye, whatever your little hear desires.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of liquid eyeliners, but they do not go on smooth and will dry out at the tips.  As soon as I got it I tried it.  No shaking or dabbing the tip required.  It works as soon as you take off the cap.  It looks like a long tapered felt pen.  It goes on smoothly and I can make a nice tapered line across my lid.  Really happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great But the point it a little to thin for me. Package box was ok. Shipling took about a week. And its waterproof so thats good</li>
            <li> You have to go over the line a few times to make the liner full on opaque black. Once you do that it&#x27;s pretty good. Long lasting and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Very thin and precise. I still prefer Revlon&#x27;s liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper, completely black and matte, and works a hundred times better!</li>
            <li> very easy to apply. water resistant</li>
            <li> I am giving this product only 3 stars because, I left the top off for about a half day, by mistake, and the eyeliner dried up.  I had only used the product about 8 times. I was pleased with the coverage, and the beautiful glide of the pen, however, I cant believe the whole bottle was ruined, b/c I left the top off for such a short time.  I will probably order again, since the color was dark like I love, and had that wet look, like I love.</li>
            <li> I like this liner, the way it applies, but notice that it comes off very easy on my upper lid.  Other than that, I like how easily it applies, and I can smudge it with an eye liner brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stays on well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 days,  and not only do the wings on the corners of my eyes smudge if my eyes get watery,  but the ink doesn&#x27;t flow out at the very tip,  where you need it. Sure,  it&#x27;ll flow out fine in the *middle * of the brush,  but not really at the end. I would Not recommend. I feel like I just wasted my money. :(</li>
            <li> personallt just like a pencil better</li>
            <li> Runs out if you use daily but other than that it is great (:</li>
            <li> I loved it, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> My sister love the maybelline new York liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This smudged off within an hour, and I had black lines under my eyebrows! Then when I went to take it off, it stuck, even with cold cream, which lifts off my waterproof mascara. I&#x27;ve used maybelline eyeliner for years, but this one is garbage.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply because it&#x27;s like a marker and it&#x27;s very long lasting. It&#x27;s also really dark. It&#x27;s not too runny or too dry.</li>
            <li> Smudges very easily. Would not buy again. I&#x27;ll stick to my Maybelline stiletto!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the eye liner !</li>
            <li> Goes on well. like it</li>
            <li> This stayed on all day without fading. I love the tip to this pen, it makes it easy to make perfect lines.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great and it gives a fine line for extra detail.  That being said the eyeliner is very precise and thin lines will get absorbed into the fine creases of my eyelid.  I find myself having to go back several times to make the lines look perfect.  The color is very bold and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  I recommend this product for those with a steady hand.</li>
            <li> i love it and would totally buy it again. i&#x27;m a fan of the maybelline eyeliners. after using the stilleto, switching to this makes me wanna quit the other one forever.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner by FAR&lt;br /&gt;you can easily make a very thin, fine line that is barely visible but adds just a bit of depth to your lashes&lt;br /&gt;OR you could do a thick, 60s style line with the same product!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t run as long as you keep the liner in a cup tip up. I kept it on the counter for a while (horizontally), and then the tip got too saturated causing me to put too thick of a layer on that ran in the heat (I was in high humidity at the time as well).&lt;br /&gt;Once I moved to lower humidity and started keeping the liner in a make-up jar with the tip up, I never had it run. Always applies perfectly</li>
            <li> Like this liquid eyeliner.  Doesn&#x27;t smear or flake off.  Stays on and looks great.</li>
            <li> My daughter really liked the</li>
            <li> dried out super quick.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It is easy to apply due the very fine tip and thicker base. Makes cat eyes super easy and wears extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously in love with this product. I&#x27;ve tried doing liner with angled brushes and with the smaller pen applicators, and just can&#x27;t ge the knack of it. I have a serious case of shaky-hands, but this long pen with fine tip makes applying eyeliner easier than ever before. I can now do wings in just a few seconds! Love it and will be buying a bazillion more.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is fantastic. You can go super thin with this pen. Its perfect!</li>
            <li> Not quite as great as Stila, but it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve come to finding a cheaper version. The felt point is great, the eyeliner glides on, and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> The skinny point helps me to get the eyeliner where I want it.  It&#x27;s so tiny that I worry about it running out; but I do have a bottle of black liquid liner on hand, and when this runs out, I will still use this point with the liquid liner that I have.</li>
            <li> I love it, is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to point out for the record that I am not a fancy make-up person.  I have been terrified to use liquid liner for the reasons of getting the cat-eye correct, and smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner has changed my view on liquid liner.  To a novice like me, I can make a cat-eye like a champ with this.  Once it dries, it is not going anywhere.  I will tell you that I do NOT wear it on my lower eye; only the top. I do feel like after a few hours, it might would smudge on the bottom, because I am constantly trying to get my contacts to stop moving around in my eyeballs.  But that is on me, not the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner is extremely precise, and I am no longer terrified to use liquid liner.  I will never go back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve been using it from a long time.</li>
            <li> PERFECT. Allows you to draw the most perfect wings. Might want to use an eyeliner gel to keep it in place if you plan on using all day long or if you plan on crying.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to use for Halloween makeup.  Ended up using it on my eyes and around my mouth.  Stays put and lasted all day!</li>
            <li> I have tried liquid eyeliner in the past with little success, so I was a bit nervous to try this. I had heard many great things about it, so I decided to give it a try. If you are not an eyeliner expert, it will take a very steady hand and some practice, but it CAN be done! I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks and I think I have it mastered. It&#x27;s quite easy to use, has an extremely fine point, and distributes color evenly. It also stays on extremely well, but isn&#x27;t impossible to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love it! Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Product just glides on.  Applicator tip is nice and fine so you can make a great thin &amp;#34;close to the eyelashes&amp;#34; line.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drug store brand marker eyeliner pen. Supper easy to apply, very black, and stays put. And cheap!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS EYELINER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip is firm enough that you have control, very dark, and dries matte so it looks like gel eyeliner. The tip is not quite as thin as they show in the ads/commercials, but you have very good control of the application. PERFECT PRODUCT. Would 100% recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it to line the entire eye,  only the waterline of 1/3 of the eye.  It brings out added dimension to my eyes without turning me into a vampire or somebody fresh out of an Egyptian tomb.</li>
            <li> Item dried up really fast.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth application.</li>
            <li> Great price; easy to apply.  Arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> not open yet but i hope is good</li>
            <li> It is not the best eyeliner, but it is decent for the price. Nothing specifically bad or good about it. It dried up relatively quickly. I&#x27;d buy it for quick eye makeup but not for big parties and wedding parties or so. It fades easily if you sweat around your eyes (dancing?)... the color isn&#x27;t too intense either. DECENT.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot. It took some practice as I had no experience with liquid liners. Found a quick tutorial video and have been a fan since. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These are my all time favorite drugstore eyeliner and when my drugstore run out I had to order them online (take note I&#x27;m from the Caribbean). This eyeliner is perfect for drawing in your winged tip shapes ,the color is rich black.it hardly ever smudges and it lasts for pretty long hours (wish it were longer though) .No other drugstore brand compares.</li>
            <li> This I like a lot. A very fine line if that is what you are looking for. However I hope that this comes out in Waterproof. I was unable to find the waterproof in this liner. I wear contacts, so on occasion I add tears to my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I never have experience with eyeliners before. I read some comment about how difficult to use it, which made me nervous for a while. However finally I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; It turned out to be a right decision. I&#x27;ll buy again when mine runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Pointed felt tip makes precise lines (may depends on the users)&lt;br /&gt;- Possible to control the intensive like painting with ink and brush on paper lol (I love this)&lt;br /&gt;- Still good, strong, consistent after months of frequent use (3-4 times a week, ~4 months already)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: they&#x27; re not actually cons, though. But I think some people will consider these as cons.&lt;br /&gt; - Don&#x27;t rub your eyes. It&#x27;s will smear&lt;br /&gt; - Try not to touch the eyelashes. If the ink gets on the eyelashes, when you blink, they will print down on the skin under your eyes &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; I blink several times to check, if it happens, I simply clear it with a Q-tip and makeup removal.</li>
            <li> i like the fact that it&#x27;s pointy and it&#x27;s easy to glide but after hours of wearing, it smudge on your eyes specially on the top eye. if i were you, just buy the water-proof eyeliner of maybelline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not this eyeliner&#x27;s biggest fan.  Though I love the pen idea (it&#x27;s very much a dupe for MAC&#x27;s Penultimate liner) and it works great with a continuous stream of product, the liner product itself is VERY poorly made.  It tends to run within a half hour of me putting it on and does not stop throughout the day.  Every hour or so I find a new smudge of black under my eyes and sometimes even back onto my temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money on this one and go with the L&#x27;Oreal Lineur Intense liquid liner instead - it still has a felt tip for easy application and dries to a crisp matte finish, without running throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My new favorite eyeliner!! I have subscribed to auto-ship.</li>
            <li> Great fine point! Buying again. On par with more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> So far so good, really easy to use</li>
            <li> I loved the product and bought it on a whim since I needed eyeliner before work and didn&#x27;t have any with me at the time. Used it and loved instantly how smooth and thin to thick I could make my eyeliner. Especially the wings, it never made drawing a thin line so easy and fixing up any mistakes to even it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give this eyeliner a 5, but I have noticed it smudging and transferring after only 3-4 hours at my part time job, powder does the trick sometimes. But, when I start to tear a bit from yawning, its a smudging mess. My loreal and maybelline stiletto barely smudge when water comes into play. Strange how it stays on sometimes, but great product nonetheless. The tip can get dry.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Wish I found this years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a great liner for cat eyes!</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat tricky eyeliner to master, but when you achieve the right hold, it is super effective and quick. Great color and staying power!</li>
            <li> I usually use Stila&#x27;s eyeliner pens, or MAC boot black liquid eyeliner... Both of which cost around $20 bucks. This eyeliner is worthy of the same ranks in my book. The liner lasts all day... Not waterproof, but that is sometimes better when you need to make corrections. I&#x27;m still loyal to my Stila and MAC, but I&#x27;ll definetlly be buying more of these to have spares available.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Stila&#x27;s waterproof eyeliner, so when my wallet emptied I had to resort to a cheaper option. This eyeliner is great for about two weeks. Then it dries out super fast. After that, the end begins to fray-- a pet peeve of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using liquid eyeliner for years and this is not even close to my favorite. I will return to Stila&#x27;s-- it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner is the best! It&#x27;s so easy to use like a pen. It&#x27;s very accurate unlike other liquid eyeliners that have the brush separate from the liquid, I like that it&#x27;s all in one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge, which I like. But I find the formula a bit sheer, I would have to go over it a few time before it&#x27;s the perfect black. But besides that, it stays on great and it&#x27;s cheap. But if you&#x27;re caught in the rain without an umbrella, it tends to &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; your eyes. Like if you try and wash it off with just water, it&#x27;ll smudge around your eye and &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; into your skin. I recommend never do that, and just stick to makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I like the very thin eyeliner look but this felt tip was a bit harder to maneuver for that. Unlike my other experiences with felt liners where it gets worse after more uses, I found that the product went on much smoother after awhile. So if you like the thick, wet, liquid eyeliner look, this is the one for you but if you are looking for a softer touch, this may not be your best bet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of liquid eyeliner pens, because they&#x27;re the easiest to get the cat eye flick. I&#x27;ve tried several so far, especially some of the top sellers/most recommended: Stila Stay All Day Waterproof, Nars Eyeliner Stylo, Kat Von D Tattoo, Eyeko Skinny, Revlon Colorstay, Marc Jacobs, Maybelline Line Stiletto, Wet &#x27;n Wild...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this one. With the exception of Eyeko (which I also love), this eyeliner was the only one that has stayed on without smudging for as long as it did on my oily lids. If it can stay on my oily lids, I&#x27;m sure it can last on other skin types as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ...</li>
            <li> Looks smaller in person</li>
            <li> This liner goes on very easily and doesn&#x27;t cake up. Big pro in my book.&lt;br /&gt;My con - halfway through the day, I had liner on the top of my lids because I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Had hoped that this would have longer staying power.&lt;br /&gt;BUT when you combine the price, the easy of use and the level of precision you can get from this - its a winner.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and dries quickly. I had to rub some mascara off right next to the end of the line on my outer eye and it didn&#x27;t budge even though I had only put it on a few minutes before. Love the color and it gives as clean a line as a steady hand will provide. No feathering like I&#x27;ve experienced with other liquids.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner dried out within 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liner. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Will forever be my favorite eyeliner of all time! This thing is black and I mean the blackest black. The tip is so fine it&#x27;s easy to do winged eyeliner with this. Definetly reccomend!</li>
            <li> I tried this eyeliner for the first time yesterday and I was so annoyed. Immediately after opening, my hands were stained with the black inky liquid that would NOT come off until I washed my hands. Not exactly where I wanted the eyeliner to end up. After applying, it was so drying that it dragged across my lid leaving a blotchy effect that I didn&#x27;t like. Yes, it is \\&quot;precise\\&quot; but its too drying. More like a stain than a liner. The price was a little steep too compared to other brands. If you&#x27;re a Maybelline fan stick with lash stiletto- if you&#x27;re open to other brands, stick with Loreal&#x27;s classic liquid liner.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and I am hooked!! I love this more that the Tarte liner!!</li>
            <li> the product arrive at excellents condicion</li>
            <li> Stiff tip makes it difficult to get a thick line, and thin line is just too thin</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a liquid eyeliner. It draws on well, does not smudge like the pencil liners I was using before, and basically beats my pencil liners in every way possible! It has good stain power (very black) and has a small tip so you have control to make the line either thin or thick. I have had this product for 7 months now and use it every once in awhile. Still working! (though for hygiene reasons I should probably toss this one out and purchase another one..). Will repurchase again!</li>
            <li> The packaging is perfect, very easy to hold in your hand. The formula is long wearing, doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge. The color is ULTRA DARK. The felt tip makes it very easy to apply and you can customize the line (thick or super fine), and allows you to be very precise in your application.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and I would totally recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a liquid liner. I choose this over high end liquid liners regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now. It stays on all day and it&#x27;s easy to wash out but I think they dry out kind of fast. I always have to tap the top on my vanity to get more product out.</li>
            <li> If you want something that gives you raccoon eyes after just a couple of hours, then buy this product. Not the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> This product gives some irritation but it is only due to leaving it over night, sometimes I don&#x27;t bother to wash my face or the eye makeup area. But this my third purchase. I almost use it every day that I need to reorder every month and half.</li>
            <li> So sad to say that I was a bit disappointed  :(  Love the idea, application is nice and easy...but product is a little watery and smudges throughout the day.  Doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.</li>
            <li> I like the accuracy of this eyeliner. It resembles a felt tip pen, nice and stiff. I&#x27;ve had it for months and use it every couple days, and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does usually take going over twice to get a super black line, and I have to sit with my eyes closed while it dries if I do a thicker line on my upper lid. If I dont, it smudges on to the top of my lid. I don&#x27;t have hooded eyes, so I don&#x27;t know why this happens. Sometimes it even happens after letting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great starter liquid eyeliner, but I&#x27;ll probably try a different brand once it runs out.</li>
            <li> Great cheaper substitute for stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner. Smudges a little but stays on (almost too well)....doesn&#x27;t wash away completely with just facial cleanser and water.  I wear on my top eyelid and after washing my face, some transferred down to my lower lid and ended up having raccoon eyes...need eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> So easy to use! And I&#x27;m really dumb when it comes to makeup application. I love how dark it is, and it&#x27;s thicker than other eye liners I&#x27;ve used, too.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner is my favorite! Great precision and goes on smooth. It&#x27;s almost like a combination of a liquid and a cream liner. That means little drying time and less risk for smudges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have eyeliner on and always winged out. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with smudging or running liner.</li>
            <li> The products runs really easy and the felt tip is really hard. When you apply the second coat, you need to wait until the first coat dries otherwise is going to leave a blank spot... and it takes too long to dry. I&#x27;ll probably pass it to my sister and see if it works for her, for me is a no go.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! Just like Stila eyeliner http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0031NNE56/ref&#x3D;twister_B004AGJXIK but at a fraction of the price.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as Stila but for the price, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy. The only drawback is it does need to be reapplied during the day.</li>
            <li> Now I just need to get better with applying this eyeliner, but it shows up dark, lasts all day.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smudges and fades easily, not water resistant</li>
            <li> Love this liner. Even for someone without a steady hand it always gives a wonderful line.</li>
            <li> Wish it glides on thicker. Have to go over the same line a few times.</li>
            <li> Finally, an eyeliner I can controll.  Makes me into an artist!  I can go with a think line or bolder, making the lines around my eyes thicker.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday for school. its so much easier and lasts for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product. It iss easy to apply, look good, I can easily remove a tiny portion with a damp q-tip if I made a mistake. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and does not smudge off!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to find a cheap alternative to Stila, but this did not work for me. I don&#x27;t have oily skin, and yet, Maybelline smudges after a couple hours of wearing it. For me, it transfers to the top of my eyelid, which is annoying to say the least. Stila never did this. Plus, the tip isn&#x27;t as fine as the Stila one, so it&#x27;s harder to make cat eyes. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this eyeliner and I&#x27;m not sure how everyone has such luck with it lasting all day...!</li>
            <li> The application is very smooth and the fine tip is great. It goes on well but smudges easily and you will look like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s pretty decent. Comes out with a bang the first 5-7 uses but then kinda lackluster after. The fine tip on the end doesn&#x27;t hold over time for the wing liner look. Spend the extra $$ on a Stila eye liner, loads better.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use , perfect quality</li>
            <li> Great &#x27;tight liner&#x27;.  Smooth application.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Good for like a week...</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again. It has good pigment. But isn&#x27;t sweat proof nor waterproof! My cheeks were black after sweating.</li>
            <li> love this eyeliner! I&#x27;m so glad I found it because I can never keep my hand steady enough to draw my liner before, I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This will officially be my eyeliner from now on.  Previous ones I have tried seem to pick up eyeshadow then stop working.  I have been using this one for a few months and it still works great, and I use it almost every day.  The pen shape also makes it really easy to use and get the line how you want it.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is not as good as other brands, however it is useful</li>
            <li> loooovve this, omg it is sooo amazing i didn&#x27;t expect it to be this awesome, get it!! i promise you won&#x27;t regret it at all</li>
            <li> The brush is stiff and very precise, as advertised. It&#x27;s nice to be able to draw such a thin line direcy above my lash line. Produces flexible, inky liquid.</li>
            <li> The liner part was very tall, but I love the color it comes out with, very dark. Must buy!</li>
            <li> I loved this eyeliner! The applicator is great for beginners who are new to the cat eye. This eyeliner isn&#x27;t all that long lasting but it&#x27;s great for the price and I don&#x27;t really like waterproof liners anyways so this works great for me</li>
            <li> Info About Me: 23 yrs old, I have oily skin, including oily lids and naturally tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;This eye liner is okay. I&#x27;d been religiously using the Stila Stay All Day Liquid Liner in Black religiously for several years and wanted to find a cheaper alternative since those are about $21.00-$22.00 each and the expense was racking up.  I tried this as an add-on.  I also tried the Kat von D Tattoo Liner, which I like and it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper than the Stila one.  I would give this 4 stars instead of 3 because of the price, but people be warned: this eyeliner migrates, even with a primer like the UD Primer Potion.  I wear eyeliner every day and NEVER did the Stila/Kat Von D end up under my eyes by the end of the day.  One day of mildly laborous work (a lot of work) and this stuff was embarrassingly smudged under my eyes.  Color pay off also isn&#x27;t as pigmented but it&#x27;s certainly not bad.  I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the Kat Von D Tattoo Liner--this one isn&#x27;t for me but if makeup doesn&#x27;t smudge on you, definitely give this a shot.  I&#x27;m not going to anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been frightened of liquid liner because my hand is not all that steady. But I adore the vintage cat eye look. This is perfect for people like me. At first I was frightened it would dry out but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, once or twice a week, with no sign of it drying out. It&#x27;s going to be my go to liner from now on. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was able to line my eyes so easily i almost can&#x27;t believe it haha also its a nice black thin line and not too shiny. only con was that its not smudge proof or waterproof but i don&#x27;t mind that</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t smear once it&#x27;s dry. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I always use this liner and its great as expected</li>
            <li> I prefer marker eye liners when it comes to applying a cat eye. This felt liner wiggles- it isn&#x27;t like a pen, more like a flexible paintbrush. Now, I am not anywhere near sophisticated with makeup, but I can apply a cat eye with no problem. I just prefer something a little more stable.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other eyeliner!  Doesn&#x27;t smudge or run.  And at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I would recommend this product to beginners and pros. This liner will stay put on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Totally loved it! Gifted it to my sis and I&#x27;m buying one again! It applies perfectly on my eyes and its so smooth that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m applying it at all.</li>
            <li> love it. compares to the stila felt eye pencil in wear and dark color. will buy again. only downside is that it can be easily overdone with the flick of your wrist (seriously)</li>
            <li> It only lasted me less then a  month. It dries out very fast and over all I&#x27;m just not happy with this product. But it&#x27;s pretty cheap so I guess it&#x27;s worth the price. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The black is bold, and the application is super smooth.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the $18 waterproof eyeliner I bought from Lauren Taylor at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeliner due to the feedback it had and I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with it.  It is sporadic in use.  Sometimes the liquid comes out easily and bold.  Sometimes the liquid comes out gray and faded.  Sometimes it starts out bold and ample and then goes away.... I&#x27;m constantly shaking this and hoping it will make it comes out.  When it comes out, it is awesome but expect to shake it a lot and think &amp;#34;I just bought this... it CAN&#x27;T be dried up yet!&amp;#34; a lot.</li>
            <li> Not something for beginners, it took me a while to master how to apply this eyeliner but once you do, its pretty good. The color is very black and opaque and a must have for those who like felt tip eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Does not spear. Nice and durable. Love it</li>
            <li> The precision point is great! The staying power? Not so much. Definitely dries to a darker grey rather than a black, and then it fades even lighter quickly. I do like that it gives me a great starting point for my wing and I can go over it with a darker liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of high and low-end eyeliners, and this one is one of my favorites. Flows well, doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just became my new go-to liner even lines, perfect point, easy application. Im in love :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a replacement for the more expensive eye liner I&#x27;ve been using...but this isn&#x27;t it. It looks ok, but just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly or last as long as Kat Von D&#x27;s Tattoo liner.</li>
            <li> Precise line, but smudges throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m looking like a racoon if I wear it for longer than just an 8 hr. work shift.</li>
            <li> This eye liner works best for the upper eye line. On the lower eye line I feel like I have to pull on my eye and press for the black ink to show nicely.</li>
            <li> BEST liquid eyeliner on the market!!! TRUST me I have searched and searched all kinds but this stuff stays put and is a rich dark black and the tip is perfect for the cateye -- YOU will not regret buying this.. In fact, I buy in twos so I never run out! EVEN the expensive stuff doesn&#x27;t hold up against this awesome liner!</li>
            <li> I was tired of constantly having to wipe under my eyes to rub off eyeliner as the day wore on so I searched high and low for an easy to apply liquid eyeliner that stays put. I found it in Maybelline New York Eye Studio Precise Liquid Eyeliner! I&#x27;m so happy I found this - I love the chunky size - it makes it easier for me to hold steady. I can swipe this on in the mornings and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> LOVE this liquid eyeliner. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Since I discovered this in October 2013, I have used it ever since. I use MAC&#x27;s black pod and then go over it with this to add a defined wing and perfect the look. Lasts long and if I wear it to sleep and need a quick touch up it goes over old eyeliner very well.</li>
            <li> I see why this eyeliner got such good ratings!  I used to use L&#x27;Oreal eyeliner, but this stuff is awesome!  does not smudge or come off at all and so easy to put on.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever owned, it&#x27;s beautiful and the sharp tip really allows for beginners to better shape their eyeliner, it&#x27;s not easy to make mistakes with this one!</li>
            <li> AWESOME FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Rubs off on underneath the eyes</li>
            <li> I switched to this product recently because I found that the color is darker and the felt tip does not ware out as easily.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product!  For one week it worked great - very fine lines and then the next week it dried up!  It must be old product, would like to return but the return product section wont let me.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a bit of an eyeliner connoisseur and, for the price, this is not bad.  It&#x27;s easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t smudge too badly by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just received an old one, but this stuff is HORRIBLE! I feel like I have to pull my eyelids with it in order for the color to even come out onto my lids. The tip that is so small, does not give out any color what-so-ever, only the thicker area when pressed really hard. My worst purchase ever in terms of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner!  Very easy to control putting it on.  It&#x27;s my go to liquid eyeliners.  I cannot recommended it more highly!</li>
            <li> I had an ELF ink liner I used to adore. This is a close second because it is not as inky as the ELF version and I thought it was a bit of expensive since I have to reapply it during the course of a 8 hour day. It does make winged liner a breeze.</li>
            <li> The tip gets a little dry when drawing the line, but super dark and precise. I really like it, is a good product.</li>
            <li> Delivered  on time, it&#x27;s a very good eyeliner I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love my eyeliners but am a low maintenance girl. So I need something that is easy to apply with my clumsy hands and sometime that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a cheap clown. I normally have multiple different tubes from different companies at a time. But since ordering this one, it has been my go to eyeliner every morning. It is really easy to apply with NO mess and it last ALL day. Seriously. I have fallen asleep after a long day and woke up to gorgeous lines. I will definitely be ordering more to stash in my purse and various other places for emergencies.</li>
            <li> I must have got a dry one because it&#x27;s NOTHING like the commercials (dark, easy to apply) Mine is like faded and isn&#x27;t as black.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day even without primer. It has a bit of shine to it so if you like a matte finish you may want to apply an eyeshadow or another pencil on top.</li>
            <li> I bought two. But they are not smooth at all and the tips is always very dry. Whats more when you got tears on it(not too much), you will become a panda.</li>
            <li> Very easy to get a clean line &amp; wing.</li>
            <li> Good product. Stays pretty much all day and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Does not melt under eyes for that racoon look</li>
            <li> My Kat Von D tattoo liner ran out and ive been too busy to get another one, and i actually have this and the urban decay liquid liner at home and i find myself reaching for this liner wayyyy more than my urban decay. its a great liner for such low cost!! i def recommend it</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great for beginners who are just learning how to use liquid liner or trying out a cat eye/winged look. The color payout is great for the first 3 hours or so. However, this product does fade throughout the day, even with eye primer. I started with this product, but now I use Revlon Colorstay Eyeliner (crayon eyeliner) to draw my cat eye because it lasts longer and is more resistant to smudges. While I don&#x27;t dislike this Precise Liquid Eyeliner enough to rate it lower than 3 stars, I have a feeling that you can find a longer lasting product. (Example: I swatched Stila All-Day Liquid Liner on my hand and It didn&#x27;t come off until the next day, which included a shower and plenty of time washing my hands.)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! It is easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little darker, but other than that, its a great product. Easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is nice. It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin. Love the dark color, however, I&#x27;m not sure I will ever get the hang of liquid eyeliner. But for something that I&#x27;m thinking twice of using, this is pretty comfortable!</li>
            <li> So far this is the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve come across next to Milani&#x27;s infinite liquid eyeliner.  (It truly stays put!) This pen has a much nicer soft, straight, felt tip! It&#x27;s so easy to make the perfect line and lasts all day. I can&#x27;t draw a straight, perfect line very well so I&#x27;ve found that turning this pen at an angle and lightly pressing the tip even along the top of lash line gives me a perfect thin line. Then I can go back over it if I want it thicker or darker. Also it dries fast so I don&#x27;t have to wait more then a few seconds before opening my eye. I do have somewhat hooded eyes and this pen works great for me and lasts all day.  I also have oily lids but I use a eyeshadow primer by Shany. I&#x27;ve bought 4 of these pens and 1 seems to lasts me about 4+ months! I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the lid coming off on its own like I do with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s infallible the super slim liquid eyeliner.  It&#x27;s lid falls off and won&#x27;t click on like this eyeliner. I do recommend this liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> SO so so easy to apply. Definitely recommended for beginners and for those who want to master &amp;#34;the wing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Absoloute favorite eyeliner! It will give you the same, clean look every time. Unlike standard eyeliners, this one does not lose shape.</li>
            <li> I try to experiment. From the expensive &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brands, to the basic sharpened pencil, but for a precise, defined line, this can&#x27;t be beat, and so I always come back. Great staying power, you can make it as thick or as thin as you&#x27;d like. Not meant for the water line, but when they invent something for that, PLEASE let me know.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner tends to transfer onto my lids.  When I close my eyes it looks like I have a rings on my lids.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is fantastic!  It is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.  You can create thin or thick lines perfectly every time.  It dries quickly and does not smudge.  It lasts all day and looks great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this. I have used it twice and it is already drying up but the 1st two uses it was great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but i feel like the first eye it works then it dries on the second eye. So it shake it a little the second time.</li>
            <li> Probably the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve had so far on my search for the perfect (within budget) product. Love how it&#x27;s got a felt tip for application- easy to make thin lines right against my lash line. Easy to smudge away any errors when applied over a primer, and lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> Great for any sort of eyeliner styling. I usually use it lightly. Tip hasn&#x27;t gone dry, I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks now.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It cracks and flakes by the end of my work day; would not repurchase.  Not the fault of the supplier.</li>
            <li> Like everything about it but doesn&#x27;t dry up as fast as I would like</li>
            <li> i love how this looks on, so easy to apply and create different looks.</li>
            <li> Product is awful. Smudges immediately, and the liquid breaks on eyes. Takes forever to dry, smudges before it does. I have better ones.</li>
            <li> I was very intimidated when I first pulled off the cap. I thought it would be very flimsy and would not be easy to put on. I was wrong! It is like a marker. It glides onto your eye so easily. I could not be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply. my 1st good eyeliner pen</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, but it is absolutely awful.  Dried out after ~5 uses, smudges all over, and after a few hours it looks like either I slept in my makeup or am auditioning for the walking dead.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOVE!! I have never liked a eye product of this type, BUT I love this!! will reorder</li>
            <li> i like it. Everything is safe delivered..</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, no complaints, so must be good :)</li>
            <li> Not longer stay , just few hour</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on very easily and it&#x27;s easier to control the line than with a brush. However, it still may take some practice to do it right. I do not think it&#x27;s waterproof. Wish it came in dark brown too.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> New found favorite.. I have been passing this up for a while now and I really hate that I did! It&#x27;s so precis!  I love how it just glides on any eye makeup</li>
            <li> Good consistency, the narrow tip makes it easy for a liquid eyeliner beginner like myself</li>
            <li> easy to use, last long. Like it a lot!</li>
            <li> First and second use was great! Even with cap left on this item gets very hard to use. I have left it upside down after reading other reviews! It is still not the same . Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The reviews were awesome so I bought it but I think it&#x27;s just okay. Not too great. It&#x27;s worth that price. It smudges on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner. Goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago because I was in desperate need of some more liquid eyeliner. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the formula. My eyelids tend to become rather oily throughout the day and if I don&#x27;t use the right kind of eyeliner, it ends up everywhere. When I use this, I usually wind up with a lot of smearing and traveling into my crease. Had the same thing happen with many kinds of eyeliner. The applicator is wonderful, though, so it gets points for that. In fact, the applicator is the same as my favorite liquid eyeliner made by Stila (which is more expensive, but has a much better, waterproof formula. I&#x27;ve never once experienced smearing or smudging or anything with this eyeliner). The problem is, they look so similar I&#x27;ve occasionally accidentally put this one on instead of the Stila one and didn&#x27;t realize it until I looked in the mirror and saw that my eyeliner was not at all where it was supposed to be. I&#x27;d probably still use this if I wanted something very temporary and easy to remove, but for the most part it&#x27;s just a waste and ends up making me look like a panda.</li>
            <li> Dried out before I finished using it. Ones at the store don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner 😍</li>
            <li> Goes on easily in a nice fine line, and I was happy, since I&#x27;m not very great with drawing fine, straight lines.  BUT it comes off very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is not as dark as I&#x27;d like and tends to disappear over time.  It does go on easily, looks natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate - which is more than I can say for many liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Like it, used it for a few days before my Stila came in...sorry it&#x27;s great and even seems darker when applied at first, but no competition to the Stila stick I got, love it.  So both are good, but Stila is awesome.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was great but the second time I used it, it was as if it was empty and just a little would come out at a time where the first time it was like a paint brush. So I held the pen at the end and shook it to see if there was more mascara in the pencil... But actually the black liquid did come out. So it was still in there...but the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t do as good as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I was upset because i really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Great liner! Satisfied customer!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, great price!</li>
            <li> It works very well. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeliner for almost a 2 years now and it is the most wonderful thing i have ever had. It apply perfectly to create wings, it is always pitch black and handles perfectly, if you are looking for an alternative to gel liners or pencil liners, I suggest this product to you.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner and the precision you can get with it. However, it smudges easily when it gets wet (like eyes watering when you yawn) and of the few tubes I bought, they all seemed to dry out very quickly. They seemed to last about a month with 5-7x/week use before they would start drying out, making the liner not as black and skip while applying. I always stored the tubes tip down but it didn&#x27;t seem to help. I&#x27;ve since moved back to a gel liner (L&#x27;oreal) and I think that&#x27;s what I will stick with from now on.</li>
            <li> love this product; really goes on well and last all day.</li>
            <li> Very nice and a very smooth line.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner! It&#x27;s hard for me to find eye makeup that does not smudge in my eyelid crease. This one is a keeper! It does not say waterproof, but seems it is quite resistant to sweat and stays put throughout the day. I have fallen asleep with it on (bad I know!) and it still looked the same in the morning. No eye irritation and a very user-friendly applicator that keeps you from applying too thick of a line.</li>
            <li> This Eyeliner is the easiest liquid I have ever used and I have tried it ALL!! It will fade color slightly with extreme humidity and mositure but adding a little powder with it helps with this to a great degree. I will buy more of it for the price and the ease of application you really can&#x27;t go wrong. You can draw the perfect lines with this liner even if you are like myself and bit shakey...</li>
            <li> the pen seem to dry up pretty fast. After 2 weeks use then pretty much seem dry and hard to use afterward</li>
            <li> Do not get this if you&#x27;re looking for something that stays in place.  It looked great when it went on, and I was pleased when looking in the mirror initially.  Three hours later, I went into the bathroom at my man&#x27;s house to find that it was completely smudged and I looked like a raccoon.  Not cool maybelline, not cool.  Stick with stilla eyeliner or Blinc-- They&#x27;re the best.  It pays not to look like you&#x27;re ready for Halloween.</li>
            <li> My new eyeliner of choice!  Glad I gave this a try after my long time favorite was discontinued.</li>
            <li> best liner i&#x27;ve owned so far</li>
            <li> Excellent product 100% recommend five star well deserved ....</li>
            <li> This is just like stila! Score!</li>
            <li> Good product easy to use</li>
            <li> I got this same product from the drug store and I like it. Sometimes you have to lightly push the tip on a piece of paper or something to make the liquid liner come out some, but all and all it&#x27;s a great product and I plan to order it online soon!</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot think of a better alternative. I originally started buying this eyeliner several years ago at my local drug store, and seeing it available cheaper on Amazon made it all the more better. Here&#x27;s the run-down of what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Supersupersuper easy to apply. You use it like a pen, and the flexibility of the felt tip makes it&#x27;s really easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;2) It STAYS! I prime my eyes with eye shadow primer and a bit of powder, but that&#x27;s only because my lids get super oily. I&#x27;ve used it once or twice without priming my eyes and it did not move. At. All.&lt;br /&gt;3) The price is unbeatable. The only other eyeliner I can think of that&#x27;s similar to it is the Stila waterproof pen, which goes for around 20$, but it peels and dries out quicker than this one.&lt;br /&gt;4) It isn&#x27;t your ritzy oh-I-bought-this-at-this-fancy-obscure-boutique-counter-thingy-kind-of-makeup. I love that it&#x27;s essentially a drug store eyeliner. Better yet: I love that it&#x27;s a drug store eyeliner that WORKS and is better than any other kind of eyeliner out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it buy it buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Perfect eyeliner, it&#x27;s felt tip so it goes on smooth! Easy to do a fine line or a thicker one</li>
            <li> The felt tip is great easy gliding. My one con is it goes on my upper eyelid throughout the day without me noticing and Im walking around like a panda</li>
            <li> shipping was heel snel. binnen een week had ik t al ontvangen. love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find an eyeliner to replace my favorite... stilla eyeliner... stila lasts all day and no smearing.  This goes on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li> I just bought this today from Walmart for $6.94 I have Never used a pen liquid liner before or any other for that matter. I just use pencils but those smudge too much and end up on my eyelid. This pen is easy to use and dries quickly. I haven&#x27;t found any issues with it as of yet The color black is the Blackest of black which i lOve and glides right on without any eye irritation. So far so good. I wore it on New Years Eve and i was in SF for the fireworks and my left eye is slit due to wind and cold air. My left eye does this every year.Needless to say YES,the eyeliner smeared and smudged off! There went my wing. LOL. I will have to do basic eyeliner and put on my wings in summer weather after 5.UPDATE:IT CONTAINS SULFATE AN DI&#x27; ALEGIC TO IT,WHICH HAS NOW CAUSED IRRITATION. I CAN&#x27;T USEIT ANYMORE. SO SAD,</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner. Goes on smooth and crisp and stays on as well as can be expected. I used another liner before that seemed like the felt tip would get dry as I was trying to apply it. This one doesn&#x27;t have that problem. It&#x27;s definitely not waterproof, but on a regular day, it stays put great.</li>
            <li> This is nice - not too thick or too think.  Nice dark color- however, I&#x27;m not sure I will ever get the hang of liquid eyeliner - but I keep trying and my lack of ability is not the eyeliners fault!</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner I have EVER used!  Goes on easily, over make up or on clean skin.  I wish there were more colors, I&#x27;d buy all of them.</li>
            <li> Amazing eyeliner!! Easy to be precise with a little practice. I am able to create thin or think lines with this liquid eyeliner. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she hates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her: It&#x27;s good for making sharp thin lines but it smears REALLY easily and does&#x27;t stay put, even with a eyelid primer.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have used. Cat eyes are just so easy to make.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at putting on eyeliner, but I love this thing. Goes on smooth and even and will last all day and night.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time and smooth application</li>
            <li> This is perfect! It&#x27;s as if you were using a pen: no more dripping or lumpy awkward brushes that end up everywhere but where you want to draw the line. Just the perfect amount comes out, really smooth stroke.. Never again getting a different one!</li>
            <li> Great product, so dark and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;But the packaging....&lt;br /&gt;Came in a box WAY too big for it. It actually scared me a bit, such a big box that was clearly empty, wondered if it was some kind of sick joke until I saw Amazon and relaxed a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well the product is great!! Enjoying it, but seriously scary packaging.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST Liquid stick liner I&#x27;ve ever used!! After turning 40, I realized it was getting harder to evenly apply liquid liner close to my top lashes (due to softening of eyelid). Plus other liquid liners ALWAYS smudged.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to my other eyeliner again! I was hesitant to buy this because liquid eyeliner tends to be too dark and thick. But this stick lets you apply it as thin and as thick as you want! Also it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily. Sometimes it does around the corners of my eyes but I apply eyeshadow over it to help it set a little better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the rating on this eyeliner is so high. I usually use Revlon&#x27;s ColorStay Liquid Liner (http://smile.amazon.com/Revlon-ColorStay-Liquid-Liner-Blackest/dp/B000H3I2N2) but thought I&#x27;d try this one to save money, but it doesn&#x27;t stay all day, it seems to bleed into the crease of my eyelid.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry and i have to use a lot force and go over my eyelids back and forth to apply it to make it visible.</li>
            <li> The easiest  liquid liner I&#x27;ve ever used! The felt tip let&#x27;s me apply  like a pro!!!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this to Line my lower lash line along the water line and it just ran into my eyes.  It flowed well if I used it on my hand, but not so well on my eyelids.  I gave this to my daughter and with some practice she was able to get this to work for her, although she only lines her top eyelids not the bottom along the water line.I think it runs into my eye before it gets a chance to dry.  I have no problem with gel eye liner,  it stays where I put it.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner.  I have experimented in the past with both pencil and powder black eyeliners, but this has been the only one that allows me to get a really clean look.  Easy to add a wing effect because the liner is so thin and precise.</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and small eyelids. Liner usually is hard for me to make look good but this one is super easy to apply and goes on perfectly. I can stay as close to my lashes as I want. The tip is ultra thin. I love it! This will be my liner as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, even without a primer on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to put on. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice liner.  Just need to get used to the tip.  I was used to using a brush.  I would use this for face painting projects on kids because of the tip.</li>
            <li> It makes even the clueless in makeup appear professional , i have used around 5 different brands since JAN and Maybelline by far was the best</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and gives definition. Waterproof formula lasts all day but thickness of the line can fade a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a great liquid liner especially for the price..</li>
            <li> The perfect eyeliner - lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them and this one is great!</li>
            <li> Performs as expected! Not the best-flowing eye pen I&#x27;ve used, but at this price I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I love this it is easy to hold stays on even though I&#x27;m  a frequent eye toucher. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I will purchase this frequently from here on out.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I like to put it on thinly. Then, to soften it, I go over it with a brown pencil. That&#x27;s if I have the time. I like how long it lasts ... seems to last for days. I also like how you can make the line very thin; it just takes a little more time.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s the best makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. I could never do winged eyeliner, and I previously used the NYC eyeliner pen-thing and it was too thick and I always came out with stripes instead of wings. Wish this, I can get right to the root for a close line, and I can easily create a sharp wing. I hope that they continue selling this liner, as it&#x27;s definitely changed my makeup look from &amp;#34;She doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s doing&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Those wings could cut&amp;#34;. Might be bad quotes, but this is soso accurate, thin and precise just like it promised.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smooth lines.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but transfers to my upper lid. End up looking like a raccoon by the end of the day. Guess I have to go back to waterproof.</li>
            <li> Great product , Love it a lot</li>
