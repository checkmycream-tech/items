            <li>I personally LOVE the way this smells.</li>
            <li>Leaves a dry nail and smells GREAT!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that strong, chemical under-scent like regular polish remover, but instead has a very potent but pleasant (herbal-woodsy) fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true!</li>

            <li>I was reluctant to spend this much on a remover but after reading reviews and loving Zoya&#x27;s polishes, I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Good design where you need only tap the top with your cotton ball.</li>
            <li>This remover works great, and smells much better than other removers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Zoya nail polish remover quickly and easily removes nail polish.</li>
            <li>This remover isn&#x27;t strong and it&#x27;s comes off really quick.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to find something new that wouldn&#x27;t bug my eyes or my nose--and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails!</li>
            <li>works very well plus LOVE the dispenser</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Make sure what you are getting is really Zoya and not a fake!</li>
            <li>This nail polish remover smells good, not like other nail polish removers that has strong smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m just that lucky</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m feeling pretty again!</li>
            <li>It really takes off polish quickly and effectively and smells better than any other remover I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Worth its money.</li>
            <li>A bit on the pricey side but worth it.</li>
            <li>I wonder if this product will even be as effective as promised, since there was definitely no seal to prevent evaporation or leakage.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It actually smells pleasant, does the job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (like so many other products do)!</li>
            <li>There was a huge piece of clear tape around the bottle and after removal it was sticky.</li>
            <li>It dispenses the product with a push, so you take your cotton ball and push down on the top and it gets soaked!</li>
            <li>I really like the design of this bottle.  </li>
            <li>It costs too much</li>
            <li>This works better than any other nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It removed the glue so much better than any other nail polish I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just place a cotton ball on the top and press down on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I was love it until remaining a half.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You just flip open the top lid, press your cotton ball or pad down on it, and it dispenses polish remover right onto the pad.  </li>
            <li>Leaves nails feeling &#x27;normal&#x27; and no dehydrated.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is not filled to the top as it appears to be in the photo.</li>
            <li>but it just didnâ€™t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>My mom and sister have really sensitive noses, and they didn&#x27;t even complain as I was removing my nail polish five feet away from them!</li>
            <li>It removes nail polish fast too and does not dry my nails.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to constantly flip it upside down to wet a cotton ball and risk spilling it everywhere, and you can twist the top to lock it for when you put it away.</li>
            <li>The remover so far is about the same as others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong chemical smell with a weird lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I was so happy ( I&#x27;m a hairdresser and my nails were looking pretty awful with no polish)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong chemical smell with a weird lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I was so happy ( I&#x27;m a hairdresser and my nails were looking pretty awful with no polish)</li>
            <li> After using this polish remover for about a month and a half my nails are peeling at the tip and they are very weak at the tip from the top layer coming off.</li>
            <li> The packing slip was partially smeared from the leak.</li>
            <li> I manicure my nails every week and it takes less remover and less work to remove even stubborn red nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had it that it does spray a little when you press down to release the polish remover.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit expensive at first</li>
            <li> It also does not seem as drying as other removers.</li>
            <li> , the smell is so strong I can&#x27;t even use it when my husband is home because it makes him sick.</li>
            <li> However, if you change polish a lot and use a lot of it, it will get expensive - on the whole - to keep buying.  </li>
            <li> This wiped it off after less than 5 seconds of sitting.</li>
            <li> It dispenses the product on to it without causing a mess.</li>
            <li> My bottle was not full either.</li>
            <li> The pump-action dispenser takes a little getting use to &amp; you have to remember to &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff really is NOT toxic like acetone and it gets rid of even the glittery polish that&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I often put a few coats of glitter on my tips or an accent nail and it is always a pain to get off.</li>
            <li> Inside the flip up lid, the plastic was broken off by the tiny hole.</li>
            <li> They usually have me go somewhere and close the door and turn on the exhaust.</li>
            <li> It was laying there and not sure how it broke off like that.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the wretched smell that you usually get with nail polish remover</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve been having a lot of issues with eye irritation lately.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a year ago (knowing it was a little expensive)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my nails were so thin and peeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the smell of regular remover but sucked it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I just received my Zoya Remove Plus 8oz bottle, and I&#x27;m highly disappointed with how it was shipped.</li>
            <li> After that the pump has stopped working :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> Polish removers seemed to &#x27;crap&#x27; up my nails.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, although I don&#x27;t find it terribly offensive.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Another Zoya product that I love. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails!</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this remover but it just didnâ€™t live up to the hype. I get the same results with the acetone I was using before.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish remover I have ever bought. The product itself is amazing. It took off my GLITTER polish ladies! GLITTER came off easily! It was awesome. I often put a few coats of glitter on my tips or an accent nail and it is always a pain to get off. This wiped it off after less than 5 seconds of sitting. I also love the top on this bottle. It dispenses the product with a push, so you take your cotton ball and push down on the top and it gets soaked! Great idea!</li>
            <li> Opinion: Make sure what you are getting is really Zoya and not a fake! Zoya does not smell strong or burns.</li>
            <li> Great for nail polish removal</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;flipper&amp;#34; bottle that this product comes in is wonderfully convenient.  You just flip open the top lid, press your cotton ball or pad down on it, and it dispenses polish remover right onto the pad.  The top can lock in place too, to make sure there is no leakage.  The remover so far is about the same as others I&#x27;ve used so I want to use it longer to see what the long-term effects are.  Some have reported peeling and breakage of their nails over time.  I do agree with those who complain about the odor of this product.  I don&#x27;t like it, although I don&#x27;t find it terribly offensive.  It would just be better to leave out the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like this nail polish remover for its design. It is extremely handy! Worth its money.</li>
            <li> Polish removers seemed to &#x27;crap&#x27; up my nails.  This one does not plus one can apply polish w/out washing it off/I actually recall they recommend same.&lt;br /&gt;Zoya polishes good too-- beautiful colors...</li>
            <li> I really like the design of this bottle.  The nail polish remover works well and doesn&#x27;t have an over powering smell.  The only issue I had it that it does spray a little when you press down to release the polish remover.  Other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not the best.  There was a huge piece of clear tape around the bottle and after removal it was sticky.</li>
            <li> Gets the Zoya polish off where regular polish remover takes a million years to remove</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover is fantastic!  I manicure my nails every week and it takes less remover and less work to remove even stubborn red nail polish.  Although it still smells like polish remover - it seems to have a lighter scent.  A bit on the pricey side but worth it.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever tried. I thought it was a bit expensive at first but it&#x27;s well worth it and will last a long time. It even smells good! The smell reminds me of aveda shampoo and I love it. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend this much on a remover but after reading reviews and loving Zoya&#x27;s polishes, I tried it.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Leaves nails feeling &#x27;normal&#x27; and no dehydrated.  It really takes off polish quickly and effectively and smells better than any other remover I&#x27;ve used.  I would highly recommend it.  However, if you change polish a lot and use a lot of it, it will get expensive - on the whole - to keep buying.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this product. I regret the day that I bought it. I have always had very beautiful strong nails that grow quickly. After using this polish remover for about a month and a half my nails are peeling at the tip and they are very weak at the tip from the top layer coming off. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my nails were so thin and peeling however I realized that the only thing that I was doing differently was using this polish remover. Run ... do not try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is so strong I can&#x27;t even use it when my husband is home because it makes him sick. It&#x27;s a very strong chemical smell with a weird lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Zoya nail polish remover quickly and easily removes nail polish. The dispenser is great too. I just place a cotton ball on the top and press down on the cotton ball. It dispenses the product on to it without causing a mess. I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free too.</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover smells good, not like other nail polish removers that has strong smell. It removes nail polish fast too and does not dry my nails. No harmful chemicals added to this as well.</li>
            <li> Love the bottle and the polish remover. This stuff really is NOT toxic like acetone and it gets rid of even the glittery polish that&#x27;s hard to get off. Good design where you need only tap the top with your cotton ball. Get the refill too - you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Wow. This stuff is fantastic! My mom and sister have really sensitive noses, and they didn&#x27;t even complain as I was removing my nail polish five feet away from them! They usually have me go somewhere and close the door and turn on the exhaust. And still complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have already talked about how well it removes nail polish, so I won&#x27;t reinvent the wheel, but to my surprise, it also removed the glue I used to attach my silver nail bow to my nail with. It removed the glue so much better than any other nail polish I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended. And I&#x27;ve tried some of everything!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nail polish remover that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals , and in my search I found Zoya( a vegan company!) I was so happy ( I&#x27;m a hairdresser and my nails were looking pretty awful with no polish) now I&#x27;m feeling pretty again!</li>
            <li> I just received my Zoya Remove Plus 8oz bottle, and I&#x27;m highly disappointed with how it was shipped. There was obvious leakage in the box. The packing slip was partially smeared from the leak. The bottle is not filled to the top as it appears to be in the photo. I wonder if this product will even be as effective as promised, since there was definitely no seal to prevent evaporation or leakage.</li>
            <li> I was love it until remaining a half. After that the pump has stopped working :(&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m just that lucky</li>
            <li> Best nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever used. Takes glitter off very easy. Even gave them as Christmas presents! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This remover works great, and smells much better than other removers I&#x27;ve tried. It also does not seem as drying as other removers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. It leave a residue on my nails</li>
            <li> I purchased this a year ago (knowing it was a little expensive) but I&#x27;m still using the same bottle and I redo my nails probably or 4 times a month.  Leaves a dry nail and smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Love this remover.  Cleans better in one swipe than many others including glitter.</li>
            <li> Nail Polish remover that smells good, what? It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d get this. Well, mine arrived leaking. I squeezed the bottle and HOLY MOLY, it went all over me, fountain like!! After I cleaned myself off I took a closer look. Inside the flip up lid, the plastic was broken off by the tiny hole. It was laying there and not sure how it broke off like that. My bottle was not full either. I&#x27;m not impressed. It costs too much and I&#x27;ll go back to my drug store brands. I did not see any difference in my nails either and boy did they get a big dose of this stuff when it poured out. I put lotion on them after. I do not know how I was to return this thing so I ate the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve been having a lot of issues with eye irritation lately. I&#x27;ve always hated the smell of regular remover but sucked it up. Now it seems like just about everything irritates my eyes so I wanted to find something new that wouldn&#x27;t bug my eyes or my nose--and boy am I glad I did! This doesn&#x27;t have the wretched smell that you usually get with nail polish remover and I love the container. The top pumps so you don&#x27;t have to constantly flip it upside down to wet a cotton ball and risk spilling it everywhere, and you can twist the top to lock it for when you put it away. It actually smells pleasant, does the job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (like so many other products do)! What more could a girl ask for? I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This remover isn&#x27;t strong and it&#x27;s comes off really quick. The flip too container is convenient too. In fact, I love Zoya nail polish too!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Works great, smells great &amp; is reasonably priced compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; polish removers. I personally LOVE the way this smells. It doesn&#x27;t have that strong, chemical under-scent like regular polish remover, but instead has a very potent but pleasant (herbal-woodsy) fragrance. It makes my restroom smell wonderful for hours after I discarding the saturated/used cotton ball in the trash. The pump-action dispenser takes a little getting use to &amp; you have to remember to &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; it before replacing the cap. This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> the best nail polish remover ever. it works great, and smells MUCH better than most removers. definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> works very well plus LOVE the dispenser</li>
            <li> The polish is great but open/close feature can be pretty tricky!!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover was fabulous!! First of all the dispenser is just like the ones in the nail salon, and then the remover works perfectly! I had been struggling with the store brand remover and it took forever to get my polish off and then my nails were getting stripped. This remover works so fast and leaves my nails in good condition too! I love it!!!</li>
