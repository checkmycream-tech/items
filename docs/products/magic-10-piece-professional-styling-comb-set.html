            <li>I got this to begin building a hair kit and it has most of the esssentials</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, just get them :)</li>
            <li>Combs came early which is good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply an excellent buy, high quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Good quality and not expensive.</li>
            <li>, the plastic roll-up pouch they arrive in, is actually a super handy method of storing them.</li>
            <li>A wide range of combs in one set with an excellent price that invites many people to buy them.</li>
            <li>my room mate is going to love this when it arrives, it will fit with her carreer</li>
            <li>I bought this set knowing it that all the combs werent going to meet my expections because it was to much for a good price</li>
            <li>To be honest I feel as if I have already gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use some of these combs but excited to use more of them.</li>
            <li>Its easy to just put away when i need to take them somewhere.</li>
            <li>The collection of combs is made of strong plastic</li>
            <li>but that is fine because I bought this in conjunction with a hair manikin.</li>
            <li>Apart from the colour I would recommend this product, they come in a cute little bag, ideal for neat storage</li>
            <li>Terrific quality for the price -- great value.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic combs that came in orange color.</li>
            <li>These are cheap.</li>
            <li>I found the combs to be cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Integrated set where I bought it for my wife which is very impressed and says it Zgm modest price, but it offers more services is received Atkdr for what it was worth</li>
            <li>Nice price, decent quality, and they come in an pocket organizer that rolls up for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Very useful for those who know how to use these.</li>
            <li>Each particular piece does something handy.</li>
            <li>set is ok for first set.</li>
            <li>So if your excepting pro combs at a great price I&#x27;d spend a little more to get what you&#x27;re looking cause for these</li>
            <li>I needed more combs and these are nice and solid.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a pick, but it was really cool.</li>
            <li>you cant really have to many.</li>
            <li>Great assortment of combs and other styling products.  </li>
            <li>They are very week and they brake easily.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, it&#x27;s a set of combs that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>This variety of combs is ideal for future hair stylists who want to experiment with different styles and combs.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy for the price, even though as a gentlemen, I will not use several of the combs which are designed for much longer hair.</li>
            <li>I fixed it pretty easily with a file and all was fine.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t custom $400 Titanium but each and every piece is well cast in heavy plastic, perfectly finished which means no sharp sides or jagged edges.</li>
            <li>But the good this is that I haven&#x27;t have any problems with the other combs.</li>
            <li>Having the right tools makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li>Overall its worth to have and better than that</li>
            <li>They come in a clear pack that rolls up and is easy to store.</li>
            <li>These set are good for starting out in a professional styles or getting your hair done.</li>
            <li>Works good on black people hair if your wondering.</li>
            <li>I love that i could get all different types of combs in one pack.</li>
            <li>The rat-tail combs snapped the first time I use them.  </li>
            <li>The metal on the comb is great and holds up to my four year olds thick hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know the specific purpose of most of these but a combs a comb.</li>
            <li>I bought this comb set thinking that I would only be able to find something like it online,</li>
            <li>The set arrives with each piece in it&#x27;s own plastic cover inside a snap down clear plastic case which can be rolled up for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this comb set, in fact I buy it every year, I say that to really say, it&#x27;s not going to last you forever</li>
            <li>Just a caveat: they run pretty small and are not really the best set, but for the price, it works very well.</li>
            <li>They are nice, just wish they came in black like in the picture.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to roll them out, select a comb, and roll it back up.</li>
            <li>But good enough if you are not a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>and it certainly doesnt come free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was priced really well.</li>
            <li>so these work really well to give me any desired look.</li>
            <li>Does what it says on the box - delivery was a lifetime though so be ready to really wait for this.</li>
            <li>For the 10 piece set at this price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t nothing to complain about the items.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>This set really took care of that problem.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much -</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, during the holidays.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Every comb in the package is unique and has a different use.</li>
            <li>Look forward to buying more styling combs down the line.</li>
            <li>the bone comb the teeth of that particular comb should be stonger and they should have space between,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly bought these so that my wife would stop stealing and then losing my combs.</li>
            <li>Decent plastic combs which all eventually found a place in my family&#x27;s lifestyle.</li>
            <li>This is more than what I was hoping for, for such a low price!</li>
            <li>My 11 year old purchased this set of combs for her Mannequin Manikin Training Head and absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>None of the combs were bent, none of them have failed, I only have good things to say about these!</li>
            <li>Large selection of various combs for whatever you need.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised but as it seems stylists can never have tomany tools of the trade - and this set fits the bill</li>
            <li>(so far) of the set.</li>
            <li>so far no problems</li>
            <li>These brushes really are terrific!!!</li>
            <li>but they came in a weird brown color, they are okay for the price, so if you don&#x27;t wanna invert too much on a comb kit go for them!</li>
            <li>so I tried to mainly use the wider toothed ones except for after I had flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li>(If that is even what is is called) was pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>Well the one with the little metal tail and the metal thing just broke right off..</li>
            <li>The other combs were decent with good spacing in the teeth, but there exists a tiny line in between each teeth which i noticed snags at my thin hair strands !</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would last because who wants to buy all new combs every few months</li>
            <li>some of the combs are duplicates as far as same size an shape and objective, but not identical.</li>
            <li>My hair texture is very curly, (tightly coiled).</li>

            <li> To be honest I feel as if I have already gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use some of these combs but excited to use more of them.</li>
            <li> Its easy to just put away when i need to take them somewhere.</li>
            <li> The collection of combs is made of strong plastic</li>
            <li> but that is fine because I bought this in conjunction with a hair manikin.</li>
            <li> Apart from the colour I would recommend this product, they come in a cute little bag, ideal for neat storage</li>

            <li> So if your excepting pro combs at a great price I&#x27;d spend a little more to get what you&#x27;re looking cause for these</li>
            <li> I needed more combs and these are nice and solid.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a pick, but it was really cool.</li>
            <li> you cant really have to many.</li>
            <li> Great assortment of combs and other styling products.  </li>
            <li> They are very week and they brake easily.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a set of combs that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This variety of combs is ideal for future hair stylists who want to experiment with different styles and combs.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for the price, even though as a gentlemen, I will not use several of the combs which are designed for much longer hair.</li>
            <li> I fixed it pretty easily with a file and all was fine.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t custom $400 Titanium but each and every piece is well cast in heavy plastic, perfectly finished which means no sharp sides or jagged edges.</li>
            <li> But the good this is that I haven&#x27;t have any problems with the other combs.</li>
            <li> Having the right tools makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> Overall its worth to have and better than that</li>
            <li> They come in a clear pack that rolls up and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> These set are good for starting out in a professional styles or getting your hair done.</li>
            <li> Works good on black people hair if your wondering.</li>
            <li> I love that i could get all different types of combs in one pack.</li>
            <li> The rat-tail combs snapped the first time I use them.  </li>
            <li> The metal on the comb is great and holds up to my four year olds thick hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know the specific purpose of most of these but a combs a comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb set thinking that I would only be able to find something like it online,</li>
            <li> The set arrives with each piece in it&#x27;s own plastic cover inside a snap down clear plastic case which can be rolled up for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this comb set, in fact I buy it every year, I say that to really say, it&#x27;s not going to last you forever</li>
            <li> Just a caveat: they run pretty small and are not really the best set, but for the price, it works very well.</li>
            <li> They are nice, just wish they came in black like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to roll them out, select a comb, and roll it back up.</li>
            <li> But good enough if you are not a professional stylist.</li>
            <li> and it certainly doesnt come free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was priced really well.</li>
            <li> so these work really well to give me any desired look.</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the box - delivery was a lifetime though so be ready to really wait for this.</li>
            <li> For the 10 piece set at this price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t nothing to complain about the items.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> This set really took care of that problem.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much -</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, during the holidays.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Every comb in the package is unique and has a different use.</li>
            <li> Look forward to buying more styling combs down the line.</li>
            <li> the bone comb the teeth of that particular comb should be stonger and they should have space between,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mainly bought these so that my wife would stop stealing and then losing my combs.</li>
            <li> Decent plastic combs which all eventually found a place in my family&#x27;s lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This is more than what I was hoping for, for such a low price!</li>
            <li> My 11 year old purchased this set of combs for her Mannequin Manikin Training Head and absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> None of the combs were bent, none of them have failed, I only have good things to say about these!</li>
            <li> Large selection of various combs for whatever you need.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised but as it seems stylists can never have tomany tools of the trade - and this set fits the bill</li>
            <li> (so far) of the set.</li>
            <li> so far no problems</li>
            <li> These brushes really are terrific!!!</li>
            <li> but they came in a weird brown color, they are okay for the price, so if you don&#x27;t wanna invert too much on a comb kit go for them!</li>
            <li> so I tried to mainly use the wider toothed ones except for after I had flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> (If that is even what is is called) was pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> Well the one with the little metal tail and the metal thing just broke right off..</li>
            <li> The other combs were decent with good spacing in the teeth, but there exists a tiny line in between each teeth which i noticed snags at my thin hair strands !</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would last because who wants to buy all new combs every few months</li>
            <li> some of the combs are duplicates as far as same size an shape and objective, but not identical.</li>
            <li> My hair texture is very curly, (tightly coiled).</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t it has a flat end</li>
            <li> so things like this just typically don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them too</li>
            <li> poor quality bought for a gift did not give them due to not professional, cheap product.</li>
            <li> but i dont think too long..</li>
            <li> I was actually only searching for one comb online and found this package of all of these ones for less than one of the regular combs somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are just a little too big for my hands.</li>
            <li> I expected my com set to be black mainly because the picture is black</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak as to how well the different combs work as half of them look like lockpicking tools.</li>
            <li> Only lost a star because mine were orange instead of black.</li>
            <li> All are plastic and looks like they can last a little bit</li>
            <li> though at least a few of these combs would of been or done what a certain comb is suppose to be do.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> I like the different types of combs but there&#x27;s a few combs like</li>
            <li> But for the price its what i expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them a few months now and after about the third week the comb spikes were breaking off and snapping.</li>
            <li> However, while I was detangling my hair witht eh wide two-sided comb, one of the three picks on the bottom broke</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and when I comb my natural hair</li>
            <li> As for shipping I got it a few days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The price is right so you can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> Comb set not strong enough... flimsy</li>
            <li> The plastic case they come in is flimsy and cheap but the combs aren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> and i thought they were black.</li>
            <li> I got the black set,</li>
            <li> I was expecting my combs too be black, but they were orange.  </li>
            <li> i thought they&#x27;d be in black</li>
            <li> (little did I know it was at Wal-Mart for a bit cheaper)</li>
            <li> After all they do break, get lost and wear out at the very least I have back ups.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for everyday combs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use half of these but for $2, there&#x27;s no issues!</li>
            <li> rat tail w/ metal end is what disappointed me even though it is mental, you&#x27;d think it would come to a decent point</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your Money Honey !</li>
            <li> Online they are shown to be black, but when they arrived they were yellow brushes they were ugly, and not what it says online.</li>
            <li> I havent contacted the company yet, I hope its not too late.</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Not as thin as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I feel the comb bending, but they&#x27;ve not yet broken.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken or messed with</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these combs because of how poorly made they are..</li>
            <li> and I was quite disappointed at that—</li>
            <li> and I hate that color</li>

            <li> A good collection of combs. Great for a starter set. Just a caveat: they run pretty small and are not really the best set, but for the price, it works very well.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old purchased this set of combs for her Mannequin Manikin Training Head and absolutely loves them. Neat pack.</li>
            <li> I love that i could get all different types of combs in one pack. Its easy to just put away when i need to take them somewhere. I love it. The only thing is that they are just a little too big for my hands. This is my honest review.</li>
            <li> It was so cute. I wish it had a pick, but it was really cool. I also thought the case was adorn.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety and a great value.</li>
            <li> A set of combs. Does what it says on the box - delivery was a lifetime though so be ready to really wait for this.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply  made combs</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for the price, even though as a gentlemen, I will not use several of the combs which are designed for much longer hair.</li>
            <li> For the 10 piece set at this price I can&#x27;t really complain. The only issue I have is the metal on rat tail comb (If that is even what is is called) was pretty sharp. I fixed it pretty easily with a file and all was fine. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I like the different types of combs but there&#x27;s a few combs like&lt;br /&gt;- the bone comb the teeth of that particular comb should be stonger and they should have space between,&lt;br /&gt;-the rat tail w/ metal end is what disappointed me even though it is mental, you&#x27;d think it would come to a decent point but it doesn&#x27;t it has a flat end ( I wont even call it a tip). I bought this set knowing it that all the combs werent going to meet my expections because it was to much for a good price and we all know nothing good comes cheap and it certainly doesnt come free.&lt;br /&gt; However I though at least a few of these combs would of been or done what a certain comb is suppose to be do.&lt;br /&gt;That just wasnt the case all, I love that they&#x27;re kept neatly in a plastic case.  Hey, a comb is comb you cant really have to many. After all they do break, get lost and wear out at the very least I have back ups.&lt;br /&gt; So if your excepting pro combs at a great price I&#x27;d spend a little more to get what you&#x27;re looking cause for these wont do.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for everyday combs these are the ones for you. They willget the job done you just might was touse a bit more effort is all. I gave them # stars all together including the S&amp;H (which can alwys be a pain) was seemless including tracking and delivery. Comb Away!!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic combs that came in orange color. Not the best combs but does the job. All are plastic and looks like they can last a little bit but i dont think too long.. But for the price its what i expected.</li>
            <li> i loved them. but they get lost easily lol mostly my fault</li>
            <li> Nice color, nice feel to them, I own a beauty school and these work well for what we need them to do.</li>
            <li> Used to style hair. Each particular piece does something handy. No complaints. Look forward to buying more styling combs down the line.</li>
            <li> A wide range of combs in one set with an excellent price that invites many people to buy them. Very useful for those who know how to use these.</li>
            <li> These beauty tools provided me with everything I need to style my hair and allows me to create different hair styles each day!</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t nothing to complain about the items. The shipping was good and I i liked the product some of the combs are duplicates as far as same size an shape and objective, but not identical.</li>
            <li> These are cheap. The rat-tail combs snapped the first time I use them.  Fast shipping...all the way from China!</li>
            <li> Very good set of combs.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality comb set that&#x27;s perfect for traveling or just at home. Large selection of various combs for whatever you need.</li>
            <li> I expected my com set to be black mainly because the picture is black but it&#x27;s the orange set that I already have but that is fine because I bought this in conjunction with a hair manikin.</li>
            <li> My hair texture is very curly, (tightly coiled). I found the combs to be cheap plastic. They are bendable and the tail comb is not pointy at the end. The metal tail comb is chopped at the end, which snags at my hair when trying to part it for design. The other combs were decent with good spacing in the teeth, but there exists a tiny line in between each teeth which i noticed snags at my thin hair strands ! Don&#x27;t waste your Money Honey !</li>
            <li> Lovely price cheaper than Walmart, but well made too.</li>
            <li> It is a nice set to have. The plastic case they come in is flimsy and cheap but the combs aren&#x27;t too bad. I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. Overall its worth to have and better than that damn dollar tree s***.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought these so that my wife would stop stealing and then losing my combs. They are very good for the price. The bag they come in rolls out like a torture or tool set. I can&#x27;t speak as to how well the different combs work as half of them look like lockpicking tools.</li>
            <li> excellent product fulfills all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;recommend their quality is very good and the price even better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying him his sevice and attention no comparison.</li>
            <li> Plastic combs seems to be 100% better then the plastic combs I bought at the dollar store. The rat tail comb is why I bought this set I needed it to make parts for my two daughters hair. The metal on the comb is great and holds up to my four year olds thick hair. Love these and they do come in a case.</li>
            <li> great set for haircutting</li>
            <li> Very happy. Now I have a comb for everyone and every need.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite comb set. this is my second time purchasing.</li>
            <li> I received all the combs. My hair is thick and when I comb my natural hair I feel the comb bending, but they&#x27;ve not yet broken.</li>
            <li> I got this for my aunt who was in a nursing home and combs always seemed to disappear.  This set really took care of that problem.</li>
            <li> I needed more combs and these are nice and solid. I wouldn&#x27;t know the specific purpose of most of these but a combs a comb.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sturdy. I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> every comb for every need.. perfect</li>
            <li> Having ordered a few of these for gifts to friends who are hair stylists - and a set for myself (I&#x27;m a puppeteer and use life size figures all of them wear custom wigs - so I do my best to keep them looking good) Well, that said tobe honest I wasn&#x27;t expecting much - but boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ten piece Pro set includes everything you could possibly need. Rat tail comb, Picks, Lifters, Curl rakes, teasing combs, seperators and more. The quality isn&#x27;t custom $400 Titanium but each and every piece is well cast in heavy plastic, perfectly finished which means no sharp sides or jagged edges. The set arrives with each piece in it&#x27;s own plastic cover inside a snap down clear plastic case which can be rolled up for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My spouse has been a hair stylist for 20 years and creative director of one of the nations most beloved and popular Day Spas. These were a huge hit! I was quite surprised but as it seems stylists can never have tomany tools of the trade - and this set fits the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply an excellent buy, high quality and worth every penny. Plus with your Prime membership this set ships with free two day shippingto boot!</li>
            <li> I just recieved my combs today and they are amazing! They come in a clear pack that rolls up and is easy to store. I took one of the combs out and put in my styling clips so I have everything there that I need when I style my hair. Everything they said would come with it did. I ordered it on the 13th and I got it TWO DAYS before I was supposed to.  This product is amazing and I definetely recommend it! thank you :)</li>
            <li> Integrated set where I bought it for my wife which is very impressed and says it Zgm modest price, but it offers more services is received Atkdr for what it was worth</li>
            <li> Has everything we wanted.  Some of the things i dont know what to do with.  i have no complaints.  solid!</li>
            <li> Decent plastic combs which all eventually found a place in my family&#x27;s lifestyle. The price is right so you can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> They are nice, just wish they came in black like in the picture. Maybe have an option to choose color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this comb set 5-stars because for the money, I was extremely impressed with the quality and durability (so far) of the set. None of the combs were bent, none of them have failed, I only have good things to say about these! I use them for styling my hair, as well as combing my beard. To be honest I feel as if I have already gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the plastic roll-up pouch they arrive in, is actually a super handy method of storing them. Makes it easy to roll them out, select a comb, and roll it back up.</li>
            <li> Quality plastic shaped into tools that are great for fighting the defiant strands that occupy your cranial region</li>
            <li> Lots of different combs for lots of different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the color is like mustard and I hate that color but I guess the price is good</li>
            <li> Comb set not strong enough... flimsy</li>
            <li> moreish lived these and so did everyone in the house</li>
            <li> Everything I need for a comb is all here in this set. I can use it during my hair treatment or when I section my hair.</li>
            <li> Came in good packaging for the combs. Nothing was broken or messed with so That&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, during the holidays. Very impressed. May even order another.</li>
            <li> All the comb I could need. I only use combs to spike my hair so I only use one of them and my sisters/mom use the others.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with a guide for what each comb is supposed to accomplish.  The teasing comb is great, but already lost a tine on the pick end.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 10 piece comb set and instead I got something totally different I dont understand why. I received some sort of bill clips, ive never used before. I havent contacted the company yet, I hope its not too late.</li>
            <li> So I thought these combs were great when I first got them. I&#x27;ve had them a few months now and after about the third week the comb spikes were breaking off and snapping. I have very curly hair so I tried to mainly use the wider toothed ones except for after I had flat ironed my hair. I was looking for something that would last because who wants to buy all new combs every few months and these won&#x27;t last for anything</li>
            <li> The variety is amazing!  The collection of combs is made of strong plastic and I have not had any problems with breakage.</li>
            <li> Good set on the cheap.  Nothing exotic, but does the job!</li>
            <li> I love that these combs came in a case with a slot for each one.  I will always know where my combs are.  The plastic the combs are made out of is good.</li>
            <li> This is more than what I was hoping for, for such a low price! I was actually only searching for one comb online and found this package of all of these ones for less than one of the regular combs somewhere else. Very happy with my products</li>
            <li> outstanding qaulity great product and love the easyness of use and information just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and i thought they were black. Online they are shown to be black, but when they arrived they were yellow brushes they were ugly, and not what it says online.</li>
            <li> The best combs to get for styling hair, or doing hair. I decide to buy hair combs because I keep on losing them or they keep on breaking so I decide to buy a set of them. These set are good for starting out in a professional styles or getting your hair done. It arrive on time.</li>
            <li> I love this comb set, in fact I buy it every year, I say that to really say, it&#x27;s not going to last you forever but it does a great job for the price. It has almost every comb you can imagine and if you have never invested in any of the combs in the kit it gives you a good chance to try it before buying a comb that you may not even like (I have done that plenty of times). I am a hair and product junkie and I have thick hair so things like this just typically don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them too but it&#x27;s an awesome buy for the price.</li>
            <li> A comb for every need. Good for a fledgling hairdresser like myself</li>
            <li> set is ok for first set. the plastic feels kind of cheep, i wouldnt buy this for an amazing set. it does its job i posibly would buy it again</li>
            <li> these are just like most good combs some are better than others depending what they are used for. Yes I do use them all and they all serve there purpose.</li>
            <li> Flimsy plastic. But good enough if you are not a professional stylist.</li>
            <li> Combs came early which is good! I got the black set, so far no problems, I will buy from them again. Works good on black people hair if your wondering.</li>
            <li> Only lost a star because mine were orange instead of black.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use half of these but for $2, there&#x27;s no issues!</li>
            <li> I got this to begin building a hair kit and it has most of the esssentials</li>
            <li> This a good set. Good quality and not expensive.</li>
            <li> These brushes really are terrific!!! Can&#x27;t beat the price for them and the teasing brush is AWESOME!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate, just get them :)</li>
            <li> Good set for the price. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb set thinking that I would only be able to find something like it online, (little did I know it was at Wal-Mart for a bit cheaper) and it works...very well? What can I say, it&#x27;s a set of combs that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! However, while I was detangling my hair witht eh wide two-sided comb, one of the three picks on the bottom broke and I was quite disappointed at that—it&#x27;s the only reason why this product is receiving 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I was expecting my combs too be black, but they were orange.  I wanted everything in my salon too match.. They are very week and they brake easily.  I would not recommend these combs because of how poorly made they are.. As for shipping I got it a few days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> i thought they&#x27;d be in black but they came in a weird brown color, they are okay for the price, so if you don&#x27;t wanna invert too much on a comb kit go for them!</li>
            <li> Best value for money. A good hands on kit for a person who is in love with creating good hair styles.</li>
            <li> Very good products and they look nice and durable, took some days to come, but they come from China, I will order them again if I need to, excellent price, thank you Amazon great vendor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this or like a week or so and I use one of the rat tail combs. Well the one with the little metal tail and the metal thing just broke right off.. : 0 like omg but ig I kinda had to expect this because of the low price but still. But the good this is that I haven&#x27;t have any problems with the other combs.</li>
