            <li>This hand cream is the best ever.  </li>
            <li>Have a GREAT weekend everyone !!!  </li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>A great experience all around!</li>
            <li>Love this hand cream!!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li>and then I purchased a very good anti-aging moisturizer that is sold in 2 sizes</li>
            <li>so , as I stated, my buying her this Robanda Hand Cream was an \\&quot; INCREDIBLE value for an INCREDIBLE product.  </li>
            <li>Great Cream send me more!!!</li>
            <li>It is beautifully creamy, but not sticky, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This product is great for moisturizing and I like that it contains sunscreen which I guess is why they call it an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; treatment.  </li>
            <li>lotion has a pleasant fragrance, i.e.  it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen to me.  </li>
            <li>Good remedy fir dryness.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a good moisturizer but waaay to greasy.</li>
            <li>I think this product might be good if you wear those gel gloves to bed but not practical for daytime use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a good hand lotion with sunscreen for my car.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grandma because it had good reviews online</li>
            <li>This really is a good product and have not found any chemical carcinogens listed in</li>
            <li>Good size product for the price as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year with good results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>If this doesn&#x27;t bother you then it would be good for you.</li>
            <li>This hand lotion is non-greasy, light and best of all has one of the highest SPF&#x27;s of any anti-aging hand lotion I could find.  </li>
            <li>The silkiness of the handcream is quite good, though you can feel that \\&quot;slip\\&quot; you feel with sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Why do most manufacturers of great moisturizers &amp; night creams add fragrance???</li>
            <li>which of course is a great thing because many of us wash our hands throughout he day.  </li>
            <li>Am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I will definately be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with purchase - this is not my first time buying this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite ever!</li>
            <li>It is gradually fading the age spots and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice though.  </li>
            <li>The scent was nice and texture was creamy.</li>
            <li>this item is wonderful and really works for my age spots.  </li>
            <li>i have paid $45.00 for creams that were 1/2 AS EFFECTIVE AS</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price although I find the S/H charges rather high when buying in quantity.</li>
            <li>The Price is RIGHT and the product delivers !!!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for the sunscreen, but that&#x27;s a nice perk since they do say that your hands give away your age :)</li>
            <li>it felt great even after the first application.</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was available any longer, and I was very glad to find this seller on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this cream my hands looked better and felt smoother.</li>
            <li>I simply love this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I worked outdoors for most of my teens and twenties.</li>
            <li>Just one more cream to add to the rest.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and would order it again.</li>
            <li>I enjoying having manicured hands</li>
            <li>but I have noticed the skin on my hands is in much better shape.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when my hands get most of their sun exposure.</li>
            <li>It feels like I am taking the best possible care of my hands.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering some more in 2 months</li>
            <li>I am sure.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to try it yet.</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two more.</li>
            <li>A friend gave this as a gift and ordered more on Amazon because it was $2 cheaper....</li>
            <li>Also my hands are softer and look better.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many many hand creams.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it, and will also buy more myself.</li>
            <li>and at the top of the web site page there is a link to click on that says \\&quot; Store \\&quot;</li>
            <li>then that opens up with 3 more links and to check out all the Robanda products, after you click on store, then click on \\&quot; Products \\&quot; ...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Most things I used didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>My hands look better - the dryness and lines are minimized.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and is non-greasy but feels nice on my hands - I like the fact that it has the retinol and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>My hands seem to get more wrinkles from using water, but when I brought this product, the wrinkles seem to smooth out, and my hands looked more youthful and I like the smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This seller shipped this product in new, mint condition; packaged perfectly and shipped super quick as promised.  </li>
            <li>Am sensitive to lots of products so this was a welcome find.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of an anti-aging hand cream -- fading spots and sun protection are really important for my often-forgotten hands.  </li>
            <li>This product really works good.  </li>
            <li>Loved this so much that I gave my bottle to a friend and bought myself another.  </li>
            <li>It does not dmell too strongly of medicine or flowers.</li>
            <li>issue is the unbearably strong soapy, baby lotion-y fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I purchased her the first bottle and within almost 22 weeks she told me how amazing this hand cream was working.  </li>
            <li>It smells fine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine for an SPF hand cream while driving.</li>
            <li>Not horrible, but kind of perfumey and old lady smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Helps smooth aging crepy skin</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a few years now and am still impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>I really cannot tell any benefits from this product that I do not get from a nice hand cream for $6.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands look and feel smooth AND has sunscreen to protect them.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and there is no residual feel or smell.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion a hand cream should be perfume free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives me smooth hands and&lt;br</li>
            <li>If they made this in a fragrance free version, I&#x27;d jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are two hand creams that absorb fast, emollient enough that it&#x27;s not greasy yet provides that perfect sheen to minimize or eliminate your finger &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when it started curdling like a product full of waxes or cheap fillers.</li>
            <li>THIS ONE.i really love the results.it has lightened age spots better than any other, and the softness of my hands is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything - this works so quickly and is so smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>It smells WONDERFUL and using it makes my hands feel soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am 40 and noticing my hands need some help though, so thought maybe my Eucerin hand cream might not be enough, and the reviews were so good with this that I decided to purchase.</li>
            <li>And the silver color is really cool.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, pleasant smell, and is thick and moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a fliptop, which is more convenient than having to screw a separate top back on right after putting lotion all over your hands!</li>
            <li>The cream dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Quick shopping.  </li>
            <li>This hand cream absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily this did not happen inside of my purse.</li>
            <li>I like that it is absorbed quickly and you don&#x27;t have to use alot.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t expect too much and it will be fine.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, a light, fresh smell; absorbs quickly and actually does help my hands to look younger.  </li>
            <li>They had so many wrinkles and looked so old..</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth purchasing and use.  </li>
            <li>It was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>so I use it sparingly (or rarely).  </li>
            <li>After only the first day of using this product my hands look SO much better!</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this product due to the good reviews.</li>
            <li>You apply it and it peels right off.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and slight scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>i cannot say how good the product actually works because i never got that far.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it very much and now has me using it.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth going on, results not &amp;#34;instantaneous&amp;#34; but obviously.  </li>
            <li>This hand cream is very moisturizing,lightly scented and very suited to the special needs of aging hands.  </li>
            <li>Only get this if you can find a fragrance free version!    </li>
            <li>It is soft and light, not sticky.</li>
            <li>They are pretty hands again thanks to this stuff!</li>
            <li>But I do like the hand cream and will most likely order it again.</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The packaging is also good - the cap snaps closed securely, so I don&#x27;t worry about it coming open in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hand cream locally first.  </li>
            <li>And after two weeks of consistent use (2-3 times a day) I have reduced the darkness of my age spots about 50%.  </li>
            <li>The first through another company and noticed it here, so tried it again.  </li>
            <li>Then after the first month she told me that her \\&quot; age spots \\&quot; were indeed fading away PLUS</li>
            <li>That is ONE of the MANY reasons people should exfoliate their faces with either a facial scrub, or by using a Clarisonic or any hand held powered scrub brush</li>
            <li>Most likely will not order it again.</li>
            <li>But, this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>The heat sealed end of the tube is defective and the first time I squeezed the tube lotion flew everywhere.</li>
            <li>There are so incredibly many hand creams/lotions available, I surprised myself when my first tube was almost empty</li>
            <li>There were less wrinkles and dryness for sure!</li>
            <li>This one has quickly faded the spots that were developing and my hands stay soft even after washing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes your hands soft .  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and blends well and has only a very mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>certainly doesn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>Boy didn&#x27;t realize I had to write a certain amount of words</li>
            <li>I will certainly keep this product on hand</li>
            <li>I feel like I need moisturizers during the day when using this product in the morning, although the fine lines that can emerge after multiple hand-washings aren&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light, and it&#x27;s less waxy/more easily absorbed than the OPI and other hand creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It made my hands look so much younger and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I lather on</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a year and have really noticed an improvement in the appearance of my hands.  </li>
            <li>and for me, the smell really is off putting.  </li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Robanda without any real hopes of this product working.</li>
            <li>so her veins are very visible</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read all of this...</li>
            <li>, I never know when to shut up, and when I give a review of anything I had purchased, I get very detail oriented and</li>
            <li>Product is really unusable at this point.</li>
            <li>I really like the light-to-nothing scent and the luminescent properties, which were both a real bonus in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had bought this product a few years ago and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Since Neutrogena discontinued their anti-aging hand cream with spf, this one is just as good if not better!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll probably do some more research and see if there are any other alternatives in this price range.</li>
            <li>so I searched for Robanda on Amazon and was pleased to not only find it available, but the price was nearly half of what I had paid for y e a r s!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like I have a new set of hands!</li>
            <li>I just found out from ASAP beauty that the original was 20 spf with a different whitening agent and this is the new version.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell -</li>
            <li>By exfoliating the facial skin or the skin all over the body, by exfoliating it helps the new skin to glow after the 28 days pass and the old skin is going down the drain and the newer skin looks healthy, vibrant and very well moisturized !!!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I bought this hand cream because it had high ratings</li>
            <li>I look for skin products with a lot of moisturizers and extras like high lactic acid content, ceramides and vitamin c.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I KNOW for a fact she would HIGHLY recommend using Robanda as an Anti-Aging hand Cream while also helping to moisturize her hands while also getting rid of the hyper pigmented \\&quot; spots...</li>
            <li>I love the retinol in it especially since I live in a Southern climate.</li>
            <li>, I have this cheap perfume smell and bitter taste from the chemicals this hand lotion contains.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use long enough to see if my hands were smoother, so I can&#x27;t attest to that.  </li>
            <li>The Robanda Anti-Aging Hand Cream not only healed my dry skin, but it really did reduce some of the age spots, show signs of firmer skin and gave my hands an overall more dewy, youthful appearance - not to sound like a commercial, but it just did what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the product in that department, but I can definitely say that wrinkles/ fine lines and texture are definitely under control all day when I use this in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing cream, too soon to tell how good it is for anti ageing, but any sunscreen on the hands has to prevent further damage, and it is hard to find a hand cream with sunscreen at this low a price.</li>
            <li>When it no longer was available at the local beauty supply store I went online to find it and have ordered it several times.  </li>
            <li>My hands were somewhat wrinkled and had some age spots, very old for my age.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>To avoid the slick feeling on my fingers, I mostly concentrate this stuff on the backs of my hands.  </li>
            <li>Since the first bottle I had purchased for her, I dropped a hint that she should use her Robanda only at night, just before she goes to bed</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong and I find it harsh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 and had two on one hand and one large one on my inner arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dryness was starting to be a large issue as well.</li>
            <li>think the pricesis fine - like another reviewer, I only use it on the back of my hands and have used about a fifth of it in the last weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid it has more than just a light scent and the smell</li>
            <li>My manicurist, friends &amp; family always gives me compliments on how soft and young looking my hands are.  </li>
            <li>I am 41 years old</li>
            <li>and it made me wonder how old the product might be?  </li>
            <li>also think it&#x27;s reasonably priced, especially considering that my alternative seemed to be purchasing a $15 bottle of face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like a dream not like the striggle with my old latex.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, but this is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li>Because of this and the use of hand sanitizers my skin was beginning to look old and wrinkled.</li>
            <li>Of course, I wash them frequently through out the day</li>
            <li>This hand cream leaves your hands soft; that is what I like.</li>
            <li>Keeps the hands soft for a longer period of time, and even diminishes the brown age spots that can occur.  </li>
            <li>I like thus one so far.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than many other hand creams</li>
            <li>Takes that dry feeling off my hands quickly and seems to last well,</li>
            <li>I generally use natural products and sunscreen with zinc and sometimes titanium dioxide too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for a long time because I really like the way it looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for a year now and still have no dark spots on my hands or arms.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and my hands seem softer and less dry.</li>
            <li>After using it for over a year (five tubes worth), I have seen slight improvement.  </li>
            <li>Her hands, first off, were extremely hydrated,</li>
            <li>If anyone is interested about Robanda&#x27;s other products go to [...]</li>
            <li>I apply it on the back of my hands nearly every time I drive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this would happen to anyone else, but apparently there are ingredients that my skin doesn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>So when I finally noticed the age spots and creepiness, I took action.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, it&#x27;s catching up with me.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 tubes at once and will buy it again, it&#x27;s turned alligator skin back to soft supple skin in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>After working outside all the time in harsh enviroments (right now I&#x27;m in Afghanistan)</li>
            <li>After completing a remodel on our home, my hands were destroyed from physical work and chemicals and general abuse.  </li>
            <li>and while I like it after a couple of weeks&#x27; daily use I believe its real value will become apparent after a few months&#x27; use.  </li>

            <li> Love this hand cream!!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li> and then I purchased a very good anti-aging moisturizer that is sold in 2 sizes</li>
            <li> so , as I stated, my buying her this Robanda Hand Cream was an \\&quot; INCREDIBLE value for an INCREDIBLE product.  </li>
            <li> Great Cream send me more!!!</li>
            <li> It is beautifully creamy, but not sticky, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for moisturizing and I like that it contains sunscreen which I guess is why they call it an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; treatment.  </li>
            <li> lotion has a pleasant fragrance, i.e.  it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen to me.  </li>
            <li> Good remedy fir dryness.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a good moisturizer but waaay to greasy.</li>
            <li> I think this product might be good if you wear those gel gloves to bed but not practical for daytime use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a good hand lotion with sunscreen for my car.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma because it had good reviews online</li>
            <li> This really is a good product and have not found any chemical carcinogens listed in</li>
            <li> Good size product for the price as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year with good results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t bother you then it would be good for you.</li>
            <li> This hand lotion is non-greasy, light and best of all has one of the highest SPF&#x27;s of any anti-aging hand lotion I could find.  </li>
            <li> The silkiness of the handcream is quite good, though you can feel that \\&quot;slip\\&quot; you feel with sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Why do most manufacturers of great moisturizers &amp; night creams add fragrance???</li>
            <li> which of course is a great thing because many of us wash our hands throughout he day.  </li>
            <li> Am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I will definately be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with purchase - this is not my first time buying this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite ever!</li>
            <li> It is gradually fading the age spots and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The cream is nice though.  </li>
            <li> The scent was nice and texture was creamy.</li>
            <li> this item is wonderful and really works for my age spots.  </li>
            <li> i have paid $45.00 for creams that were 1/2 AS EFFECTIVE AS</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price although I find the S/H charges rather high when buying in quantity.</li>
            <li> The Price is RIGHT and the product delivers !!!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for the sunscreen, but that&#x27;s a nice perk since they do say that your hands give away your age :)</li>
            <li> it felt great even after the first application.</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was available any longer, and I was very glad to find this seller on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this cream my hands looked better and felt smoother.</li>
            <li> I simply love this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I worked outdoors for most of my teens and twenties.</li>
            <li> Just one more cream to add to the rest.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and would order it again.</li>
            <li> I enjoying having manicured hands</li>
            <li> but I have noticed the skin on my hands is in much better shape.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when my hands get most of their sun exposure.</li>
            <li> It feels like I am taking the best possible care of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering some more in 2 months</li>
            <li> I am sure.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to try it yet.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two more.</li>
            <li> A friend gave this as a gift and ordered more on Amazon because it was $2 cheaper....</li>
            <li> Also my hands are softer and look better.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many many hand creams.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it, and will also buy more myself.</li>
            <li> and at the top of the web site page there is a link to click on that says \\&quot; Store \\&quot;</li>
            <li> then that opens up with 3 more links and to check out all the Robanda products, after you click on store, then click on \\&quot; Products \\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Most things I used didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> My hands look better - the dryness and lines are minimized.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is non-greasy but feels nice on my hands - I like the fact that it has the retinol and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> My hands seem to get more wrinkles from using water, but when I brought this product, the wrinkles seem to smooth out, and my hands looked more youthful and I like the smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This seller shipped this product in new, mint condition; packaged perfectly and shipped super quick as promised.  </li>
            <li> Am sensitive to lots of products so this was a welcome find.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of an anti-aging hand cream -- fading spots and sun protection are really important for my often-forgotten hands.  </li>
            <li> This product really works good.  </li>
            <li> Loved this so much that I gave my bottle to a friend and bought myself another.  </li>
            <li> It does not dmell too strongly of medicine or flowers.</li>
            <li> issue is the unbearably strong soapy, baby lotion-y fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I purchased her the first bottle and within almost 22 weeks she told me how amazing this hand cream was working.  </li>
            <li> It smells fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine for an SPF hand cream while driving.</li>
            <li> Not horrible, but kind of perfumey and old lady smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Helps smooth aging crepy skin</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years now and am still impressed by the results.</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell any benefits from this product that I do not get from a nice hand cream for $6.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands look and feel smooth AND has sunscreen to protect them.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and there is no residual feel or smell.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion a hand cream should be perfume free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives me smooth hands and&lt;br</li>
            <li> If they made this in a fragrance free version, I&#x27;d jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are two hand creams that absorb fast, emollient enough that it&#x27;s not greasy yet provides that perfect sheen to minimize or eliminate your finger &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when it started curdling like a product full of waxes or cheap fillers.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE.i really love the results.it has lightened age spots better than any other, and the softness of my hands is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything - this works so quickly and is so smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It smells WONDERFUL and using it makes my hands feel soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I am 40 and noticing my hands need some help though, so thought maybe my Eucerin hand cream might not be enough, and the reviews were so good with this that I decided to purchase.</li>
            <li> And the silver color is really cool.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, pleasant smell, and is thick and moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> It has a fliptop, which is more convenient than having to screw a separate top back on right after putting lotion all over your hands!</li>
            <li> The cream dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Quick shopping.  </li>
            <li> This hand cream absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Luckily this did not happen inside of my purse.</li>
            <li> I like that it is absorbed quickly and you don&#x27;t have to use alot.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t expect too much and it will be fine.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, a light, fresh smell; absorbs quickly and actually does help my hands to look younger.  </li>
            <li> They had so many wrinkles and looked so old..</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth purchasing and use.  </li>
            <li> It was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> so I use it sparingly (or rarely).  </li>
            <li> After only the first day of using this product my hands look SO much better!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this product due to the good reviews.</li>
            <li> You apply it and it peels right off.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and slight scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> i cannot say how good the product actually works because i never got that far.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much and now has me using it.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth going on, results not &amp;#34;instantaneous&amp;#34; but obviously.  </li>
            <li> This hand cream is very moisturizing,lightly scented and very suited to the special needs of aging hands.  </li>
            <li> Only get this if you can find a fragrance free version!    </li>
            <li> It is soft and light, not sticky.</li>
            <li> They are pretty hands again thanks to this stuff!</li>
            <li> But I do like the hand cream and will most likely order it again.</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The packaging is also good - the cap snaps closed securely, so I don&#x27;t worry about it coming open in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hand cream locally first.  </li>
            <li> And after two weeks of consistent use (2-3 times a day) I have reduced the darkness of my age spots about 50%.  </li>
            <li> The first through another company and noticed it here, so tried it again.  </li>
            <li> Then after the first month she told me that her \\&quot; age spots \\&quot; were indeed fading away PLUS</li>
            <li> That is ONE of the MANY reasons people should exfoliate their faces with either a facial scrub, or by using a Clarisonic or any hand held powered scrub brush</li>
            <li> Most likely will not order it again.</li>
            <li> But, this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> The heat sealed end of the tube is defective and the first time I squeezed the tube lotion flew everywhere.</li>
            <li> There are so incredibly many hand creams/lotions available, I surprised myself when my first tube was almost empty</li>
            <li> There were less wrinkles and dryness for sure!</li>
            <li> This one has quickly faded the spots that were developing and my hands stay soft even after washing.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes your hands soft .  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and blends well and has only a very mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li> certainly doesn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> Boy didn&#x27;t realize I had to write a certain amount of words</li>
            <li> I will certainly keep this product on hand</li>
            <li> I feel like I need moisturizers during the day when using this product in the morning, although the fine lines that can emerge after multiple hand-washings aren&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light, and it&#x27;s less waxy/more easily absorbed than the OPI and other hand creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It made my hands look so much younger and smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> no matter how much I lather on</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and have really noticed an improvement in the appearance of my hands.  </li>
            <li> and for me, the smell really is off putting.  </li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Robanda without any real hopes of this product working.</li>
            <li> so her veins are very visible</li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to read all of this...</li>
            <li> , I never know when to shut up, and when I give a review of anything I had purchased, I get very detail oriented and</li>
            <li> Product is really unusable at this point.</li>
            <li> I really like the light-to-nothing scent and the luminescent properties, which were both a real bonus in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had bought this product a few years ago and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Since Neutrogena discontinued their anti-aging hand cream with spf, this one is just as good if not better!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll probably do some more research and see if there are any other alternatives in this price range.</li>
            <li> so I searched for Robanda on Amazon and was pleased to not only find it available, but the price was nearly half of what I had paid for y e a r s!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like I have a new set of hands!</li>
            <li> I just found out from ASAP beauty that the original was 20 spf with a different whitening agent and this is the new version.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell -</li>
            <li> By exfoliating the facial skin or the skin all over the body, by exfoliating it helps the new skin to glow after the 28 days pass and the old skin is going down the drain and the newer skin looks healthy, vibrant and very well moisturized !!!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this hand cream because it had high ratings</li>
            <li> I look for skin products with a lot of moisturizers and extras like high lactic acid content, ceramides and vitamin c.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I KNOW for a fact she would HIGHLY recommend using Robanda as an Anti-Aging hand Cream while also helping to moisturize her hands while also getting rid of the hyper pigmented \\&quot; spots...</li>
            <li> I love the retinol in it especially since I live in a Southern climate.</li>
            <li> , I have this cheap perfume smell and bitter taste from the chemicals this hand lotion contains.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use long enough to see if my hands were smoother, so I can&#x27;t attest to that.  </li>
            <li> The Robanda Anti-Aging Hand Cream not only healed my dry skin, but it really did reduce some of the age spots, show signs of firmer skin and gave my hands an overall more dewy, youthful appearance - not to sound like a commercial, but it just did what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the product in that department, but I can definitely say that wrinkles/ fine lines and texture are definitely under control all day when I use this in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing cream, too soon to tell how good it is for anti ageing, but any sunscreen on the hands has to prevent further damage, and it is hard to find a hand cream with sunscreen at this low a price.</li>
            <li> When it no longer was available at the local beauty supply store I went online to find it and have ordered it several times.  </li>
            <li> My hands were somewhat wrinkled and had some age spots, very old for my age.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> To avoid the slick feeling on my fingers, I mostly concentrate this stuff on the backs of my hands.  </li>
            <li> Since the first bottle I had purchased for her, I dropped a hint that she should use her Robanda only at night, just before she goes to bed</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong and I find it harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and had two on one hand and one large one on my inner arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dryness was starting to be a large issue as well.</li>
            <li> think the pricesis fine - like another reviewer, I only use it on the back of my hands and have used about a fifth of it in the last weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it has more than just a light scent and the smell</li>
            <li> My manicurist, friends &amp; family always gives me compliments on how soft and young looking my hands are.  </li>
            <li> I am 41 years old</li>
            <li> and it made me wonder how old the product might be?  </li>
            <li> also think it&#x27;s reasonably priced, especially considering that my alternative seemed to be purchasing a $15 bottle of face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like a dream not like the striggle with my old latex.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, but this is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> Because of this and the use of hand sanitizers my skin was beginning to look old and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> Of course, I wash them frequently through out the day</li>
            <li> This hand cream leaves your hands soft; that is what I like.</li>
            <li> Keeps the hands soft for a longer period of time, and even diminishes the brown age spots that can occur.  </li>
            <li> I like thus one so far.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than many other hand creams</li>
            <li> Takes that dry feeling off my hands quickly and seems to last well,</li>
            <li> I generally use natural products and sunscreen with zinc and sometimes titanium dioxide too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for a long time because I really like the way it looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a year now and still have no dark spots on my hands or arms.</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily and my hands seem softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> After using it for over a year (five tubes worth), I have seen slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> Her hands, first off, were extremely hydrated,</li>
            <li> If anyone is interested about Robanda&#x27;s other products go to [...]</li>
            <li> I apply it on the back of my hands nearly every time I drive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this would happen to anyone else, but apparently there are ingredients that my skin doesn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> So when I finally noticed the age spots and creepiness, I took action.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s catching up with me.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 tubes at once and will buy it again, it&#x27;s turned alligator skin back to soft supple skin in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> After working outside all the time in harsh enviroments (right now I&#x27;m in Afghanistan)</li>
            <li> After completing a remodel on our home, my hands were destroyed from physical work and chemicals and general abuse.  </li>
            <li> and while I like it after a couple of weeks&#x27; daily use I believe its real value will become apparent after a few months&#x27; use.  </li>
            <li> So Robands has natural ingredients in it that helps to inhibit the production in the skin of her hands, and the skin renews itself every 28 days and then new skin \\&quot; pops into place \\&quot; and by inhibiting thee production of melanin, the new skin has not been affected by UV exposure, and then 28 days pass again, new skin appears with less and less of the uneven skin tone from the melanin.  </li>
            <li> If my fingers feel dry, I use a small amount of one of my regular lotions first, then after a minute or two I apply this stuff.  </li>
            <li> right before she goes to bed and the combination of BOTH hand creams have definitely moisturized and plumped up her \\&quot; thin skin \\&quot; on the backs of her hands, her cuticles are, in her words \\&quot;</li>
            <li> It absorbs will into your skin and turns dried rough skin back to soft in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> Dab a bit on the back of one hand and rub it to the back of the other, thus conserving/stretching my supply.</li>
            <li> This is the first bathing cap that fits my long thick hair and even keeps is somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> The only major brand I found with sun protection in it is so heavy that it makes me feel hot/sticky if I apply it during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was probably the most disappointing things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really did show a decrease in dark spots on my hands in a few days..</li>
            <li> Once I started looking for a hand lotion with SPF in it, I was surprised at how few I could find on the drugstore shelves.  </li>
            <li> I have a long commute each day and noticed my hands are in the sun a lot because of that.</li>
            <li> This is another product in the long list of products I&#x27;ve tried to age gracefully.  </li>
            <li> I used another product previously that worked just as well but was more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have found and none did anything other than moisturize until the next hand washing.</li>
            <li> While looking for the Robanda hand Cream I came across A LOT of other skin care products made by Robanda like an exfoliating facial wash, an Anti-aging Serum,  Intensive Night Cream,  Anti-Aging moisturizer with sunscreen, Neck Firming Cream, an Eye Treatment cream, Anti-Aging hand cream, etc...etc...etc...  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s too dry</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and am convinced that I have less age spots on my hands than others my age.  </li>
            <li> My hands look less lined, smoother and with fewer age spots; however the larger age spots remain.  </li>
            <li> have eczema and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> ( the head of the brush is NOT stiff or hard, but by it rotating on your face with whatever facial cleanser you are using, that also helps to exfoliate the facial skin, and the hands, feet and body should also be exfoliated at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> I think this probably works well, but cannot stand the heavy perfume fragrance they added, so don&#x27;t use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> I carefully read all the questions and answers posted for this product.  </li>
            <li> before you know it I had spent close to an hour typing out the review...</li>
            <li> This product just has the regular chemical sunscreens and shea butter half way down on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I gave him the other 1/2 of the tube I was using,</li>
            <li> I usually order several at once.</li>
            <li> Due to work my hands are contantly being washed.</li>
            <li> , 1 is in a 17 ounce bottle and the other is in a \\&quot; purse size \\&quot; 3.5 ounce bottle and it is an Anti-Aging body moisturizer</li>
            <li> In fact, it is so greasy that I have to wipe down my palms with a wet napkin after applying it.</li>
            <li> The skin on the back of my hands was really thin and felt fragile.  </li>
            <li> I could be dreaming, but I truly think this product has made the surface of my hands smoother, brighter, and less aged looking.  </li>
            <li> Slightly greasy, but I expected that with these ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does seem to fade the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my hands look much younger, or at least not so that anyone would notice.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that this cream is fading dark spots and eliminating crepiness.</li>
            <li> dark spots on my hands are&lt;br /&gt;beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of minimal nightly use, my hands are no longer dry appearing and the age byproduct of constant washing has decreased.</li>
            <li> It has a slight sunblock smell to it too.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel like they helped my hands look any less wrinkled though,</li>
            <li> Within a week I saw my hands looking less spotty and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Also if I use it twice a day, my hands get a slight rash, so I just use it at night now.  </li>
            <li> are almost gone after using Robanda for almost a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> is nothing less of a miracle.  </li>
            <li> The product has a slight perfume smell which I like.  </li>
            <li> I usually go for non scented hand lotions as I am picky about smells and don&#x27;t want my hand lotion competing with any other scent I may be wearing.</li>
            <li> Knowing your hands show your age, I wanted to help them out a little.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s probably a little pricey just for a hand lotion.</li>
            <li> the density of the skin on her hands became a little thicker so her veins in her hands was not as noticeable,</li>
            <li> and she also had \\&quot; age spots, sun spots, liver spots, however anyone describes an uneven skin tone in targeted areas on the hands</li>
            <li> are/ were Melanin concentrated in areas creating moles, freckles and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It is too heavy for me and my hands just feel irritated.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product or the vendor who sold it to me through Amazon, but the bottle came worn down a bit</li>
            <li> so thought it would be worth it but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> No better than cream</li>
            <li> If this had been sitting on their shelf past the expiration date, then, I was jipped.  </li>
            <li> If there has been a change, it has been very slight &amp; I&#x27;ve had the product for over a month and use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Bes hand creqam for dark spots and for thin skin.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed it in, thinking it at least was sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and yes I was still hoping for at least the dryness to go away</li>
            <li> I hope this was of some use to at least ONE person.  </li>
            <li> and again I hope this helps at least ONE person.  </li>
            <li> So, if i could give negative stars for a defective product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> my hands were really looking horrible!</li>
            <li> One tube was broken and the lotion spilled all over the package ...</li>
            <li> It is so thin and didn&#x27;t feel moist, or even oily/ greasy.</li>
            <li> I get tired of wearing gloves everywhere.</li>
            <li> absorb without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Would not pay this expensive price again.</li>
            <li> Sorry Ladies, I see no difference in my hands.  </li>
            <li> She has very \\&quot; thin \\&quot; skin</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> , that is annoying!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews online. I had purchased a $40 anti-aging hand cream from Elemis Spa and saw no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this cream my hands looked better and felt smoother. The SPF is an added bonus. The cream dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because I wish it didn&#x27;t smell like sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product really works good.  My hands seem to get more wrinkles from using water, but when I brought this product, the wrinkles seem to smooth out, and my hands looked more youthful and I like the smell.  I will definitely be buying ths product in the future.</li>
            <li> It smells fine but it just doesn&#x27;t work.  So don&#x27;t expect too much and it will be fine.  Plus it states that there&#x27;s a bleaching agent in the cream.</li>
            <li> I simply love this lotion. It is like nothing I have ever used. It made my hands look so much younger and smooth. We&#x27;ll definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-aging hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used!  My manicurist, friends &amp; family always gives me compliments on how soft and young looking my hands are.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is the best ever.  It is gradually fading the age spots and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Non greasy. Good remedy fir dryness. Helps smooth aging crepy skin</li>
            <li> I think this probably works well, but cannot stand the heavy perfume fragrance they added, so don&#x27;t use it regularly.  Only get this if you can find a fragrance free version!    Why do most manufacturers of great moisturizers &amp; night creams add fragrance???</li>
            <li> No better than cream I already use.&lt;br /&gt;Does absorb without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Would not pay this expensive price again. Goodbye</li>
            <li> I have tried everything - this works so quickly and is so smooth and creamy.  Love it!  GO BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does seem to fade the dark spots on my hands. It is soft and light, not sticky. I use it every night at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This cream does make my sun spots lighter but it hasn&#x27;t made them go away.  It is pleasantly-scented, non-greasy, and absorbs well into my skin. I like that it contains retinol.  After using it for over a year (five tubes worth), I have seen slight improvement.  Don&#x27;t expect results to rave about.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this product due to the good reviews. Yes, it is a good moisturizer but waaay to greasy. Be prepared to leave greasy finger marks on everything you touch. In fact, it is so greasy that I have to wipe down my palms with a wet napkin after applying it. I think this product might be good if you wear those gel gloves to bed but not practical for daytime use. I plan to return.</li>
            <li> After only the first day of using this product my hands look SO much better! After working outside all the time in harsh enviroments (right now I&#x27;m in Afghanistan) my hands were really looking horrible! They had so many wrinkles and looked so old..but after I started using this lotion it&#x27;s like I have a new set of hands! They are pretty hands again thanks to this stuff! I will definately be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and I worked outdoors for most of my teens and twenties. Needless to say, it&#x27;s catching up with me. My hands were somewhat wrinkled and had some age spots, very old for my age. Anyway, this cream has actually made a big difference. I have tried every had cream I have found and none did anything other than moisturize until the next hand washing. This one has quickly faded the spots that were developing and my hands stay soft even after washing. I was amazed and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work for me. My spots are still there.  Just one more cream to add to the rest.  The cream is nice though.  Darn it.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product or the vendor who sold it to me through Amazon, but the bottle came worn down a bit and it made me wonder how old the product might be?  If this had been sitting on their shelf past the expiration date, then, I was jipped.  It does soften hands but as to whether or not I&#x27;ve seen improvement in age spots? If there has been a change, it has been very slight &amp; I&#x27;ve had the product for over a month and use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years now and am still impressed by the results. Use it on my arms and legs as well as my hands.Am sensitive to lots of products so this was a welcome find. Amazon has the best price although I find the S/H charges rather high when buying in quantity.</li>
            <li> I usually go for non scented hand lotions as I am picky about smells and don&#x27;t want my hand lotion competing with any other scent I may be wearing. I am 40 and noticing my hands need some help though, so thought maybe my Eucerin hand cream might not be enough, and the reviews were so good with this that I decided to purchase. I don&#x27;t care for this scent at all. Not horrible, but kind of perfumey and old lady smell in my opinion. I will only use this at night before bed. I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness as I haven&#x27;t used it enough and haven&#x27;t noticed a improvement when I do.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and am convinced that I have less age spots on my hands than others my age.  I apply it on the back of my hands nearly every time I drive. Dab a bit on the back of one hand and rub it to the back of the other, thus conserving/stretching my supply. Purchased it @ a local beauty supply store for y e a r s...then...it was out of stock so I searched for Robanda on Amazon and was pleased to not only find it available, but the price was nearly half of what I had paid for y e a r s!</li>
            <li> One tube was broken and the lotion spilled all over the package ... Ugh!  I like the feel of the cream</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream!!!  Quick shopping.  No problems at all would definitely order again. Don&#x27;t want to be without this product.</li>
            <li> Have been on the hunt for a hand cream that will help with the crepiness of my hands.  I tried this and whatever may be in the ingredients, made the back of my hands itch.  I don&#x27;t know if this would happen to anyone else, but apparently there are ingredients that my skin doesn&#x27;t like.  I wasn&#x27;t able to use long enough to see if my hands were smoother, so I can&#x27;t attest to that.  The scent was nice and texture was creamy.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, pleasant smell, and is thick and moisturizing without being greasy. It absorbs easily and my hands seem softer and less dry. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction of sun spots/aka &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;. But I do like the hand cream and will most likely order it again.</li>
            <li> This hand cream absorbs quickly into the skin. This lotion is not too greasy.  I love it, and would order it again.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is very moisturizing,lightly scented and very suited to the special needs of aging hands.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I immediately seen a difference, it&#x27;s lightening the age spots thus leaving the hands looking younger and healthier. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing cream, too soon to tell how good it is for anti ageing, but any sunscreen on the hands has to prevent further damage, and it is hard to find a hand cream with sunscreen at this low a price. I just found out from ASAP beauty that the original was 20 spf with a different whitening agent and this is the new version. So time will tell.</li>
            <li> Once I started looking for a hand lotion with SPF in it, I was surprised at how few I could find on the drugstore shelves.  The only major brand I found with sun protection in it is so heavy that it makes me feel hot/sticky if I apply it during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even bought a couple of different face moisturizers with sunscreen to try out as a hand protecting lotion.  Everything made my fingers feel slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a pleasant fragrance, i.e.  it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen to me.  It absorbs pretty well.  To avoid the slick feeling on my fingers, I mostly concentrate this stuff on the backs of my hands.  If my fingers feel dry, I use a small amount of one of my regular lotions first, then after a minute or two I apply this stuff.  But if I only have room for one tube in my purse, I think this absorbs well enough to serve as regular hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think it&#x27;s reasonably priced, especially considering that my alternative seemed to be purchasing a $15 bottle of face moisturizer.  The tube looks larger to me than it did in the picture on Amazon.  It has a fliptop, which is more convenient than having to screw a separate top back on right after putting lotion all over your hands!</li>
            <li> After researching a hand cream with sunscreen, at my hand therapists suggestion (to protect a scar on my hand from the sun) I chose this lotion.  At 36 I am a former smoker and my hands are starting to show their age, so since I was going to be putting on lotion, i figured I might as well get something anti-aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to use this after every time I wash my hands.  It smells great, a light, fresh smell; absorbs quickly and actually does help my hands to look younger.  I recommend it to all my friends and co workers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product the first time I used it.  It took my red fingernail polish off!  I enjoying having manicured hands so I dont think this will work out for me.</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell any benefits from this product that I do not get from a nice hand cream for $6.</li>
            <li> This is the first bathing cap that fits my long thick hair and even keeps is somewhat dry. It goes on like a dream not like the striggle with my old latex. And the silver color is really cool.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion at night before bedtime. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good but I have noticed the skin on my hands is in much better shape.</li>
            <li> This is an anti-aging hand cream - not a moisturizing cream, per se - and while I like it after a couple of weeks&#x27; daily use I believe its real value will become apparent after a few months&#x27; use.  I feel like I need moisturizers during the day when using this product in the morning, although the fine lines that can emerge after multiple hand-washings aren&#x27;t a problem.  I don&#x27;t have age spots to erase or hide so can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the product in that department, but I can definitely say that wrinkles/ fine lines and texture are definitely under control all day when I use this in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It makes my hands look and feel smooth AND has sunscreen to protect them. I have a long commute each day and noticed my hands are in the sun a lot because of that. Knowing your hands show your age, I wanted to help them out a little. The cream smells a bit like sunscreen, but since I specifically wanted sunscreen, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bes hand creqam for dark spots and for thin skin.  I am very happy with purchase - this is not my first time buying this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I just switched from  OPI Avoplex to this Robanda since it was a bit cheaper than OPI.  I love it!  The scent is nice and light, and it&#x27;s less waxy/more easily absorbed than the OPI and other hand creams I&#x27;ve tried.  The packaging is also good - the cap snaps closed securely, so I don&#x27;t worry about it coming open in my purse.  I didn&#x27;t buy it for the sunscreen, but that&#x27;s a nice perk since they do say that your hands give away your age :)</li>
            <li> I carefully read all the questions and answers posted for this product.  I&#x27;m afraid it has more than just a light scent and the smell certainly doesn&#x27;t go away.  The smell is quite strong and I find it harsh.  So I cant comment on the efficacy of the product because I cant use it.</li>
            <li> no odor and I use it nightly.  It goes on smoothly and there is no residual feel or smell.  I recommend</li>
            <li> Since Neutrogena discontinued their anti-aging hand cream with spf, this one is just as good if not better!  Miss the price of Neutrogena though!</li>
            <li> I bought this hand cream because it had high ratings and it had SPF in it too.  However, it&#x27;s too dry no matter how much I lather on.  It is not emollient like Loccitane Shea Butter Hand Cream or the Origins Hand Treatment (Victoria Beckham Fave a while ago) for example.  These are two hand creams that absorb fast, emollient enough that it&#x27;s not greasy yet provides that perfect sheen to minimize or eliminate your finger &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;. I am going to stick with these from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this scent is way way too overbearing.  Sometimes if I accidentally touch/graze my lips with my hands after I put this lotion on, I have this cheap perfume smell and bitter taste from the chemicals this hand lotion contains.  It has a slight sunblock smell to it too.  I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Did not see a noticeable improvement with this cream.  It is more expensive than many other hand creams so thought it would be worth it but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for weeks, I have not seen ANY results since I started using whatsoever....!  I would not buy this product again...!</li>
            <li> It really works.  The skin on the back of my hands was really thin and felt fragile.  After using 1/2 of the tube, it feels and looks lots thicker and nicer to me.  I got my daughter to start using it too and gave her one of my tubes of the three I just ordered and recieve.  My grandson had a constant scab and he used my tube I was using and I gave him the other 1/2 of the tube I was using,</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth purchasing and use.  My wife likes it very much and now has me using it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It absorbs quickly and makes your hands soft .  I love the retinol in it especially since I live in a Southern climate.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product. After using it and then looking at the ingredients I wondered why I bought it at all. It is so thin and didn&#x27;t feel moist, or even oily/ greasy. It was watery. I rubbed it in, thinking it at least was sunscreen. That&#x27;s when it started curdling like a product full of waxes or cheap fillers. It didn&#x27;t even soak in or stay on. You apply it and it peels right off. I am so angry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a good hand lotion with sunscreen for my car. That&#x27;s when my hands get most of their sun exposure. This product just has the regular chemical sunscreens and shea butter half way down on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema and very dry skin. I also have a sun sensitivity (Lupus). I get tired of wearing gloves everywhere. I generally use natural products and sunscreen with zinc and sometimes titanium dioxide too. I look for skin products with a lot of moisturizers and extras like high lactic acid content, ceramides and vitamin c. This product rates at the bottom of hundreds of lotions and sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and have really noticed an improvement in the appearance of my hands.  It is my favorite ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this hand cream locally first.  After completing a remodel on our home, my hands were destroyed from physical work and chemicals and general abuse.  This cream is so silky and softening.  It absorbs will into your skin and turns dried rough skin back to soft in a very short time.  I bought 3 tubes at once and will buy it again, it&#x27;s turned alligator skin back to soft supple skin in a very short time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very smooth going on, results not &amp;#34;instantaneous&amp;#34; but obviously.  Not greasy and slight scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like the feel off this lotion going on and it makes my skin feel very soft.  It feels like I am taking the best possible care of my hands.  I can&#x27;t say my hands look much younger, or at least not so that anyone would notice.  Still I like the way my hands feel now and I feel like I am pampering myself everytime I put this on.  I have already repurchased which says a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year now and still have no dark spots on my hands or arms. I used another product previously that worked just as well but was more expensive.</li>
            <li> this item is wonderful and really works for my age spots.  It also helps the growth of my nails.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like that it is absorbed quickly and you don&#x27;t have to use alot.  I&#x27;m hoping that it will prevent age spots and perhaps fade the ones I have.  Those spots seem to have faded but we will see with time.  For now Like all Robanda products  -  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great Cream send me more!!! I will be ordering some more in 2 months I am sure.  Boy didn&#x27;t realize I had to write a certain amount of words, that is annoying!</li>
            <li> I could be dreaming, but I truly think this product has made the surface of my hands smoother, brighter, and less aged looking.  I use it religiously before going out of the house.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and blends well and has only a very mild fragrance.  There are so incredibly many hand creams/lotions available, I surprised myself when my first tube was almost empty and I decided I thought it was working well enough that I not only bought a second tube, but  an additional one as a gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma because it had good reviews online so I hope she likes it.  Haven&#x27;t been able to try it yet.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product a few years ago and really liked it.  However, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was available any longer, and I was very glad to find this seller on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.  Emollient with sunscreen.  Takes that dry feeling off my hands quickly and seems to last well,</li>
            <li> This product is great for moisturizing and I like that it contains sunscreen which I guess is why they call it an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; treatment.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and the brown spots on my hands have not diminished at all.  So it&#x27;s probably a little pricey just for a hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, but this is a bit overpowering. It&#x27;s almost like the company tried to mask the smell of sunscreen with an overpowering perfume smell. Not the smell I like, but it&#x27;s fine for an SPF hand cream while driving.</li>
            <li> Not moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Robanda hand cream for about two weeks and noticed a definite improvement in my hands. My age spots have faded, including the one that almost felt &amp;#34;raised&amp;#34;. It isn&#x27;t any longer. I highly recommend this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I used this product to the very last bit in the container and it does not work. Not at all.</li>
            <li> This hand cream with SPF and anti-aging ingredients is an product.  The scent is very light and smells great.  It has helped my hands and arms to look years younger.  I like to give this to my friends as a gift so they will try it.  Once you try it, you&#x27;ll be hooked on it too.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream. It smells WONDERFUL and using it makes my hands feel soft and deeply moisturized. I do believe that this cream is fading dark spots and eliminating crepiness. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The positives are is that this is paraben-free, not animal tested and contains a sunscreen.  And after two weeks of consistent use (2-3 times a day) I have reduced the darkness of my age spots about 50%.  I feel after another two weeks they will hopefully fade entirely. I&#x27;m 47 and had two on one hand and one large one on my inner arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like they helped my hands look any less wrinkled though, and for me, the smell really is off putting.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, but it&#x27;s one of those overpowering perfumy smells that lingers for about 45-60 minutes.  That was probably the most disappointing things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pricesis fine - like another reviewer, I only use it on the back of my hands and have used about a fifth of it in the last weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase it again - maybe - but I&#x27;ll probably do some more research and see if there are any other alternatives in this price range.</li>
            <li> it felt great even after the first application. by day 3 i could see the difference in my hands. I have ordered two more.</li>
            <li> A friend gave this as a gift and ordered more on Amazon because it was $2 cheaper....It really did show a decrease in dark spots on my hands in a few days.. Also my hands are softer and look better. This really is a good product and have not found any chemical carcinogens listed in ingredients- but continuing to do research to see if there any chemicals used..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for a long time because I really like the way it looks and feels.  I usually order several at once.</li>
            <li> Loved this so much that I gave my bottle to a friend and bought myself another.  Really works.  Within a week I saw my hands looking less spotty and smoother.  There were less wrinkles and dryness for sure!</li>
            <li> Due to work my hands are contantly being washed. Because of this and the use of hand sanitizers my skin was beginning to look old and wrinkled. Dryness was starting to be a large issue as well. I purchased Robanda without any real hopes of this product working. After a few weeks of minimal nightly use, my hands are no longer dry appearing and the age byproduct of constant washing has decreased. I will certainly keep this product on hand and I am considering purchasing some of their face creams and washes as well. Good size product for the price as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many many hand creams. i have paid $45.00 for creams that were 1/2 AS EFFECTIVE AS THIS ONE.i really love the results.it has lightened age spots better than any other, and the softness of my hands is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this hand cream.  The first through another company and noticed it here, so tried it again.  Sorry Ladies, I see no difference in my hands.  Of course, I wash them frequently through out the day and yes I was still hoping for at least the dryness to go away if nothing else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year with good results.  My hands look less lined, smoother and with fewer age spots; however the larger age spots remain.  Also if I use it twice a day, my hands get a slight rash, so I just use it at night now.  It&#x27;s a good product and I would recommend it, and will also buy more myself.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Robanda Anti-Aging Hand cream because one day when we were in the car she was telling me how un-happy she was with the looks of her hands.  She has very \\&quot; thin \\&quot; skin so her veins are very visible and she also had \\&quot; age spots, sun spots, liver spots, however anyone describes an uneven skin tone in targeted areas on the hands and I remember reading about Robanda in 1 of the dozens of skin care catalogues I get, so I purchased her the first bottle and within almost 22 weeks she told me how amazing this hand cream was working.  Her hands, first off, were extremely hydrated, which of course is a great thing because many of us wash our hands throughout he day.  Then after the first month she told me that her \\&quot; age spots \\&quot; were indeed fading away PLUS the density of the skin on her hands became a little thicker so her veins in her hands was not as noticeable, so , as I stated, my buying her this Robanda Hand Cream was an \\&quot; INCREDIBLE value for an INCREDIBLE product.  Since the first bottle I had purchased for her, I dropped a hint that she should use her Robanda only at night, just before she goes to bed so she could reserve it and then I purchased a very good anti-aging moisturizer that is sold in 2 sizes, 1 is in a 17 ounce bottle and the other is in a \\&quot; purse size \\&quot; 3.5 ounce bottle and it is an Anti-Aging body moisturizer and so she uses that throughout the day while saving her Robandda to use at the end of her day right before she goes to bed and the combination of BOTH hand creams have definitely moisturized and plumped up her \\&quot; thin skin \\&quot; on the backs of her hands, her cuticles are, in her words \\&quot; AMAZING\\&quot; and her \\&quot; Age Spots \\&quot; are almost gone after using Robanda for almost a year and a half.  I have seen the \\&quot; Before \\&quot; of her hands, before using Robanda and I have also seem the almost a year of using Robanda and the change in the look of her hands is nothing less of a miracle.  I KNOW for a fact she would HIGHLY recommend using Robanda as an Anti-Aging hand Cream while also helping to moisturize her hands while also getting rid of the hyper pigmented \\&quot; spots...age spots : on her hands.  The Price is RIGHT and the product delivers !!!  It does NOT \\&quot; bleach \\&quot; the skin, it has ingredients in it that inhibits the production of melanin...melanin is basically what happens when exposed to the Suns UV Rays, melanin is the suntan after being in the sun and after it rises to the surface of the skin and when it is oxidized, when oxygen and melanin meet, a suntan occurs, and those \\&quot; Age Spots \\&quot; are/ were Melanin concentrated in areas creating moles, freckles and uneven skin tone.  So Robands has natural ingredients in it that helps to inhibit the production in the skin of her hands, and the skin renews itself every 28 days and then new skin \\&quot; pops into place \\&quot; and by inhibiting thee production of melanin, the new skin has not been affected by UV exposure, and then 28 days pass again, new skin appears with less and less of the uneven skin tone from the melanin.  That is ONE of the MANY reasons people should exfoliate their faces with either a facial scrub, or by using a Clarisonic or any hand held powered scrub brush ( the head of the brush is NOT stiff or hard, but by it rotating on your face with whatever facial cleanser you are using, that also helps to exfoliate the facial skin, and the hands, feet and body should also be exfoliated at least once a week.  By exfoliating the facial skin or the skin all over the body, by exfoliating it helps the new skin to glow after the 28 days pass and the old skin is going down the drain and the newer skin looks healthy, vibrant and very well moisturized !!!  I hope this was of some use to at least ONE person.  While looking for the Robanda hand Cream I came across A LOT of other skin care products made by Robanda like an exfoliating facial wash, an Anti-aging Serum,  Intensive Night Cream,  Anti-Aging moisturizer with sunscreen, Neck Firming Cream, an Eye Treatment cream, Anti-Aging hand cream, etc...etc...etc...  If anyone is interested about Robanda&#x27;s other products go to [...] and at the top of the web site page there is a link to click on that says \\&quot; Store \\&quot; then that opens up with 3 more links and to check out all the Robanda products, after you click on store, then click on \\&quot; Products \\&quot; ... and again I hope this helps at least ONE person.  Thanks for taking the time to read all of this...it&#x27;s like when I am on the telephone, I never know when to shut up, and when I give a review of anything I had purchased, I get very detail oriented and before you know it I had spent close to an hour typing out the review...just like I did with THIS one !!!  Have a GREAT weekend everyone !!!  - Rick</li>
            <li> This hand cream leaves your hands soft; that is what I like. What I don&#x27;t like is that it has a perfume smell. In my opinion a hand cream should be perfume free. Anything you touch such as food will stink of perfume. If this doesn&#x27;t bother you then it would be good for you. I gave mine away to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind perfume on their hands.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used.  Keeps the hands soft for a longer period of time, and even diminishes the brown age spots that can occur.  Try it...you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It took a few months of use, each night a generous amount on the tops of my hands, but this product really worked well in diminishing brown spots on my hands.  Am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for hand lotion. I like thus one so far. It does not dmell too strongly of medicine or flowers. I took pics of my hands and time will tell if the anti-aging componant works. I will take pics again in a month and see what I think. Otherwise, works well as a mouisturizer.  Slightly greasy, but I expected that with these ingredients.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. It is too heavy for me and my hands just feel irritated. Most likely will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Our hands are always the last thing we tend to &amp;#34;work on&amp;#34; for aging.  So when I finally noticed the age spots and creepiness, I took action.  Most things I used didn&#x27;t work.  But, this stuff really works!  Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> i cannot say how good the product actually works because i never got that far. The heat sealed end of the tube is defective and the first time I squeezed the tube lotion flew everywhere. Luckily this did not happen inside of my purse. Product is really unusable at this point. So, if i could give negative stars for a defective product. I would do so.</li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or oily.  My hands look better - the dryness and lines are minimized.  The product has a slight perfume smell which I like.  It was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me smooth hands and&lt;br /&gt;my dark spots on my hands are&lt;br /&gt;beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is non-greasy but feels nice on my hands - I like the fact that it has the retinol and sunscreen.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I purchased some of this hand cream a year ago at a salon so the price for my recent purchase at Amazon was a definite cost saving decision. I cannot say this hand cream has removed all the age spots on my hands since I do not faithfully use it every day, but I can say it has reduced the appearance of several of the spots and does make my hands softer when I use it. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This hand lotion is non-greasy, light and best of all has one of the highest SPF&#x27;s of any anti-aging hand lotion I could find.  The Robanda Anti-Aging Hand Cream not only healed my dry skin, but it really did reduce some of the age spots, show signs of firmer skin and gave my hands an overall more dewy, youthful appearance - not to sound like a commercial, but it just did what it said it would do.  I really like the light-to-nothing scent and the luminescent properties, which were both a real bonus in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller shipped this product in new, mint condition; packaged perfectly and shipped super quick as promised.  I will definitely buy this product again and again - and I will buy from this seller again as well!  A great experience all around!</li>
            <li> This is another product in the long list of products I&#x27;ve tried to age gracefully.  This product does not deliver as advertised.  Basically just another hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this hand lotion for 5 years. When it no longer was available at the local beauty supply store I went online to find it and have ordered it several times.  It is beautifully creamy, but not sticky, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of an anti-aging hand cream -- fading spots and sun protection are really important for my often-forgotten hands.  The silkiness of the handcream is quite good, though you can feel that \\&quot;slip\\&quot; you feel with sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is the unbearably strong soapy, baby lotion-y fragrance.  It conflicts with my perfumes and I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell - so I use it sparingly (or rarely).  If they made this in a fragrance free version, I&#x27;d jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;ll stick to the Paula&#x27;s Choice Resist anti-aging hand cream.</li>
