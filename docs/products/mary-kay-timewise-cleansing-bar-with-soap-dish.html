            <li> I have purchase this soap as a gift for a friend in the past. She encouraged me to try it. My skin felt so good after using it. I am surprised that Mary Kay does not promote the bar soap more. I have not used it long enough to evaluate the long term effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin and this facial bar works for me. It&#x27;s a quick regimen and lasts a long time. Great value for price.</li>
            <li> I just love this cleanser.  It is the 3 in 1, but in bar instead do liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts much longer.  First time I have tried the bar and now will always use it.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and got it fast!&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased !!</li>

            <li> This is the best face soap I have ever used. It works well for my oily and acne skin. I use it severely times a day to minimize the oil in my skin.</li>

            <li> This soap is great for the face . I will order this again in bluk when I run out, Great product.</li>
            <li> This is  a fantastic product. I have used it for years and years. Even though its for your face, I use it on my arms and back to control acne. It lathers up so well yet lasts for ever and ever, months if you use it sparingly . Best investment for the money.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and was sealed well. I love this soap. It lasts a really long time if you just use it on your face but it is a fantastic soap for the whole body. Its very moisturizing and leaves your skin very soft and smooth</li>

            <li> Great and well made product!</li>
            <li> This is a great face bar that my 93 year old mother can&#x27;t live without.  It does not burn her eyes when she thoroughly washed her face.  It would be nice if they designed their bars like the amway soap bar where when you get to the end of the bar, it molds into the next bar and you NEVER have bar ends or ANY waste.  Nonetheless I use it to the very end.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast delivery. Will be ordering again. My husband uses this product and ran out. He told me after the fact and I placed my order. We both were very happy with the turn around time.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who breaks out in whatever soap she uses, with this product her hands get clean and her skin does not break out or get overly dry.  Kudos Mary Kay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great for Hypo-Allergenic skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS PRODUCT NOW FOR YEARS AND WOULD NOT DO WITH OUT. EXCELLENT MARY KAY SOAP BAR AND GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> Use this daily. I was very pleased with my purchase. It came in very quickly and I actually saved money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, MANY different cleansers on my face over the years, but stopped even looking after I started using Mary Kay Timewise Cleansing Bar! I like the way it gets sudsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My skin is very sensitive to chemicals, especially fragrances, and this does not irritate my skin!!</li>
