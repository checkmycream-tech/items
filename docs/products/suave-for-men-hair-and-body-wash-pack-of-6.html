            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love the price!</li>
            <li>This body wash smells nice and cleans my body well</li>
            <li>I love Suave anything because it is cheaper than alot of its competitors and it works good.</li>
            <li>This Suave 2 in 1 lathers up nicely on the body and in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Suaves name, aptly describes the scent.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s just handy, getting it in a pack of 6.  </li>
            <li>and it smells nice as well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Just a note that you might get a good deal on these nearby, either as a better price than what&#x27;s online, or just a way to try it out for yourself before you buy a multi-pack of them.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, not too strong, but I would prefer unscented.</li>
            <li>This soap smells good and it&#x27;s really easy for my boys to use.</li>
            <li>Great for my two boys who go through soap quickly.</li>
            <li>Very sexy and clean smelling!  </li>
            <li>It works well, and it is nice to be able to use one bottle on both the hair and body.  </li>
            <li>It really smells good too guys!</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves body feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This is a real nice combination of hair and body (this seems to be the new trend-adding hair/conditioner/body wash</li>
            <li>product lathers up nicely and does get the guys clean, but I prefer a good old-fashioned bar of soap that leaves you smelling \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, not like you have on too much cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>be amused, I&#x27;m sure, to learn that he&#x27;s in trend these days.</li>
            <li>More brand lines are introducing all in one products that combine body wash with shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love having the combo for hair and body</li>
            <li>I love 2-in-1 body wash and hair shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love using a body wash for a shower.</li>
            <li>They love it</li>
            <li>I find the product to be ok.</li>
            <li>It cleans ok.</li>
            <li>It is a better body wash than shampoo/conditioner combo, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Often I use Dove products, but gave this a try and now am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>My husband love his  suave</li>
            <li>So that all-day clean feel and smell is not just for the scalp, but the body as well!  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and works great for my husband who has super fine hair.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nice, smells nice and leave hair feeling soft and shiny and your skin feeling invigorated and moisturized.</li>
            <li>2 in 1 rinses off easily and,</li>
            <li>My hair has never been more luxurious and clean.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well, rinses well, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but not overly so.  </li>
            <li>My hubby&#x27;s deodorant has a strong scent</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;d be surprised if it makes it more than a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>The Suave Hair &amp; Body smells fine.  </li>
            <li>It cleans and rinses off easily, and leaves a light manly scent that fades in about an hour.</li>
            <li>It lathers up pretty well and does leave my hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li>My chest hair is silky smooth</li>
            <li>Bought for my boyfriend, we were worried about how it would smell, it came fast and was shipped nicely.</li>
            <li>Here is a two in one that could probably also be considered a conditioner, if a light one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real surprise was how much he liked this as a body wash.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too mild.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>This stuff reminds me of a commercial for some kind of soap many years ago.</li>
            <li>It does leave me feeling clean from heat to toe.  </li>
            <li>Clean Feeling after rinsing&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good all in one body and hair cleaner.</li>
            <li>The Suave feels good, just different.</li>
            <li>If you want to get feng shui and remove the clutter from your shower, this is really all the product many men should need.</li>
            <li>We agreed it is a good product to have on hand for the occasional quick shower</li>
            <li>We agreed it is a good product to have on hand for the occasional quick shower</li>
            <li>I did notice that the fragrance was pretty strong while scrubbing my skin with it.</li>
            <li>I have bought the Suave brand in local stores and was very pleased to find it on amazon at such a good price.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not brand loyal with soap, so I try a variety.  </li>
            <li>Suave&#x27;s Body Wash has a pleasant, light scent (unlike some other cheapie products I could name that bowl you over with the perfume!)</li>
            <li>In general, I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>&quot; OK, I might be well past the gorgeous stage, but I confess that I used this Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, and the scent was invigoratingly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is a great value, love the six-pack packaging.</li>
            <li>man just found one of his new favorite body/ hair wash</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and the product works as advertised, so a nice solid body/hair wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant during use and diminishes as it should, unlike some of the scents that somehow live on long after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied on a washcloth, shower scrub or by hand, one good squeeze suffices because it lathers up BIG.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Fresh &amp; Clean,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am not used to, but whatever, feels the same, works into a nice lather, but it smells like Suave.  </li>
            <li>Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, Hair &amp; Body 2 in 1 takes the fun of the choice out of that, but also all of the guess work.</li>
            <li>product wins in the body wash department for me</li>
            <li>I thought the product worked fine, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it isn&#x27;t something I would purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>The soap does a great job at getting him clean after a hard day of working ...</li>
            <li>Other than that, there&#x27;s a good scent to the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and I would have no problem purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li>Lathers OK, and rinses off very cleanly, unlike other men&#x27;s body washes that are known for leaving a residue.</li>
            <li>Extraordinarily rich lather particularly as a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The scent also doesn&#x27;t last on the skin after rinsing it off, which for me is good because I am too sensitive to lingering smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>suggest that the sole soap shopping criterion used by most men is: “What’s cheapest?”</li>
            <li>and I love it-I only have to buy one bottle instead of two or three).</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;This can be had at an even better price in your local supermarket.</li>
            <li>I found the scent very manly and even if you don&#x27;t like it that much it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other body washes for men and this one definitely is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Some body washes for men are very (and this probably isn&#x27;t the right word) spicy-smelling to me, and I don&#x27;t like them at all.  </li>
            <li>The wash suds up well and leaves hair and skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair dried especially quick without any aid.</li>
            <li>Suds nicely, cleans nicely, nothing really wrong with it</li>
            <li>Hey, a man needs squeaky clean hair too, and this product delivers that clean feeling all day long.</li>
            <li>The small case of six works well and is a good value.</li>
            <li>My hubby isn&#x27;t very particular about what soap he uses in the shower.</li>
            <li>His hair was a bit dry, but otherwise manageable and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I went in to see what the problem was, and the only thing I could smell was the strong scents from the products that grandpa had used when he showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely a manly scent here, but it&#x27;s not as strong as some of the competitor&#x27;s scents.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly consider using it again.</li>
            <li>Very manly and smells like a great cologne such as POLO Black or Aqua Eternity.</li>
            <li>It felt clean and looked shiny, but was more flyaway than usual.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather well at all unless you use multiple applications or a huge amount.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really.  </li>
            <li>but it really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you should really use shampoo and conditioner day-to-day?</li>
            <li>It held deodorant, toothbrush, tooth paste, a straight razor, and bar soap that served as his shaving cream, body soap, face soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to work very well for both my hair and as a body soap.</li>
            <li>I would avoid this as because of that one issue one would be running through this quite fast.</li>
            <li>really like the scent of this.  </li>
            <li>I really like these all-in-one hair and body washes for the guys in my house.</li>
            <li>This feels gentle and non-abrasive.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty typical body wash in most regards.</li>
            <li>Totally unisex, if you ask me, because clean does not have a gender.</li>
            <li>and you need to use almost 25% of the bottle to clean your entire body</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and it last a bit long</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how long a bottle lasts me, but it&#x27;s multiple weeks.  </li>
            <li>so I end up using twice as much as I would normally use.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it will replace my regular routine of Nivea Coconut Body Wash and Tresemme Keratin Shampoo (the one in the red bottle), mostly because I like my shampoo so much.  </li>
            <li>He was willing to give it a go, and he was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Scent reminds me a little of Old Spice; very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Major issue is that this Suave shampoo is not nearly as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as many of the others I have used.</li>
            <li>I ordered these as a gift for my older brother.</li>
            <li>Not subtle but neither</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, floral scent that is not particularly overwhelming - I personally prefer to smell like coconuts as it is how I imagine I would smell emerging from the bath in Polynesia.</li>
            <li>Strips heavy oils and sweat to a clean fresh skin.</li>
            <li>Rinses off clean without any residue but also doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Why are so many men&#x27;s products so heavily scented as this one is.  </li>
            <li>This combo is a new experience for both myself and the wife.  </li>
            <li>The Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, 2 in 1 is a new product for me.</li>
            <li>The idea of using one product on the body and hair is a new one to my husband.</li>
            <li>Strong masculine scent out of the bottle and when you lather, but it tones down after you rinse</li>
            <li>This blue wash does appear a bit more watery than other Suave body washes we have tried, but it does get the body and hair clean and leaves behind a clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it is because of this that such a large pack is being sold.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, even though the entire bathroom was filled with the scent of this product by the time I finished my shower, the scent on my skin was minimal.</li>
            <li>I find that it leaves the feeling of having used soft water on my skin.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have soft water but using the Suave makes it feel a bit that way.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok but the texter of the product sucks</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>but I think you use a little more than you might of a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>I find that as a shampoo, it works as well as any that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Since a body wash is new to me, I can only compare it to the bar soap I have used.</li>
            <li>As a result, it pours out of the bottle rather quickly, which could lead to wasted product.</li>
            <li>It needs some other moisturizer in it, and no, sorry Suave but applying other Suave men products after using this defeats the purpose as other products are able to combine multiple features into one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We usually buy this locally, but Amazon had as cheap as Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;ll shy away from Dove in the future, but I like this enough (including a fresh scent) that I will be comfortable using either one going forward.</li>
            <li>My husband says that he likes Suave just as much as the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really pin down what the scent is like to describe it.</li>
            <li>Some of Suave&#x27;s products seem too watered down to me (their hand lotions and some of the shampoos), but I really like their body wash.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Suaves name, aptly describes the scent.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s just handy, getting it in a pack of 6.  </li>
            <li> and it smells nice as well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Just a note that you might get a good deal on these nearby, either as a better price than what&#x27;s online, or just a way to try it out for yourself before you buy a multi-pack of them.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, not too strong, but I would prefer unscented.</li>
            <li> This soap smells good and it&#x27;s really easy for my boys to use.</li>
            <li> Great for my two boys who go through soap quickly.</li>
            <li> Very sexy and clean smelling!  </li>
            <li> It works well, and it is nice to be able to use one bottle on both the hair and body.  </li>
            <li> It really smells good too guys!</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves body feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This is a real nice combination of hair and body (this seems to be the new trend-adding hair/conditioner/body wash</li>
            <li> product lathers up nicely and does get the guys clean, but I prefer a good old-fashioned bar of soap that leaves you smelling \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, not like you have on too much cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> be amused, I&#x27;m sure, to learn that he&#x27;s in trend these days.</li>
            <li> More brand lines are introducing all in one products that combine body wash with shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love having the combo for hair and body</li>
            <li> I love 2-in-1 body wash and hair shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love using a body wash for a shower.</li>
            <li> They love it</li>
            <li> I find the product to be ok.</li>
            <li> It cleans ok.</li>
            <li> It is a better body wash than shampoo/conditioner combo, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Often I use Dove products, but gave this a try and now am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> My husband love his  suave</li>
            <li> So that all-day clean feel and smell is not just for the scalp, but the body as well!  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and works great for my husband who has super fine hair.</li>
            <li> Lathers up nice, smells nice and leave hair feeling soft and shiny and your skin feeling invigorated and moisturized.</li>
            <li> 2 in 1 rinses off easily and,</li>
            <li> My hair has never been more luxurious and clean.  </li>
            <li> It cleans well, rinses well, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but not overly so.  </li>
            <li> My hubby&#x27;s deodorant has a strong scent</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;d be surprised if it makes it more than a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> The Suave Hair &amp; Body smells fine.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and rinses off easily, and leaves a light manly scent that fades in about an hour.</li>
            <li> It lathers up pretty well and does leave my hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li> My chest hair is silky smooth</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend, we were worried about how it would smell, it came fast and was shipped nicely.</li>
            <li> Here is a two in one that could probably also be considered a conditioner, if a light one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real surprise was how much he liked this as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too mild.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> This stuff reminds me of a commercial for some kind of soap many years ago.</li>
            <li> It does leave me feeling clean from heat to toe.  </li>
            <li> Clean Feeling after rinsing&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good all in one body and hair cleaner.</li>
            <li> The Suave feels good, just different.</li>
            <li> If you want to get feng shui and remove the clutter from your shower, this is really all the product many men should need.</li>
            <li> We agreed it is a good product to have on hand for the occasional quick shower</li>
            <li> We agreed it is a good product to have on hand for the occasional quick shower</li>
            <li> I did notice that the fragrance was pretty strong while scrubbing my skin with it.</li>
            <li> I have bought the Suave brand in local stores and was very pleased to find it on amazon at such a good price.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not brand loyal with soap, so I try a variety.  </li>
            <li> Suave&#x27;s Body Wash has a pleasant, light scent (unlike some other cheapie products I could name that bowl you over with the perfume!)</li>
            <li> In general, I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> &quot; OK, I might be well past the gorgeous stage, but I confess that I used this Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, and the scent was invigoratingly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a great value, love the six-pack packaging.</li>
            <li> man just found one of his new favorite body/ hair wash</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and the product works as advertised, so a nice solid body/hair wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant during use and diminishes as it should, unlike some of the scents that somehow live on long after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied on a washcloth, shower scrub or by hand, one good squeeze suffices because it lathers up BIG.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Fresh &amp; Clean,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am not used to, but whatever, feels the same, works into a nice lather, but it smells like Suave.  </li>
            <li> Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, Hair &amp; Body 2 in 1 takes the fun of the choice out of that, but also all of the guess work.</li>
            <li> product wins in the body wash department for me</li>
            <li> I thought the product worked fine, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it isn&#x27;t something I would purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> The soap does a great job at getting him clean after a hard day of working ...</li>
            <li> Other than that, there&#x27;s a good scent to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The price was right, and I would have no problem purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> Lathers OK, and rinses off very cleanly, unlike other men&#x27;s body washes that are known for leaving a residue.</li>
            <li> Extraordinarily rich lather particularly as a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The scent also doesn&#x27;t last on the skin after rinsing it off, which for me is good because I am too sensitive to lingering smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> suggest that the sole soap shopping criterion used by most men is: “What’s cheapest?”</li>
            <li> and I love it-I only have to buy one bottle instead of two or three).</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> /&gt;This can be had at an even better price in your local supermarket.</li>
            <li> I found the scent very manly and even if you don&#x27;t like it that much it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other body washes for men and this one definitely is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Some body washes for men are very (and this probably isn&#x27;t the right word) spicy-smelling to me, and I don&#x27;t like them at all.  </li>
            <li> The wash suds up well and leaves hair and skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair dried especially quick without any aid.</li>
            <li> Suds nicely, cleans nicely, nothing really wrong with it</li>
            <li> Hey, a man needs squeaky clean hair too, and this product delivers that clean feeling all day long.</li>
            <li> The small case of six works well and is a good value.</li>
            <li> My hubby isn&#x27;t very particular about what soap he uses in the shower.</li>
            <li> His hair was a bit dry, but otherwise manageable and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I went in to see what the problem was, and the only thing I could smell was the strong scents from the products that grandpa had used when he showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely a manly scent here, but it&#x27;s not as strong as some of the competitor&#x27;s scents.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly consider using it again.</li>
            <li> Very manly and smells like a great cologne such as POLO Black or Aqua Eternity.</li>
            <li> It felt clean and looked shiny, but was more flyaway than usual.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather well at all unless you use multiple applications or a huge amount.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really.  </li>
            <li> but it really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you should really use shampoo and conditioner day-to-day?</li>
            <li> It held deodorant, toothbrush, tooth paste, a straight razor, and bar soap that served as his shaving cream, body soap, face soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to work very well for both my hair and as a body soap.</li>
            <li> I would avoid this as because of that one issue one would be running through this quite fast.</li>
            <li> really like the scent of this.  </li>
            <li> I really like these all-in-one hair and body washes for the guys in my house.</li>
            <li> This feels gentle and non-abrasive.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty typical body wash in most regards.</li>
            <li> Totally unisex, if you ask me, because clean does not have a gender.</li>
            <li> and you need to use almost 25% of the bottle to clean your entire body</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and it last a bit long</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how long a bottle lasts me, but it&#x27;s multiple weeks.  </li>
            <li> so I end up using twice as much as I would normally use.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it will replace my regular routine of Nivea Coconut Body Wash and Tresemme Keratin Shampoo (the one in the red bottle), mostly because I like my shampoo so much.  </li>
            <li> He was willing to give it a go, and he was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Scent reminds me a little of Old Spice; very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Major issue is that this Suave shampoo is not nearly as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as many of the others I have used.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for my older brother.</li>
            <li> Not subtle but neither</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, floral scent that is not particularly overwhelming - I personally prefer to smell like coconuts as it is how I imagine I would smell emerging from the bath in Polynesia.</li>
            <li> Strips heavy oils and sweat to a clean fresh skin.</li>
            <li> Rinses off clean without any residue but also doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Why are so many men&#x27;s products so heavily scented as this one is.  </li>
            <li> This combo is a new experience for both myself and the wife.  </li>
            <li> The Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, 2 in 1 is a new product for me.</li>
            <li> The idea of using one product on the body and hair is a new one to my husband.</li>
            <li> Strong masculine scent out of the bottle and when you lather, but it tones down after you rinse</li>
            <li> This blue wash does appear a bit more watery than other Suave body washes we have tried, but it does get the body and hair clean and leaves behind a clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because of this that such a large pack is being sold.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, even though the entire bathroom was filled with the scent of this product by the time I finished my shower, the scent on my skin was minimal.</li>
            <li> I find that it leaves the feeling of having used soft water on my skin.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have soft water but using the Suave makes it feel a bit that way.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok but the texter of the product sucks</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> but I think you use a little more than you might of a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> I find that as a shampoo, it works as well as any that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Since a body wash is new to me, I can only compare it to the bar soap I have used.</li>
            <li> As a result, it pours out of the bottle rather quickly, which could lead to wasted product.</li>
            <li> It needs some other moisturizer in it, and no, sorry Suave but applying other Suave men products after using this defeats the purpose as other products are able to combine multiple features into one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We usually buy this locally, but Amazon had as cheap as Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ll shy away from Dove in the future, but I like this enough (including a fresh scent) that I will be comfortable using either one going forward.</li>
            <li> My husband says that he likes Suave just as much as the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really pin down what the scent is like to describe it.</li>
            <li> Some of Suave&#x27;s products seem too watered down to me (their hand lotions and some of the shampoos), but I really like their body wash.  </li>
            <li> Usually to just use whatever I&#x27;m in the mood for, or grab something specific to address a certain hygiene topic that I feel needs some attention.</li>
            <li> If used in your hair you might want to add a conditioner after since this left it pretty dry and statically, vs my usual shampoo/conditioner product.  </li>
            <li> The soap washes off clean and leaves no residue behind.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re short on hair and long on body this might be the product for you</li>
            <li> The main drawback is that it is a small bottle, especially if it is both shampoo and body wash.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so be careful to not pour out too much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to really strong smells and get bad headaches</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or hair either.  </li>
            <li> it does leave the skin feeling dry too.</li>
            <li> My bar soap feels &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34;, unlike the slick feeling of soft water washing.</li>
            <li> As  a general rule, I try to avoid products with heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> but you might need a conditioner if you have a normal head of hair because it leaves it a little on the fluffy side.</li>
            <li> but the smell doesn&#x27;t last at all, seems typical in my experience with cheaper brands</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Small Bottle, it won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> A few times later in the day I&#x27;ve gotten a whiff that the smell of the soap is still on me, but I don&#x27;t have to smell it all day.  </li>
            <li> When traveling,  he packed a military style grooming kit.</li>
            <li> I just know that I&#x27;ve never really noticed, which means that they don&#x27;t run out</li>
            <li> Once the body is dry, the scent is much less noticeable</li>
            <li> I use an exfoliating towel and just a small amount of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hubby will shower a couple times a day during the summer, and goes through body wash way too fast for us to get the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way too watered down and diluted</li>
            <li> I think that they are under $3/bottle at the notoriously overpriced Safeway down the street.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully those will be less diluted.</li>
            <li> In the store these are about $2 each, could be less with a coupon.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle, but it lasting.  </li>
            <li> so there is one less bottle on the shower caddy.</li>
            <li> It lathers well on the hair; less so on the skin.</li>
            <li> , it rinsed well, and it had a subtle scent that seemed a little perfumed but manly enough.</li>
            <li> once I dried off, I didn&#x27;t detect that sometimes after shower feeling of something residual lingering.</li>
            <li> it is too harsh.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out rather nicely and was not overconditioned, which I hate!</li>
            <li> One of my young granddaughters walked into the bathroom the other day, and said it stinks.  </li>
            <li> number one thing that I like about it, compared to some all-in-one products I&#x27;ve tried, is that the smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I do recommend this product unilaterally to all bodies of all genders, whatever that may be now or in the future because of freedom of choice.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see the coupons as often lately.</li>
            <li> I tend to only purchase products with either no scent, or products with a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; rather than a &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; or artificial (like AXE) scent.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick like some body washes.  </li>
            <li> Subtle,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just not good.</li>
            <li> but again the amount to use makes it a pretty terrible deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thin in texture and viscosity.  </li>
            <li> One star off because I&#x27;m confused about whether it is meant to be used as a shampoo as well though?</li>
            <li> but this is one of the few men&#x27;s shampoos that we both like and it doesn&#x27;t make me sick!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell and cleaning power are ok.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s way too watered down and diluted so I end up using twice as much as I would normally use. I&#x27;ve gone through 3 bottles in just 2 weeks....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying out Gillette&#x27;s body wash and also Nivea&#x27;s. Hopefully those will be less diluted.</li>
            <li> With subscribe and save the price is good for the amount you receive. In the store these are about $2 each, could be less with a coupon. But I don&#x27;t see the coupons as often lately. The fact that is delivered to my door is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> My chest hair is silky smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really.  Does anyone actually use anonymous internet reviews to determine which brand of men’s soap they purchase?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that the sole soap shopping criterion used by most men is: “What’s cheapest?”</li>
            <li> This body wash smells nice and cleans my body well but it really dries out my skin. So I had to switch to a different body wash.</li>
            <li> I love Suave anything because it is cheaper than alot of its competitors and it works good. This is a real nice combination of hair and body (this seems to be the new trend-adding hair/conditioner/body wash all in one-and I love it-I only have to buy one bottle instead of two or three). Liked the way it smelled and did a good job on my hair and body as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will use in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a good hair and body wash.  I think that the smell is pleasant.  The smell is strong, but not overly so.  A few times later in the day I&#x27;ve gotten a whiff that the smell of the soap is still on me, but I don&#x27;t have to smell it all day.  This gives me a good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thin in texture and viscosity.  It isn&#x27;t thick like some body washes.  A little goes a long way, so be careful to not pour out too much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not brand loyal with soap, so I try a variety.  This is one I would get again.</li>
            <li> This Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash cleans well, smells nice and is a great price.  The smell is subtle, but it lasting.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or hair either.  It lathers well and rinses clean.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good all in one body and hair cleaner.</li>
            <li> This combo is a new experience for both myself and the wife.  We both use the product even though it is advertised as for men.  It works well, and it is nice to be able to use one bottle on both the hair and body.  The small case of six works well and is a good value.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re short on hair and long on body this might be the product for you but you might need a conditioner if you have a normal head of hair because it leaves it a little on the fluffy side. Just jump in the shower, lather up, rinse and jump into your onesie coveralls and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff lathers well and does a good job of cleaning.  I found the scent very manly and even if you don&#x27;t like it that much it dissipates quickly. Inexpensive enough to give a try anyway.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is something to be said, even for SHAMPOO!  Hey, a man needs squeaky clean hair too, and this product delivers that clean feeling all day long. So fellas, if ya have hair, ya should try SUAVE!  This product was value-priced as a shampoo, BUT WAIT! It&#x27;s also a BODY WASH!  So that all-day clean feel and smell is not just for the scalp, but the body as well!  Suave got me bustin&#x27; out rhymes!  Seriously, this is a great value, love the six-pack packaging. It really smells good too guys!</li>
            <li> My hubby isn&#x27;t very particular about what soap he uses in the shower. He&#x27;s been known to use bar soap to wash his hair and shampoo to wash his body. Therefore I have been buying him these 2 and 3 in one shampoos that are made for that. He&#x27;s been using this Suave now for a couple of months and he likes it a lot. So, when this came up for a review, I jumped on it. This Suave 2 in 1 lathers up nicely on the body and in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. I have used this myself, and I have to agree. It&#x27;s very nice. Lathers up nice, smells nice and leave hair feeling soft and shiny and your skin feeling invigorated and moisturized. A Very nice all in one shower soap for body and hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other body washes for men and this one definitely is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. Strong masculine scent out of the bottle and when you lather, but it tones down after you rinse so it&#x27;s not overpowering. Rinses off clean without any residue but also doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry. One star off because I&#x27;m confused about whether it is meant to be used as a shampoo as well though? It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Hair &amp; Body 2 in 1&amp;#34; but both the bottle and Amazon descriptions say &amp;#34;Try Suave Shampoo and Conditioner for men.&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Try Suave hair products for men.&amp;#34; Why would I need to try their shampoo and conditioner if this product is &amp;#34;2 in 1&amp;#34; and is &amp;#34;HAIR &amp; Body&amp;#34;? Is it meant to be used routinely daily to wash your hair? Can you use it for hair in a pinch but you should really use shampoo and conditioner day-to-day? Should you only use it to wash your body and only use dedicated products for your hair?</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for my older brother. He says it smells good, and cleanses well. And, the price is great!</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend, we were worried about how it would smell, it came fast and was shipped nicely. And the product smells amazing, great lathering, and the smell stays on the skin for a while.&lt;br /&gt;My man just found one of his new favorite body/ hair wash</li>
            <li> My grandfather was a simple man. When traveling,  he packed a military style grooming kit. It held deodorant, toothbrush, tooth paste, a straight razor, and bar soap that served as his shaving cream, body soap, face soap and shampoo. When he visited, the multiple bottles of products we&#x27;d accumulated in the bath were sources of amusement to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;d be amused, I&#x27;m sure, to learn that he&#x27;s in trend these days. More brand lines are introducing all in one products that combine body wash with shampoo. Some are promoted to also replace face wash and/or hair conditioner. This product from Sauve&#x27;s line for men is for hair and body. I tried it before my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one thing that I like about it, compared to some all-in-one products I&#x27;ve tried, is that the smell is not overwhelming. \\&quot;Fresh &amp; Clean,\\&quot; Suaves name, aptly describes the scent. It&#x27;s pleasant during use and diminishes as it should, unlike some of the scents that somehow live on long after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied on a washcloth, shower scrub or by hand, one good squeeze suffices because it lathers up BIG. Although it&#x27;s not marketed as a face wash, I lathered it up there too since it was already on my head. My nose didn&#x27;t melt off or anything, but I suppose there&#x27;s a reason why Sauve doesn&#x27;t promote its use as a face wash, so I&#x27;ll avoid using it there in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave&#x27;s Hair &amp; Body 2 in 1 rinses off easily and, once I dried off, I didn&#x27;t detect that sometimes after shower feeling of something residual lingering. My hair dried especially quick without any aid. It felt clean and looked shiny, but was more flyaway than usual.  It&#x27;s not a shampoo that I&#x27;d use daily without a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that my almost bald grandfather would rate this five stars, it&#x27;s a multi-use product and a definite step up from bar soap. My husband had the same concern that I expressed about not using it daily without a conditioner (at his age, his hair is already flying away without additional help). We agreed it is a good product to have on hand for the occasional quick shower and/or to pack along when traveling or going to the gym. We like it.y without additional help). We agreed it is a good product to have on hand for the occasional quick shower and/or to pack along when traveling or going to the gym. We like it.</li>
            <li> The Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, 2 in 1 is a new product for me. I have always used bar soap, but decided to try this product which is a shampoo and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work very well for both my hair and as a body soap. I find that as a shampoo, it works as well as any that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Since a body wash is new to me, I can only compare it to the bar soap I have used. I find that it leaves the feeling of having used soft water on my skin. My bar soap feels &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34;, unlike the slick feeling of soft water washing. The Suave feels good, just different. We don&#x27;t have soft water but using the Suave makes it feel a bit that way. The scent is pleasant, not too strong, but I would prefer unscented. I can&#x27;t really pin down what the scent is like to describe it. I haven&#x27;t decided whether I will abandon my bar soap yet. The wash is easier to use. In any case I will use the Suave as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and works great for my husband who has super fine hair. The smell is fresh and clean, not overpowering at all. Love having the combo for hair and body so there is one less bottle on the shower caddy.</li>
            <li> I love 2-in-1 body wash and hair shampoo.  That way you don&#x27;t have to buy soap and shampoo separately.  The Suave Hair &amp; Body smells fine.  Not subtle but neither it is too harsh.  I use an exfoliating towel and just a small amount of this goes a long way.  It cleans well.</li>
            <li> My guys like this fragrance and so do I!  They use this in winter and summer daily and like this product!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!  My husband says that he likes Suave just as much as the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> This stuff reminds me of a commercial for some kind of soap many years ago. A gorgeous woman holding the bar of soap says, \\&quot;Manly, yes! But I use it, too!\\&quot; OK, I might be well past the gorgeous stage, but I confess that I used this Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, and the scent was invigoratingly clean and fresh. Totally unisex, if you ask me, because clean does not have a gender. My hair came out rather nicely and was not overconditioned, which I hate! Therefore, I do recommend this product unilaterally to all bodies of all genders, whatever that may be now or in the future because of freedom of choice. (I like to cover my bases in the interest of political correctness.) Good stuff, &#x27;yall.</li>
            <li> What to say about this?  The liquid is sort of a gross color I am not used to, but whatever, feels the same, works into a nice lather, but it smells like Suave.  If you like that smell, great.  If used in your hair you might want to add a conditioner after since this left it pretty dry and statically, vs my usual shampoo/conditioner product.  The scent is mild and the product works as advertised, so a nice solid body/hair wash.</li>
            <li> We usually buy this locally, but Amazon had as cheap as Wal Mart.  Plus, it&#x27;s just handy, getting it in a pack of 6.  My husband likes suave hair and body wash.  Low maintenance!</li>
            <li> I love using a body wash for a shower. I have bought the Suave brand in local stores and was very pleased to find it on amazon at such a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty typical body wash in most regards. I did notice that the fragrance was pretty strong while scrubbing my skin with it. Thankfully, even though the entire bathroom was filled with the scent of this product by the time I finished my shower, the scent on my skin was minimal. As  a general rule, I try to avoid products with heavy fragrance. I thought the product worked fine, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it isn&#x27;t something I would purchase in the future. I tend to only purchase products with either no scent, or products with a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; rather than a &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; or artificial (like AXE) scent.</li>
            <li> good price, nice product.  My hair has never been more luxurious and clean.  I feel like running naked through a field of daisies.  Then the cops showed up.</li>
            <li> This body wash has a great smell and all but I have to agree with others that it is way too diluted. It doesn&#x27;t lather well at all unless you use multiple applications or a huge amount. Perhaps it is because of this that such a large pack is being sold. I found myself using quite a bit to get the same level of soapiness that I like when using a bar soap. I would avoid this as because of that one issue one would be running through this quite fast. I liked the smell and it last a bit long but again the amount to use makes it a pretty terrible deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally post application and post shower it does leave the skin feeling dry too. It needs some other moisturizer in it, and no, sorry Suave but applying other Suave men products after using this defeats the purpose as other products are able to combine multiple features into one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just not good.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok but the texter of the product sucks and you need to use almost 25% of the bottle to clean your entire body</li>
            <li> Husband loves this!! Smells good and leaves body feeling clean. Bought on subscribe n save, and will continue to buy that way.</li>
            <li> Why are so many men&#x27;s products so heavily scented as this one is.  My hubby&#x27;s deodorant has a strong scent and I think these two clash.  One of my young granddaughters walked into the bathroom the other day, and said it stinks.  I went in to see what the problem was, and the only thing I could smell was the strong scents from the products that grandpa had used when he showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lathers up nicely and does get the guys clean, but I prefer a good old-fashioned bar of soap that leaves you smelling \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, not like you have on too much cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Extraordinarily rich lather particularly as a shampoo.  I like it well enough but I don&#x27;t think it will replace my regular routine of Nivea Coconut Body Wash and Tresemme Keratin Shampoo (the one in the red bottle), mostly because I like my shampoo so much.  I can see putting this in a gym bag; I will keep my bottle in my vacation home.  It has a pleasant, floral scent that is not particularly overwhelming - I personally prefer to smell like coconuts as it is how I imagine I would smell emerging from the bath in Polynesia.</li>
            <li> I found this product for my boyfriend for a great price and great value. Smells wonderful. My boyfriend says he loves that its for the hair and body</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is affordable and great on your skin and hair. Does not leave any residue on skin when rinsing.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 teen boys. Now they will never run out of soap. They love it and I love the price!</li>
            <li> I find the product to be ok. It cleans ok. Nothing fancy about it. Has virtually no odor to it so you don&#x27;t wind up smelling like spring flowers. It&#x27; inexpensive but I think you use a little more than you might of a more expensive product. Overall, I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Major issue is that this Suave shampoo is not nearly as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as many of the others I have used. As a result, it pours out of the bottle rather quickly, which could lead to wasted product. Other than that, there&#x27;s a good scent to the shampoo. It lathers up pretty well and does leave my hair nice and clean. I would certainly consider using it again.</li>
            <li> This soap smells good and it&#x27;s really easy for my boys to use.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean. Great for my two boys who go through soap quickly. Good stuff. Would order again at is price</li>
            <li> Suave is know to have 3-in-1 hair/body/shave combos. Here is a two in one that could probably also be considered a conditioner, if a light one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m I guy and I still have a collection of shampoos, conditioners, body washes and soaps in the shower. Usually to just use whatever I&#x27;m in the mood for, or grab something specific to address a certain hygiene topic that I feel needs some attention. Suave Men&#x27;s Body Wash, Hair &amp; Body 2 in 1 takes the fun of the choice out of that, but also all of the guess work. It is a better body wash than shampoo/conditioner combo, but it does the job. It cleans and rinses off easily, and leaves a light manly scent that fades in about an hour. If you want to get feng shui and remove the clutter from your shower, this is really all the product many men should need. It isn&#x27;t organic and all-natural, but if you don&#x27;t mind that, it can&#x27;t be beat for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> This is a good body wash from Suave, it&#x27;s also a good price and I can often get it even cheaper with coupons or buy-one-get-one deals at the grocery.  When using the body wash it lather ups really good and it smells nice as well.  The soap washes off clean and leaves no residue behind.  The scent also doesn&#x27;t last on the skin after rinsing it off, which for me is good because I am too sensitive to lingering smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, my husband uses this on his hair from time to time.  It isn&#x27;t helpful with dandruff, but he switches it in and out with his dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product wins in the body wash department for me and I&#x27;ll keep using it for that use on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Some of Suave&#x27;s products seem too watered down to me (their hand lotions and some of the shampoos), but I really like their body wash.  I&#x27;ve essentially been using this 2-in-1 version for years.  The packaging changes from time to time, but the wash seems to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent of this.  It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and has a nice smell.  Some body washes for men are very (and this probably isn&#x27;t the right word) spicy-smelling to me, and I don&#x27;t like them at all.  This isn&#x27;t flowery, either.  I think it&#x27;s pretty neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think that these are a good value.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how long a bottle lasts me, but it&#x27;s multiple weeks.  A month, maybe?  Don&#x27;t know.  I just know that I&#x27;ve never really noticed, which means that they don&#x27;t run out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to buy these locally at Target for about $2/bottle.  I think that they are under $3/bottle at the notoriously overpriced Safeway down the street.  Just a note that you might get a good deal on these nearby, either as a better price than what&#x27;s online, or just a way to try it out for yourself before you buy a multi-pack of them.</li>
            <li> My hubby will shower a couple times a day during the summer, and goes through body wash way too fast for us to get the expensive stuff. This one is cheap and smells great!</li>
            <li> Suds nicely, cleans nicely, nothing really wrong with it but the smell doesn&#x27;t last at all, seems typical in my experience with cheaper brands</li>
            <li> Often I use Dove products, but gave this a try and now am glad I did.  Not that I&#x27;ll shy away from Dove in the future, but I like this enough (including a fresh scent) that I will be comfortable using either one going forward.</li>
            <li> Smells manly enough without knocking you over. I really like these all-in-one hair and body washes for the guys in my house. They don&#x27;t like fooling with a lot of bath products, which makes Suave Men&#x27;s Body and Hair wash great.  Scent reminds me a little of Old Spice; very clean and fresh. The wash suds up well and leaves hair and skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I like the way this works both as a shampoo and as a body wash.  It does leave me feeling clean from heat to toe.  I also appreciate the masculine scent.  Not too strong, not too mild.  I recommend it for all you guys out there.</li>
            <li> In general, I really liked this product.  It lathered well, it rinsed well, and it had a subtle scent that seemed a little perfumed but manly enough. The main drawback is that it is a small bottle, especially if it is both shampoo and body wash.  To be honest, I&#x27;d be surprised if it makes it more than a couple more weeks. The product is great, just wished it came in a 20 ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;+ Great Lather&lt;br /&gt;+ Subtle, Pleasant Scent&lt;br /&gt;+ Clean Feeling after rinsing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Small Bottle, it won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The idea of using one product on the body and hair is a new one to my husband. He was willing to give it a go, and he was pleasantly surprised. Suave&#x27;s Body Wash has a pleasant, light scent (unlike some other cheapie products I could name that bowl you over with the perfume!) His hair was a bit dry, but otherwise manageable and healthy looking. The real surprise was how much he liked this as a body wash. He&#x27;s a bar soap guy. This gave lots of lather and made showering faster, something all guys like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be had at an even better price in your local supermarket. I&#x27;d recommend shopping for it there.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It cleans well, rinses well, and is easy to use.  The price was right, and I would have no problem purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> My husband love his  suave</li>
            <li> This blue wash does appear a bit more watery than other Suave body washes we have tried, but it does get the body and hair clean and leaves behind a clean smell.  It lathers well on the hair; less so on the skin. This feels gentle and non-abrasive.  No oily residue remains on the skin, either.  There&#x27;s definitely a manly scent here, but it&#x27;s not as strong as some of the competitor&#x27;s scents.  Once the body is dry, the scent is much less noticeable</li>
            <li> My husband walked into the kitchen this morning to kiss me goodbye for the day, and he smelled great so asked him which cologne he was wearing.  He said none, it was this soap.  Very sexy and clean smelling!  Lathers OK, and rinses off very cleanly, unlike other men&#x27;s body washes that are known for leaving a residue. Strips heavy oils and sweat to a clean fresh skin. Very manly and smells like a great cologne such as POLO Black or Aqua Eternity.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my husband.  The soap does a great job at getting him clean after a hard day of working ... but more importantly it smells wonderful!  I am very sensitive to really strong smells and get bad headaches but this is one of the few men&#x27;s shampoos that we both like and it doesn&#x27;t make me sick! Wish we could still find it in stores but so happy Amazon has it!</li>
