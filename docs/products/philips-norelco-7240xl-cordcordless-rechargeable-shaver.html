    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>

            <li>For the price, I believe this razor is a BEST BUY!</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll find that this shaver is quite impressive.     </li>
            <li>What a great shaver!</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving Norelco I have used in the 35 years I have used an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>This is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Note: for best results do not press against skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and he is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>AND THIS IS THE BEST</li>
            <li>If you want the best shave, buy a quality manual razor.</li>
            <li>This razor was a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li>The quality of the shave is very good.</li>
            <li>This is a very good electric razor for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a very good feel in the hand.</li>
            <li>Very good.  </li>
            <li>Very good razor for the price.   </li>
            <li>but this was the best yet and great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly close.</li>
            <li>and I was extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>For the money it is a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Great Razor</li>
            <li>He is happy with the closeness of the shave, rechargeabilty of the battery, he reported no problems or disappointments.</li>
            <li>The tap-rinse feature is great, and I did not expect to find a trimmer too (not advertised).</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t get it, like who thought this was going to make people happy.  </li>
            <li>This was a great deal</li>
            <li>when it cuts it does a great job, but the blades aren&#x27;t compatable with my series 7 Noelco.....</li>
            <li>and it gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>The fact that you can use it corded is great because if the battery dies during use, you can plug it in and finish shaving before recharging it, which enhances the battery life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about a year now and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This shaver cuts exceptionally good</li>
            <li>This is a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>One thing I found surprising is that the shaver just stopped while I was shaving with no warning.</li>
            <li>like the difference between looking at a nice sporty car with great lines, and then looking at one of those butchered hummers</li>
            <li>you can get this at a good price, don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li>Not withstanding, It is a good ride for my face.  </li>
            <li>Everything looks good except the look is weired.</li>
            <li>It takes a good 8 hours to recharge the unit.  </li>
            <li>It would be a good idea to just charge the razor every 8 - 10 days for the way I shave, you might need to charge it sooner.</li>
            <li>and it cut so close and smooth that I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Shape provides a good grip regardless of how it is held.</li>
            <li>This razor is a good value.</li>
            <li>Shape provides a good grip regardless of how it is held.     </li>
            <li>Turns out that this product is good, but not as good as everyone says.</li>
            <li>To date, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>May not be the most attractive razor, but who cares?</li>
            <li>It is great, I love it.</li>
            <li>I owned many Norelco shavers, but this one has given me the closest shave yet!</li>
            <li>I was injured and now I&#x27;ve got some nice scares just under the chin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own stand, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m deducting &lt;br /&gt;one star.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of it and the closeness of the shaves I got.  </li>
            <li>works good on more barbaras  </li>
            <li>When I turned this on, it honestly felt and sounded like another shaver that&#x27;s at 5% battery level.</li>
            <li>My bumps/razor burn are healing nicely.  </li>
            <li>IT DOES A NICE JOB.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer is equally effective.  </li>
            <li>this is really nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was also happy about the quick delivery - within 48 hours.</li>
            <li>This razor did an excellent job until it was about 3 months old, the battery would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I was beginning to think that mine was just a defect but then decided against doing anything because the rotary type did not seem to be a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>Gives good shave and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Now I have this electric razor and it is so easy!</li>
            <li>the razor is great so easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great razor, if you&#x27;re willing to charge it often.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great, its very low maintenance (just wash it off with warm water), and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is very smooth &amp; close.</li>
            <li>; Norelco makes a fine shaver and let&#x27;s be honest, here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;to make sure it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions, shaved as recommended, and have never been satisfied.    </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter, holds a charge longer, and gives a better shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems many have not had this problem</li>
            <li>It is so much better.</li>
            <li>sure hold longer then</li>
            <li>The unit comes with the compact recharging unit, barely more than a core.</li>
            <li>Not only will I be saving money on razor packs and shaving cream, I&#x27;ll be able to show my friends a self-grooming utility that looks like it could take a bullet and gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase, one more time,</li>
            <li>Really nice shave doesn&#x27;t hurt shaves very closely and skin doesn&#x27;t irritate or anything just really really good.</li>
            <li>not matter how many times I go over them.  </li>
            <li>However, the razor does perform much better on the flatter portions of my face.  </li>
            <li>The price now is 10-15$ more than what it was when I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I AM WELL SATISFIED FOR THE PRICE I PAID.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably give it to my son one of these days and get a better Norelco model...</li>
            <li>A lighter touch works better.</li>
            <li>If I had more money, though, I would have bought a nicer shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a shaver I would recommend, or would buy for someone as a gift and would be confident they would like it.  </li>
            <li>All in all, quite pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s washable so water seems to be ok to go through the piece.</li>
            <li>:)     </li>
            <li>OWNED MANY ELECTRIC RAZORS</li>
            <li>This shaver does everything they said it would, and more.</li>
            <li>Better than a safety raxor.</li>
            <li>I find the shave to be not as close as with a razor blade, but better than the Remington.  </li>
            <li>The price is right for this good product.</li>
            <li>Good product, smooth shave, light, quite and holds a pretty good charge.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>The shave is pretty good.</li>
            <li>All in all, its a pretty good device.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave, but I think the best things I like about it are that it&#x27;s very quiet, very smooth against my skin, cordless, and you can rinse it clean with water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many Norelco razors over the years and this razor, the 7240xl, has given me the closest, most comfortable shave ever.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since my skin is used to being shaved this way, I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance; it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, slides very easy, is very easy to clean and maintain, and keeps charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver under warm water is convenient and easy and a good idea compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a very good job, and is so quiet, I have</li>
            <li>The ability to rinse it out with water to clean it is a nice feature not to mention I think it is light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The shaver gives a fast close shave, but it is not as good as the Norelco I bought 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Makes cleaning so easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this looks ok, but it feels light and cheap.</li>
            <li>It takes 12 hours to charge and the charge dies very quickly (with no warning or charge indicator).</li>
            <li>Blades conform easily to my angular features without needing to stretch skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to manupilate.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, and I&#x27;m getting three or more shaves out of each recharge of the batteries.</li>
            <li>&quot; It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice.</li>
            <li>although it still shaves fine.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine</li>
            <li>AGAIN, IT&#x27;S DONE A FINE JOB.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean - just wash out.  </li>
            <li>From here on in its \\&quot;smooth shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>it works well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This shaver holds a charge well and is light to handle.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this again because it gives me a comfortable, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the springs on the floating heads seem to be a bit stiffer, or else the heads just don&#x27;t fit together as well - the point is, instead of smoothly gliding from one position to another, the heads are noticeably popping into position as you shave.</li>
            <li>It feels like light cheap plastic [...]</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with tap water or brush.</li>
            <li>A genuine bargain.  </li>
            <li>There is a light that blinks when it is done charging.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with tap water or brush.</li>
            <li>Smooth, effortless shave.  </li>
            <li>The plastic exterior makes it look cheap</li>
            <li>The closest shave, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does give a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>With my Remmington, I could get a good complete shave after two minutes of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Replaced 10 year old Norelco and found that this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, gives a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor, and it is cool looking and well priced.</li>
            <li>My favorite is still the top of line black Spectra, which charges super fast and has an incredible battery life (132 minutes on my display).</li>
            <li>Looks strange (space age) but works great.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost, and you can buy replacement heads at WalMart!  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful, but it shaves perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I have owned several electric razors and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Rinse it clean with running water</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m glad my old Norelco died after  many years</li>
            <li>I bought this based on previous reviews and the incredible $32.99 Amazon sale price.    </li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>Very smooth, fast, close.</li>
            <li>If the razor is kept clean, it delivers a good shave and doesn&#x27;t seem to infect acne any further.</li>
            <li>this one and WOW AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to clean, and it holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>While not as good as shaving with a blade, which is my normal way of shaving, it does a very acceptable job when in a hurry and not wanting to take the time for using the blade.</li>
            <li>You may wish to wait to see if it&#x27;s restocked at its former price, or simply elect to pay the higher freight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality of shave is getting better and better, and apparently both my beard and I needed some training.</li>
            <li>I am slow to give perfect scores so a five from me is something.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s how it sounds at full charge.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, and does some pretty clean shavings.</li>
            <li>Washes under the shower head or faucet quickly.  </li>
            <li>This model is better that way because you can hold it many different ways.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit to replace an older Norelco, and was quite pleased with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>But it delivers the same flawless performance and has niceties such as water-wash</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li>Surprised at the quietness of the razor, shaves smooth, quickly and easily even after two days growth.  </li>
            <li>Only thing the top comes off alto!</li>
            <li>I am lucky to get four days of shaving before the battery dies completely without a warning as many others have attested to.    </li>
            <li>It is quiet, faster, closer, and importantly very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I carried this shaver on a family trip and it performed pretty well, keeping all the men in the household with a clean shave.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth, has an extremely comfortable grip, and is exceptionally quiet.  </li>
            <li>The translucent plastic across the front doesn&#x27;t really seem to match nor fit with the rest of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I thought paying $30 for a shaver was too low and that there would be some kind of problem with it</li>
            <li>the old shaver had more streamlined lines.  </li>
            <li>The unit feels comfortable in the hand and the charge lasts for a week or more of daily shaves.  </li>
            <li>I am always a Philips razor fun.</li>
            <li>First of all, it looks really cool.</li>
            <li>At the area around mouth, it does a great job, if you let it go through a few times, also stretch the skin little bit, it does a clean cut as good as razor blade.</li>
            <li>Rubber pads are in the right places, indents are shaped to fit pretty much any hand.</li>
            <li>It cuts just fine, but it folds back too easily while you&#x27;re trying to use it.  </li>
            <li>I really like that I can clean it in tap water.  </li>
            <li>Really like the ability to clean the shaver head under water.</li>
            <li>Hubby really likes it and he likes the fact that he can rinse it under water and clean it that way.</li>
            <li>Compared to all my previous models, I was immediately impressed by how quiet this one is, yet</li>
            <li>Very smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li>I never thought a new shaver would be better than my 30 year old Norelco, but this one is!</li>
            <li>If you can forego the thumb rest and live with blue instead of silver, the 7140XL will serve you just as well, I&#x27;m sure, and currently at a significantly lower price</li>
            <li>I made sure to use it untill it was fully discharged and a charge would last approx.</li>
            <li>it was the first model that came out with the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad it worked because blades are such a pain both figuratively and literally.  </li>
            <li>so I would have to use the trimmer first and then the razor.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be well made, feels pretty hefty in my hand.</li>
            <li>Much to my delight he loves it!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my son as his first shaver.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem I have with this shaver is that is so quiet that it makes me always feel like it&#x27;s not charged :)</li>
            <li>Actually I have used one before, not this one, and the razor pulled more hair out than it cut.  </li>
            <li>Light, quiet, smooth and fast shave.  </li>
            <li>Much better value that some of the fancier razors, and the ability to use it as a corded razor is a big plus.  </li>
            <li>Then I decided to try my first shave</li>
            <li>one that I first inspect in a store, since the photo online misled me.</li>
            <li>The shave I get now is equal to or better than the blades and no styptic.  </li>
            <li>This is the first philips Norelco shaver I have had.</li>
            <li>This is my first rotary head shaver.  </li>
            <li>After ten days of using it, I decided to keep it, and now, after a month, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>After ten shaves on the same charge it is still as good as the first.</li>
            <li>Mine is currently en route to Norelco&#x27;s returns facility (at my own expense, naturally), after which I will wait 6-8 weeks and hopefully get a refund.</li>
            <li>It is true that this model is easy to clean; cuts well and is a little unusual feeling in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;m not crazy about the wanna be high tech design,</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of the number of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I grow facial hair and this razor has been great because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne as much as other electric razors.</li>
            <li>Just once in a while to eliminate sideburns or other facial trimming and it works great.    </li>
            <li>When you open the box your first reaction may be that it&#x27;s cheap because it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li>Quiet, close shave, holds a charge well, cleans easy.</li>
            <li>Shaves two day old beard as easily as one day old.</li>
            <li>Fine product,shaves well and holds it&#x27;s charge for eight to ten shaves.</li>
            <li>I have used previous Norelco shavers, but this by far is the smoothest and most comfortable</li>
            <li>only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but I am fine with that</li>
            <li>Fine shave, although the motor is nearly silent.  </li>
            <li>No major problems with it, holds a charge for a long time, gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers, exclusively, since 1966 when I received my first razor for high school graduation.</li>
            <li>only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I&#x27;m not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running.</li>
            <li>the pop up trimmer works very well, too.</li>
            <li>Very quite also.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband, not knowing much at all about electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I really like the way it shaves and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I was really awed when I turned it on.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really cut myself all that much</li>
            <li>but my skin would just really hurt</li>
            <li>Was well worth $35 so far</li>
            <li>Much easier on my face.  </li>
            <li>but they really don&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li>This could very well be Darth Vader&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave to my father, whose face is not as angular as mine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Produces a close shave without too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rinsing under the faucet is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to upgrade since replacment blades were almost as much as the razor itself.</li>
            <li>, I did not know they improved so much.</li>
            <li>My only drawback is the shaver can&#x27;t glide smoothly when the humidity causes my face to be a bit moist.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>what surprised me the most is how incredibly quiet it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a razor that would at least give me a reasonably good shave without going to take a loan out to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I resisted Norelcos for over 40 years because, frankly, I thought the rotary head looked \\&quot;dorky\\&quot;--especially compared to the more masculine, phallic, lance-like Remingtons and Schicks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a very close shave like razor in most part of the face, compared to other electrical shaving systems I have.</li>
            <li>For special occasions I still use a blade, but for everyday shaving it works fine.</li>
            <li>I can shave right before  a shower or in the middle of the day, maybe right before i go to bed.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can rinse it out after use, but it still recommends you take it apart and clean with a brush once a month - exactly as frequently as the old non-water-cleanable model.    </li>
            <li>No, but it does shave better than any other electric I have ever used</li>
            <li>I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It was out of warranty, and a new lithium battery would cost me as much as the whole assembly to both buy and replace.</li>
            <li>, It is comfortable and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is outstanding as I average just over 10 years before replacing a shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this new Norelco.  </li>
            <li>This is fare better at nearly half the price.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the less pressure I apply the better the shave.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it is much lighter weight and gives a much smoother shave than his old one did.</li>
            <li>Shaves older beard without pulling.   </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not tried rinsing under the faucet as we have high mineral content water but just blowing and brushing work well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this razor as a gift or for yourself.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this gizmo.</li>
            <li>far* better job than the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using this everyday after more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>Above all, THE SHAVE IS MUCH CLOSER AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>Although my Remmington battery is not like it was when new, I keep both in my vehicle, first shave with the Norelco to cut down the longer whiskers, and then finish it up with the Remmington to get a close shave quickly.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning is easy since you just push a button, which opens the spring loaded head up (or down)</li>
            <li>But if this is the new \\&quot;face\\&quot; of Norelco; I think I&#x27;ll take my face somewhere else.</li>
            <li>So I figured it was time for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I actually paid less for this one than the Remington and it has better features and much quieter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is to be expected, but this razor also misses several hairs on my neck</li>
            <li>Despite the jagged, robotic appearance (which is half of why it&#x27;s so darn cool), the grips set in to the body make it surprisingly easy to hold when in use.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews and seeing this rated very high, I purchased this to replace my Remmington Triple Foil that was starting to lose charge very quickly.    </li>
            <li>This shaver is a little cheap feeling and very lightweight, but it seems to work as advertised so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the 7240XL for a little short of 2 weeks now, it runs very quietly but does a good job of shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall, my first shave was as close as any I&#x27;ve ever had...really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had norelcos in the past, but this one is much better.</li>
            <li>nicer then my old one, seems to give a closer shave (could be the new blades though), and new rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li>Then I tried the least expensive Norelco model and experienced a completely clean shave for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not that I care, but aesthetically, this razor looks cheap compared to previous Norelcos that I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>LONG LASTING CHARGE,GOOD SHAVE AND COMFORTABLE TO USE.</li>
            <li>Previously I have owned a Remington shaver, but have done most of my shaving with standard blades.  </li>
            <li>When I shaved with a blade it never failed I&#x27;d catch the scare with the blade and have to reach for the styptic pencil or toilet paper to plug the leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a Norelco, and this one is probably twice as good as any other I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Form factor&#x27;s a little funky, as there&#x27;s no base, and charging is a bit unweildy since you occupy an outlet once a week, and it&#x27;s on its side for that.</li>
            <li>razor shaves nice and close and is extremely quiet versus my old razor (it sounds so quiet, I think once in a while the charge is going down, but it&#x27;s not!).</li>
            <li>My old shaver was an OLD Remington Microflex, the old cobalt-blue ones.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts another 30 years like my old one (which is still working, but I gave it to my kids.)  </li>
            <li>But as far as I&#x27;m concerned the compliments end</li>
            <li>my old (3 years?)</li>
            <li>the old unit, but</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone who wants to try it out, since it does come with a 21-day money back guarantee from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Using an old one.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>so I tried it and WOW.</li>
            <li>But again, I&#x27;m used to the old style Norelcos, so this is probably no news.</li>
            <li>the area near the ears, it does not work as well as razor blade.  </li>
            <li>Gives a really close shave, and is really simple to maintain.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this razor to replace my 20 year old Norelco Triple Header, but after charging it up and using it, all my reservations were gone.  </li>
            <li>I gave this shaver a good two months of effort to ensure I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer on the back is very very efficient, in that I was able to shave down half of my beard and still look like I had a beard afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, but it provides an incredibly gentle shave to the point where you barely know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>norelco needed new blades again, so I decided that rather then spend nearly the same amount on blades, I would instead get this newer (discounted) shaver for nearly the</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different however I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>no regrets with this choice!!</li>
            <li>Also, the trimmer is noisier (and \\&quot;sounds\\&quot; less powerful) than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li>Norelco is more shaver than I need--slightly heavier and bigger than my previous, entry-level model, and it has a curious</li>
            <li>My last one held up for nearly eight years.  </li>
            <li>there is no low battery indicator, like there was on my old one.  </li>
            <li>One moment you are shaving and the next you have to find the cord to complete your shave.      </li>
            <li>But real men do not really care about the looks, or do they?</li>
            <li>I just picked this bad boy up a few days ago, and I have to say I&#x27;m incredibly impressed.</li>
            <li>At first glance, this little gizmo resembles something from the plant Zrylon-5.  </li>
            <li>The only possible minor quirk is that it took me an extra minute or so to shave my neck, but the machine again was gentle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now spring-loaded, which is as convenient to open as the old one with a manual level, but comes with a really severe drawback - you can only use the trimmer by pulling down across your face, not by pushing up.</li>
            <li>Minor irritants so far though.    </li>
            <li>(Amazon apparently caught on and adjusted the formerly upside-down pricing of the two models).</li>
            <li>This extends the life and value of the razor well past the useful life of the battery.</li>
            <li>Other shavers were much more expensive but this one was reasonable and does the job.</li>
            <li>but in the end, could really care less either way.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with that model, but it&#x27;s managed to disappear, leading me to the 7240XL, which Amazon inexplicably had priced at $15-20 below the \\&quot;less deluxe,\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also placed a decent way down from the rotating blades, so you don&#x27;t accidentally give yourself a haircut or a bald spot when trimming your beard/sideburns/mustache</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive neck and the Mach 3 would leave me with razor burn and other facial bumps.  </li>
            <li>Maby I just got a bad one, battery wise.</li>

            <li> This is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Note: for best results do not press against skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> AND THIS IS THE BEST</li>
            <li> If you want the best shave, buy a quality manual razor.</li>
            <li> This razor was a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li> The quality of the shave is very good.</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric razor for the price.</li>
            <li> It has a very good feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> Very good.  </li>
            <li> Very good razor for the price.   </li>
            <li> but this was the best yet and great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly close.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> For the money it is a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Great Razor</li>
            <li> He is happy with the closeness of the shave, rechargeabilty of the battery, he reported no problems or disappointments.</li>
            <li> The tap-rinse feature is great, and I did not expect to find a trimmer too (not advertised).</li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t get it, like who thought this was going to make people happy.  </li>
            <li> This was a great deal</li>
            <li> when it cuts it does a great job, but the blades aren&#x27;t compatable with my series 7 Noelco.....</li>
            <li> and it gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> The fact that you can use it corded is great because if the battery dies during use, you can plug it in and finish shaving before recharging it, which enhances the battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about a year now and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This shaver cuts exceptionally good</li>
            <li> This is a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> One thing I found surprising is that the shaver just stopped while I was shaving with no warning.</li>
            <li> like the difference between looking at a nice sporty car with great lines, and then looking at one of those butchered hummers</li>
            <li> you can get this at a good price, don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> Not withstanding, It is a good ride for my face.  </li>
            <li> Everything looks good except the look is weired.</li>
            <li> It takes a good 8 hours to recharge the unit.  </li>
            <li> It would be a good idea to just charge the razor every 8 - 10 days for the way I shave, you might need to charge it sooner.</li>
            <li> and it cut so close and smooth that I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Shape provides a good grip regardless of how it is held.</li>
            <li> This razor is a good value.</li>
            <li> Shape provides a good grip regardless of how it is held.     </li>
            <li> Turns out that this product is good, but not as good as everyone says.</li>
            <li> To date, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> May not be the most attractive razor, but who cares?</li>
            <li> It is great, I love it.</li>
            <li> I owned many Norelco shavers, but this one has given me the closest shave yet!</li>
            <li> I was injured and now I&#x27;ve got some nice scares just under the chin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own stand, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m deducting &lt;br /&gt;one star.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of it and the closeness of the shaves I got.  </li>
            <li> works good on more barbaras  </li>
            <li> When I turned this on, it honestly felt and sounded like another shaver that&#x27;s at 5% battery level.</li>
            <li> My bumps/razor burn are healing nicely.  </li>
            <li> IT DOES A NICE JOB.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer is equally effective.  </li>
            <li> this is really nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was also happy about the quick delivery - within 48 hours.</li>
            <li> This razor did an excellent job until it was about 3 months old, the battery would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I was beginning to think that mine was just a defect but then decided against doing anything because the rotary type did not seem to be a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> Gives good shave and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Now I have this electric razor and it is so easy!</li>
            <li> the razor is great so easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a great razor, if you&#x27;re willing to charge it often.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great, its very low maintenance (just wash it off with warm water), and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is very smooth &amp; close.</li>
            <li> ; Norelco makes a fine shaver and let&#x27;s be honest, here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;to make sure it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions, shaved as recommended, and have never been satisfied.    </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter, holds a charge longer, and gives a better shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems many have not had this problem</li>
            <li> It is so much better.</li>
            <li> sure hold longer then</li>
            <li> The unit comes with the compact recharging unit, barely more than a core.</li>
            <li> Not only will I be saving money on razor packs and shaving cream, I&#x27;ll be able to show my friends a self-grooming utility that looks like it could take a bullet and gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase, one more time,</li>
            <li> Really nice shave doesn&#x27;t hurt shaves very closely and skin doesn&#x27;t irritate or anything just really really good.</li>
            <li> not matter how many times I go over them.  </li>
            <li> However, the razor does perform much better on the flatter portions of my face.  </li>
            <li> The price now is 10-15$ more than what it was when I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I AM WELL SATISFIED FOR THE PRICE I PAID.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably give it to my son one of these days and get a better Norelco model...</li>
            <li> A lighter touch works better.</li>
            <li> If I had more money, though, I would have bought a nicer shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a shaver I would recommend, or would buy for someone as a gift and would be confident they would like it.  </li>
            <li> All in all, quite pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s washable so water seems to be ok to go through the piece.</li>
            <li> :)     </li>
            <li> OWNED MANY ELECTRIC RAZORS</li>
            <li> This shaver does everything they said it would, and more.</li>
            <li> Better than a safety raxor.</li>
            <li> I find the shave to be not as close as with a razor blade, but better than the Remington.  </li>
            <li> The price is right for this good product.</li>
            <li> Good product, smooth shave, light, quite and holds a pretty good charge.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> The shave is pretty good.</li>
            <li> All in all, its a pretty good device.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave, but I think the best things I like about it are that it&#x27;s very quiet, very smooth against my skin, cordless, and you can rinse it clean with water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Norelco razors over the years and this razor, the 7240xl, has given me the closest, most comfortable shave ever.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since my skin is used to being shaved this way, I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance; it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, slides very easy, is very easy to clean and maintain, and keeps charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver under warm water is convenient and easy and a good idea compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a very good job, and is so quiet, I have</li>
            <li> The ability to rinse it out with water to clean it is a nice feature not to mention I think it is light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a fast close shave, but it is not as good as the Norelco I bought 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Makes cleaning so easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this looks ok, but it feels light and cheap.</li>
            <li> It takes 12 hours to charge and the charge dies very quickly (with no warning or charge indicator).</li>
            <li> Blades conform easily to my angular features without needing to stretch skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to manupilate.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, and I&#x27;m getting three or more shaves out of each recharge of the batteries.</li>
            <li> &quot; It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice.</li>
            <li> although it still shaves fine.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine</li>
            <li> AGAIN, IT&#x27;S DONE A FINE JOB.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean - just wash out.  </li>
            <li> From here on in its \\&quot;smooth shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it works well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This shaver holds a charge well and is light to handle.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this again because it gives me a comfortable, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the springs on the floating heads seem to be a bit stiffer, or else the heads just don&#x27;t fit together as well - the point is, instead of smoothly gliding from one position to another, the heads are noticeably popping into position as you shave.</li>
            <li> It feels like light cheap plastic [...]</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with tap water or brush.</li>
            <li> A genuine bargain.  </li>
            <li> There is a light that blinks when it is done charging.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with tap water or brush.</li>
            <li> Smooth, effortless shave.  </li>
            <li> The plastic exterior makes it look cheap</li>
            <li> The closest shave, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does give a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> With my Remmington, I could get a good complete shave after two minutes of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Replaced 10 year old Norelco and found that this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, gives a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor, and it is cool looking and well priced.</li>
            <li> My favorite is still the top of line black Spectra, which charges super fast and has an incredible battery life (132 minutes on my display).</li>
            <li> Looks strange (space age) but works great.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost, and you can buy replacement heads at WalMart!  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful, but it shaves perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Rinse it clean with running water</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m glad my old Norelco died after  many years</li>
            <li> I bought this based on previous reviews and the incredible $32.99 Amazon sale price.    </li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> Very smooth, fast, close.</li>
            <li> If the razor is kept clean, it delivers a good shave and doesn&#x27;t seem to infect acne any further.</li>
            <li> this one and WOW AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to clean, and it holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> While not as good as shaving with a blade, which is my normal way of shaving, it does a very acceptable job when in a hurry and not wanting to take the time for using the blade.</li>
            <li> You may wish to wait to see if it&#x27;s restocked at its former price, or simply elect to pay the higher freight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of shave is getting better and better, and apparently both my beard and I needed some training.</li>
            <li> I am slow to give perfect scores so a five from me is something.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s how it sounds at full charge.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, and does some pretty clean shavings.</li>
            <li> Washes under the shower head or faucet quickly.  </li>
            <li> This model is better that way because you can hold it many different ways.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older Norelco, and was quite pleased with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> But it delivers the same flawless performance and has niceties such as water-wash</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the quietness of the razor, shaves smooth, quickly and easily even after two days growth.  </li>
            <li> Only thing the top comes off alto!</li>
            <li> I am lucky to get four days of shaving before the battery dies completely without a warning as many others have attested to.    </li>
            <li> It is quiet, faster, closer, and importantly very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I carried this shaver on a family trip and it performed pretty well, keeping all the men in the household with a clean shave.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth, has an extremely comfortable grip, and is exceptionally quiet.  </li>
            <li> The translucent plastic across the front doesn&#x27;t really seem to match nor fit with the rest of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I thought paying $30 for a shaver was too low and that there would be some kind of problem with it</li>
            <li> the old shaver had more streamlined lines.  </li>
            <li> The unit feels comfortable in the hand and the charge lasts for a week or more of daily shaves.  </li>
            <li> I am always a Philips razor fun.</li>
            <li> First of all, it looks really cool.</li>
            <li> At the area around mouth, it does a great job, if you let it go through a few times, also stretch the skin little bit, it does a clean cut as good as razor blade.</li>
            <li> Rubber pads are in the right places, indents are shaped to fit pretty much any hand.</li>
            <li> It cuts just fine, but it folds back too easily while you&#x27;re trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> I really like that I can clean it in tap water.  </li>
            <li> Really like the ability to clean the shaver head under water.</li>
            <li> Hubby really likes it and he likes the fact that he can rinse it under water and clean it that way.</li>
            <li> Compared to all my previous models, I was immediately impressed by how quiet this one is, yet</li>
            <li> Very smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li> I never thought a new shaver would be better than my 30 year old Norelco, but this one is!</li>
            <li> If you can forego the thumb rest and live with blue instead of silver, the 7140XL will serve you just as well, I&#x27;m sure, and currently at a significantly lower price</li>
            <li> I made sure to use it untill it was fully discharged and a charge would last approx.</li>
            <li> it was the first model that came out with the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad it worked because blades are such a pain both figuratively and literally.  </li>
            <li> so I would have to use the trimmer first and then the razor.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be well made, feels pretty hefty in my hand.</li>
            <li> Much to my delight he loves it!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as his first shaver.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have with this shaver is that is so quiet that it makes me always feel like it&#x27;s not charged :)</li>
            <li> Actually I have used one before, not this one, and the razor pulled more hair out than it cut.  </li>
            <li> Light, quiet, smooth and fast shave.  </li>
            <li> Much better value that some of the fancier razors, and the ability to use it as a corded razor is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> Then I decided to try my first shave</li>
            <li> one that I first inspect in a store, since the photo online misled me.</li>
            <li> The shave I get now is equal to or better than the blades and no styptic.  </li>
            <li> This is the first philips Norelco shaver I have had.</li>
            <li> This is my first rotary head shaver.  </li>
            <li> After ten days of using it, I decided to keep it, and now, after a month, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> After ten shaves on the same charge it is still as good as the first.</li>
            <li> Mine is currently en route to Norelco&#x27;s returns facility (at my own expense, naturally), after which I will wait 6-8 weeks and hopefully get a refund.</li>
            <li> It is true that this model is easy to clean; cuts well and is a little unusual feeling in the hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;m not crazy about the wanna be high tech design,</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the number of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I grow facial hair and this razor has been great because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne as much as other electric razors.</li>
            <li> Just once in a while to eliminate sideburns or other facial trimming and it works great.    </li>
            <li> When you open the box your first reaction may be that it&#x27;s cheap because it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li> Quiet, close shave, holds a charge well, cleans easy.</li>
            <li> Shaves two day old beard as easily as one day old.</li>
            <li> Fine product,shaves well and holds it&#x27;s charge for eight to ten shaves.</li>
            <li> I have used previous Norelco shavers, but this by far is the smoothest and most comfortable</li>
            <li> only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but I am fine with that</li>
            <li> Fine shave, although the motor is nearly silent.  </li>
            <li> No major problems with it, holds a charge for a long time, gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers, exclusively, since 1966 when I received my first razor for high school graduation.</li>
            <li> only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I&#x27;m not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running.</li>
            <li> the pop up trimmer works very well, too.</li>
            <li> Very quite also.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, not knowing much at all about electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I really like the way it shaves and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I was really awed when I turned it on.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really cut myself all that much</li>
            <li> but my skin would just really hurt</li>
            <li> Was well worth $35 so far</li>
            <li> Much easier on my face.  </li>
            <li> but they really don&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li> This could very well be Darth Vader&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave to my father, whose face is not as angular as mine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Produces a close shave without too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rinsing under the faucet is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to upgrade since replacment blades were almost as much as the razor itself.</li>
            <li> , I did not know they improved so much.</li>
            <li> My only drawback is the shaver can&#x27;t glide smoothly when the humidity causes my face to be a bit moist.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> what surprised me the most is how incredibly quiet it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a razor that would at least give me a reasonably good shave without going to take a loan out to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> I resisted Norelcos for over 40 years because, frankly, I thought the rotary head looked \\&quot;dorky\\&quot;--especially compared to the more masculine, phallic, lance-like Remingtons and Schicks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a very close shave like razor in most part of the face, compared to other electrical shaving systems I have.</li>
            <li> For special occasions I still use a blade, but for everyday shaving it works fine.</li>
            <li> I can shave right before  a shower or in the middle of the day, maybe right before i go to bed.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can rinse it out after use, but it still recommends you take it apart and clean with a brush once a month - exactly as frequently as the old non-water-cleanable model.    </li>
            <li> No, but it does shave better than any other electric I have ever used</li>
            <li> I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It was out of warranty, and a new lithium battery would cost me as much as the whole assembly to both buy and replace.</li>
            <li> , It is comfortable and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is outstanding as I average just over 10 years before replacing a shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this new Norelco.  </li>
            <li> This is fare better at nearly half the price.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the less pressure I apply the better the shave.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it is much lighter weight and gives a much smoother shave than his old one did.</li>
            <li> Shaves older beard without pulling.   </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried rinsing under the faucet as we have high mineral content water but just blowing and brushing work well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this razor as a gift or for yourself.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this gizmo.</li>
            <li> far* better job than the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this everyday after more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> Above all, THE SHAVE IS MUCH CLOSER AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Although my Remmington battery is not like it was when new, I keep both in my vehicle, first shave with the Norelco to cut down the longer whiskers, and then finish it up with the Remmington to get a close shave quickly.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning is easy since you just push a button, which opens the spring loaded head up (or down)</li>
            <li> But if this is the new \\&quot;face\\&quot; of Norelco; I think I&#x27;ll take my face somewhere else.</li>
            <li> So I figured it was time for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I actually paid less for this one than the Remington and it has better features and much quieter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is to be expected, but this razor also misses several hairs on my neck</li>
            <li> Despite the jagged, robotic appearance (which is half of why it&#x27;s so darn cool), the grips set in to the body make it surprisingly easy to hold when in use.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews and seeing this rated very high, I purchased this to replace my Remmington Triple Foil that was starting to lose charge very quickly.    </li>
            <li> This shaver is a little cheap feeling and very lightweight, but it seems to work as advertised so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 7240XL for a little short of 2 weeks now, it runs very quietly but does a good job of shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall, my first shave was as close as any I&#x27;ve ever had...really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had norelcos in the past, but this one is much better.</li>
            <li> nicer then my old one, seems to give a closer shave (could be the new blades though), and new rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> Then I tried the least expensive Norelco model and experienced a completely clean shave for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not that I care, but aesthetically, this razor looks cheap compared to previous Norelcos that I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> LONG LASTING CHARGE,GOOD SHAVE AND COMFORTABLE TO USE.</li>
            <li> Previously I have owned a Remington shaver, but have done most of my shaving with standard blades.  </li>
            <li> When I shaved with a blade it never failed I&#x27;d catch the scare with the blade and have to reach for the styptic pencil or toilet paper to plug the leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a Norelco, and this one is probably twice as good as any other I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Form factor&#x27;s a little funky, as there&#x27;s no base, and charging is a bit unweildy since you occupy an outlet once a week, and it&#x27;s on its side for that.</li>
            <li> razor shaves nice and close and is extremely quiet versus my old razor (it sounds so quiet, I think once in a while the charge is going down, but it&#x27;s not!).</li>
            <li> My old shaver was an OLD Remington Microflex, the old cobalt-blue ones.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts another 30 years like my old one (which is still working, but I gave it to my kids.)  </li>
            <li> But as far as I&#x27;m concerned the compliments end</li>
            <li> my old (3 years?)</li>
            <li> the old unit, but</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone who wants to try it out, since it does come with a 21-day money back guarantee from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Using an old one.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> so I tried it and WOW.</li>
            <li> But again, I&#x27;m used to the old style Norelcos, so this is probably no news.</li>
            <li> the area near the ears, it does not work as well as razor blade.  </li>
            <li> Gives a really close shave, and is really simple to maintain.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this razor to replace my 20 year old Norelco Triple Header, but after charging it up and using it, all my reservations were gone.  </li>
            <li> I gave this shaver a good two months of effort to ensure I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer on the back is very very efficient, in that I was able to shave down half of my beard and still look like I had a beard afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far, but it provides an incredibly gentle shave to the point where you barely know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> norelco needed new blades again, so I decided that rather then spend nearly the same amount on blades, I would instead get this newer (discounted) shaver for nearly the</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different however I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> no regrets with this choice!!</li>
            <li> Also, the trimmer is noisier (and \\&quot;sounds\\&quot; less powerful) than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> Norelco is more shaver than I need--slightly heavier and bigger than my previous, entry-level model, and it has a curious</li>
            <li> My last one held up for nearly eight years.  </li>
            <li> there is no low battery indicator, like there was on my old one.  </li>
            <li> One moment you are shaving and the next you have to find the cord to complete your shave.      </li>
            <li> But real men do not really care about the looks, or do they?</li>
            <li> I just picked this bad boy up a few days ago, and I have to say I&#x27;m incredibly impressed.</li>
            <li> At first glance, this little gizmo resembles something from the plant Zrylon-5.  </li>
            <li> The only possible minor quirk is that it took me an extra minute or so to shave my neck, but the machine again was gentle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now spring-loaded, which is as convenient to open as the old one with a manual level, but comes with a really severe drawback - you can only use the trimmer by pulling down across your face, not by pushing up.</li>
            <li> Minor irritants so far though.    </li>
            <li> (Amazon apparently caught on and adjusted the formerly upside-down pricing of the two models).</li>
            <li> This extends the life and value of the razor well past the useful life of the battery.</li>
            <li> Other shavers were much more expensive but this one was reasonable and does the job.</li>
            <li> but in the end, could really care less either way.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with that model, but it&#x27;s managed to disappear, leading me to the 7240XL, which Amazon inexplicably had priced at $15-20 below the \\&quot;less deluxe,\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also placed a decent way down from the rotating blades, so you don&#x27;t accidentally give yourself a haircut or a bald spot when trimming your beard/sideburns/mustache</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive neck and the Mach 3 would leave me with razor burn and other facial bumps.  </li>
            <li> Maby I just got a bad one, battery wise.</li>
            <li> You can also clean this razor using running water from your faucet--a nice feature if you&#x27;re like me and hate to bang the head out on your waste basket spilling whiskers everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I rarely cleaned my old models, and when I did it would take too long and be frustrating.</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic material, takes 8 hours to charge (as opposed to less than an  hour for my previous shaver), came without a carrying case, and has no settings for making the shave closer or less close (unlike the earlier model).</li>
            <li> I tried Norelcos&#x27; more expensive model with more cutting blades, but didn&#x27;t like it and returned it (to Norelco, not Amazon).</li>
            <li> use it all week long on one charge and it shaves the same on Friday as it did on Monday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, it holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> issue I&#x27;ve seen is the trimmer is only held open by a spring unlike some other models, so sometimes it will try to fold back while using it.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th or 6th Norelco razor and while I like the way it shaves, I only gave it 3 Stars because it runs slower than all my others and takes a very long time to charge.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the unusual looks, you&#x27;ll like the feel and quality of this razor and it stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The less expensive models offer the same, though the 7240XL is slightly more \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; (with the inclusion of a thumb and finger rest).  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an aging (10 years old) Norelco that had trouble holding a charge.</li>
            <li> After several tries I found my mistake.</li>
            <li> Although you cant expect this shaver to give the same feel as a blade, this razor gives a close shave with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully I&#x27;ll have it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I have owned several rechargable razors before with no issues; only charge when the battery runs down, etc...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the cover, as much more difficult to put on that previous cover,</li>
            <li> The exterior of this shaver is very different from the other Norelcos.</li>
            <li> The booklet suggests a removal and cleaning of the whirling cutters every month, and while the print in the booklet is big enough, the drawing showing the removal and replacement of the cutters is too small for me to interpret--a call to Norelco assured me they&#x27;d send a larger illustration--not yet received.</li>
            <li> This razor does a pretty good job of cutting longer whiskers without using the trimmer, but unfortunately, I still feel a slight stubble after a shave.    </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Shaves almost as close as a blade (maybe a millimiter difference), however, in places on my face where there are hard and sudden turns, I need to go over that area again and again and again, to the point where I get rough rashes and spend nearly 30 minutes shaving.  </li>
            <li> However, ol&#x27; Blue had a slight battery malfunction (it died) and crapped a brick.</li>
            <li> The 7240XL has a whir and a slight scrape to it, and even that&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last quite a while, but there is a slight decrease in speed and power after about four shaves.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this razor exceeded all my expectations!  </li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly bad battery for a reputable company like Philips.</li>
            <li> Sure the pictures on Amazon look ugly...</li>
            <li> Wet my face, lather up, let it soften, and then pull a blade over it.</li>
            <li> But minus one star for the possiblity that I might be caught one day on a weekend trip without the charger and the battery quits on me.</li>
            <li> It served me well, but never really got as close as I&#x27;d like with a shave.</li>
            <li> So I won&#x27;t recommend this razor to be used in a wet environment.  </li>
            <li> When it finally kicked the bucket following an unfortunate water-immersion incident, I figured I&#x27;d go for its direct successor.</li>
            <li> So this is my second shaver I bought first one was not a Phillips shaver it was actually CONAIR and it was bad it would hurt me when I shaved so for a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Norelco patented \\&quot;Lift-and-Cut\\&quot; system, but my previous Norelco model was painful to use--especially with longer growth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver for the past 10 days.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars was due to the functionality of the sideburns trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I just wash it out and apply some baby oil to the rotors every other month or so.</li>
            <li> I have used several of these Norelco shavers over the past 30 years.  </li>
            <li> The 7240XL looks like it could not only shave off the toughest, most brutal of all hairs, but also defend your home from intrusion</li>
            <li> It ran out on me the other morning halfway through my shave.    </li>
            <li> They always sounded aggressive and took wiskers off sharply.  </li>
            <li> For background information, I have used Norelco rotary razors for the past thirty years, my last was an 850RX.</li>
            <li> I wish the charger was just a cord and not a gizmo, but it is small enough.</li>
            <li> Other than that--I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s due time.  </li>
            <li> Have to be very careful of it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is, as has been said here before, it&#x27;s so quiet that it&#x27;s hard to tell when it needs a charge.</li>
            <li> The first few days were difficult for my neck</li>
            <li> but eventually I&#x27;d be forced to go back to a blade every time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t improve over most of the review&#x27;s that are already printed for this product, but I hate to shave.  </li>
            <li> I turned it on and it ran so quietly and slow that I thought it had not charged.</li>
            <li> this thing just mows it down sometimes in one pass.</li>
            <li> The motor was weak and it barely shaved any of my moustache.</li>
            <li> The re&#x3D;charge period is less than 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> My previous Norelcos charged in about 2 to 3 hours...</li>
            <li> A few days after I got it from Amazon saw it at Target for about $12 less</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor as far as the shaving goes, but the battery is just awful.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the side is a little anemic.</li>
            <li> But this can be overcome with a little patience.</li>
            <li> If the shaver is left in a cold place, the battery essentially dies.</li>
            <li> Keep that in mind and put it on the charger after a few days to keep this from happening.     </li>
            <li> Shaves well, even on a few days growth.</li>
            <li> Forget cuddling and kissing the lady after a few minutes with that thing.</li>
            <li> Just run it under water for a few seconds after each use.  </li>
            <li> I bought a beard trimmer because after a few days of growth neither the Remington or the Braun could get a lot of those longer hairs.</li>
            <li> This one I run under a faucet for a few seconds  </li>
            <li> I shave everyday and</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I have used Norelco rotary razors for almost 30 years, with an 850RX for the past 10+.</li>
            <li> I find other styles of shaver don&#x27;t cut as close, at least not on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have used the razor everyday for the past 21 days, about 10 minutes a day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slow down as the battery drains like you&#x27;d expect...</li>
            <li> This shaver is odd looking to say the least but when I receeived it</li>
            <li> It was expensive and you had to keep buying that fluid and eventually the station crapped out.  </li>
            <li> Most shavers have a horrific, pigs-being-slaughtered metal grinding noise when the blades spin up.</li>
            <li> Low cost, but without silly frills.  </li>
            <li> Small wonder that they sold out.  </li>
            <li> Comparable with the actual razors I&#x27;ve used over the past few years, which is saying something since I like those crazy 5-blade models.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat at the price.</li>
            <li> I was pressing too hard with the shaver.</li>
            <li> but I hardly ever use it.</li>
            <li> (I hardly dare to use it),</li>
            <li> The only plus with this razor, is that the Remmington didn&#x27;t like cutting longer whiskers</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, and the shape of the shaver doesn&#x27;t work well for cutting above the mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle thing, it runs a bit slower when it needs a charge (after 10 days)</li>
            <li> I had requested it because shaving with a regular razor (Mach 3) had become too painful.  </li>
            <li> But, if you have a round or average face, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this model.  </li>
            <li> is small and feeble.</li>
            <li> I can shave while I watch TV, play a video game, or whatever.</li>
            <li> Tired battery, bulky</li>
            <li> , the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with this shaver:    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but pulling is completely useless for me, thus making the trimmer useless as well.    </li>
            <li> Sorry, but Amazon&#x27;s staff recommendation of this shaver is just not warranted.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> bad about leaving my razor behind when I travel, so I keep one in my travel kit and swap them every time I charge the one at home.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Too bad this doesn&#x27;t come &lt;</li>
            <li> I would just use razors to shave but that was bad too</li>
            <li> Bad move.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one, but bad is bad....</li>
            <li> and this razor is bad...</li>
            <li> (One star off for being ugly)</li>
            <li> after removing it from the charger you can hear it lose RPMs by 3 days it sounds sickly.</li>
            <li> This is a really stupid reason to buy a shaver, but I guess Philips knows that consumers do stupid things.</li>
            <li> Stands upright on counter without need of a base.</li>
            <li> Stands upright on counter without need of a base.   </li>
            <li> I used to HATE shaving!</li>
            <li> The battery life is horrible....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEF1VE Philips Norelco 7240XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]I purchased this shaver about 8 months ago from amazon to replace a Norelco that I had for about 5 years and finally would not hold a charge. This shaver cuts exceptionally good and I was extremely happy with it. I made sure to use it untill it was fully discharged and a charge would last approx. 1 week but after only 4 months, it would not hold a charge lasting only for 1 shave. Now I use it as a corded shaver only. It still gives probably the best shave I have had. but as a cordless shaver, I cannot reccomend it to anyone. Maby I just got a bad one, battery wise.</li>
            <li> I am slow to give perfect scores so a five from me is something.  I have owned every brand of electric razor there.  I&#x27;d try it for a while but eventually I&#x27;d be forced to go back to a blade every time.  My last was a Braun it was the first model that came out with the cleaning station.  It was expensive and you had to keep buying that fluid and eventually the station crapped out.  This is fare better at nearly half the price.  I really like that I can clean it in tap water.  Makes cleaning so easy.  I am so glad it worked because blades are such a pain both figuratively and literally.  May of 05&#x27; shaving got to be more complicated for me.  I was injured and now I&#x27;ve got some nice scares just under the chin.  When I shaved with a blade it never failed I&#x27;d catch the scare with the blade and have to reach for the styptic pencil or toilet paper to plug the leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Norelco.  You made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver for the past 10 days. &lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job, and is so quiet, I have &lt;br /&gt;to make sure it&#x27;s on. Too bad this doesn&#x27;t come &lt;br /&gt;with it&#x27;s own stand, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m deducting &lt;br /&gt;one star.</li>
            <li> This razor was a pleasant surprise!  It is very smooth, has an extremely comfortable grip, and is exceptionally quiet.  For the price, I believe this razor is a BEST BUY!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used. I have owned several electric razors and this is by far the best. It shaves as close as a blade and it holds a charge for three weeks. I would highly recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> I have a bit of acne around around areas were I grow facial hair and this razor has been great because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne as much as other electric razors. It is easy to clean, gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor, and it is cool looking and well priced. If the razor is kept clean, it delivers a good shave and doesn&#x27;t seem to infect acne any further. Worked for me and I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the fact that this razor looks like something out of a Ridley Scott sci-fi thriller turn you off.  It works like a charm.  It&#x27;s quiet, provides a close/clean shave, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s pulling your whiskers out one at a time.  I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Norelco patented \\&quot;Lift-and-Cut\\&quot; system, but my previous Norelco model was painful to use--especially with longer growth.  With this model, longer whiskers are no problem.  You can also clean this razor using running water from your faucet--a nice feature if you&#x27;re like me and hate to bang the head out on your waste basket spilling whiskers everywhere.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5/5 stars was due to the functionality of the sideburns trimmer.  It cuts just fine, but it folds back too easily while you&#x27;re trying to use it.  I&#x27;ve had this razor now for over a month and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Fine product,shaves well and holds it&#x27;s charge for eight to ten shaves.Hard to beat at the price.</li>
            <li> This shaver is odd looking to say the least but when I receeived it I liked the feel of it and the closeness of the shaves I got.  I also like the idea that It is washable and holds a charge for quite some time.</li>
            <li> This razor did an excellent job until it was about 3 months old, the battery would not hold a charge.  I have owned several rechargable razors before with no issues; only charge when the battery runs down, etc...It is now a corded razor and I cannot recommend it to anyone.  Looks like several others had the same problem.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews and seeing this rated very high, I purchased this to replace my Remmington Triple Foil that was starting to lose charge very quickly.    With my Remmington, I could get a good complete shave after two minutes of shaving.  With the Norelco, it takes five minutes of shaving and it never felt as close as the shave I got with the Remmington.    I am lucky to get four days of shaving before the battery dies completely without a warning as many others have attested to.    I gave this shaver a good two months of effort to ensure I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong.  I read the instructions, shaved as recommended, and have never been satisfied.    The only plus with this razor, is that the Remmington didn&#x27;t like cutting longer whiskers so I would have to use the trimmer first and then the razor.  This razor does a pretty good job of cutting longer whiskers without using the trimmer, but unfortunately, I still feel a slight stubble after a shave.    Although my Remmington battery is not like it was when new, I keep both in my vehicle, first shave with the Norelco to cut down the longer whiskers, and then finish it up with the Remmington to get a close shave quickly.  It is a kludge, but it works.</li>
            <li> the razor is great so easy to use and clean I use it to shave my head works good on more barbaras  it will pay for it self in no time ken</li>
            <li> This is a good electric razor. Does it shave as close as a blade? No, but it does shave better than any other electric I have ever used, It is comfortable and the battery lasts a long time. For the money it is a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all week long on one charge and it shaves the same on Friday as it did on Monday.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I love it. I had Remington&#x27;s but this was the best yet and great price. Only thing the top comes off alto! Have to be very careful of it.</li>
            <li> I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave. And isn&#x27;t that what we want in the end?  &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know anyone who buys one of these things for its \\&quot;ergonomic design features.\\&quot; It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice. Rinse it clean with running water and you&#x27;re done. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I&#x27;m not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running. It seems like it&#x27;s always needing a charge...but that&#x27;s how it sounds at full charge. It will take some getting used to I guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus.  &lt;br /&gt;Also, the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated.</li>
            <li> Nunca antes habia usado una rasuradora siempre use rastrillo y la primera vez que la use tenia una barba de 5 dias, me dejo muy bien rasurado, nada de puntos negros sino al raz, estoy muy sorprendido del resultado, la recomiendo ampliamente, ademas las cabezas de las hojas tienen una duracion de un a&amp;ntilde;o. vale la pena la inversion y el resultado es muy bueno.</li>
            <li> This is my third cordless electric razor.  I bought a Remington a year ago and the trimmer broke after 8 months.  I actually paid less for this one than the Remington and it has better features and much quieter.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I never thought a new shaver would be better than my 30 year old Norelco, but this one is! It&#x27;s quieter, holds a charge longer, and gives a better shave. It seems to be well made, feels pretty hefty in my hand. The only complaint I have is, as has been said here before, it&#x27;s so quiet that it&#x27;s hard to tell when it needs a charge. It&#x27;s a subtle thing, it runs a bit slower when it needs a charge (after 10 days) although it still shaves fine.  the pop up trimmer works very well, too. I hope it lasts another 30 years like my old one (which is still working, but I gave it to my kids.)  Norelco shavers rule!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an aging (10 years old) Norelco that had trouble holding a charge. It is true that this model is easy to clean; cuts well and is a little unusual feeling in the hand. But as far as I&#x27;m concerned the compliments end there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe mine is defective but this shaver has the shortest charge capacity of any shavers I&#x27;ve known. After one or two shaves it needs to be recharged which takes a couple of hours. So, for 15 minutes of shaving you need a 2 hour recharge? This is no deal. In fact, this is no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems many have not had this problem or so I&#x27;ve not seen it in their reviews. But if this is the new \\&quot;face\\&quot; of Norelco; I think I&#x27;ll take my face somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver. I thought paying $30 for a shaver was too low and that there would be some kind of problem with it but I was wrong. Gives good shave and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have used previous Norelco shavers, but this by far is the smoothest and most comfortable shave I have ever experienced. Very quite also. I have only one negitive thing to say, and that is, it is not cosmetically pleasing, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> When you open the box your first reaction may be that it&#x27;s cheap because it&#x27;s plastic. Once you get over that and focus on the reason for purchasing the product (its shaving abilities) you&#x27;ll find that this shaver is quite impressive.     I&#x27;ve been using a razor all my life because electric shavers just couldn&#x27;t compare with the closeness a razor provides.    This razor changed my opinion forever. What a great shaver! I provides me with the close shave I demand without skin irritation.     Since it&#x27;s rechargeable I can take it with me and the charge lasts about 1 week. One thing I found surprising is that the shaver just stopped while I was shaving with no warning. It doesn&#x27;t slow down as the battery drains like you&#x27;d expect...it just stops. Keep that in mind and put it on the charger after a few days to keep this from happening.     One improvement suggestion: It needs to have a low battery warning indicator.     I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, this was a disappointment. The motor was weak and it barely shaved any of my moustache. When I turned this on, it honestly felt and sounded like another shaver that&#x27;s at 5% battery level. I was beginning to think that mine was just a defect but then decided against doing anything because the rotary type did not seem to be a good fit for me. I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, and the shape of the shaver doesn&#x27;t work well for cutting above the mouth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this looks ok, but it feels light and cheap.</li>
            <li> A few days after I got it from Amazon saw it at Target for about $12 less</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used. Looks strange (space age) but works great. Quiet, close shave, holds a charge well, cleans easy. I&#x27;ve not tried rinsing under the faucet as we have high mineral content water but just blowing and brushing work well. Best I&#x27;ve tried. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I used to HATE shaving! Wet my face, lather up, let it soften, and then pull a blade over it. ugh. Not anymore! Now I have this electric razor and it is so easy! I can shave while I watch TV, play a video game, or whatever. I can shave right before  a shower or in the middle of the day, maybe right before i go to bed. It is so much better. &lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but I am fine with that and so is my face.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, even on a few days growth. Easy to clean - just wash out.  I&#x27;m still using this everyday after more than 4 years. I just wash it out and apply some baby oil to the rotors every other month or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, not knowing much at all about electric shavers.  Much to my delight he loves it!  Apparently it is much lighter weight and gives a much smoother shave than his old one did. He&#x27;s very pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Norelco 7240XL electric shaver. To date, I am very pleased with this product. I have been using Norelco shavers, exclusively, since 1966 when I received my first razor for high school graduation. This is only my 4th shaver in just over 40 years of use. The quality of the product is outstanding as I average just over 10 years before replacing a shaver. The quality of the shave is very good. I would recommend a Norelco product to anyone who needs to purchase an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this razor exceeded all my expectations!  It was a birthday gift to me from my wife, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It gives a close shave, but I think the best things I like about it are that it&#x27;s very quiet, very smooth against my skin, cordless, and you can rinse it clean with water.  I highly recommend buying this razor as a gift or for yourself.</li>
            <li> After several tries I found my mistake. I was pressing too hard with the shaver. From here on in its \\&quot;smooth shaving\\&quot;. Great Razor</li>
            <li> my old (3 years?) norelco needed new blades again, so I decided that rather then spend nearly the same amount on blades, I would instead get this newer (discounted) shaver for nearly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels nicer then my old one, seems to give a closer shave (could be the new blades though), and new rechargeable batteries sure hold longer then the old unit, but what surprised me the most is how incredibly quiet it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not crazy about the wanna be high tech design, but in the end, could really care less either way.  the old shaver had more streamlined lines.  like the difference between looking at a nice sporty car with great lines, and then looking at one of those butchered hummers these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you can get this at a good price, don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> Although you cant expect this shaver to give the same feel as a blade, this razor gives a close shave with minimal effort.  The unit feels comfortable in the hand and the charge lasts for a week or more of daily shaves.  The re&#x3D;charge period is less than 4 hours.  The unit comes with the compact recharging unit, barely more than a core.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as his first shaver. He is happy with the closeness of the shave, rechargeabilty of the battery, he reported no problems or disappointments.</li>
            <li> THIS GAVE HIM A VALUABLE BOOST IN SPIRIT AND ARRIVED IN TIME TO GIVE HIM A LOT OF USE. THANKS</li>
            <li> I had only one electric shaver before this one, a Remington, which performed well even after 4 years of use. The biggest problem I have with this shaver is that is so quiet that it makes me always feel like it&#x27;s not charged :)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since my skin is used to being shaved this way, I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance; it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, slides very easy, is very easy to clean and maintain, and keeps charge for a decent amount of time. I recommend it to everyone who wants to try it out, since it does come with a 21-day money back guarantee from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have used several of these Norelco shavers over the past 30 years.  My last one held up for nearly eight years.  Compared to all my previous models, I was immediately impressed by how quiet this one is, yet it still gets the job done.  I find other styles of shaver don&#x27;t cut as close, at least not on my face.  The only thing I do not care for is that I have no idea when the battery is low becuase there is no low battery indicator, like there was on my old one.  Also, I like that this one can be rinsed out and cleaned under running water.  So, on the plus side: it&#x27;s quiet, it works well and is easy to clean.  But minus one star for the possiblity that I might be caught one day on a weekend trip without the charger and the battery quits on me.</li>
            <li> This shaver holds a charge well and is light to handle.  I really like the way it shaves and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the quietness of the razor, shaves smooth, quickly and easily even after two days growth.  The pop-up trimmer however rattles a bit noisily</li>
            <li> I just picked this bad boy up a few days ago, and I have to say I&#x27;m incredibly impressed. My old shaver was an OLD Remington Microflex, the old cobalt-blue ones. It served me well, but never really got as close as I&#x27;d like with a shave. I was usually left with stubble akin to diamond-coated sandpaper. Forget cuddling and kissing the lady after a few minutes with that thing. However, ol&#x27; Blue had a slight battery malfunction (it died) and crapped a brick. It was out of warranty, and a new lithium battery would cost me as much as the whole assembly to both buy and replace. So I figured it was time for a new shaver. Went out and picked up the 7240XL on both looks and brand; Norelco makes a fine shaver and let&#x27;s be honest, here. The 7240XL looks like it could not only shave off the toughest, most brutal of all hairs, but also defend your home from intrusion should you wave it at an attacker. Despite the jagged, robotic appearance (which is half of why it&#x27;s so darn cool), the grips set in to the body make it surprisingly easy to hold when in use. Rubber pads are in the right places, indents are shaped to fit pretty much any hand. I was really awed when I turned it on. Most shavers have a horrific, pigs-being-slaughtered metal grinding noise when the blades spin up. The 7240XL has a whir and a slight scrape to it, and even that&#x27;s quiet. The only time I really hear any loud noises is when passing it through thick beard hair. The pop-up trimmer on the back is very very efficient, in that I was able to shave down half of my beard and still look like I had a beard afterwards. It&#x27;s also placed a decent way down from the rotating blades, so you don&#x27;t accidentally give yourself a haircut or a bald spot when trimming your beard/sideburns/mustache/whatever. As for the shave itself? It&#x27;s incredibly close. Comparable with the actual razors I&#x27;ve used over the past few years, which is saying something since I like those crazy 5-blade models. Not only will I be saving money on razor packs and shaving cream, I&#x27;ll be able to show my friends a self-grooming utility that looks like it could take a bullet and gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years. Five closely-trimmed stars.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t improve over most of the review&#x27;s that are already printed for this product, but I hate to shave.  I used a Remington for two years and eventually got away from it.  I wanted to purchase, one more time, a razor that would at least give me a reasonably good shave without going to take a loan out to purchase it.  So after reading the reviews for this razor I bought it.  I really like it. I will admit that I cannot shave without a pre-shave.  Not withstanding, It is a good ride for my face.  I do not use it in the shower.  Actually I have used one before, not this one, and the razor pulled more hair out than it cut.  So I won&#x27;t recommend this razor to be used in a wet environment.  Well worth the cost, and you can buy replacement heads at WalMart!  What a deal what a deal.</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric razor for the price. My husband likes that it is so quiet and gives him a close shave. I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> At first glance, this little gizmo resembles something from the plant Zrylon-5.  I have only used it once so far, but it provides an incredibly gentle shave to the point where you barely know it&#x27;s there. The tap-rinse feature is great, and I did not expect to find a trimmer too (not advertised). The only possible minor quirk is that it took me an extra minute or so to shave my neck, but the machine again was gentle.  Overall, my first shave was as close as any I&#x27;ve ever had...really.</li>
            <li> So this is my second shaver I bought first one was not a Phillips shaver it was actually CONAIR and it was bad it would hurt me when I shaved so for a while I would just use razors to shave but that was bad too, I didn&#x27;t really cut myself all that much but my skin would just really hurt so I didn&#x27;t like that so I tried this one and WOW AMAZING. Really nice shave doesn&#x27;t hurt shaves very closely and skin doesn&#x27;t irritate or anything just really really good. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different however I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a quality electric razor.  The battery life is great, its very low maintenance (just wash it off with warm water), and does a good job.  Depending on your rate of hair growth, you will probably need to shave every day with this for the first month in order to get past the itchy/burned stage.</li>
            <li> Good product, smooth shave, light, quite and holds a pretty good charge. No case. Using an old one. Was well worth $35 so far</li>
            <li> I received this razor for Christmas from my wife.  I had requested it because shaving with a regular razor (Mach 3) had become too painful.  I have a very sensitive neck and the Mach 3 would leave me with razor burn and other facial bumps.  So, I just finished my 21-day trial and here are the results:    Pros:  1)  Much easier on my face.  My bumps/razor burn are healing nicely.  2)  Very easy to clean.  Just run it under water for a few seconds after each use.  3)  Holds charge well.  I have used the razor everyday for the past 21 days, about 10 minutes a day.  I have charged the razor 3 times, including the initial charge.    Cons:  1)  Shave is not as close as the Mach 3.  I&#x27;m sure this is to be expected, but this razor also misses several hairs on my neck not matter how many times I go over them.  However, the razor does perform much better on the flatter portions of my face.  2)  No battery indicator.  It ran out on me the other morning halfway through my shave.    Overall, I really like this razor.  Don&#x27;t expect it to cut as close as a Mach 3 though.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving Norelco I have used in the 35 years I have used an electric razor.  Light, quiet, smooth and fast shave.  The charge seems to last quite a while, but there is a slight decrease in speed and power after about four shaves.  Much better value that some of the fancier razors, and the ability to use it as a corded razor is a big plus.  This extends the life and value of the razor well past the useful life of the battery.</li>
            <li> I have the same experience with my razor as others,e.g. Tired battery, bulky, I just don&#x27;t get it, like who thought this was going to make people happy.  I have had just about all the different electric razors Norelco has come out with since I can remember.  They always sounded aggressive and took wiskers off sharply.  I am giving them or it a chance,  I will comment back after a month.</li>
            <li> I am always a Philips razor fun. This one is a gift to my father-in-law. Everything looks good except the look is weired.</li>
            <li> My husband reports:    I would buy this again because it gives me a comfortable, close shave.  What I don&#x27;t like is that there is no warning when the battery runs out of power.  One moment you are shaving and the next you have to find the cord to complete your shave.      It takes a good 8 hours to recharge the unit.  My previous Norelcos charged in about 2 to 3 hours...but the copy did report this so I knew what I was getting into.  It would be a good idea to just charge the razor every 8 - 10 days for the way I shave, you might need to charge it sooner.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve used Braun and Remington but never tried the phillips. This was a great deal so I tried it and WOW. I bought a beard trimmer because after a few days of growth neither the Remington or the Braun could get a lot of those longer hairs. It would take me 10 minutes to trim the longer hairs then use the razor then repeat. Even doing that my neck hair didn&#x27;t always get cut. From day one this thing picked up neck hair and 2-3 day growth no problem. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple months I get the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric. It takes me 2-3 minutes tops, and I&#x27;m meticulous. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s 1 day or 4 days this thing just mows it down sometimes in one pass. I&#x27;ll be buying replacement blades for this and using it until it dies. The trimmer works fine but I hardly ever use it. Just once in a while to eliminate sideburns or other facial trimming and it works great.    I&#x27;ll be buying another phillips again if this one dies but hopefully I&#x27;ll have it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> No major problems with it, holds a charge for a long time, gives a good shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only issue I&#x27;ve seen is the trimmer is only held open by a spring unlike some other models, so sometimes it will try to fold back while using it.</li>
            <li> After I charged this razor I turned it on and it ran so quietly and slow that I thought it had not charged. Then I decided to try my first shave and it cut so close and smooth that I was impressed. After ten shaves on the same charge it is still as good as the first. Cleaning the shaver under warm water is convenient and easy and a good idea compared to my old Norelco. The price is right for this good product.</li>
            <li> Replaced 10 year old Norelco and found that this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a Norelco 5863 XL for years before this. When it finally kicked the bucket following an unfortunate water-immersion incident, I figured I&#x27;d go for its direct successor. Bad move. Norelco&#x27;s manufacturing standards appear to have dropped precipitously over the last decade.    Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with this shaver:    1. It just doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as its predecessor. Additionally, the springs on the floating heads seem to be a bit stiffer, or else the heads just don&#x27;t fit together as well - the point is, instead of smoothly gliding from one position to another, the heads are noticeably popping into position as you shave. It&#x27;s disconcerting.    2. The trimmer is just godawful. It&#x27;s now spring-loaded, which is as convenient to open as the old one with a manual level, but comes with a really severe drawback - you can only use the trimmer by pulling down across your face, not by pushing up. If you try to push, the trimmer will just close, since you can no longer hold it open by holding you thumb on the level. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but pulling is completely useless for me, thus making the trimmer useless as well.    3. The water-cleanable feature is a half-truth. Yes, you can rinse it out after use, but it still recommends you take it apart and clean with a brush once a month - exactly as frequently as the old non-water-cleanable model.    4. It feels like light cheap plastic [...] in your hand.    5. Sure the pictures on Amazon look ugly... but they really don&#x27;t do it justice. This could very well be Darth Vader&#x27;s shaver. If you&#x27;ve got a techno-dystopian theme going in your consumer electronics, then go for it... otherwise, you may want to reconsider.    Mine is currently en route to Norelco&#x27;s returns facility (at my own expense, naturally), after which I will wait 6-8 weeks and hopefully get a refund. Sorry, but Amazon&#x27;s staff recommendation of this shaver is just not warranted.</li>
            <li> I owned many Norelco shavers, but this one has given me the closest shave yet! Very smooth and quiet. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave to my father, whose face is not as angular as mine.  In \\&quot;straight\\&quot; places on my face, it shaves well.  Shaves almost as close as a blade (maybe a millimiter difference), however, in places on my face where there are hard and sudden turns, I need to go over that area again and again and again, to the point where I get rough rashes and spend nearly 30 minutes shaving.  For my face, which is very angular and unround, I guess every electric razor will not fit.  But, if you have a round or average face, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this model.  (Results after a month of use)  The price now is 10-15$ more than what it was when I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I AM WELL SATISFIED FOR THE PRICE I PAID.  IT DOES A NICE JOB.  IT&#x27;S BEEN YEARS SINCE I USED AN ELECTRIC RAZOR AND AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS OF TRAINING MY BEARD TO AN ELECTRIC AGAIN, IT&#x27;S DONE A FINE JOB.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a fast close shave, but it is not as good as the Norelco I bought 10 years ago. It is made of cheap plastic material, takes 8 hours to charge (as opposed to less than an  hour for my previous shaver), came without a carrying case, and has no settings for making the shave closer or less close (unlike the earlier model). I&#x27;ll probably give it to my son one of these days and get a better Norelco model...one that I first inspect in a store, since the photo online misled me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for eight months, now.  It&#x27;s quiet and comfortable.  Produces a close shave without too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I care, but aesthetically, this razor looks cheap compared to previous Norelcos that I&#x27;ve owned.  The translucent plastic across the front doesn&#x27;t really seem to match nor fit with the rest of the unit.  It looks tacked-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bad about leaving my razor behind when I travel, so I keep one in my travel kit and swap them every time I charge the one at home.  As an experiment, I purchased a similarly-priced Braun at the same time I got this one.  The Norelco does a *far* better job than the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough difference that I&#x27;m here today to purchase a second one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  (One star off for being ugly)</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor as far as the shaving goes, but the battery is just awful. It takes 12 hours to charge and the charge dies very quickly (with no warning or charge indicator). If the shaver is left in a cold place, the battery essentially dies. This is a surprisingly bad battery for a reputable company like Philips.</li>
            <li> For background information, I have used Norelco rotary razors for the past thirty years, my last was an 850RX. Have used the 7240XL for two weeks. Did hours of web research before buying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Positives: &lt;br /&gt;1. Shaving: Very smooth, fast, close. No razor burn. Blades conform easily to my angular features without needing to stretch skin. Note: for best results do not press against skin. A lighter touch works better. Shaves two day old beard as easily as one day old. Shaved longer hairs on neck without pulling. Trimmer is equally effective.  &lt;br /&gt;2. So quiet I though it was defective, until I used it to shave. &lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to clean with tap water or brush. Stands upright on counter without need of a base. &lt;br /&gt;4. Shape provides a good grip regardless of how it is held. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Negatives: &lt;br /&gt;1. Shape may take some getting used to, but personally has not been a problem. (See \\&quot;4\\&quot; above) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Summary: As the title says, the 7240XL exceeded my expectation</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a while back because I wanted to switch back from a razor. First of all, it looks really cool. This is a really stupid reason to buy a shaver, but I guess Philips knows that consumers do stupid things. The shave is pretty good. I have always shaved well with electric shavers, and this one preforms well too. It is pretty easy to clean, and it holds a charge well. The trimmer on the side is a little anemic. There is no dial to change the closeness of the shave, and I do miss that feature quite a bit. All in all, its a pretty good device. If I had more money, though, I would have bought a nicer shaver.</li>
            <li> this is really nice shaver.  The only problem I have is this burns my skin and my face is inflamed for several hours after using this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he is very happy with it.  Other shavers were much more expensive but this one was reasonable and does the job.</li>
            <li> Starting out in &#x27;50&#x27;s with a Remington and into &#x27;60&#x27;s with the blade, I continued with blade until I received the 7240XL.  My hand had started to shake and I was using lots of styptic stick so decided to try an electric.  I found the 7240XL on line and read at the time 19 reviews which convinced me to give it a try.  I cannot say enough good things about this shaver.  The shave I get now is equal to or better than the blades and no styptic.  I have found that the less pressure I apply the better the shave.  The first few days were difficult for my neck but once I reduced the pressure on the shaver I have not had an issue.  It holds a charge for about 10 days and is very quiet.  Rinsing under the faucet is a real plus.  I highly recommend this shaver.  I wish I had tried it sooner. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> A genuine bargain.  Shave in or out of the shower.  Washes under the shower head or faucet quickly.  Fine shave, although the motor is nearly silent.  Low cost, but without silly frills.  Plastic case, but solid feel.  This is a shaver I would recommend, or would buy for someone as a gift and would be confident they would like it.  Only 2 negatives:  Does not show a low battery state and the sideburn trimmer is small and feeble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had norelcos in the past, but this one is much better. The literature says to give it three weeks to compare against a blade shave, but I found it as close within three days. (Even closer than shaving with a blade \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;.)    Form factor&#x27;s a little funky, as there&#x27;s no base, and charging is a bit unweildy since you occupy an outlet once a week, and it&#x27;s on its side for that. Minor irritants so far though.    Rinsing the head under water after shaving is a big plus too. But again, I&#x27;m used to the old style Norelcos, so this is probably no news. I like it though.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon for about 30 bucks. I was hoping to upgrade since replacment blades were almost as much as the razor itself. I also found it for $28 at Target. I am compelled to write to hopefully help some of you avoid this razor. The battery life is horrible....after removing it from the charger you can hear it lose RPMs by 3 days it sounds sickly. Maybe I just got a bad one, but bad is bad....and this razor is bad...when it cuts it does a great job, but the blades aren&#x27;t compatable with my series 7 Noelco.....so I am stuck.....caveat emptor!7240</li>
            <li> This electric razor does what it says. I have always used a regular razor.  I tried this and it gives a great close shave. It takes about 3-4 weeks  for you to notice the close shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver can do a job almost same as the razor blade.  At the area around mouth, it does a great job, if you let it go through a few times, also stretch the skin little bit, it does a clean cut as good as razor blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the area near the ears, it does not work as well as razor blade.  So do not toss out the razor blade yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does a very close shave like razor in most part of the face, compared to other electrical shaving systems I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a Norelco, and this one is probably twice as good as any other I&#x27;ve used in the past. It is quiet, faster, closer, and importantly very easy to clean. I rarely cleaned my old models, and when I did it would take too long and be frustrating. This one I run under a faucet for a few seconds  and it&#x27;s clean.  I wish the charger was just a cord and not a gizmo, but it is small enough. There is a light that blinks when it is done charging. The charge lasts a very long time.  It has a very good feel in the hand. Now I&#x27;m glad my old Norelco died after  many years, I did not know they improved so much.</li>
            <li> This razor is a good value. I tried Norelcos&#x27; more expensive model with more cutting blades, but didn&#x27;t like it and returned it (to Norelco, not Amazon). One of my peeves on some models is tripping the on/off button because of it&#x27;s placement. This model is better that way because you can hold it many different ways. My favorite is still the top of line black Spectra, which charges super fast and has an incredible battery life (132 minutes on my display). This razor uses the same cutters as my Spectra, which was one of the reasons I got it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  It&#x27;s quiet, it holds a charge for a long time.  The ability to wash hair off the business end of the shaver is convenient.  Above all, THE SHAVE IS MUCH CLOSER AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED. I highly recommend this gizmo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 7240XL for a little short of 2 weeks now, it runs very quietly but does a good job of shaving. My only drawback is the shaver can&#x27;t glide smoothly when the humidity causes my face to be a bit moist. But this can be overcome with a little patience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Definitely, no regrets with this choice!!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older Norelco, and was quite pleased with the closeness of the shave. While not as good as shaving with a blade, which is my normal way of shaving, it does a very acceptable job when in a hurry and not wanting to take the time for using the blade. All in all, quite pleased with the unit. Really like the ability to clean the shaver head under water. Don&#x27;t like the cover, as much more difficult to put on that previous cover,</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this new Norelco.  The only beef I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge for 18 hours as it said on the package.  It only held the charge for 1-2 hours tops before it stopped working altogether and we had to plug it in again.  But it&#x27;s a great razor, if you&#x27;re willing to charge it often.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, and I like it very much.  Gives a really close shave, and is really simple to maintain.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I have used Norelco rotary razors for almost 30 years, with an 850RX for the past 10+. I have used the 7240XL for a month now.  I bought this based on previous reviews and the incredible $32.99 Amazon sale price.    Positives:   1. Shaving is very smooth &amp; close. Shaves older beard without pulling.   2. Extremely quiet.   3. Easy to clean with tap water or brush. Stands upright on counter without need of a base.   4. Shape provides a good grip regardless of how it is held.     Negatives:   1. I prefer the trimmer location off the end/top vs \\&quot;out the side\\&quot;.  2. May not be the most attractive razor, but who cares?</li>
            <li> I resisted Norelcos for over 40 years because, frankly, I thought the rotary head looked \\&quot;dorky\\&quot;--especially compared to the more masculine, phallic, lance-like Remingtons and Schicks.  Then I tried the least expensive Norelco model and experienced a completely clean shave for the first time in my life.  I was happy with that model, but it&#x27;s managed to disappear, leading me to the 7240XL, which Amazon inexplicably had priced at $15-20 below the \\&quot;less deluxe,\\&quot; cosmetically blue 7140XL.  Small wonder that they sold out.  You may wish to wait to see if it&#x27;s restocked at its former price, or simply elect to pay the higher freight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco is more shaver than I need--slightly heavier and bigger than my previous, entry-level model, and it has a curious but I assume functional plastic \\&quot;shield\\&quot; (hair-catcher?).  Also, the trimmer is noisier (and \\&quot;sounds\\&quot; less powerful) than its predecessor.  But it delivers the same flawless performance and has niceties such as water-wash clean (I hardly dare to use it), adjustability to the curvature of the face, and automatic voltage selection.  The less expensive models offer the same, though the 7240XL is slightly more \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; (with the inclusion of a thumb and finger rest).  If you can forego the thumb rest and live with blue instead of silver, the 7140XL will serve you just as well, I&#x27;m sure, and currently at a significantly lower price (Amazon apparently caught on and adjusted the formerly upside-down pricing of the two models).</li>
            <li> This is the first philips Norelco shaver I have had. It&#x27;s light weight, and does some pretty clean shavings. It&#x27;s washable so water seems to be ok to go through the piece. How well does the blades resist moisture? I guess we will find out as time goes by.     I carried this shaver on a family trip and it performed pretty well, keeping all the men in the household with a clean shave. :)     The exterior of this shaver is very different from the other Norelcos. But real men do not really care about the looks, or do they?</li>
            <li> OWNED MANY ELECTRIC RAZORS AND THIS IS THE BEST I EVER HAD. LONG LASTING CHARGE,GOOD SHAVE AND COMFORTABLE TO USE.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Very good.  Smooth, effortless shave.  Easy to manupilate.  Quiet.  Long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> This is the finest shaver I have ever used, BAR NONE. This shaver does everything they said it would, and more. Better than a safety raxor. &lt;br /&gt;David C. Jones P.O. Box 155 Rolling Prairie In. 46371</li>
            <li> This is my first rotary head shaver.  Previously I have owned a Remington shaver, but have done most of my shaving with standard blades.  I find the shave to be not as close as with a razor blade, but better than the Remington.  This shaver is a little cheap feeling and very lightweight, but it seems to work as advertised so far.  For special occasions I still use a blade, but for everyday shaving it works fine.</li>
            <li> Very good razor for the price.   I bought one for my uncle as a gift.</li>
            <li> Hubby really likes it and he likes the fact that he can rinse it under water and clean it that way.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Norelco 7240XL Triplehead rechargable razor and had it in three days. It is great, I love it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for 15 years and this one works as well as more expensive ones. The plastic exterior makes it look cheap and it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful, but it shaves perfectly fine. The fact that you can use it corded is great because if the battery dies during use, you can plug it in and finish shaving before recharging it, which enhances the battery life.</li>
            <li> If you want the best shave, buy a quality manual razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver came with an instruction booklet--which I needed after 60+ years of soap and blade shaving--and the booklet suggested trying the razor for a week or two before deciding whether or not to keep the \\&quot;shaving system\\&quot;. After ten days of using it, I decided to keep it, and now, after a month, I&#x27;m glad I did. The quality of shave is getting better and better, and apparently both my beard and I needed some training. It is easy to clean, and I&#x27;m getting three or more shaves out of each recharge of the batteries. The booklet suggests a removal and cleaning of the whirling cutters every month, and while the print in the booklet is big enough, the drawing showing the removal and replacement of the cutters is too small for me to interpret--a call to Norelco assured me they&#x27;d send a larger illustration--not yet received. Other than that--I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this razor to replace my 20 year old Norelco Triple Header, but after charging it up and using it, all my reservations were gone.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor shaves nice and close and is extremely quiet versus my old razor (it sounds so quiet, I think once in a while the charge is going down, but it&#x27;s not!). The ability to rinse it out with water to clean it is a nice feature not to mention I think it is light weight and easy to hold. If you can get past the unusual looks, you&#x27;ll like the feel and quality of this razor and it stays charged for a long time.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ultimate test? I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> This shaver is everything it was advertised to be.  It is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, gives a very nice shave. Does not irritate the skin. Cannot go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The closest shave, easy to clean. Only problem, replacement heads unavailable as of this writing</li>
            <li> This is my 5th or 6th Norelco razor and while I like the way it shaves, I only gave it 3 Stars because it runs slower than all my others and takes a very long time to charge. Without another one like it, I almost believe mine has a charging problem which makes it run slower. It does give a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Norelco razors over the years and this razor, the 7240xl, has given me the closest, most comfortable shave ever. I was also happy about the quick delivery - within 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the number of positive reviews. Turns out that this product is good, but not as good as everyone says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about a year now and it works great.  I shave everyday and my 5 o&#x27;clock doesn&#x27;t show up till the it&#x27;s due time.  The cleaning is easy since you just push a button, which opens the spring loaded head up (or down) so you can rinse away the pepper shakes.  Haven&#x27;t had to change the blades yet.  Don&#x27;t plan on chaning them for a while.  The batteries last quite a bit.  I would say two to three thorough shaves per charge.</li>
