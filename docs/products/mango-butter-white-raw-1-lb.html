            <li>It smells so good and holds the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used a good bit in a batch of lotions with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>You should feel it in a good winter body cream.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, melted well, and whipped up perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love to mix the two together to make a firmer cream which makes a great pomade or thicker cream for winter.</li>

            <li>I love mango butter!  </li>
            <li>So easy to work with and melts great for making homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and great service!</li>
            <li>It is very nice, no unpleasant odor, and a good consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>We used this for making our own lotion bars.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t think making my own lotion is going to be my thing.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of homemade body products, this is a nice alternative to cocoa or Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I use it to make my own beauty products (lotions, lip balms, deodorant, etc...).</li>
            <li>I really liked the product and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I make my own soap scrubs and body butters</li>
            <li>Is nice color in the package.</li>
            <li>I use this mango butter to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li>The product was nicely wrapped and in a block form.  </li>
            <li>This mango butter is a nice quality, and works well in my lotion formula.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>I used this for making my own lotions and creams and I have to say,</li>
            <li>I make all of my own products and I have been using Shea Butter, exclusively.  </li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>
            <li>This mango butter does not have a strong smell, but it is very smooth and works great in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product combined with other butters and my skin feels great</li>
            <li>This is great, thanks!!</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own whipped body butters, lip butters and hair products with mostly shea butter.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, nice white color, no impurities visible.</li>
            <li>Product was clean, pure and wonderful to use.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very securely capped tub.</li>
            <li>It feels very light, so it doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of build up.</li>
            <li>Also, for those who may be sensitive to strong smells, this may be perfect for you because it is virtually odorless.</li>
            <li>and I like the mango butter much better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I truly enjoyed it in every use I found for it.</li>
            <li>This mango butter is a bit grainy and I do wonder why the color is more tan.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again when I need more.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Worked very well and enhanced all of my lotion recipes greatly.</li>
            <li>I just love this mango butter</li>
            <li>This works even better than shea butter</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need anything more than a dime-sized piece for your face and maybe a silver dollar for each arm and leg.</li>
            <li>My skin has a healthy sheen/not shine</li>
            <li>and I find that my makeup sits better on my face when I&#x27;ve moisturized with mango butter.</li>
            <li>Before I used to use shea butter for my home made lotion bars and lip balms, but I like mango butter much better.</li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>This mango butter is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I mix mine with some oils and whip it for better texture</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so, I&#x27;ve not had experience with mango butter before.</li>
            <li>I had to re-do the batch and add in a lot more olive oil to counter the mango butter</li>
            <li>This product seems to work OK with the Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I will have to use it more</li>
            <li>The top of the container was cracked but I blame that on postal mishandling.</li>
            <li>Great shipped fast worked well in my body butters</li>
            <li>Mango butter is a lovely contrast to the cocoa and shea butter I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>and it was awesome, then I reordered in April 2014 and it was not the same product at all.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred a better container to hold products, as it did break while trying to remove butter, but that does not change the quality of the product at all.</li>
            <li>He even asked me to purchase more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be purchasing this for many many years to come.</li>
            <li>definitely by more.</li>
            <li>Better texture quality than the mango butter I got from another seller on here.</li>
            <li>Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
            <li>You will love it</li>
            <li>i really love this mango butter very nice, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The butter spread very nicely over my skin and had a very creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, fast shipping, great transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li>This butter is very smooth and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent that is not overpowering and can easily blend with any scent, if you choose to go that route.</li>
            <li>Smooth easy transaction as well!</li>
            <li>very moisturizing, smooth texture and great smell.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth going on and light as well.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again without question, your black African soap is also out of this world, and the best I have ever used thank you for your excellent business.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It came in a plastic container and overall, it was very good.</li>
            <li>The first one came in a plastic jar with a lid, it was soft and creamy and awesome to apply on the skin.</li>
            <li>Other than that great product!!!</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and in an airtight container.  </li>
            <li>It virtually had no scent, absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.</li>
            <li>It melted nicely, and the bright white color kept my soap from discoloring.</li>
            <li>Very mild smell, but nothing you notice when you use it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t detect any smell (can&#x27;t stand the smell of shea or cocoa butter), and it melted down wonderfully.</li>
            <li>smooth, unscented.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, nice addition to lotions.</li>
            <li>It really makes a nice cuticle treatment for nighttime.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great butter especially if you don&#x27;t like the smell and oiliness of the shea.</li>
            <li>The mango butter feels so smooth and moisturizing on my skin.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re thinking about making your own, it&#x27;s absolutely something you want to consider.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the body and has such a tropical smell.  </li>
            <li>but I think what I got before was a better quality product and as such this doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good a value.</li>
            <li>nice white color and packaged nicely....</li>
            <li>The mango butter melts easily upon contact with the skin and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I recently made whipped body butter using this butter, and it is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Great butter long as you know how to use it</li>
            <li>makes it rich and creamy</li>
            <li>My delivery came right on time as Promised!</li>
            <li>I like this product&#x27;s fresh light scent</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and makes your skin feel so nice</li>
            <li>It smells so incredibly fresh and light.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>They are both noncomedogenic, full of antioxidants and super hydrating.</li>
            <li>Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Used this as an ingredient for my home made body butter for my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>It has a mild to non-existent woody scent.</li>
            <li>I am finding it makes a very good face creme, nail creme and hair conditioner for very little money.</li>
            <li>my skin just loves it really is a true butter for the skin melts right in</li>
            <li>This arrived to me super fast, and is exactly what I ordered!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color with very little smell.</li>
            <li>I just hope the seller considers selling this amazing product in bigger quanities</li>
            <li>THE TINY BITS MELT AFTER APPLYING TO WARM SKIN</li>
            <li>The shine lasts and makes the toes look freshly manicured.  </li>
            <li>Contents were sealed, fresh and undisturbed.</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for a face moisturizer recipe with doTerra oils and so far I am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to create separate batches of body butter for his sensitive skin and this has been one of my favorite ingredients to add.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and white and doesn&#x27;t have any Oder.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth this goes on, how it melts when it hits the skin, and that there is no major scent to it.</li>
            <li>It was easy to cut and weigh, making it easy to obtain the necessary measurements needed for my recipe.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right</li>
            <li>Fantastic high quality butter.</li>
            <li>When skiing recently, I still reached for my shea butter to calm the sun and wind damage, but for any lesser uses, the mango butter works great.</li>
            <li>Super soft, mild but not unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Like the product, easy to work with and soft.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It makes a great addition to hard lotion bars.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more once I run out.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use mango butter</li>
            <li>It was my first time ordering mango butter</li>
            <li>I wanted to show you exactly what I got</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with Mango butter</li>
            <li>so I love it as my facial moisturizer rather than Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I have to melt the lotion in hot water each time I put it on.</li>
            <li>The safety seal under the screw top was open.</li>
            <li>First off, let me tell you, this Mango Butter is packaged so that it will survive shipping to anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li>I only used 1/3 of it and put the remainder in the freezer for safe keeping.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using mango butter and compared to Shea butter</li>
            <li>I like it better mixed with oils.</li>
            <li>First off, I appreciate the container the mango butter came in.</li>
            <li>The product that was left is quite clean and lovely and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>A nice little bucket to keep the butter fresh.</li>
            <li>This can be a hard to find item at a reasonable price, and I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li>At first it seemed really sketchy</li>
            <li>It came in a big plastic jar which makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin super soft and leave no residue.</li>
            <li>I make my own lotion and typically use shea, coco, and either olive oil or coconut oil.</li>
            <li>and it was easy enough.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really have much of any smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a scent.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is a lot softer and is much easier to mix and melt.</li>
            <li>I really like using in my handmade body lotions.</li>
            <li>Each batch of lotion I&#x27;ve ever made is always very creamy and melts in my palm.</li>
            <li>This time it came as chunks in a plastic bag and didn&#x27;t really have a smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Also shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>see how well it really works.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell</li>
            <li>very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This is much softer and smoother, not like candle wax trying to break it up.</li>
            <li>Not a competitive price but can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>Very nice...love this product</li>
            <li>Like I mentioned, I mix it with other items and it works better in place of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>My jar of mango butter looked clean and white.</li>
            <li>The product is an essential oil for those special soaps.  </li>
            <li>I added essential oil to it, so I don&#x27;t know if that is what made it cool this way or not.</li>
            <li>It has improved my really dry skin tremendously!</li>
            <li>but I only received 14 ounces,,,not a full lb.</li>
            <li>It came in a bag as several big chunks, but it&#x27;s been pretty easy to scrape or chip off the amounts that I need for making products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning the item and will re-order, hoping to get a new product this time!</li>
            <li>My skin, hair and nails really seem to like this new treatment.</li>
            <li>This Mango Butter is perfect for being able to manipulate scent of a product you use this as a base in!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I wish I had received it in a better and more air tight container instead of a cheap plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>I like it more than the store bought cremes and lotions because mine is not filled with chemical or fillers.</li>
            <li>Nice thick airtight container.</li>
            <li>first time using mango, but it smells very little (especially compared to Shea) and is very easy to hand grate.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using mango butter for hair and add it to my lotion to give it the extra moisture that your skin will be looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone interested in massage oils and such.</li>
            <li>Melts right into dry skin without being at all greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft once it absorbs.  </li>
            <li>I am completely sold.</li>
            <li>I makes my skin feel soooo soft.</li>
            <li>It melts beautifully, doesn&#x27;t give a weird smell (unlike cocoa butter) and leaves my sensitive dry skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>This was my second experience with mango butter, my first batch came in a thick air tight container and was very creamy and amazing.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered this same exact product last September 2013</li>
            <li>I use it mainly in my hair mixed with coconut oil, shae butter, etc...</li>
            <li>so I could make him another batch because he is down to the wire on the first jar I made for him!</li>
            <li>I had butter left from a previous purchase but am excited to use this butter to make my skin oil</li>
            <li>This is truly what I had not expected.</li>
            <li>This one came in a plastic bag, was all crumbly and I have to reheat the crumbles by rolling them in my hands in order to make them soft enough to apply on the skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still pretty hard, but I am at least able to scrape it out of the jar now.</li>
            <li>exactly as expected, perfect base for things I make</li>
            <li>I did use a little when I first got it</li>
            <li>The reason for only four stars is because the mango butter isn&#x27;t quite as soft as the description said so i cut a chunk off and placed it in a small stainless steel bowl atop of a candle warmer.</li>
            <li>It comes in a small little bucket with an airtight top that can be pried off with a coin or in my case a flat head screwdriver...</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to get out of the container, but my container was solid almost to the top, so I have no doubt</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about different butter to put in recipes, I do know this one melted well, but when it cools off it becomes a little chunky.</li>

            <li> It smells so good and holds the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used a good bit in a batch of lotions with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> You should feel it in a good winter body cream.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, melted well, and whipped up perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love to mix the two together to make a firmer cream which makes a great pomade or thicker cream for winter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for lotions or hair love it</li>
            <li> love it arrived on time great product</li>

            <li> So easy to work with and melts great for making homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and great service!</li>
            <li> It is very nice, no unpleasant odor, and a good consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> We used this for making our own lotion bars.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t think making my own lotion is going to be my thing.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of homemade body products, this is a nice alternative to cocoa or Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I use it to make my own beauty products (lotions, lip balms, deodorant, etc...).</li>
            <li> I really liked the product and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I make my own soap scrubs and body butters</li>
            <li> Is nice color in the package.</li>
            <li> I use this mango butter to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li> The product was nicely wrapped and in a block form.  </li>
            <li> This mango butter is a nice quality, and works well in my lotion formula.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I used this for making my own lotions and creams and I have to say,</li>
            <li> I make all of my own products and I have been using Shea Butter, exclusively.  </li>
            <li> Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> This mango butter does not have a strong smell, but it is very smooth and works great in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product combined with other butters and my skin feels great</li>
            <li> This is great, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own whipped body butters, lip butters and hair products with mostly shea butter.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, nice white color, no impurities visible.</li>
            <li> Product was clean, pure and wonderful to use.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very securely capped tub.</li>
            <li> It feels very light, so it doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of build up.</li>
            <li> Also, for those who may be sensitive to strong smells, this may be perfect for you because it is virtually odorless.</li>
            <li> and I like the mango butter much better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I truly enjoyed it in every use I found for it.</li>
            <li> This mango butter is a bit grainy and I do wonder why the color is more tan.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Worked very well and enhanced all of my lotion recipes greatly.</li>
            <li> I just love this mango butter</li>
            <li> This works even better than shea butter</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need anything more than a dime-sized piece for your face and maybe a silver dollar for each arm and leg.</li>
            <li> My skin has a healthy sheen/not shine</li>
            <li> and I find that my makeup sits better on my face when I&#x27;ve moisturized with mango butter.</li>
            <li> Before I used to use shea butter for my home made lotion bars and lip balms, but I like mango butter much better.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> This mango butter is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I mix mine with some oils and whip it for better texture</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so, I&#x27;ve not had experience with mango butter before.</li>
            <li> I had to re-do the batch and add in a lot more olive oil to counter the mango butter</li>
            <li> This product seems to work OK with the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I will have to use it more</li>
            <li> The top of the container was cracked but I blame that on postal mishandling.</li>
            <li> Great shipped fast worked well in my body butters</li>
            <li> Mango butter is a lovely contrast to the cocoa and shea butter I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> and it was awesome, then I reordered in April 2014 and it was not the same product at all.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a better container to hold products, as it did break while trying to remove butter, but that does not change the quality of the product at all.</li>
            <li> He even asked me to purchase more</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be purchasing this for many many years to come.</li>
            <li> definitely by more.</li>
            <li> Better texture quality than the mango butter I got from another seller on here.</li>
            <li> Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
            <li> You will love it</li>
            <li> i really love this mango butter very nice, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The butter spread very nicely over my skin and had a very creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, fast shipping, great transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> This butter is very smooth and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent that is not overpowering and can easily blend with any scent, if you choose to go that route.</li>
            <li> Smooth easy transaction as well!</li>
            <li> very moisturizing, smooth texture and great smell.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth going on and light as well.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again without question, your black African soap is also out of this world, and the best I have ever used thank you for your excellent business.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic container and overall, it was very good.</li>
            <li> The first one came in a plastic jar with a lid, it was soft and creamy and awesome to apply on the skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that great product!!!</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and in an airtight container.  </li>
            <li> It virtually had no scent, absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> It melted nicely, and the bright white color kept my soap from discoloring.</li>
            <li> Very mild smell, but nothing you notice when you use it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t detect any smell (can&#x27;t stand the smell of shea or cocoa butter), and it melted down wonderfully.</li>
            <li> smooth, unscented.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, nice addition to lotions.</li>
            <li> It really makes a nice cuticle treatment for nighttime.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great butter especially if you don&#x27;t like the smell and oiliness of the shea.</li>
            <li> The mango butter feels so smooth and moisturizing on my skin.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re thinking about making your own, it&#x27;s absolutely something you want to consider.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the body and has such a tropical smell.  </li>
            <li> but I think what I got before was a better quality product and as such this doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good a value.</li>
            <li> nice white color and packaged nicely....</li>
            <li> The mango butter melts easily upon contact with the skin and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I recently made whipped body butter using this butter, and it is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Great butter long as you know how to use it</li>
            <li> makes it rich and creamy</li>
            <li> My delivery came right on time as Promised!</li>
            <li> I like this product&#x27;s fresh light scent</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft and makes your skin feel so nice</li>
            <li> It smells so incredibly fresh and light.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> They are both noncomedogenic, full of antioxidants and super hydrating.</li>
            <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Used this as an ingredient for my home made body butter for my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> It has a mild to non-existent woody scent.</li>
            <li> I am finding it makes a very good face creme, nail creme and hair conditioner for very little money.</li>
            <li> my skin just loves it really is a true butter for the skin melts right in</li>
            <li> This arrived to me super fast, and is exactly what I ordered!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color with very little smell.</li>
            <li> I just hope the seller considers selling this amazing product in bigger quanities</li>
            <li> THE TINY BITS MELT AFTER APPLYING TO WARM SKIN</li>
            <li> The shine lasts and makes the toes look freshly manicured.  </li>
            <li> Contents were sealed, fresh and undisturbed.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for a face moisturizer recipe with doTerra oils and so far I am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to create separate batches of body butter for his sensitive skin and this has been one of my favorite ingredients to add.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and white and doesn&#x27;t have any Oder.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this goes on, how it melts when it hits the skin, and that there is no major scent to it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to cut and weigh, making it easy to obtain the necessary measurements needed for my recipe.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right</li>
            <li> Fantastic high quality butter.</li>
            <li> When skiing recently, I still reached for my shea butter to calm the sun and wind damage, but for any lesser uses, the mango butter works great.</li>
            <li> Super soft, mild but not unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Like the product, easy to work with and soft.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It makes a great addition to hard lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use mango butter</li>
            <li> It was my first time ordering mango butter</li>
            <li> I wanted to show you exactly what I got</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Mango butter</li>
            <li> so I love it as my facial moisturizer rather than Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have to melt the lotion in hot water each time I put it on.</li>
            <li> The safety seal under the screw top was open.</li>
            <li> First off, let me tell you, this Mango Butter is packaged so that it will survive shipping to anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li> I only used 1/3 of it and put the remainder in the freezer for safe keeping.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using mango butter and compared to Shea butter</li>
            <li> I like it better mixed with oils.</li>
            <li> First off, I appreciate the container the mango butter came in.</li>
            <li> The product that was left is quite clean and lovely and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> A nice little bucket to keep the butter fresh.</li>
            <li> This can be a hard to find item at a reasonable price, and I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li> At first it seemed really sketchy</li>
            <li> It came in a big plastic jar which makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin super soft and leave no residue.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion and typically use shea, coco, and either olive oil or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and it was easy enough.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really have much of any smell.  </li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a scent.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a lot softer and is much easier to mix and melt.</li>
            <li> I really like using in my handmade body lotions.</li>
            <li> Each batch of lotion I&#x27;ve ever made is always very creamy and melts in my palm.</li>
            <li> This time it came as chunks in a plastic bag and didn&#x27;t really have a smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Also shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> see how well it really works.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell</li>
            <li> very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This is much softer and smoother, not like candle wax trying to break it up.</li>
            <li> Not a competitive price but can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Very nice...love this product</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned, I mix it with other items and it works better in place of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> My jar of mango butter looked clean and white.</li>
            <li> The product is an essential oil for those special soaps.  </li>
            <li> I added essential oil to it, so I don&#x27;t know if that is what made it cool this way or not.</li>
            <li> It has improved my really dry skin tremendously!</li>
            <li> but I only received 14 ounces,,,not a full lb.</li>
            <li> It came in a bag as several big chunks, but it&#x27;s been pretty easy to scrape or chip off the amounts that I need for making products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning the item and will re-order, hoping to get a new product this time!</li>
            <li> My skin, hair and nails really seem to like this new treatment.</li>
            <li> This Mango Butter is perfect for being able to manipulate scent of a product you use this as a base in!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish I had received it in a better and more air tight container instead of a cheap plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> I like it more than the store bought cremes and lotions because mine is not filled with chemical or fillers.</li>
            <li> Nice thick airtight container.</li>
            <li> first time using mango, but it smells very little (especially compared to Shea) and is very easy to hand grate.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using mango butter for hair and add it to my lotion to give it the extra moisture that your skin will be looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone interested in massage oils and such.</li>
            <li> Melts right into dry skin without being at all greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft once it absorbs.  </li>
            <li> I am completely sold.</li>
            <li> I makes my skin feel soooo soft.</li>
            <li> It melts beautifully, doesn&#x27;t give a weird smell (unlike cocoa butter) and leaves my sensitive dry skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> This was my second experience with mango butter, my first batch came in a thick air tight container and was very creamy and amazing.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered this same exact product last September 2013</li>
            <li> I use it mainly in my hair mixed with coconut oil, shae butter, etc...</li>
            <li> so I could make him another batch because he is down to the wire on the first jar I made for him!</li>
            <li> I had butter left from a previous purchase but am excited to use this butter to make my skin oil</li>
            <li> This is truly what I had not expected.</li>
            <li> This one came in a plastic bag, was all crumbly and I have to reheat the crumbles by rolling them in my hands in order to make them soft enough to apply on the skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still pretty hard, but I am at least able to scrape it out of the jar now.</li>
            <li> exactly as expected, perfect base for things I make</li>
            <li> I did use a little when I first got it</li>
            <li> The reason for only four stars is because the mango butter isn&#x27;t quite as soft as the description said so i cut a chunk off and placed it in a small stainless steel bowl atop of a candle warmer.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small little bucket with an airtight top that can be pried off with a coin or in my case a flat head screwdriver...</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get out of the container, but my container was solid almost to the top, so I have no doubt</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about different butter to put in recipes, I do know this one melted well, but when it cools off it becomes a little chunky.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft after using this butter alone or with other butters.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my bath teas and other a natural and organic products.</li>
            <li> The manage butter itself in its raw state was very powdery.</li>
            <li> So much silkier than raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon had created a different SKU because this is absolutely not the same product sold under the same description.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li> I would definitely whip it up for the summer to help it go on lightly, as it does go on a bit thick if you keep it raw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely familiar with mango butter, but it worked well and was a little grainy when you first apply it, but melted into my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased mango butter to make whipped butter mixtures for my hair but what I discovered is that my skin absolutely loves raw mango butter!</li>
            <li> I ordered via this ad in august and received a ziplock bag with an inner plastic bag containing a hard block of white mango butter that was nearly odorless.</li>
            <li> The next morning when I attempted to use it, it was so hard that I had to re-melt it just to make it soft enough to use.</li>
            <li> However, had I known that this was packaged this way, I would not have ordered, since I don&#x27;t use this product frequently and need to store it for a few months.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that the rim of the tub was busted and even though the tub arrived inside a plastic bag, it still leaked onto other products in shipment.</li>
            <li> It would be hard to use in its natural state and doesn&#x27;t work well when mixed with oils.</li>
            <li> Just rub together between palms and apply to ends of dry hair.</li>
            <li> the lady has dry skin (well did have) .</li>
            <li> I love to use shea butter in the winter, but it can be too stiff and hard on delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got the latter, and the product does seem crumbly, but since this is my first experience with mango butter, I can&#x27;t say that isn&#x27;t the way it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> I mix the Mango butter with shea butter, jojobo oil, a little coconut oil, and essential oils</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT TO MIX WITH OTHER &amp;#34;BUTTERS&amp;#34; TO MAKE SOOTHING AFTER BATH YUMMY RUBS TO COVER DRY AREAS OF THE BODY TO ATTEMPT TO PREVENT MOISTURE LOSS.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My product arrived cracked and broken up (probably a product of shipping and temperature changes) but this works well for me since its easier to get how much I need.</li>
            <li> I received this mango butter and it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have not really had a chance to try it yet.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only real complaint, other than that I&#x27;ve used this in a few lotion recipes and it is certainly quality mango butter.</li>
            <li> Lucious, mango butter a little goes a long way thank you!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t interfere with other smells like shea butter or coconut butter sometimes can.</li>
            <li> and it mixes in well with the other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try something other than Shea butter</li>
            <li> Making homemade creams, lotions and other products with it.</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t have to worry about it taking away from my other doTerra oils that were added.  </li>
            <li> Mango butter is harder and takes a lot of time and patience to break it down into a whipped butter</li>
            <li> It blends so well with my other oils and is so moisturizing!</li>
            <li> and it helps make hair shiny and less flyaway.</li>
            <li> The previous butter I ordered was lighter and easier to use.</li>
            <li> it is on the hard dry side</li>
            <li> It is quite thick so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Little to no smell.  </li>
            <li> But it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell at all; maybe a very faint hint of fruit, which works out if you&#x27;re going to add other scents.</li>
            <li> I ordered again just a few days ago and received a creamier ivory - colored product in a tub.</li>
            <li> It was all dried up</li>
            <li> Raw 1 Lb (16 Oz)]]</li>
            <li> I use a aloe gel, ACV, honey and lemon homemade shampoo and (for past 2 years).</li>
            <li> not sure if that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be</li>
            <li> Adding this to it made the lotion rock solid where I was unable to scrape out of the jar (when I make I put in glass jars).</li>
            <li> That is reason for the missing star!  </li>
            <li> Received the product and unfortunately it had a rancid smell, not sure if it has been stored for a long time</li>
            <li> There is hardly a scent at all.  </li>
            <li> It was really hard to find quality mango butter</li>
            <li> The lotion ended up being grainy and hard.</li>
            <li> It is really hard</li>
            <li> Mango butter very white and creamy in my cold cream .</li>
            <li> This butter is hard at room temp, but I soften it to use for base mix with my other lotions to get the consistency required for the product that I am making.  </li>
            <li> but the product was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Use this is my homemade body butters and cold process soaps.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that I ordered the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed however it was my fault for not reading.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good for hair, skin, making deodorant, etc. Using this and shea butter is very nice. I use a aloe gel, ACV, honey and lemon homemade shampoo and (for past 2 years). I mix the Mango butter with shea butter, jojobo oil, a little coconut oil, and essential oils and it helps make hair shiny and less flyaway. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  It arrived very quickly and in an airtight container.  I&#x27;ll be making lots of butters and lotions with it!</li>
            <li> it is on the hard dry side BUT I used it in place of cocoa butter for my body butter and I like the mango butter much better. It melts beautifully, doesn&#x27;t give a weird smell (unlike cocoa butter) and leaves my sensitive dry skin silky soft. Like I mentioned, I mix it with other items and it works better in place of cocoa butter. Looks just like the description picture.</li>
            <li> I used this as one of my ingredients in a homemade whipped body butter. It&#x27;s easily my most popular creation, so I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Lucious, mango butter a little goes a long way thank you!</li>
            <li> I use mango butter to make whipped lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with other smells like shea butter or coconut butter sometimes can.</li>
            <li> So easy to work with and melts great for making homemade beauty products. Doesn&#x27;t smell funky like Shea Butter does and also not as oily.</li>
            <li> This is great. I will definitely purchase more once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use mango butter and I love it.  I always wonder how this stuff would be on my skin and it work wonderful!!  I would order from them again!!</li>
            <li> I ordered via this ad in august and received a ziplock bag with an inner plastic bag containing a hard block of white mango butter that was nearly odorless. It was my first time ordering mango butter and I truly enjoyed it in every use I found for it. The label identified it as &amp;#34;the wandering prophet&amp;#34; brand. I ordered again just a few days ago and received a creamier ivory - colored product in a tub. This mango butter is a bit grainy and I do wonder why the color is more tan. I like this product&#x27;s fresh light scent but I think what I got before was a better quality product and as such this doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good a value.</li>
            <li> Great butter. Works well in lotions and body butters.</li>
            <li> worked great for body butter</li>
            <li> Like the product, easy to work with and soft. I will be purchasing again when I need more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product in my homemade body butter!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Incredible product!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This Mango Butter worked perfect in my homemade body butters! This butter is very smooth and easy to work with. It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable fragrance so it will not compete with your essential oils. Very moisturizing. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> We used this for making our own lotion bars.  I love the mango butter!  I didn&#x27;t detect any smell (can&#x27;t stand the smell of shea or cocoa butter), and it melted down wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. I mixed it with a shea butter mixture I create for body lotion and hair product. I do believe it helped reduce some of the order of the shea butter that I don&#x27;t like. However, I did use grapefruit and lavender scents with it. I have not used all of what I purchased yet so I plan to continue to explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mixture seems to be an improved with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for body butters or as a stand-alone moisturizer!  It makes your skin so soft once it absorbs.  There is hardly a scent at all.  It is quite thick so a little goes a long way.  I LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is truly what I had not expected. It was all dried up and I thought I was getting  a pound. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This mango butter is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s creamy, not too greasy and makes wonderful body butter.  Skin feels so soft after using this butter alone or with other butters.  Will definitely be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great butter at a fair price. Worked very well and enhanced all of my lotion recipes greatly. Glad I tried it out!</li>
            <li> I just love this mango butter it&#x27;s so soft and makes your skin feel so nice</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2741ab704b4b72dc7593e3aac5a5b398]] I find a lot of people talking about the packaging that different butters are mailed in (some people rate based on that alone). I wanted to show you exactly what I got so you know what to expect.</li>
            <li> Mango butter is awesome!</li>
            <li> Fantastic high quality butter. I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This mango butter does not have a strong smell, but it is very smooth and works great in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> no scent but really great product for my lotions and body butter</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Mango butter and I&#x27;m really happy i tried it.  This works even better than shea butter and i got compliments after using this for just 1 week.</li>
            <li> exactly as expected, perfect base for things I make</li>
            <li> still in the fridge from 2014 ,can someone tell me if I can still use it?</li>
            <li> Although the container was all cracked up when it arrived.  The product that was left is quite clean and lovely and leaves my skin feeling very soft. I will definitely order again...  But if my tub is all cracked I will be sending it back!</li>
            <li> This has a nice feel to it but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell good at all. I use it in making body butter and lotions and it works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased mango butter to make whipped butter mixtures for my hair but what I discovered is that my skin absolutely loves raw mango butter! I use it on my face and body and my skin is supple-not greasy all day. You don&#x27;t need anything more than a dime-sized piece for your face and maybe a silver dollar for each arm and leg. My skin has a healthy sheen/not shine and I find that my makeup sits better on my face when I&#x27;ve moisturized with mango butter. Keep in mind that I have combination-dry skin and I would NOT recommend this for people with oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell at all; maybe a very faint hint of fruit, which works out if you&#x27;re going to add other scents. I have also noticed that my skin tone has evened out since using this product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I used this in a recipe I got online in a blog from pintrest. I don&#x27;t know much about different butter to put in recipes, I do know this one melted well, but when it cools off it becomes a little chunky. I added essential oil to it, so I don&#x27;t know if that is what made it cool this way or not. It is a little hard to get out of the container, but my container was solid almost to the top, so I have no doubt I got a pound of it. I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t think making my own lotion is going to be my thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I use the mango butter to make a whipped butter. It melted well and mixed well with the oils I added.  I allowed it to sit over night. The next morning when I attempted to use it, it was so hard that I had to re-melt it just to make it soft enough to use. Total waste of money. I will not be reordering this one. The previous butter I ordered was lighter and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of homemade body products, this is a nice alternative to cocoa or Shea butter.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it :)</li>
            <li> Just got it yesterday n made some homemade body butter with almond oil n frankensence and ylang ylang mmmmm n my skin just loves it really is a true butter for the skin melts right in</li>
            <li> Good quality product!  This is a great product, in terms of quality and quantity.  I add it to just about all of the hair and body butters that I make.</li>
            <li> This butter is hard at room temp, but I soften it to use for base mix with my other lotions to get the consistency required for the product that I am making.  It is nutritious for your skin.</li>
            <li> smooth, unscented.  my go to for all body/face care recipes.</li>
            <li> Mango butter very white and creamy in my cold cream . Will be making body butter with it next. Jar came well packaged and within estimated  shipping time . Will order again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product combined with other butters and my skin feels great</li>
            <li> Good quality mango butter.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner. I use it to make my own beauty products (lotions, lip balms, deodorant, etc...). It comes in a very securely capped tub. My product arrived cracked and broken up (probably a product of shipping and temperature changes) but this works well for me since its easier to get how much I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a facial moisturizer blended with Argan oil, coconut oil and lemongrass essential oil! WOW! It&#x27;s amazing. There is no smell from the mango so I love it as my facial moisturizer rather than Shea butter. It&#x27;s great all on its own as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I really recommend it. It smells so incredibly fresh and light. It makes a great addition to hard lotion bars. It feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> I had butter left from a previous purchase but am excited to use this butter to make my skin oil</li>
            <li> This mango butter is so great in my lotions and potions. I especially love it in lip balms.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely familiar with mango butter, but it worked well and was a little grainy when you first apply it, but melted into my skin. It came in a plastic container and overall, it was very good.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for shea butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my butters and pastilles in plastic bags, and this was sent in a plastic tray style carton similar to what you may get a sushi bento disk in.  That&#x27;s my only real complaint, other than that I&#x27;ve used this in a few lotion recipes and it is certainly quality mango butter.</li>
            <li> I used this mango butter in a homemade deodorant and it&#x27;s wonderful! No overpowering odor and it mixes in well with the other ingredients.  I would purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 because I thought it would smell like mangos but it doesn&#x27;t really have much of any smell.  I love it over the option of Shea which doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant and is a dryer butter.  The mango butter melts easily upon contact with the skin and soaks in quickly.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in my next batch of lotion bars.</li>
            <li> Works very well, nice addition to lotions.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, pleased with purchase will use them again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This butter was very gritty.....not sure if that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be but I did not like it for what I use it for.</li>
            <li> This is the best mango butter. Beautiful color with very little smell. It blends perfectly when used to create my body butters and hair products.</li>
            <li> I received this mango butter and it was not what I expected. I wanted to try something other than Shea butter and I thought this would be it. I tried making a cream like I do with my Shea butter and it was horrible. The manage butter itself in its raw state was very powdery. It would be hard to use in its natural state and doesn&#x27;t work well when mixed with oils. Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right but I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I really like Shea butter is very good for the skin.I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. thank you thank you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Before I used to use shea butter for my home made lotion bars and lip balms, but I like mango butter much better. It virtually had no scent, absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy. It came in a big plastic jar which makes it easy to store. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!! It blends so well with my other oils and is so moisturizing!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using mango butter for hair and add it to my lotion to give it the extra moisture that your skin will be looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I loved this mango butter. The smell was good and the quality was great. I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> It seems that this item is being fulfilled by different products, some of which are in a plastic resealable tub and others that are in a ziploc bag.  Unfortunately, I got the latter, and the product does seem crumbly, but since this is my first experience with mango butter, I can&#x27;t say that isn&#x27;t the way it is supposed to be.  However, had I known that this was packaged this way, I would not have ordered, since I don&#x27;t use this product frequently and need to store it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this goes on, how it melts when it hits the skin, and that there is no major scent to it. It feels great on my skin and I like combining it with shea butter and essential oils and just using it as is too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make some whipped body butter and lotion bars. It arrived quickly, melted well, and whipped up perfectly. It has a very light scent that is not overpowering and can easily blend with any scent, if you choose to go that route. It is very smooth going on and light as well. I think it will be perfect for the dry winter days ahead and still be perfect for airy summer days. I would definitely whip it up for the summer to help it go on lightly, as it does go on a bit thick if you keep it raw.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT TO MIX WITH OTHER &amp;#34;BUTTERS&amp;#34; TO MAKE SOOTHING AFTER BATH YUMMY RUBS TO COVER DRY AREAS OF THE BODY TO ATTEMPT TO PREVENT MOISTURE LOSS.  THE TINY BITS MELT AFTER APPLYING TO WARM SKIN BUT ARE A BIT DISCONCERTING UPON INITIAL APPLICATION.  SINCE THIS IS THE 1ST TIME I HAVE EVER TRIED MANGO BUTTER MAYBE THEY ALL HAVE TINY GRANULAR BITS.  IT DOES A SKIN WELL AFTER THEY MELT.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It really makes a nice cuticle treatment for nighttime.  Great on my toes before going out for the day in sandals.  The shine lasts and makes the toes look freshly manicured.  This is a lifetime supply! I also use a smidgeon in my hair.  Helps control frizzies. Just rub together between palms and apply to ends of dry hair.</li>
            <li> Like it to make body butter. I didn&#x27;t really notice a scent.</li>
            <li> Great butter long as you know how to use it</li>
            <li> I have not really had a chance to try it yet. I did use a little when I first got it and it left my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own whipped body butters, lip butters and hair products with mostly shea butter. I ordered this to determine the difference between mango and shea. Shea butter is a lot softer and is much easier to mix and melt. It has a nutty smell to it which fades once essential oils are added. It is also easier to spread on the body in its unwhipped form. Mango butter is harder and takes a lot of time and patience to break it down into a whipped butter and it&#x27;s odorless. I love to mix the two together to make a firmer cream which makes a great pomade or thicker cream for winter. It&#x27;s a great butter especially if you don&#x27;t like the smell and oiliness of the shea.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and quality.  I make my own soap scrubs and body butters and I LOVE mango butter!!!  I do not like the smell of cocoa butter so this is an amazing product for me!!</li>
            <li> From lips to toes I use this butter for everything! Very Happy with purchase. Will definitely do business with this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Super soft, mild but not unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Making homemade creams, lotions and other products with it. Smooth easy transaction as well!</li>
            <li> This mango butter is fabulous!  It came in a bag as several big chunks, but it&#x27;s been pretty easy to scrape or chip off the amounts that I need for making products.  The mango butter feels so smooth and moisturizing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Is nice color in the package. Have not yet used this item but expect to soon. Planning on making body butter</li>
            <li> It was really hard to find quality mango butter but I found it and I would buy again. I mix mine with some oils and whip it for better texture and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Nice thick airtight container. Mango butter us very nice I really like using in my handmade body lotions. Very nice quality I will buy from again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product not knowing what to expect. I am completely sold. I use this for my bath teas and other a natural and organic products. It smells so good and holds the fragrance.  It makes the skin super soft and leave no residue.</li>
            <li> I use this mango butter to make my own lotion. It is great. It works great for eczema as well.</li>
            <li> I order it this along with Shea Butter and Coco Butter and I love it. I have made a body butter smoothie for my skin and it turned out awesome.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and great service!</li>
            <li> Okay, so, I&#x27;ve not had experience with mango butter before. I make my own lotion and typically use shea, coco, and either olive oil or coconut oil. I decided to add this into the mix and it made everything rock solid. Each batch of lotion I&#x27;ve ever made is always very creamy and melts in my palm. Adding this to it made the lotion rock solid where I was unable to scrape out of the jar (when I make I put in glass jars). I had to re-do the batch and add in a lot more olive oil to counter the mango butter and it&#x27;s still pretty hard, but I am at least able to scrape it out of the jar now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! So much silkier than raw cocoa butter. It has improved my really dry skin tremendously! The only issue I had was that the rim of the tub was busted and even though the tub arrived inside a plastic bag, it still leaked onto other products in shipment. No harm done but COULD have happened. That is reason for the missing star!  Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> The lotion ended up being grainy and hard. I have to melt the lotion in hot water each time I put it on. I did as the directions said but the product was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I recently made whipped body butter using this butter, and it is absolutely AMAZING! The product was nicely wrapped and in a block form.  It was easy to cut and weigh, making it easy to obtain the necessary measurements needed for my recipe.  I will definitely be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I used this butter to make soap. It melted nicely, and the bright white color kept my soap from discoloring.</li>
            <li> Everything was great n on time.</li>
            <li> this mango butter it&#x27;s great for lotions or hair love it</li>
            <li> This was my second experience with mango butter, my first batch came in a thick air tight container and was very creamy and amazing.  This time it came as chunks in a plastic bag and didn&#x27;t really have a smell to it.  I used it to make a hair mask and it came out wonderful! I would order this product again.  Also shipping was fast.  My only complaint is I wish I had received it in a better and more air tight container instead of a cheap plastic bag.  At first it seemed really sketchy and I almost sent it back just because of that. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work OK with the Shea butter.I will have to use it more go see how well it really works.</li>
            <li> Would give this 10 stars if possible.  first time using mango, but it smells very little (especially compared to Shea) and is very easy to hand grate. I ended up grating the entire tub and putting in ziploc bag so it will be easier to measure for future recipes.  My skin feels elegant with it!</li>
            <li> very moisturizing, smooth texture and great smell.</li>
            <li> I made lotion bars with this product, combining it with shea butter, coconut oil/sweet almond oil. I love the way it feels! I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. Great product.</li>
            <li> nice white color and packaged nicely....bought for making creme</li>
            <li> I thought this butter would have a smell but it didn&#x27;t.  I was so disappointed however it was my fault for not reading.  The packaging and delivery was great.  Just disappointed that I ordered the wrong one.  Should have ordered unrefined.</li>
            <li> This is the one of the best ingredient for moisturizers. I made one with sunflower oil and mango butter seed; My skin looks and feels superb since I started using it.  They are both noncomedogenic, full of antioxidants and super hydrating. I will continue buying it</li>
            <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The safety seal under the screw top was open. Someone had opened the container before. I&#x27;ll be returning the item and will re-order, hoping to get a new product this time! I will update based on the next arrival but for now it&#x27;s one star!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, fast shipping, great transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> My delivery came right on time as Promised! Packaging was proper. The top of the container was cracked but I blame that on postal mishandling. Contents were sealed, fresh and undisturbed.</li>
            <li> I Love it!!!!!! I makes my skin feel soooo soft. I just wish I could get it in a larger quanity like a 5lb bag instead of one. Other than that great product!!! Shipping was super fast I ordered it on November 27, 2014  and it came to me on Sunday, November 30, 2014 with standard shipping. I just hope the seller considers selling this amazing product in bigger quanities</li>
            <li> Great shipped fast worked well in my body butters</li>
            <li> First off, let me tell you, this Mango Butter is packaged so that it will survive shipping to anywhere in the world. It comes in a small little bucket with an airtight top that can be pried off with a coin or in my case a flat head screwdriver... I just pressed under the lid every inch or so and it was easy enough. The quality of this butter is excellent. I&#x27;ve already used a good bit in a batch of lotions with [[ASIN:B00AEG51YK Kokum Butter Refined Raw 1 Lb (16 Oz)]] and it turned out perfectly. I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering through SpirZon LLC. This can be a hard to find item at a reasonable price, and I&#x27;m really happy I found this seller.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. The reason for only four stars is because the mango butter isn&#x27;t quite as soft as the description said so i cut a chunk off and placed it in a small stainless steel bowl atop of a candle warmer. A coffee mug warmer would work as well. I use it on my wife&#x27;s skin and it lasts forever. I would recommend this for anyone interested in massage oils and such.</li>
            <li> i really love this mango butter very nice, fast shipping. Wonderful and perfect for my homemade crafts. mahalo thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for a face moisturizer recipe with doTerra oils and so far I am enjoying it.  I only used 1/3 of it and put the remainder in the freezer for safe keeping.  Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell so didn&#x27;t have to worry about it taking away from my other doTerra oils that were added.  Arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Mango butter is a lovely contrast to the cocoa and shea butter I&#x27;ve been using.  There were several lotion and body butter recipes that use it, so if you&#x27;re thinking about making your own, it&#x27;s absolutely something you want to consider.</li>
            <li> I love mango butter!  I use it in my soaps and it makes amazingly conditioning bars!  Thank you for listing this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Used this as an ingredient for my home made body butter for my pregnant belly. Came in a plastic take out container...soft to cut thru at room temperature. Love it.</li>
            <li> This mango butter is a nice quality, and works well in my lotion formula.</li>
            <li> I purchased mango butter to make lotion bars which turned out great! My jar of mango butter looked clean and white. It has a mild to non-existent woody scent.</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair butter and body butter along with oils such as almond oil and olive oil. This stuff does wonders for my hair and body.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It was exactly as I expected. Deliver, quality, price all great. I use this in beauty products.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for making personal products - deodorant, moisturizer, lip balm, etc.  It is very nice, no unpleasant odor, and a good consistency.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging. The butter spread very nicely over my skin and had a very creamy texture. This butter is unscented.</li>
            <li> I love to use shea butter in the winter, but it can be too stiff and hard on delicate skin.  Mango butter is just enough softer to allow for easier application.  When skiing recently, I still reached for my shea butter to calm the sun and wind damage, but for any lesser uses, the mango butter works great.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using mango butter and compared to Shea butter I would definitely go for mango butter. Its great for my hair and body.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing. I like it better mixed with oils. makes it rich and creamy</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it with Shea butter and different oils to make a creme or lotion depending on the amount of oils I add. I am finding it makes a very good face creme, nail creme and hair conditioner for very little money. I like it more than the store bought cremes and lotions because mine is not filled with chemical or fillers. My skin, hair and nails really seem to like this new treatment.</li>
            <li> This was everything I hoped it would be.  I forgot to measure (weigh) it, but it seemed like a proper quantity.  It came in a tub in a bag with no leaking as some reviews mentioned.  Little to no smell.  Melts right into dry skin without being at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I used this for making my own lotions and creams and I have to say, I love this one. Product was clean, pure and wonderful to use. You should feel it in a good winter body cream. Like heaven!</li>
            <li> So I ordered this same exact product last September 2013 and it was awesome, then I reordered in April 2014 and it was not the same product at all. The first one came in a plastic jar with a lid, it was soft and creamy and awesome to apply on the skin. This one came in a plastic bag, was all crumbly and I have to reheat the crumbles by rolling them in my hands in order to make them soft enough to apply on the skin. I wish Amazon had created a different SKU because this is absolutely not the same product sold under the same description.</li>
            <li> Very good product, happy with purchase.  Would have preferred a better container to hold products, as it did break while trying to remove butter, but that does not change the quality of the product at all.</li>
            <li> Used this with shea butter and essential oils to make a body and hair cream.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and is allergic to nuts so I&#x27;ve had to create separate batches of body butter for his sensitive skin and this has been one of my favorite ingredients to add. He even asked me to purchase more so I could make him another batch because he is down to the wire on the first jar I made for him! It is really hard so you will have to mix it with something softer, like coconut oil or shea butter.</li>
            <li> First off, I appreciate the container the mango butter came in. A nice little bucket to keep the butter fresh. Smells wonderful, nice white color, no impurities visible. Use this is my homemade body butters and cold process soaps. Would definitely buy again. But it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I had never seen this before. It&#x27;s nice and white and doesn&#x27;t have any Oder. Made some face cream with it and it is wonderful. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> love it arrived on time great product</li>
            <li> This Mango Butter is perfect for being able to manipulate scent of a product you use this as a base in! This arrived to me super fast, and is exactly what I ordered!!</li>
            <li> Very mild smell, but nothing you notice when you use it on your skin.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This is great, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I make all of my own products and I have been using Shea Butter, exclusively.  I decided to branch out and try the mango butter, and it is the only thing that I will use in my body cremes, from now on.  It comes in a great resealable bucket that you can reuse after the product is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this for many many years to come.</li>
            <li> Received the product and unfortunately it had a rancid smell, not sure if it has been stored for a long time but I had to returned it.</li>
            <li> works well made some body butter for the girl  she loves it. Had a problem with the packaging. was fix pronto. but the product is great.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely by more. the lady has dry skin (well did have) .</li>
            <li> Wonderful in my lipbalms</li>
            <li> I do not like how this mango butter feels. Its grity and when I mix it with my body butters is doesn&#x27;t mix well. Will not buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. Better texture quality than the mango butter I got from another seller on here. This is much softer and smoother, not like candle wax trying to break it up. Great addition to my homemade products. Not a competitive price but can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I will be ordering again without question, your black African soap is also out of this world, and the best I have ever used thank you for your excellent business.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
            <li> Great product, but I only received 14 ounces,,,not a full lb.</li>
            <li> Very nice...love this product</li>
            <li> The product is an essential oil for those special soaps.  Feels great on the body and has such a tropical smell.  You will love it</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product. I use it mainly in my hair mixed with coconut oil, shae butter, etc... I also use it on my skin some days. It feels very light, so it doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of build up. Also, for those who may be sensitive to strong smells, this may be perfect for you because it is virtually odorless. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
