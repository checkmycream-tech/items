            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is okay for some.  I, actually was looking for a clear henna, so it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.  I think that under a professional salon application, it would be fine, but too many do&#x27;s &amp; don&#x27;t&#x27;s for me..  Unfortunately, had to return.  Just waiting for refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results of my hair after using Sebastian Cellophane. Will use product again.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for so long it&#x27;s embarrassing to say.  It gives extra shiney hair and body. Why everyone doesn&#x27;t use it I have no idea.  Clear is my choice, no color.  It used to be available only through salons, I couldn&#x27;t purchase it.  Since I now can, I also bought an old fashioned hood hair dryer as heat is necessary for this product to work.  I adore it and my hair looks great. Use as directed.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to use</li>
