    <ol>
            <li>Excellent lotion!  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena products provide excellent quality, in my experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency - not watery, greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>This lotion is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially excellent on my feet-</li>
            <li>This is the best body lotion, Not greasy and it makes you feel really good.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s also a great lip balm).</li>
            <li>this work great.</li>
            <li>It is a really good price thru subscribe and save</li>
            <li>I am puzzled as the ingredients look good.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years, and I think my skin is looking nice because of it.  </li>
            <li>It is not as good as the old Neutrogena NE, but It is the best I know of for now and people like getting it as a gift.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena hand cream is also excellent stuff - really, really good for putting on at night and waking up with super soft skin</li>
            <li>I get the unscented and the lotion is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I am pleased, I will reccommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your great service.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love it</li>
            <li>This is the best body lotion I have ever used and this is probably the 3rd tube I&#x27;m on.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This works WAY better than the steroid cream I get from my doctor.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is lighter than the intensive care and men like it better.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Rubs in easily, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell that I really like!</li>
            <li>Its a bit pricey in my opinion, but WELL worth it :)</li>
            <li>this is a great body and hand lotion  really adds moisture to my skin I live in MN</li>
            <li>Now that I am pregnant, I can&#x27;t use lotions with scent, so I use this lotion daily now and it does a great job on keeping my body hydrated.</li>
            <li>This does nothing for my skin while the original gets rid of all my redness.</li>
            <li>Goes in quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Just plain, good stuff for moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I am wandering in the wilderness looking for something that keeps my dry hands in good condition.</li>
            <li>Moisture Wrap lotion absorbs instantly, feels very silky and smooth, and does an amazing job of helping my skin without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This LOTION is a great everywhere moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is her favorite hand lotion and it really moisturizes better than any other out there.</li>
            <li>Better than similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li>I used it the first time when I was having some allergies.</li>
            <li>Very efficient !</li>
            <li>I love Norwegian Formula hand cream, but this did not moisturize well for me.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft without making it soggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so any heavy-duty lotion pretty much never absorbs and eventually feels like it slides</li>
            <li>so the winters can be very drying  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free is the key here.</li>
            <li>my heels were completely improved the first 24 hours I put the lotion on.</li>
            <li>They discontinued the best hand lotion ever, the original Norwegian Emulsion formula, and now have all these Norwegian products that perform less and less well.</li>
            <li>Especially for those with extra dry skin, Nivea or any kind of cocoa butter work ten times better.</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, it&#x27;s just as good as any other drugstore lotion.</li>
            <li>I have tried a zillion other foot creams, including the heavy duty tubs of lotion made especially for cracked feet, and the Moisture Wrap is the best thing I have tried.</li>
            <li>but I also live in a very humid area (Southwest Florida)</li>
            <li>THIS, WE ARE OLDER AND OUR FEET GET</li>
            <li>; the older sons ask for it in their Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li>I would not buy scented - personal preference; I&#x27;m sure the product is otherwise the same.)</li>
            <li>Within a week of using this stuff, my rough spots and smooth again and my legs stop itching.  </li>
            <li>is my new go-to lotion.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Moisture Wrap Daily Repair Body Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce arrived on time.</li>
            <li>but WOW!  </li>
            <li>I have used the intense moisture wrap cream for years and this new formula is no better than most other creams out there.</li>
            <li>Works decently well, but not well enough to spend the extra money on it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a cream - thick and rich.</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN A VERY DRY CLIMATE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few days were exhilerating, and now I think about moisturizing constantly.  </li>

            <li> MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN A VERY DRY CLIMATE.&lt;br /&gt;BESIDES THIS, WE ARE OLDER AND OUR FEET GET&lt;br /&gt;VERY DRY.  WE BOTH USE THIS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURE...YET OUR FEET DON&#x27;T FEEL GREASY.</li>
            <li> Everything is AOK. Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Moisture Wrap Daily Repair Body Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce arrived on time. I am pleased, I will reccommend this to anyone. I will do business with this company again. Thanks for your great service.</li>
            <li> this is a great body and hand lotion  really adds moisture to my skin I live in MN so the winters can be very drying  It is a really good price thru subscribe and save</li>
            <li> My wife works in the medical field and washes her hands dozens of times each day. This is her favorite hand lotion and it really moisturizes better than any other out there.</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion, Not greasy and it makes you feel really good. I buy 6 at a time as I can not find them around me. Love Love Love it and so does my hubby</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion!  I&#x27;ve used it for years, and I think my skin is looking nice because of it.  Rubs in easily, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  Better than similar products I have used.  Definitely worth the price.  Neutrogena products provide excellent quality, in my experience.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family loves this lotion (fragrance-free only). The youngest says it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t burn when her hands are red-dry; the older sons ask for it in their Christmas stocking. A visitor from out of state tried ours and had to get some for herself. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency - not watery, greasy or sticky. However, it&#x27;s a lotion, not a cream. One reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the hand cream. Neutrogena hand cream is also excellent stuff - really, really good for putting on at night and waking up with super soft skin (it&#x27;s also a great lip balm). But it&#x27;s a cream - thick and rich. And it would be hard to spread on limbs. This LOTION is a great everywhere moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin. (*This review is for the fragrance-free lotion. I would not buy scented - personal preference; I&#x27;m sure the product is otherwise the same.)</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion I have ever used and this is probably the 3rd tube I&#x27;m on.  I keep one at work and one at home.  This year, I bought it for my Mom and daughter-in-laws for a stocking stuffer.  Goes in quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Works decently well, but not well enough to spend the extra money on it. Especially for those with extra dry skin, Nivea or any kind of cocoa butter work ten times better. However, if you don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, it&#x27;s just as good as any other drugstore lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I used it the first time when I was having some allergies. Now that I am pregnant, I can&#x27;t use lotions with scent, so I use this lotion daily now and it does a great job on keeping my body hydrated.</li>
            <li> This works WAY better than the steroid cream I get from my doctor. It cleared the dry skin patches on my lower back within a week!! Its a bit pricey in my opinion, but WELL worth it :)</li>
            <li> Very efficient ! I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Norwegian Formula hand cream, but this did not moisturize well for me. I am puzzled as the ingredients look good. But somehow I was still scratchy and felt this was not rich enough for me.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free is the key here. No smell to notice at all. This is lighter than the intensive care and men like it better. Not really noticable after a minute.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this in the winter as my legs will start getting dry and rough patches on it.  Within a week of using this stuff, my rough spots and smooth again and my legs stop itching.  This is the only lotion I have found to work for that and I have tried many.  It also has a nice smell that I really like!</li>
            <li> I have used the intense moisture wrap cream for years and this new formula is no better than most other creams out there. If you can, get the one in the squirt bottle. It is amazing. This does nothing for my skin while the original gets rid of all my redness.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful. I have issues with super dry skin from distance swimming in chlorinated pools and salty water (and having that delicate skin get bruised and irritated with the slightest of friction) but I also live in a very humid area (Southwest Florida) so any heavy-duty lotion pretty much never absorbs and eventually feels like it slides off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moisture Wrap lotion absorbs instantly, feels very silky and smooth, and does an amazing job of helping my skin without making it greasy. It&#x27;s especially excellent on my feet- my heels were completely improved the first 24 hours I put the lotion on. I have tried a zillion other foot creams, including the heavy duty tubs of lotion made especially for cracked feet, and the Moisture Wrap is the best thing I have tried. It makes my skin smooth and soft without making it soggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to lotion. I wish they sold it in a pump.</li>
            <li> What has happened to Neutrogena? They discontinued the best hand lotion ever, the original Norwegian Emulsion formula, and now have all these Norwegian products that perform less and less well. I am wandering in the wilderness looking for something that keeps my dry hands in good condition. I am now buyng unscented lotion from some Dominican nuns in Summit NJ. It is not as good as the old Neutrogena NE, but It is the best I know of for now and people like getting it as a gift. As for this one, I can use it as a body lotion, but forget it for the hands.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this lotion but WOW!  The first few days were exhilerating, and now I think about moisturizing constantly.  My pet armadillo, Chester, loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I have always had dry skin and this work great. I get the unscented and the lotion is very smooth. Does not leave a sticky feeling on my skin. I have had a hard time finding this lotion in stores so now I just order several at a time.</li>
            <li> Just plain, good stuff for moisturizing! I highly recommend it for those looking for a well made product that costs much less than from a drug store.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m very careful about which body lotion I use.  Neutrogena is usually my go-to.  I found this lotion on Amazon, when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  I absolutely love it.</li>
