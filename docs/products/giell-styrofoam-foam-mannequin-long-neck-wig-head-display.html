            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good product</li>

            <li>I love the tall mannequin.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>the foam mannequin was securely packaged, no cracks, scratches or indentations!</li>
            <li>PETA lovers, please disregard my reference to &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34;.  :)</li>
            <li>Because the neck is longer, your wig/hairpiece will not touch the table top and crimp.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my 70cm long wigs and they stand upright with my wigs on them.</li>
            <li>So surprisingly for styrofoam, these mask stands are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine ever since).</li>
            <li>I have cleared space for it now and fit in well in my room.</li>
            <li>For everyday or overnight, it is the perfect way to keep your wig or hairpiece intact.</li>
            <li>Very nice, basic mannequin head.  </li>
            <li>great length for long wigs</li>
            <li>I bought this for a long wig and it works great -</li>
            <li>i might buy more and let my friends know about it and how cheap and fast it got here.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>They do a good job for the most part, even though one of my masks are a little bit too tall for the wig stand.</li>
            <li>Love the long neck as it makes it easy to hold between legs n sew!</li>
            <li>stand because it&#x27;s perfect for long wigs, and the low price.</li>
            <li>Best Long neck wig holder for long wig</li>
            <li>But is worth thought if you don&#x27;t mind using something to keep it up right.</li>
            <li>Holding two wigs on one of these right now, and works like a charm, no topple or anything of that sort.</li>
            <li>The long neck lets you style the wig very easy.</li>
            <li>Most likely will be my go to wig</li>
            <li>The item matched the photo exactly.  </li>
            <li>Besides having some balance issues when my wig is on, I&#x27;m satisfied with the height and such.</li>
            <li>There is a hole in the bottom of the stand so that you can attach it (with the proper accessory) to a table top and style the wig.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is a simple, light weight, Styrofoam wig stand.</li>
            <li>It is not fancy, but it serves the purpose very well for those longer wigs and hairpieces and was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I see myself purchasing more to hold all my other wigs.</li>
            <li>Love the long neck for the long length wigs.</li>
            <li>The Giell wig head display is alright, however, it came packed in bubble wrap, and when opened it had three (3) large slices on the left side of the face.</li>
            <li>I hold it to style my wigs and so far no problems.</li>
            <li>I have a long hair, real hair wig.  </li>
            <li>I like the long neck; it&#x27;s very helpful for storing and styling longer wigs.</li>
            <li>Said wig is long, and heavy in the back, so that might be part of the problem, but than I imagine many people buying this product, are using it for longer wigs.</li>
            <li>My overall experience with this has been positive and I recommend it for your long wig as well!</li>
            <li>Item shipped very promptly, contents as expected.</li>
            <li>Also, if your wig is heavy then this is easy to knock over - but that&#x27;s expected for a styrofoam head.</li>
            <li>I use it to store my long (past the shoulder) hair piece and use wig pins to secure the hair in place.</li>

            <li> I like the long neck which allows my headpiece</li>
            <li> Head was smaller than expected but</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get, a long neck styrofoam head.  </li>
            <li> Will recommend to anyone with a long wig or of course, an oversized mask.</li>
            <li> Travelling with this head can be cumbersome, since it is long, and you do have to take care not to snap the neck in transit</li>
            <li> it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> Delivered on-time, and just as expected.</li>
            <li> It really is not for travel.</li>
            <li> Due to it&#x27;s height, it is a bit unstable but still does the trick</li>
            <li> These masks can be a little bit heavy, but I&#x27;ve had the other 2 wig stands for years without any cracks or dents.</li>
            <li> You have to put something heavy to hold it up.</li>
            <li> so I had to unwrapped it slowly and carefully.</li>
            <li> since it has the thin long neck, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the style of the wig.</li>
            <li> It is all one piece and could be easily broken or crushed.</li>
            <li> It will stay on the stand without the pins, but with expensive hair pieces, I prefer to be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll attach it to a heavy base to prevent tipping.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it is always difficult to return things through the mail, so I did not inform you of this disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of them to hold up Mr. Bones and creature reacher Grim Reaper.</li>

            <li> Good product. wasn&#x27;t damaged in shipment like others report. I&#x27;ll attach it to a heavy base to prevent tipping.</li>
            <li> Delivered on-time, and just as expected.</li>
            <li> The Giell wig head display is alright, however, it came packed in bubble wrap, and when opened it had three (3) large slices on the left side of the face. It sort of looks like she has been in a car accident with scars on her cheek!!! Oh well, it is always difficult to return things through the mail, so I did not inform you of this disappointment.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister-in-law to hang her wig on. The reason why I gave 4 star is because it won&#x27;t stand up on it&#x27;s own. You have to put something heavy to hold it up. But is worth thought if you don&#x27;t mind using something to keep it up right.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping wigs neat! Love the long neck for the long length wigs. Very sturdy. I see myself purchasing more to hold all my other wigs.</li>
            <li> I love the tall mannequin. The long neck lets you style the wig very easy. I will purchase this again. Quality is great.</li>
            <li> this mannequin head was just what I was looking for! great length for long wigs</li>
            <li> Nice tall wig stand. Due to it&#x27;s height, it is a bit unstable but still does the trick</li>
            <li> This mannequin works good but works even better now that I purchased the stand for it.</li>
            <li> I have a long hair, real hair wig.  This is perfect for it!  Also ordered the wig holder, from amamazon..https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C3ZYWE/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8.  So happy I did!</li>
            <li> Holding two wigs on one of these right now, and works like a charm, no topple or anything of that sort. Great quality wig holder!</li>
            <li> The wig head is great for the longer wig&#x27;s and hold them good. The only thing I recommend is buying the weight or pole that inserts into the bottom so it give the stability so it does not fall over while fixing your wigs. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;d recommend buying.</li>
            <li> I wish it were heavier, tends to topple over, but otherwise this is a great wig stand.  Most likely will be my go to wig stand because it&#x27;s perfect for long wigs, and the low price.</li>
            <li> I like the long neck which allows my headpiece I am sewing to drape well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for wig making and styling before wear. Love the long neck as it makes it easy to hold between legs n sew!</li>
            <li> it was a little bigger I thought it would be. I have cleared space for it now and fit in well in my room. It was pakaged in sticky bubble rap so I had to unwrapped it slowly and carefully. I can&#x27;t wait to put my wig on it when it arrives in mail.</li>
            <li> Head was smaller than expected but good product</li>
            <li> Best Long neck wig holder for long wig I love it i might buy more and let my friends know about it and how cheap and fast it got here.</li>
            <li> the foam mannequin was securely packaged, no cracks, scratches or indentations! (i was a bit nervous about that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality it does not pill</li>
            <li> I bought two and they both arrived a day after being shipped. These are perfect for my 70cm long wigs and they stand upright with my wigs on them. I hold it to style my wigs and so far no problems. I would definitely recommend this to someone.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get, a long neck styrofoam head.  The item matched the photo exactly.  Works well for storing my fur hat during the summer.  PETA lovers, please disregard my reference to &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34;.  :)</li>
            <li> Besides having some balance issues when my wig is on, I&#x27;m satisfied with the height and such. Said wig is long, and heavy in the back, so that might be part of the problem, but than I imagine many people buying this product, are using it for longer wigs.</li>
            <li> Item shipped very promptly, contents as expected.</li>
            <li> I for one do not use these heads for wigs. I use them for my oversized latex masks. They do a good job for the most part, even though one of my masks are a little bit too tall for the wig stand. I have bought 2 of them to hold up Mr. Bones and creature reacher Grim Reaper. Now as I buy King of Bones mask this year, this will be my third wig stand. These masks can be a little bit heavy, but I&#x27;ve had the other 2 wig stands for years without any cracks or dents. So surprisingly for styrofoam, these mask stands are pretty sturdy. Will recommend to anyone with a long wig or of course, an oversized mask.</li>
            <li> was dented when it came</li>
            <li> This is a simple, light weight, Styrofoam wig stand. I use it to store my long (past the shoulder) hair piece and use wig pins to secure the hair in place. It will stay on the stand without the pins, but with expensive hair pieces, I prefer to be careful. There is a hole in the bottom of the stand so that you can attach it (with the proper accessory) to a table top and style the wig. It is not fancy, but it serves the purpose very well for those longer wigs and hairpieces and was very inexpensive. It really is not for travel. It is all one piece and could be easily broken or crushed. For everyday or overnight, it is the perfect way to keep your wig or hairpiece intact. Because the neck is longer, your wig/hairpiece will not touch the table top and crimp. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Received item today.  It works perfect.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a long wig and it works great - since it has the thin long neck, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the style of the wig. Travelling with this head can be cumbersome, since it is long, and you do have to take care not to snap the neck in transit (this happened to me but I just glued it back together with some Elmer&#x27;s glue and it&#x27;s been fine ever since). Also, if your wig is heavy then this is easy to knock over - but that&#x27;s expected for a styrofoam head. My overall experience with this has been positive and I recommend it for your long wig as well!</li>
            <li> Very nice, basic mannequin head.  Arrived intact and it does its job.  I like the long neck; it&#x27;s very helpful for storing and styling longer wigs.</li>
