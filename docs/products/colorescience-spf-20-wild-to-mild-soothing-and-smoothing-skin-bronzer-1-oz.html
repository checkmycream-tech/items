            <li>But when I do use foundation this is the perfect primer, foundation goes on smoother and lasts longer no matter what brand I use.  </li>

            <li>I first discovered this wonderful primer/foundation at a pricey spa, and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li>AAAAAAAAwesome love it!</li>
            <li>and I think stay on better as well!</li>
            <li>Love the coverage you get with this primer and also doesn&#x27;t cause break outs!</li>
            <li>so much to love here!  </li>
            <li>I have used lots and lots of primers, but this is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many comments about how even and nice my skin looks when wearing this.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for skin that needs a touch of coverage with  a natural appearance.</li>
            <li>is very important.</li>
            <li>My BFF sees the same dermatologist and uses this as well and her naturally good skin looks even more beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer, but better coverage and so smooth!</li>
            <li>And I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to put a foundation over top of this.</li>
            <li>This has become my #1 favorite product out of all of my makeup &amp; I will be recommending to friends/family &amp; purchasing more.</li>
            <li>It is smooth!  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for many years but bought it through my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Now I am buying it online and love the ease of getting it this way.</li>
            <li>so when I go over it with a powder, the powder doesn&#x27;t settle into those areas accentuating them -- which is NOT what I want to do! :-)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love colorescience make up.</li>
            <li>It may help making sure my foundation goes on and stays on better, but not at the price that I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product-</li>
            <li>Wild to Mild is the best all around product I use for my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, the texture is light and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming like I find a lot of makeup to have.  </li>
            <li>It glides on easily</li>
            <li>My husband, who only comments on how many products I have tried, saw me the first morning I wore this, in bright sunshine, and said, &amp;#34;Whoa!  </li>
            <li>This is a light weight mineral bronzer that is designed for use with Colorscience foundations.</li>
            <li>Light weight product with gr8 coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a primer that smooths out your skin tone, but you can also use as a light foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t add to my break outs.</li>
            <li>My primary use for it now is the SPF.</li>
            <li>It is not as light as the original one was.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is light and natural -- and somehow it perfectly covers just about anything, even my ruddy skin tone and the occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to stumble upon this product.</li>
            <li>This product is not like the original Color Science bronzer.</li>
            <li>The product is an absolutely silky smooth application, and having the added benefit of the SPF is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My daughters always ask for this product on birthdays or special occassions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot; since pre-adolescence and have spent a great deal of money over the years on foundations to improve the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is nice too in that it dispenses a nice amount without having to dig down into a jar.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this, and more often than not it&#x27;s the only &#x27;foundation&#x27;</li>
            <li>My favorite product for my face by far!  </li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin and this product works great to even out my skin, minimize pores and fine lines and it has spf too</li>
            <li>The bronzing is very, very mild and you can hardly tell it is on but does give you a very nice glow.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice and sheer.</li>
            <li>I am very fair, but this color is not too dark and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The last couple of orders have been off on the color, however, but still high quality (one was the cocoa color, which smelled like cocoa but had good coverage, albeit darker, and</li>
            <li>just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>Where can I find the original Wild to Mild????</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, provideds sun protection and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for about 4 months &amp; have fallen in love with this product, not only for it&#x27;s sunscreen, but the silky feel it has when I put it on after moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>I love this product but this felt softer than what i have experienced in the past, the primer felt like it was watered down.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and it certainly doesn&#x27;t help that in any way.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how it works, but it really does.    </li>
            <li>It covers so well &amp; really diminishes the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need&lt;br /&gt;any type of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>like most other primers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>--I have sun damage that is largely covered, as I would normally have to do with concealer, when I use this primer.  </li>
            <li>and it still is the only one that goes on easily and leaves a natural look to my face.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth has a 20 SPF and really helps with uneven skin</li>
            <li>Not only does it go on super creamy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the SPF</li>
            <li>think the amount and the price point is high, however.</li>
            <li>I am very oily with sensitive skin, and this does not break you out at all nor does it make your skin look oily</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of make-up and this replaces both base and power and provides a simple, smooth and non-greasy cover that makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
            <li>After reading a description of \\&quot;BB cream\\&quot; I think this product pretty much qualifies since it is such a multi-tasker.</li>
            <li>especially like the wild to mild.</li>
            <li>The new one is way darker and my skin doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and this gives you a nice Btful natural finish glow look.  </li>
            <li>It evens out all my skin imperfections and restores to a natural color.  </li>
            <li>This one is not the real product different texture,color everything&lt;br /&gt;Figures!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a natural looking effect.  </li>
            <li>Colorscience makeup products provide coverage &amp; sun protection for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very subtle, but nice, not flower-y or overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>the last was the same color on the package, Wild to Mild, but had less of the reddish Sienna tint to it).  </li>
            <li>and I find I can generally use this product by itself for daytime wear and not use foundation over it.  </li>

            <li> and I find I can generally use this product by itself for daytime wear and not use foundation over it.  </li>
            <li> Very even without looking heavy!  </li>
            <li> it is super sheer and doesn&#x27;t result in that creepy orange color at the end of the day-plus it has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I still use concealer when I have appts, meetings, etc., but if my day is casual, this is quick and lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a makeup expert, so I may be completely missing the point of using this product, but it definitely is not taking away my need for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I do not use any other makeup after applying this and I am 60.</li>
            <li> Having rosacea I have tried other products &amp; always return to Colorescience.</li>
            <li> can be worn alone or under other makeup.</li>
            <li> I just use spot concealer as needed and apply my other make-up as normal---no need for foundation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product but this felt softer than what i have experienced in the past, the primer felt like it was watered down. I was so dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> I LOVE everything about this! It glides on easily and it&#x27;s so soft and smooth. I love the way it makes my skin feel too!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  In fact once I tried it I&#x27;m hoping it never gets discontinued!  It evens out all my skin imperfections and restores to a natural color.  Very even without looking heavy!  I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> Wild to Mild is the best all around product I use for my face.  I have moderate rosacea and I find I can generally use this product by itself for daytime wear and not use foundation over it.  But when I do use foundation this is the perfect primer, foundation goes on smoother and lasts longer no matter what brand I use.  It may not work for everyone, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight mineral bronzer that is designed for use with Colorscience foundations.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face look flawless and very smooth like a cream powder.  I highly recommend this product and the SPF is very important.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I&#x27;ve used it for years over Vivite antioxidant serum as rec by my dermatologist.  I use retinoin at night and this helps with resulting flakiness. I&#x27;ve had \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot; since pre-adolescence and have spent a great deal of money over the years on foundations to improve the appearance of my skin.  I get compliments on my skin now, decades later, which I never could have anticipated.  My BFF sees the same dermatologist and uses this as well and her naturally good skin looks even more beautiful.  Pricey, but lasts for months.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this wonderful primer/foundation at a pricey spa, and have used it ever since.  The last couple of orders have been off on the color, however, but still high quality (one was the cocoa color, which smelled like cocoa but had good coverage, albeit darker, and the last was the same color on the package, Wild to Mild, but had less of the reddish Sienna tint to it).  Still, if I could have only one makeup product, it would be this one.  It&#x27;s like Photoshop in a plastic pump!</li>
            <li> I use this primer as my foundation, too.  It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer, but better coverage and so smooth!</li>
            <li> I never liked to wear foundation.  But one day, after a harsh chemical treatment, my aesthetician put this on my face.  And I fell in love.  It&#x27;s definitely not a bronzer.  I agree with the reviewer who likened it to a tinted moisturizer.  On me, mineral powder make up looks artificial.  Liquid foundations get greasy.  This stuff is light and natural -- and somehow it perfectly covers just about anything, even my ruddy skin tone and the occasional pimple.  I have no idea how it works, but it really does.    You&#x27;ll be blown away.</li>
            <li> My Cosmetologist recommended this to me to wear on a daily basis b/c of the type of sunscreen this product has in it. I have been using it now for about 4 months &amp; have fallen in love with this product, not only for it&#x27;s sunscreen, but the silky feel it has when I put it on after moisturizing my face. I don&#x27;t even have to put a foundation over top of this. It covers so well &amp; really diminishes the size of my pores. This has become my #1 favorite product out of all of my makeup &amp; I will be recommending to friends/family &amp; purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 and I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years and it still is the only one that goes on easily and leaves a natural look to my face. I never have creases or streaks or a cakey look.</li>
            <li> Light weight product with gr8 coverage. Breathable makeup. Pairs perfectly with Sunforgetable powder sunscreen. These take the place of foundation &amp; powder with a flawless finish I can swim &amp; sweat in, and still have a beautifully smoothe glow. Love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I turned 50 and had melanoma, I have become an organic beauty product junkie.  I have used lots and lots of primers, but this is the absolute best.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is smooth!  Not cake-y and does not &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; like most other primers.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It smells good!  Very subtle, but nice, not flower-y or overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Others will notice. My husband, who only comments on how many products I have tried, saw me the first morning I wore this, in bright sunshine, and said, &amp;#34;Whoa!  Your skin looks great!&amp;#34;  HUH????&lt;br /&gt;4.  As an added bonus, it has a bit of coverage--I have sun damage that is largely covered, as I would normally have to do with concealer, when I use this primer.  I still use concealer when I have appts, meetings, etc., but if my day is casual, this is quick and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid that this would be sparkly or too &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; looking, but it is not. It just makes you look rested and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this-your face will be gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years and love it. This one is not the real product different texture,color everything&lt;br /&gt;Figures!</li>
            <li> My sister had me try hers and I fell in love with it.  Not only does it go on super creamy but it has SPF 20 in it so I don&#x27;t have to apply another sunscreen.  The bronzing is very, very mild and you can hardly tell it is on but does give you a very nice glow.  I have very fair skin and it is perfect.  My sister is even lighter and it compliments her as well so I think it is good for any color skin complexion.  The applicator is nice too in that it dispenses a nice amount without having to dig down into a jar.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a natural looking effect.  I do not use any other makeup after applying this and I am 60.</li>
            <li> Best primer I have used. Goes on very smooth has a 20 SPF and really helps with uneven skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the wild to mild. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> AAAAAAAAwesome love it!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think I would like this but it does give you a little color and helps your mineral makeup go on smoother and I think stay on better as well!</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on the skin and gives a nice coverage. Can be used instead of tinted moisturizer. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer; the color blends so well and you really don&#x27;t need&lt;br /&gt;any type of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I think the amount and the price point is high, however.</li>
            <li> The best skin bronzer I have ever used.  It goes on smooth, provideds sun protection and looks very natural.  Coverage is for a more natural look.  My daughters always ask for this product on birthdays or special occassions.</li>
            <li> This is really nice and sheer. I have used it for many years but bought it through my dermatologist. Now I am buying it online and love the ease of getting it this way.</li>
            <li> Colorscience makeup products provide coverage &amp; sun protection for my sensitive skin. Having rosacea I have tried other products &amp; always return to Colorescience.</li>
            <li> My favorite product for my face by far!  It evens out my skin tone and I use it every day with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> Where can I find the original Wild to Mild???? The new one is way darker and my skin doesn&#x27;t like it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I was so happy to stumble upon this product. I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of make-up and this replaces both base and power and provides a simple, smooth and non-greasy cover that makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
            <li> This product is not like the original Color Science bronzer. It is not as light as the original one was.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage you get with this primer and also doesn&#x27;t cause break outs! I usually mix this shade with the bronze and I can use them year round by adjusting how much bronze I mix in.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this. It&#x27;s a primer that smooths out your skin tone, but you can also use as a light foundation. It&#x27;s actually beneficial to your skin too. I am very fair, but this color is not too dark and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried it every foundation, primer, tinted moisturizer you can think of, and this is an absolute best of the best.  This is All in one!  It feels great knowing that you are putting something healthy onto your skin and not having to Worry about breakouts.  I use the bronze since I am an olive tan tone.  And the bronze is just perfect for me.  A little goes a long way and this gives you a nice Btful natural finish glow look.  I am very oily with sensitive skin, and this does not break you out at all nor does it make your skin look oily but it actually helps it.</li>
            <li> I love to use this, and more often than not it&#x27;s the only &#x27;foundation&#x27; I use.  It helps to prime and fill in the lines and wrinkles so when I go over it with a powder, the powder doesn&#x27;t settle into those areas accentuating them -- which is NOT what I want to do! :-)</li>
            <li> Colorscience.....so much to love here!  The product is an absolutely silky smooth application, and having the added benefit of the SPF is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love colorescience make up. I have bad acne and red scars and this completely camouflages everything. It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t add to my break outs. I&#x27;ve received so many comments about how even and nice my skin looks when wearing this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. I wear it every day because it contains sun screen and helps my mineral powder foundation stick to my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the basis of another review.  If I remember correctly, someone said that she used in instead of her foundation.  I find that this is not a substitute for my foundation.  It may help making sure my foundation goes on and stays on better, but not at the price that I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a makeup expert, so I may be completely missing the point of using this product, but it definitely is not taking away my need for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the texture is light and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming like I find a lot of makeup to have.  I have rosacea and it certainly doesn&#x27;t help that in any way.  My primary use for it now is the SPF.</li>
            <li> Love this product-it is super sheer and doesn&#x27;t result in that creepy orange color at the end of the day-plus it has sunscreen. It is perfect for skin that needs a touch of coverage with  a natural appearance.</li>
            <li> the best makeup discovery in YEARS! can be worn alone or under other makeup. makeup around eyes no longer looks crepey - just the right amount of coverage. i love my skin again!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and it&#x27;s wonderful. Sort of like a mouse texture- it blends well and doesn&#x27;t have a Casey look. Nice product!</li>
            <li> This will be the 4th time I am re-ordering this product. I tried it at a spa a couple of years ago and have been using it as my daily primer/foundation/moisturizer ever since. I have dry sensitive skin and this product works great to even out my skin, minimize pores and fine lines and it has spf too so no need for anything else! I just use spot concealer as needed and apply my other make-up as normal---no need for foundation. It&#x27;s a great product. After reading a description of \\&quot;BB cream\\&quot; I think this product pretty much qualifies since it is such a multi-tasker.</li>
