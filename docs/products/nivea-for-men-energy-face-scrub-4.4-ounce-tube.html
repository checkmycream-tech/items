            <li>Great all-around face scrub.</li>
            <li>I often use it in lieu of shaving gel and it fels even better than when I use the Gel.</li>
            <li>I use this product twice a week to scrub my face and my face skin looks healthier and better.  </li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>and I was able to find it on amazon and surprise him.  </li>
            <li>We both use this and love how it feels.</li>
            <li>I love the Energy Face Scrub, its refreshing &amp;..  energizing:)</li>
            <li>The face scrub leaves your face nice and smooth after just one use.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love this face scrub.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Great scent, not overly fine or overly large granules.</li>
            <li>Pretty good scrub.</li>
            <li>is awesome, though I wish it had a little more of the refreshing stuff in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, I guess the good thing is that the smell isn&#x27;t really overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smells good and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle, face feels fresh after using.</li>
            <li>It smells good and has some scrubs beads but is still gentle.</li>
            <li>It came fast and was in good shape (not leaking) upon arrival.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, it was a good product, especially for the amazing price.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my face feels afterwords.</li>
            <li>Not as abrasive to be considered a true face &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34; More like finely scratches your face.</li>
            <li>I love all Nivea products - they are generally all good quality and this one is one of them.</li>
            <li>This was OK, better than OK maybe, but I was a little surprised there wasn&#x27;t more &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; or exfoliating substance in what is labeled a &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34; The almost-menthol scent and refreshing feeling was as good or better than the scrubbing aspects.</li>
            <li>, I bought this on a whim, because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>The beads help with exfoliation leaving your skin feeling smooth as ever.</li>
            <li>Keeps his face blackhead/zit free.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s available via subscribe and save option, I settled on this one.</li>
            <li>My husband really enjoy this product</li>
            <li>I use this right before a fresh shave, and my skin couldn&#x27;t be any more smooth feeling afterwards!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, leaves my face feeling fresh and VERY clean!  </li>
            <li>but instead i enjoyed how easy it was to apply and how gentle it felt.</li>
            <li>Originally ordered to fill volume requirement for subscribe and save discount.</li>
            <li>It has beads in it that help to clean out the pores and remove dirt and oil from your skin.</li>
            <li>Face never felt so clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li>the Mr. Clean look and shave my head to the skin.  </li>
            <li>He says he likes the grittiness to it...that it makes his face feel clean.</li>
            <li>, seems to clean, so there are no complaints from me.</li>
            <li>My BF loves how exfoliating and the clean feel he gets after using this.</li>
            <li>Canont clean well.</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>Ok, having had the whole macho image going for me hadnt worked out so well.</li>
            <li>Although I do feel that the formula was similarly cheapened, I continue to use it because it works similarly to the original, and that was the best value scrub I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>fresh, clean scent, just the right amount of grit and smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Leaves a clean fresh feel.</li>
            <li>N&amp;iacute;vea for Men Energy has a pleasant scent with micro bead action that leaves your face smooth, moisturized, clear from dirt and grime from working out and running NYC streets.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it really cleanses my face and feels fresh</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and mild with a tingling sensation that comes on after one or two minutes due to an aromatic of some sort.  </li>
            <li>I am familiar with this product and I received the exact product that was advertised.</li>
            <li>you fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent</li>
            <li>fresh instead.</li>
            <li>Your face feel fresh and renew after each use.</li>
            <li>Made my husbands hface so soft love the product ...will buy again ...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more environmentally-friendly product, check out the face scrub from Bulldog Natural Skincare.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, and Amazon is the place to get it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has VERY sensitive skin &amp; my own is normal.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of the same type of thing, but for me, the Nivea seems to work best.</li>
            <li>Good decent amount should last for some time if use sparingly.</li>
            <li>NOt too abrasive just the right amount.</li>
            <li>He said it was all right...</li>
            <li>it leaves your face feeling clean and smooth, which is something that I haven&#x27;t been able to find in any other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>this face wash may leave your skin excessively dry after use so be sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li>By doing this, it makes shaving go much more smoothly, with limited nicks.  </li>
            <li>As far as facial scrubs go, this is a fairly abrasive, deep cleaning one; that is a good thing, but if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Good product; makes your face feel fresh, but could be a little grittier...</li>
            <li>Far too strong of a scent</li>
            <li>Nivea for men Energy Facial Scrub is a great product to eliminate oily skin and assist in eliminating facial blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Nivea face wash and scrub products were excellent until the formulas of both were changed a few years back.</li>
            <li>It also gives off a sort of tingly feeling, which I guess is what they mean when they say it energizes you, but either way it does do a good job of waking you up in the morning, as well as keeping your face rather smooth.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>Theres little balls that seem to really clean amazingly.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a face scrub</li>
            <li>I compliment this with Facial refreshing cleaner to keeps face invigorating and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>This was my first pre-scrubber.  </li>
            <li>After a hot shower, rub this on, and then the cream and go for it.  </li>
            <li>They have replaced it with this product ([...]), which is OK, but really a different product.</li>
            <li>Will continue to sneak more Nivea mens skincare products into his daily routine ;)</li>
            <li>A top quality product that should be in every man&#x27;s daily regimen.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say about how the old product was, but the new product seems great enough.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel clean which may sound strange</li>
            <li>after using the face scrub my face felt comletely clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to balance out today&#x27;s 1-star review of the face wash with a positive one for this scrub, because I am still using this product after 14 years.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because it is in my price range and had the little beads to help me exfoliate and truly clean my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had been getting bumps and just not getting a good shave with some of the creams and lotions in the past.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using this more than 2-3 times a week than it can dry your skin if you&#x27;re not using lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps my face smooth, and free of allergens and black heads.</li>
            <li>Nice little tingly feeling after using.</li>
            <li>It kind of gets in your nose a little.</li>
            <li>Really like the product and don&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to use it any time you really want a closer shave.</li>
            <li>gets rid of ... on your face....and really clears it up.....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it as a preshave, but that could be an option.  </li>
            <li>This product used to really freshen my face</li>
            <li>This product seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the Energizing.</li>
            <li>so you dont have to use much.</li>
            <li>I personally like the old product better, which I have been trying to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly more drying that other men&#x27;s face scrubs that I have used.</li>
            <li>he uses normal body soap!</li>
            <li>It shows the picture of the old formula but you get the newer, less effective formula.</li>
            <li>Cheap, effective, and the small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, and so far, it&#x27;s worked really well!</li>
            <li>I love the grit because it gets down in the pores and cleans.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really the new</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s not as abrading, and less refreshing.</li>
            <li>It too is mild to moderate if you like that sort of thing.  </li>
            <li>Does a decent job of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I think using this is the key to not cutting myself and not getting bumps and razor</li>
            <li>I find that most soaps dry out my face, causing bigger issues.  </li>
            <li>I am a LOW maintenance guy, but this is simple and easy.</li>
            <li>It seems Nivea has chosen to cut corners with this new formulation.  </li>
            <li>This is a new picture of the bottle as of February 2015.</li>
            <li>I have a bit more sensitive skin though, and so I felt it dried out my face a bit.</li>
            <li>It can be harsh on your skin if your not gentle using it, Smells good and always follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Consistent regular use will improve skin tone and repair oil created surface blemishes.  </li>
            <li>This lasted for about 3 days, and that was after using it the first (and last) time.</li>
            <li>Though you feel you face seems clean after you washed your face, but actually it just make you skin too dry....</li>
            <li>and I am now pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>A dab on the finger, circular action on the face, rinse, and now I feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Then, about a year ago they changed the packaging (the one pictured here is the OLD version).</li>
            <li>Not enough grit to do much of anything.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised the difference it makes in shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used a similar product from Lancome (more expensive) and actually prefer Nivea better.</li>
            <li>Micro-scrubbers left my face feeling very refreshed</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re showing a pic of the old product that Nivea does not produce anymore.</li>
            <li>like the amount of the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; particles- not so much to irritate the face, but just so to feel like it is properly scrubbing the skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>Crushed fruit-nuts, like apricot hulls, have sharp edges and points which can be too aggressive for more tender skin types.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that there is also one called &amp;#34;revitalizing that share the same bar code #, but I found the &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; has an extra kick that I found lacking in the revitalizing.</li>
            <li>It is very gritty, as other reviewers have mentioned, but it leaves me with a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Other face washes without the beads never get a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want and expected.</li>
            <li>I am spoiled because i had jack black face scrub before and that stuff is worth the price.</li>
            <li>me up&amp;#34; effect which some would say it is similar to that caused by something similar to menthol but much lighter and without noticeable odor.</li>
            <li>Please, please bring back the old \\&quot;Engergizing\\&quot; formulation!  </li>
            <li>Use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed and also use the nivea for men face wash on the other days.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a reasonably priced cleanser this is for you because it&#x27;s certainly not a scrub anymore.</li>
            <li>Nivea products always seem live up to their standard of facial care.</li>
            <li>You could hardly feel the little beads/micro scrubbers, and it simply leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>As with most scrubs it can be tough to rinse away all the grit/beads with only a sink.</li>
            <li>The scrubby balls within the soap effectively break down tough facial hair letting the razor get closer to the skin for a cleaner shave.  </li>
            <li>Its a little too gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my face is a little softer since using it, but that may very well be a placebo effect.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s neither good or bad, it just simply has a smell similar to shaving cream.</li>

            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great all-around face scrub.</li>
            <li> I often use it in lieu of shaving gel and it fels even better than when I use the Gel.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a week to scrub my face and my face skin looks healthier and better.  </li>
            <li> Just OK.</li>
            <li> and I was able to find it on amazon and surprise him.  </li>
            <li> We both use this and love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I love the Energy Face Scrub, its refreshing &amp;..  energizing:)</li>
            <li> The face scrub leaves your face nice and smooth after just one use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Great scent, not overly fine or overly large granules.</li>
            <li> Pretty good scrub.</li>
            <li> is awesome, though I wish it had a little more of the refreshing stuff in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, I guess the good thing is that the smell isn&#x27;t really overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells good and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle, face feels fresh after using.</li>
            <li> It smells good and has some scrubs beads but is still gentle.</li>
            <li> It came fast and was in good shape (not leaking) upon arrival.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, it was a good product, especially for the amazing price.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my face feels afterwords.</li>
            <li> Not as abrasive to be considered a true face &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34; More like finely scratches your face.</li>
            <li> I love all Nivea products - they are generally all good quality and this one is one of them.</li>
            <li> This was OK, better than OK maybe, but I was a little surprised there wasn&#x27;t more &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; or exfoliating substance in what is labeled a &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34; The almost-menthol scent and refreshing feeling was as good or better than the scrubbing aspects.</li>
            <li> , I bought this on a whim, because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> The beads help with exfoliation leaving your skin feeling smooth as ever.</li>
            <li> Keeps his face blackhead/zit free.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s available via subscribe and save option, I settled on this one.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoy this product</li>
            <li> I use this right before a fresh shave, and my skin couldn&#x27;t be any more smooth feeling afterwards!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, leaves my face feeling fresh and VERY clean!  </li>
            <li> but instead i enjoyed how easy it was to apply and how gentle it felt.</li>
            <li> Originally ordered to fill volume requirement for subscribe and save discount.</li>
            <li> It has beads in it that help to clean out the pores and remove dirt and oil from your skin.</li>
            <li> Face never felt so clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li> the Mr. Clean look and shave my head to the skin.  </li>
            <li> He says he likes the grittiness to it...that it makes his face feel clean.</li>
            <li> , seems to clean, so there are no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> My BF loves how exfoliating and the clean feel he gets after using this.</li>
            <li> Canont clean well.</li>
            <li> Nothing special</li>
            <li> Ok, having had the whole macho image going for me hadnt worked out so well.</li>
            <li> Although I do feel that the formula was similarly cheapened, I continue to use it because it works similarly to the original, and that was the best value scrub I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> fresh, clean scent, just the right amount of grit and smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean fresh feel.</li>
            <li> N&amp;iacute;vea for Men Energy has a pleasant scent with micro bead action that leaves your face smooth, moisturized, clear from dirt and grime from working out and running NYC streets.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really cleanses my face and feels fresh</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and mild with a tingling sensation that comes on after one or two minutes due to an aromatic of some sort.  </li>
            <li> I am familiar with this product and I received the exact product that was advertised.</li>
            <li> you fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent</li>
            <li> fresh instead.</li>
            <li> Your face feel fresh and renew after each use.</li>
            <li> Made my husbands hface so soft love the product ...will buy again ...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a more environmentally-friendly product, check out the face scrub from Bulldog Natural Skincare.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, and Amazon is the place to get it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has VERY sensitive skin &amp; my own is normal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of the same type of thing, but for me, the Nivea seems to work best.</li>
            <li> Good decent amount should last for some time if use sparingly.</li>
            <li> NOt too abrasive just the right amount.</li>
            <li> He said it was all right...</li>
            <li> it leaves your face feeling clean and smooth, which is something that I haven&#x27;t been able to find in any other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this face wash may leave your skin excessively dry after use so be sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li> By doing this, it makes shaving go much more smoothly, with limited nicks.  </li>
            <li> As far as facial scrubs go, this is a fairly abrasive, deep cleaning one; that is a good thing, but if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Good product; makes your face feel fresh, but could be a little grittier...</li>
            <li> Far too strong of a scent</li>
            <li> Nivea for men Energy Facial Scrub is a great product to eliminate oily skin and assist in eliminating facial blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Nivea face wash and scrub products were excellent until the formulas of both were changed a few years back.</li>
            <li> It also gives off a sort of tingly feeling, which I guess is what they mean when they say it energizes you, but either way it does do a good job of waking you up in the morning, as well as keeping your face rather smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.</li>
            <li> Theres little balls that seem to really clean amazingly.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a face scrub</li>
            <li> I compliment this with Facial refreshing cleaner to keeps face invigorating and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> This was my first pre-scrubber.  </li>
            <li> After a hot shower, rub this on, and then the cream and go for it.  </li>
            <li> They have replaced it with this product ([...]), which is OK, but really a different product.</li>
            <li> Will continue to sneak more Nivea mens skincare products into his daily routine ;)</li>
            <li> A top quality product that should be in every man&#x27;s daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say about how the old product was, but the new product seems great enough.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel clean which may sound strange</li>
            <li> after using the face scrub my face felt comletely clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to balance out today&#x27;s 1-star review of the face wash with a positive one for this scrub, because I am still using this product after 14 years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it is in my price range and had the little beads to help me exfoliate and truly clean my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had been getting bumps and just not getting a good shave with some of the creams and lotions in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this more than 2-3 times a week than it can dry your skin if you&#x27;re not using lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps my face smooth, and free of allergens and black heads.</li>
            <li> Nice little tingly feeling after using.</li>
            <li> It kind of gets in your nose a little.</li>
            <li> Really like the product and don&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to use it any time you really want a closer shave.</li>
            <li> gets rid of ... on your face....and really clears it up.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it as a preshave, but that could be an option.  </li>
            <li> This product used to really freshen my face</li>
            <li> This product seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the Energizing.</li>
            <li> so you dont have to use much.</li>
            <li> I personally like the old product better, which I have been trying to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly more drying that other men&#x27;s face scrubs that I have used.</li>
            <li> he uses normal body soap!</li>
            <li> It shows the picture of the old formula but you get the newer, less effective formula.</li>
            <li> Cheap, effective, and the small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, and so far, it&#x27;s worked really well!</li>
            <li> I love the grit because it gets down in the pores and cleans.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really the new</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s not as abrading, and less refreshing.</li>
            <li> It too is mild to moderate if you like that sort of thing.  </li>
            <li> Does a decent job of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think using this is the key to not cutting myself and not getting bumps and razor</li>
            <li> I find that most soaps dry out my face, causing bigger issues.  </li>
            <li> I am a LOW maintenance guy, but this is simple and easy.</li>
            <li> It seems Nivea has chosen to cut corners with this new formulation.  </li>
            <li> This is a new picture of the bottle as of February 2015.</li>
            <li> I have a bit more sensitive skin though, and so I felt it dried out my face a bit.</li>
            <li> It can be harsh on your skin if your not gentle using it, Smells good and always follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Consistent regular use will improve skin tone and repair oil created surface blemishes.  </li>
            <li> This lasted for about 3 days, and that was after using it the first (and last) time.</li>
            <li> Though you feel you face seems clean after you washed your face, but actually it just make you skin too dry....</li>
            <li> and I am now pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> A dab on the finger, circular action on the face, rinse, and now I feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Then, about a year ago they changed the packaging (the one pictured here is the OLD version).</li>
            <li> Not enough grit to do much of anything.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised the difference it makes in shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used a similar product from Lancome (more expensive) and actually prefer Nivea better.</li>
            <li> Micro-scrubbers left my face feeling very refreshed</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re showing a pic of the old product that Nivea does not produce anymore.</li>
            <li> like the amount of the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; particles- not so much to irritate the face, but just so to feel like it is properly scrubbing the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Crushed fruit-nuts, like apricot hulls, have sharp edges and points which can be too aggressive for more tender skin types.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that there is also one called &amp;#34;revitalizing that share the same bar code #, but I found the &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; has an extra kick that I found lacking in the revitalizing.</li>
            <li> It is very gritty, as other reviewers have mentioned, but it leaves me with a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Other face washes without the beads never get a deep clean.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want and expected.</li>
            <li> I am spoiled because i had jack black face scrub before and that stuff is worth the price.</li>
            <li> me up&amp;#34; effect which some would say it is similar to that caused by something similar to menthol but much lighter and without noticeable odor.</li>
            <li> Please, please bring back the old \\&quot;Engergizing\\&quot; formulation!  </li>
            <li> Use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed and also use the nivea for men face wash on the other days.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a reasonably priced cleanser this is for you because it&#x27;s certainly not a scrub anymore.</li>
            <li> Nivea products always seem live up to their standard of facial care.</li>
            <li> You could hardly feel the little beads/micro scrubbers, and it simply leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> As with most scrubs it can be tough to rinse away all the grit/beads with only a sink.</li>
            <li> The scrubby balls within the soap effectively break down tough facial hair letting the razor get closer to the skin for a cleaner shave.  </li>
            <li> Its a little too gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my face is a little softer since using it, but that may very well be a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s neither good or bad, it just simply has a smell similar to shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Overall it still seems to be a gentle formula, though I&#x27;m not sure I would use it daily</li>
            <li> I havent used it long enough to notice the long term effects, but from the way my face feels, it&#x27;s removed alot of gunk and dirt that i didnt actually notice.</li>
            <li> has little tiny beads in it like sand but is soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the photo of the old package, hoping to snap up some of the previous formula...</li>
            <li> and my face got completely dry, red, and started peeling.</li>
            <li> and it looks like it will last for a long long time!</li>
            <li> This face scrub is a necessary part of my daily routine; however, my use might be slightly non-standard.  </li>
            <li> While others may prefer using this product every other day or when shaving, I have been using it once daily in the shower and also before shaving.</li>
            <li> Does not leave my face dry</li>
            <li> Not so dry and the oil is gone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin, and has like Nivea products in the past.</li>
            <li> What I got was the new, icky stuff.</li>
            <li> Regular cleaning seems to take off those black dots too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soupy and I&#x27;d prefer slightly larger grit.</li>
            <li> I am not much of a face soap type of guy.  </li>
            <li> As expected..</li>
            <li> sent me the wrong item, TWICE, even after returning the item once at my cost, WITH A PICTURE OF THE RIGHT ITEM.  </li>
            <li> keeps the oil down and doesnt dry out my face either.</li>
            <li> for the first few days, I tried this product without wearing my glasses and confused it for my hemeroid cream.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; to this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> use a small amount, but that goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I get a lot less</li>
            <li> Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> all the dead skin off my face.</li>
            <li> The scrub is not too harsh to the touch.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub on my scalp before I shave my head in order to scrub off small bumps and slightly tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> I just plain get a closer, smoother shave after using it.  </li>
            <li> Used to use Kyoku for Men, but that became entirely too expensive.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing serious.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s got a sickening cologne smell, and a gooey texture with large chunks of grit that feel like somebody dropped snot into a sandbox.</li>
            <li> It does contain menthol so you will feel a chilling effect on the face</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the scrub would feel like sand paper</li>
            <li> Do not listen to the one bad</li>
            <li> Although the formula change (specifically the addition of menthol) ruined the face wash for me, this scrub did not suffer as badly.</li>
            <li> Buy it; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> and i have nasty</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this right before a fresh shave, and my skin couldn&#x27;t be any more smooth feeling afterwards!</li>
            <li> Nivea for Men Energy Face Scrub, 4.4 Ounce Tube I love how my face feels after using this.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Originally ordered to fill volume requirement for subscribe and save discount. Really like the product and don&#x27;t go without it. Use every morning and often at night before bed.  Leaves a clean fresh feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and I look like i&#x27;m 12. What more do you want to know?</li>
            <li> Works well. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Ok, having had the whole macho image going for me hadnt worked out so well. So i said what the heck, took the plunge and bought this as well as the daily wash. &lt;br /&gt;The feeling you get after using this amazing product is just fantastic. I havent used it long enough to notice the long term effects, but from the way my face feels, it&#x27;s removed alot of gunk and dirt that i didnt actually notice. &lt;br /&gt;Leaves you fresh and tingly. On with the facial care products! Bravo!</li>
            <li> Use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed and also use the nivea for men face wash on the other days.  i&#x27;ve been using this routine for about a year now and my skin has never looked better.  after using the face scrub my face felt comletely clean and soft.  i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> sent me the wrong item, TWICE, even after returning the item once at my cost, WITH A PICTURE OF THE RIGHT ITEM.  Won&#x27;t use them again, and don&#x27;t recommend for this reason.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves the face feeling tingly. I bought this for my husband, but I use it, too!  Fresh scent and I works well as a scrub!</li>
            <li> I use this versus clinque. I use at home and combine with shave cream when shaving. I like it</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a face scrub and I am now pleasantly surprised with the results.  N&amp;iacute;vea for Men Energy has a pleasant scent with micro bead action that leaves your face smooth, moisturized, clear from dirt and grime from working out and running NYC streets. A dab on the finger, circular action on the face, rinse, and now I feel refreshed. I was afraid the scrub would feel like sand paper but instead i enjoyed how easy it was to apply and how gentle it felt. Ladies at work complemented my skin and made feel good about using it.</li>
            <li> Far too strong of a scent</li>
            <li> This face wash is the only one my husband will use. It smells great and does a great job of keeping his skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased yet through Amazon, but I love this stuff.  I use it after the shower and before shaving.  I just plain get a closer, smoother shave after using it.  I don&#x27;t know how or why...I just do.  Massage on...rinse off...shave.  You&#x27;ll want to use it any time you really want a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The Nivea Men Energy Face scrub is really effective at cleansing the face almost immediately after use. I&#x27;ve purchased this several times before because it&#x27;s a product I trust. It has beads in it that help to clean out the pores and remove dirt and oil from your skin. It does contain menthol so you will feel a chilling effect on the face but it&#x27;s nothing serious. Overall, this product works.</li>
            <li> The way to keep handsome is not to just wash with a darn soap bar and stuff....here this does what only ladies are doing....come on guys......it works for us too ! &lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating Scrubs are great for anyone...ya dudes ...us too.  gets rid of ... on your face....and really clears it up.....a great scent too....not overpowering or musky.....fresh instead. Try the facewash too...great combo.</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s scrub used to be wonderful... fresh, clean scent, just the right amount of grit and smooth texture. Then, about a year ago they changed the packaging (the one pictured here is the OLD version). Now it&#x27;s got a sickening cologne smell, and a gooey texture with large chunks of grit that feel like somebody dropped snot into a sandbox. I bought this based on the photo of the old package, hoping to snap up some of the previous formula... What I got was the new, icky stuff. If that&#x27;s what you want, go for it. Otherwise, don&#x27;t be fooled by the incorrect photo.</li>
            <li> Good product; makes your face feel fresh, but could be a little grittier... End up mixing it with St Ives for teh extra grit.</li>
            <li> Face never felt so clean and invigorating. Regular cleaning seems to take off those black dots too. Whoever invented this, a genius in facial cleaning products.&lt;BR&gt;I compliment this with Facial refreshing cleaner to keeps face invigorating and rejuvenating. Another amazing product from Nivea!</li>
            <li> Not enough grit to do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Good face scrub for men. Nice little tingly feeling after using. Good decent amount should last for some time if use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Good face scrub product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this item !</li>
            <li> This face scrub is great to use before shaving.  The scrubby balls within the soap effectively break down tough facial hair letting the razor get closer to the skin for a cleaner shave.  I&#x27;ve been using the stuff since it came out, must be about 1 years now... simply the best.  Every man should have it.</li>
            <li> This was my first pre-scrubber.  I had been getting bumps and just not getting a good shave with some of the creams and lotions in the past.  After a hot shower, rub this on, and then the cream and go for it.  You&#x27;ll be surprised the difference it makes in shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for a while - it greatly improved the quality of the shave that I get.  I get a lot less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used a similar product from Lancome (more expensive) and actually prefer Nivea better.</li>
            <li> Your face feel fresh and renew after each use.</li>
            <li> Great scent, not overly fine or overly large granules.</li>
            <li> Micro-scrubbers left my face feeling very refreshed</li>
            <li> Always a nice feel to work this through the skin.</li>
            <li> The photo shown here is NOT IN STOCK. They&#x27;re showing a pic of the old product that Nivea does not produce anymore. They have replaced it with this product ([...]), which is OK, but really a different product. I personally like the old product better, which I have been trying to find. Thought they had it here but it&#x27;s really the new product.[[ASIN:B001FB5IGY Nivea for Men Revitalizing Face Scrub, 4.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> Good stuff make my feels and looks great</li>
            <li> I am spoiled because i had jack black face scrub before and that stuff is worth the price. I tried to replace it with this and its just not even close in the way it makes my face feel and scubs all the dead skin off my face.</li>
            <li> for the first few days, I tried this product without wearing my glasses and confused it for my hemeroid cream.  I&#x27;ll tell you it works much better on my face than my arse.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!  My boyfriend has VERY sensitive skin &amp; my own is normal.  This product does beautifully on both.  I recommend this to everyone I can.  Buy it; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; to this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I am not much of a face soap type of guy.  I find that most soaps dry out my face, causing bigger issues.  So I just use any soap because I always assumed all of them were the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I bought this on a whim, because it was cheap.  Since using it, my wife has noticed my face looks nicer.  Cleaner.  I don&#x27;t really use it as a preshave, but that could be an option.  I use it in the shower to help me wake up in the morning.  The scrubbing beads and scent give me a bit of a wake up call, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount, but that goes a long way.  I will probably buy this again.  Damn you Nivea.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.</li>
            <li> Wonderful way to keep your skin fresh and looking fantastic.. Thank You Amazon and Nivea for providing this product for purchase.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with this product and I received the exact product that was advertised. I am very happy with my order of this item and will order it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this to wash and prepare my face and head to be shaved.  I have the Mr. Clean look and shave my head to the skin.  I think using this is the key to not cutting myself and not getting bumps and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 5 years now and I love it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> This face scrub feels great on the face. The beads help with exfoliation leaving your skin feeling smooth as ever.</li>
            <li> Husband with beard loves this face wash. Keeps his face blackhead/zit free.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say about how the old product was, but the new product seems great enough. You could hardly feel the little beads/micro scrubbers, and it simply leaves you feeling fresh and clean. It also gives off a sort of tingly feeling, which I guess is what they mean when they say it energizes you, but either way it does do a good job of waking you up in the morning, as well as keeping your face rather smooth. Smell however seems rather neutral, it&#x27;s neither good or bad, it just simply has a smell similar to shaving cream. Although, I guess the good thing is that the smell isn&#x27;t really overpowering.</li>
            <li> Made my husbands hface so soft love the product ...will buy again ...</li>
            <li> Really Good Product...</li>
            <li> The polyethylene beads do a much gentler job of abrading the dead skin from your face.  Crushed fruit-nuts, like apricot hulls, have sharp edges and points which can be too aggressive for more tender skin types.  The scent is pleasant and mild with a tingling sensation that comes on after one or two minutes due to an aromatic of some sort.  It too is mild to moderate if you like that sort of thing.  I don&#x27;t, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after the rinse and pat-dry to be too offensive.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this stuff since I was a kid. Cleans your face greatly. Theres little balls that seem to really clean amazingly.</li>
            <li> Great price, great scent. Not as abrasive to be considered a true face &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34; More like finely scratches your face. St. Ives is a face scrub but doesn&#x27;t come in this manly scent, which I caught my wife using/smelling in the shower....</li>
            <li> Smells good and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Pretty good scrub. It kind of gets in your nose a little. Can taste the product for a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my caveman husband, in hopes of bringing him into the wonderful world of men&#x27;s skincare. He has sensitive skin, and has like Nivea products in the past. He uses this in the shower before shaving, and has said that it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and makes it easier to shave. He also said it smells nice and it &amp;#34;wakes his face up&amp;#34; in the morning. He says he likes the grittiness to it...that it makes his face feel clean. If he&#x27;s happy with it, I&#x27;m happy with it. Will continue to sneak more Nivea mens skincare products into his daily routine ;)</li>
            <li> Does not leave my face dry, seems to clean, so there are no complaints from me. Good scent too. I would but this again.</li>
            <li> Not to grainy, cleans well and has a nice &amp;#34;wake me up&amp;#34; effect which some would say it is similar to that caused by something similar to menthol but much lighter and without noticeable odor. Quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This product used to really freshen my face and I loved the feeling of it. Now it&#x27;s not as abrading, and less refreshing. But it&#x27;s still the best I&#x27;ve found to get the oils off my nose and from around my eyes. (And DON&#x27;T get it in your eyes!!!)</li>
            <li> Nice bottle, face feels fresh after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Nivea products before (aftershave balm), so was expecting a good quality product here as well. This was OK, better than OK maybe, but I was a little surprised there wasn&#x27;t more &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; or exfoliating substance in what is labeled a &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34; The almost-menthol scent and refreshing feeling was as good or better than the scrubbing aspects. In any case, it is what it is.</li>
            <li> allays used this brand. like the amount of the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; particles- not so much to irritate the face, but just so to feel like it is properly scrubbing the skin.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great all-around face scrub. Nice refreshing feel! I just use it while in the shower then I&#x27;m all prepped for a shave.</li>
            <li> There is a big difference between men&#x27;s face wash vs regular or womens. The men&#x27;s face wash like this one are more suitable for a hairy face and smell more manly. I love all Nivea products - they are generally all good quality and this one is one of them. After looking for face wash that&#x27;s available via subscribe and save option, I settled on this one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> have used it and very good quality and very good feeling after that. Not so dry and the oil is gone.</li>
            <li> Liked it, bought another.</li>
            <li> Perfect quality.. As expected..</li>
            <li> Perfect for maintaining clean fair skin.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin</li>
            <li> The menthol in the product woke my face up in the morning. It&#x27;s slightly more drying that other men&#x27;s face scrubs that I have used. I may go back to it in the future but do not miss the product in the meantime.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work really well.  I often use it in lieu of shaving gel and it fels even better than when I use the Gel.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a week to scrub my face and my face skin looks healthier and better.  Also feels good when applying too and it looks like it will last for a long long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching stores for months and can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore. My BF loves how exfoliating and the clean feel he gets after using this. I should probably order in stock bc with out this he uses normal body soap! ugh</li>
            <li> Just OK. Nothing special</li>
            <li> I use all of the NIVEA Men products. This is a great face scrub it leaves your face nice and refreshed. Great for the skin also.</li>
            <li> I had this item as a subscribe and save, but never received it even though it says it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Cheap, effective, and the small bottle lasts a long time. Don&#x27;t let the size fool you like it did me. I bought my first bottle a few months ago, and I&#x27;m still using it! It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but after using it a while, it has helped remove blackheads and smoothen my face.</li>
            <li> Nivea for men Energy Facial Scrub is a great product to eliminate oily skin and assist in eliminating facial blemishes.  Consistent regular use will improve skin tone and repair oil created surface blemishes.  A top quality product that should be in every man&#x27;s daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Does a decent job of exfoliation. Got this for ingrown hairs over neck area. Nothing is perfect for this problem, but this is excellent as part of a shaving regimen.</li>
            <li> This was a gift I bought my boyfriend.  We couldn&#x27;t find this in the store and I was able to find it on amazon and surprise him.  We both use this and love how it feels.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as some sand-based scrubs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Great for pre shave. has little tiny beads in it like sand but is soft. Def helps exfoliate</li>
            <li> My husband loves this face wash.</li>
            <li> This product (Energizing) has been discontinued by Nivea. They have replaced it with \\&quot;Revitalizing\\&quot; Face Scrub. I much prefer the Energizing. I ordered this but was sent the Revitalizing instead. I asked for a refund label and mailing address, which the supplier said they would provide, but have not heard back (three weeks now).</li>
            <li> Got my bf started on this because he was using soap on his face now it&#x27;s the only thing he will use</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoy this product Nivea is the best we buy all of it&#x27;s products and this one is the best it gives my husband that smooth face and that glow that he look for every morning</li>
            <li> I love the Energy Face Scrub, its refreshing &amp;..  energizing:) Just be aware that there is also one called &amp;#34;revitalizing that share the same bar code #, but I found the &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; has an extra kick that I found lacking in the revitalizing. Both have menthol so its got to be another ingredient I don&#x27;t recognize, that give you that tingling feel.</li>
            <li> FEELS GREAT AFTER USING. &lt;BR&gt;mAKES FACE LOOK VERY HEALTHY</li>
            <li> This scrub was wonderful as a cleaner and exfoliation product. I have a bit more sensitive skin though, and so I felt it dried out my face a bit. It has more of a cologne smell, which many women may not find appealing when applied to their own skin. All-in-all, it was a good product, especially for the amazing price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. a little bit goes a long way so you dont have to use much. NOt too abrasive just the right amount. keeps the oil down and doesnt dry out my face either. good price on amazon.</li>
            <li> Great scrub! I bought this for the men in my house and used it once or twice when I ran out of mine!</li>
            <li> great product.&lt;br /&gt;works !</li>
            <li> Been using this Face Scrub for a couple months. If you&#x27;re using this more than 2-3 times a week than it can dry your skin if you&#x27;re not using lotion. I use this 1-2 times a week and lotion after.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband he has oily skin he doesnt like using face products but this one makes him feel refresh and dont cause break out.</li>
            <li> Nivea products always seem live up to their standard of facial care. The Nivea Men Face Scrub has a great scent, not to strong and good on sensitive skin. The scrub is not too harsh to the touch. It is Invigorating! The face scrub leaves your face nice and smooth after just one use. It entices you to want to wash your face, morning, noon and night!</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; LOVES this product. Nivea makes an awesome unisex product. Never a disappoint from them. Will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Works well but supposedly the microbeads build up in the water supply. Several states have banned them from store shelves.</li>
            <li> Very good choice and excellent experience! I will choose it again if I have the opportunity and the same supply.</li>
            <li> Awesome for pre-shave and removing some blackheads.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth. Use twice daily.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling nice and clean.  I love the grit because it gets down in the pores and cleans.</li>
            <li> I have used this face scrub several times over the last couple of years and I think it works well. It is very gritty, as other reviewers have mentioned, but it leaves me with a clean feeling. Overall it still seems to be a gentle formula, though I&#x27;m not sure I would use it daily (I use it 2 to 3 times per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: This scrub contains polyethylene (plastic) beads, which have come under scrutiny in recent months for their impact on sewer systems and rivers. If you&#x27;re looking for a more environmentally-friendly product, check out the face scrub from Bulldog Natural Skincare.</li>
            <li> not enough scrubbies in there. basically just a face wash.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anybody. I used it once and my face got completely dry, red, and started peeling. This lasted for about 3 days, and that was after using it the first (and last) time.</li>
            <li> Really good cleanser.  Do not listen to the one bad review-- sounds like he may have had an allergic reaction.  This stuff is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Exactly as described, leaves my face feeling fresh and VERY clean!  Perfect before shaving. Perfect transaction.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really cleanses my face and feels fresh</li>
            <li> Awesome pre-shave scrub for moisturizing your beard/Wiskers for a super smooth shave! Smells great.</li>
            <li> Nivea &#x27;makes no junk&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, and so far, it&#x27;s worked really well! I like that it leaves your face feeling clean and smooth, which is something that I haven&#x27;t been able to find in any other products I&#x27;ve tried. As you use the product, the scrubbing beads do not dissolve, allowing for a  thorough exfoliation. While others may prefer using this product every other day or when shaving, I have been using it once daily in the shower and also before shaving. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation or breakouts since using this product (keep in mind that I can sometimes break out even after using a product 2-3 times). I recommend this product for anyone looking for a pre-shave scrub AND deep cleanser, especially during these summer months!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want and expected. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It seems Nivea has chosen to cut corners with this new formulation.  Provitamin B5 is absent and I also noticed a glaring lack of exfoliating beads.  Please, please bring back the old \\&quot;Engergizing\\&quot; formulation!  If you are looking for a reasonably priced cleanser this is for you because it&#x27;s certainly not a scrub anymore.</li>
            <li> Canont clean well. Though you feel you face seems clean after you washed your face, but actually it just make you skin too dry....</li>
            <li> Used to use Kyoku for Men, but that became entirely too expensive.  I love this stuff because it is in my price range and had the little beads to help me exfoliate and truly clean my skin.  I supplement this wash with cetaphil and I am good to go.  Other face washes without the beads never get a deep clean.  I am sold until proven otherwise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soupy and I&#x27;d prefer slightly larger grit. Its a little too gentle. I like the smell and the energizing aspect of it is awesome, though I wish it had a little more of the refreshing stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my face is a little softer since using it, but that may very well be a placebo effect. Worth the money, and Amazon is the place to get it.</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub. I have oily skin and i have nasty allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my face smooth, and free of allergens and black heads.</li>
            <li> Why does everything have to have sand in it?  Well, it&#x27;s not sand but close enough.</li>
            <li> This is a new picture of the bottle as of February 2015. Look at the customer images.</li>
            <li> I wanted to balance out today&#x27;s 1-star review of the face wash with a positive one for this scrub, because I am still using this product after 14 years. Nivea face wash and scrub products were excellent until the formulas of both were changed a few years back. Although the formula change (specifically the addition of menthol) ruined the face wash for me, this scrub did not suffer as badly. Although I do feel that the formula was similarly cheapened, I continue to use it because it works similarly to the original, and that was the best value scrub I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m also open to suggestions!</li>
            <li> Good Product, Good Price, Good Service</li>
            <li> One of the best face scrubs I&#x27;ve found. It can be harsh on your skin if your not gentle using it, Smells good and always follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Invigorating and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I love how clean my face feels afterwords.</li>
            <li> I am a LOW maintenance guy, but this is simple and easy.</li>
            <li> This face scrub is a necessary part of my daily routine; however, my use might be slightly non-standard.  I use this scrub on my scalp before I shave my head in order to scrub off small bumps and slightly tighten the skin.  By doing this, it makes shaving go much more smoothly, with limited nicks.  I have tried other brands of the same type of thing, but for me, the Nivea seems to work best.</li>
            <li> Purchased for boyfriend who always used my face washes in the shower. He said it was all right... he likes the face wash with the sand like scrubs best. I like this one. It smells good and has some scrubs beads but is still gentle. It came fast and was in good shape (not leaking) upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. The exfoliating beads are on point. It makes your skin feel clean which may sound strange but once you use it you&#x27;ll understand. BEWARE this face wash may leave your skin excessively dry after use so be sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li> It shows the picture of the old formula but you get the newer, less effective formula. They need to update the picture</li>
            <li> As far as facial scrubs go, this is a fairly abrasive, deep cleaning one; that is a good thing, but if you have very sensitive skin you might want to use it sparingly. Also I recommend you use this while showering. As with most scrubs it can be tough to rinse away all the grit/beads with only a sink.</li>
            <li> Great for pre shaving too!</li>
