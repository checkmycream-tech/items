            <li>This is a great product and a smoking deal for 4 of them!  </li>
            <li>This product USED TO BE the best face scrub out there.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>And it smells great.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>this is great for my oily skin</li>
            <li>The smell is also very nice.</li>
            <li>The combination of the ex-foliate and astringent makes for a perfect smooth shave!</li>
            <li>The scent is also pleasant in this face scrub.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and it cleans skin; just not as well as the product it was designed to replace.</li>
            <li>Most of the stuff in this segment has some kind of plant-based ingredient list that smells delicious (as opposed to like solvent).</li>
            <li>I bought this because I like a good scrub to help cleanse the pores.</li>
            <li>That may be all that it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li>Good product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This one is good.</li>
            <li>so now I&#x27;m good for a While and plan on doing it again ,so Ilove ,love,love it</li>
            <li>Have tried many others but this one will always win out.</li>
            <li>Meant as a toner pre-shaving, effectively cleans the face.</li>
            <li>Its great to my face clean every day and to have all that I need when I want it</li>
            <li>I would give the Energizing formula 5 stars, the new formula is 3 at best.</li>
            <li>Nivea Energizing Face Scrub for Men is by far the best face cleaning product on the market.</li>
            <li>and i feel it is the best product for direct cleaning and scrubbing.</li>
            <li>No idea why Nivea decided to completely revamp the formula for what seemed like a very successful product</li>
            <li>you use this, make sure to get some good lotion too because keeping your skin moist is just as important.</li>
            <li>Your face feels very smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>A huge plus!</li>
            <li>I guess we&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li>I rather enjoy using it to keep me looking youthful!</li>
            <li>I noticed at the top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for exfoliating your face and leaving it smell fresh and energized.     </li>
            <li>(I think it&#x27;s better used in a shower</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>as I think using it more would not serve the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>This is the best (course) facial scrub I have used.</li>
            <li>I try not to be a metro, but damn I love this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of guy who wears flannel, chops wood, eats meat n potatoes, and has many leather bound books.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face nice and smooth after a shave.</li>
            <li>love this product, helps a ton with acne and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I work on my cars and bikes and have been able to get oil/grease/gas off my head no problem.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Overall this is the best face wash that I have found for the price.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent face scrub with noticeable grit to scrub off old skin and clean your pores.</li>
            <li>great product and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Good stuff and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Both clean, this just cleans better.</li>
            <li>Just as easy to use in the shower as with a sink, it applies easily and rinses off just as easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily washed out but if you&#x27;re not expecting it, there may be another surprize.</li>
            <li>I used this product over a year ago and I can already tell the difference in how clean my face is and my skin tone is better.</li>
            <li>This scrub probably wouldn&#x27;t be good for someone with very sensitive skin, it will probably irritate it a lot.</li>
            <li>That was a fantastic product that did wonders for my face.      </li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling smooth and helps with razor bumps.</li>
            <li>As to whether it does anything, who can say, but I do enjoy how my face feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>such great face wash, it has literally stopped all of my pimples</li>
            <li>It really does deep-clean and most guys like myself need something better than just using a bar of soap on the face which clogs the pores.  </li>
            <li>A good scrub and leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>(Another reason I prefer it in the shower, eyes can easily and quickly be cleaned.)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty confident it was just a result of the cleaning ingredients doing their job.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean when used in combination with the Nivea face wash.  </li>
            <li>The granules embedded in the scrub make your face feel really clean and invigorated.</li>
            <li>It smells great, it cleans well, and it has really helped to clear my face up.</li>
            <li>I would get ingrown hairs, and the product seems to keep them under control, as well as keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li>The Nivea Energizing Face Scrub is not only great for an active person like me but it also is great for a morning face cleanser.</li>
            <li>the air here in Kabul is full of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m able to use it and see fast results.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild, manly scent too.  </li>
            <li>The Energizing Scrub is too smooth and \\&quot;gel-like\\&quot; in its consistency, and the abrasives are not as palpable and effective.</li>
            <li>Like all other Nivea German original product very good!!!</li>
            <li>I really like that the scrubbing particles in this product are fine and concentrated.  </li>
            <li>That said, does a great job getting the grease and dead skin off of your face.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing ingredients are particularly useful if your life style creates dirt or oil on your skin.</li>
            <li>but I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m right as rain.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want my friends to comment on how pretty and smooth my face looks around the campfire eating beans n stuff.</li>
            <li>Unlike some products whose efficacy is seen over time, this works the first time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave many reviews; however I deemed it necessary for this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first use, I could feel my face breathing</li>
            <li>You can definitely feel the granules in this scrub when you use it, and it does feel refreshing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rate much, but when I do, I prefer this stuff!</li>
            <li>The scrub is moderately beaded to help exfoliate, but there are better options out there if you&#x27;re trying to fight ingrowns.</li>
            <li>I gotta admit I was questioning my manliness when I first look into this product.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of face scrubs that could not stand up to the test of removing oils, dirt and grease form the skin and deep pores (and keep it off!!).</li>
            <li>Cleans very well, leaves your face without a trace of oil after you scrub for a a few good seconds.    </li>
            <li>This will dry out your skin afterward, so make sure you apply a non pore clogging moisturizer afterward.    </li>
            <li>One thing to remember is that there is a certain amount of grit in this that can get in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I wish it left my face feeling more tingly, but maybe that will be in the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>I had been looking at switching over to a new shaving regimen thinking my Fusion and gel were not the right combo.</li>
            <li>I use my hand to apply it and my finger tips to really get into the depressions around my nose and those cavities that develop as we age.</li>
            <li>This face scrub works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>The price is really what caught my attention here.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>which was the original formula for the Nivea facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>I have tried using many other companies and all causes rashes over my face.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean, cheaper than the store especially when combined with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea products for years, and it keeps my skin properly moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>I try and use it for special occasions only though.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s silly for Nivea to introduce another gel-like scrub into its line-up, since it already offers the excellent Oil Control and Sensitive Skin scrubs.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t help you get a better shave and much less</li>
            <li>and I use this mainly in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the cool sensation that stays behind after I wash my face and the exfoliation beads in this scrub really pulls away dirt, makeup and sweat.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this face wash because my clean and clear face wash was running low</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way best face soap for men gentle for everyday use too does no irritate my face</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s not the best product either.    </li>
            <li>I constantly have dried skin and this does an excellent job of removing the dead skin while cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face clean, but does dry it out a bit</li>
            <li>I suggest using it in small quantities as it is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>I hate using strong fragrance creams, while this is not fragrance free, I like the very light fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>I am not the type to clean my face with anything other than when I shower in the morning, using normal bath soap.  </li>
            <li>and I was noticing more pimples than usual on my forehead and temples.</li>
            <li>I miss the clean feeling of other brand i used to use.</li>
            <li>so a clear complexion.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive but it doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching all over for the old formula</li>
            <li>When you rub it into your skin it takes off all the old skin, cleans your pores, and removes oil.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend getting it at Walmart though, much much cheaper</li>
            <li>With only a few reviews about this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to purchase it</li>
            <li>Also, I recommend you do not use this more than once a day, because you WILL dry out your skin and make it very flaky, and I learned that the hard way.    </li>
            <li>The new smell is nauseating and they added menthol to further irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>No other scrub even comes close.</li>
            <li>There are no other face scrubs that truly have the grit that this one does.</li>
            <li>Oil is still necessary for the skin; some advice:    I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>The scrub is very course and rough but that&#x27;s what makes it work so well.</li>
            <li>B00005375C Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal, 8</li>
            <li>Hope.they stop trying to cut cost at the consumers expense and bring back the old scrub.</li>
            <li>It being a scrub, it has some course particles in it, but not rough at all.  </li>
            <li>Its small rough particles give a very fresh feeling after use.</li>
            <li>This can be good and bad.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> which was the original formula for the Nivea facial scrub.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using many other companies and all causes rashes over my face.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean, cheaper than the store especially when combined with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea products for years, and it keeps my skin properly moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> I try and use it for special occasions only though.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s silly for Nivea to introduce another gel-like scrub into its line-up, since it already offers the excellent Oil Control and Sensitive Skin scrubs.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t help you get a better shave and much less</li>
            <li> and I use this mainly in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the cool sensation that stays behind after I wash my face and the exfoliation beads in this scrub really pulls away dirt, makeup and sweat.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this face wash because my clean and clear face wash was running low</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way best face soap for men gentle for everyday use too does no irritate my face</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s not the best product either.    </li>
            <li> I constantly have dried skin and this does an excellent job of removing the dead skin while cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face clean, but does dry it out a bit</li>
            <li> I suggest using it in small quantities as it is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> I hate using strong fragrance creams, while this is not fragrance free, I like the very light fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> I am not the type to clean my face with anything other than when I shower in the morning, using normal bath soap.  </li>
            <li> and I was noticing more pimples than usual on my forehead and temples.</li>
            <li> I miss the clean feeling of other brand i used to use.</li>
            <li> so a clear complexion.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive but it doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching all over for the old formula</li>
            <li> When you rub it into your skin it takes off all the old skin, cleans your pores, and removes oil.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend getting it at Walmart though, much much cheaper</li>
            <li> With only a few reviews about this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to purchase it</li>
            <li> Also, I recommend you do not use this more than once a day, because you WILL dry out your skin and make it very flaky, and I learned that the hard way.    </li>
            <li> The new smell is nauseating and they added menthol to further irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> No other scrub even comes close.</li>
            <li> There are no other face scrubs that truly have the grit that this one does.</li>
            <li> Oil is still necessary for the skin; some advice:    I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> The scrub is very course and rough but that&#x27;s what makes it work so well.</li>
            <li> B00005375C Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal, 8</li>
            <li> Hope.they stop trying to cut cost at the consumers expense and bring back the old scrub.</li>
            <li> It being a scrub, it has some course particles in it, but not rough at all.  </li>
            <li> Its small rough particles give a very fresh feeling after use.</li>
            <li> This can be good and bad.    </li>
            <li> If you already have dry skin, I am not sure this is the right face wash for you.</li>
            <li> The 4.4 oz tube is pretty sizable and they recommend you use it 2-3 times a week only, so each tube should last a couple of months at least.</li>
            <li> The old formulation would have really small micro beads which would open up all my pores on my acne prone nose and my face in general</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gritty and unless you really rinse your face off (or use it in the shower) it leaves little specks of sand behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on multiple occasions and my face doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out from this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how dry it leaves my skin</li>
            <li> After I used the Nivea Face Scrub for the first time (this past week), I felt a slight burning sensation to my face after I left the shower.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the shower the other day prior to shaving and can say that I have not had that close of a shave in a LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I cleans extremely well, including pores, and leaves my face tingling as if I had just had a facial.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be the same scent that they use in some other Nivea for men products.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t harsh like the apricot scrub my wife has bought but does make you feel like you did some deep cleaning when used.    </li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, however, I am noticing results already.</li>
            <li> Certainly not for cleaning your pores to help prevent pimples.</li>
            <li> You need very little applied to your face, and you don&#x27;t need to scrub your face hard, or rub it into your skin too much.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews on this and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I never used any face scrub product before, so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I use other Nivea creams, so I went ahead with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately Nivea discontinued that product and replaced it with the \\&quot;revitalizing\\&quot; formula which is 50% different ingredients and leaves me with skin that isn&#x27;t nearly as clear.    </li>
            <li> Black heads are gone, skin smooths, pores open and all that in under a very few minutes.</li>
            <li> Pack of 4 because the other half keeps stealing them.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s almost a little too harsh to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Their new formulation sucks to say the least.</li>
            <li> Moreover, he always feels his face is not clean after use the scrub.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub about three times a week, just put a little in my hand and rub it over my face.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it after my little adventure here is done.</li>
            <li> I used it for little over a week now</li>
            <li> I bought something that looked just like it, but without the green \\&quot;Pre</li>
            <li> So I think the scrub not fit for everyone.</li>
            <li> It worked well to scrub away dirt and dead skin.</li>
            <li> They are equivalent to the texture of harsh sand grit on sand paper.</li>
            <li> I think it would be hard on my face if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure how people have a hard time rinsing this off of their face...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have really coarse thick hair on my face and have lately been suffering from black-heads on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower if it is that hard to</li>
            <li> ; that&#x27;s in it, but leaves a little residue behind.  </li>
            <li> Smell is hard to describe, but it is very subtle, hardly noticeable.    </li>
            <li> He complained that it was difficult to be rinsed thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Nivea Energizing Face Scrub is inferior, in my opinion, to the product it replaced.</li>
            <li> Smells like chemistry - which is sad.</li>
            <li> but it is nearly impossible to get.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too bad</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The guys in the family say that it works well and makes their skin smoother.  I guess we&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a Subscribe &amp; Save plan with this. I rather enjoy using it to keep me looking youthful!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  Keeps my face clean when used in combination with the Nivea face wash.  This stuff isn&#x27;t harsh like the apricot scrub my wife has bought but does make you feel like you did some deep cleaning when used.    Keeps my face clean, cheaper than the store especially when combined with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> took forever to come, and when it did one tube  was opened and leaked all over the others.  I will think twice about this next time .</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like a good scrub to help cleanse the pores. It does feel invigorating, but after using about 2 or 3 tubes of this, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I still get the occasional pimples and after using it daily, I wonder why. I noticed at the top it says Pre Shave. That may be all that it&#x27;s good for. Certainly not for cleaning your pores to help prevent pimples. Not for me anyway. I know this isn&#x27;t labeled as clear-pore treatment for acne, but one would assume that a scrub would do just that.</li>
            <li> Nivea Energizing Face Scrub for Men is by far the best face cleaning product on the market. The granules embedded in the scrub make your face feel really clean and invigorated. And it smells great. No other scrub even comes close.</li>
            <li> I use these to shave with!  The combination of the ex-foliate and astringent makes for a perfect smooth shave!</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s not the best product either.    It&#x27;s good for exfoliating your face and leaving it smell fresh and energized.     Smell is hard to describe, but it is very subtle, hardly noticeable.    Cleans very well, leaves your face without a trace of oil after you scrub for a a few good seconds.    This can be good and bad.    Oil is still necessary for the skin; some advice:    I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.    This will dry out your skin afterward, so make sure you apply a non pore clogging moisturizer afterward.    Also, I recommend you do not use this more than once a day, because you WILL dry out your skin and make it very flaky, and I learned that the hard way.    But if that does happen, just use a non pore clogging moisturizer and your face should heal over time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent face scrub with noticeable grit to scrub off old skin and clean your pores. I use this scrub about three times a week, just put a little in my hand and rub it over my face. My skin is fairly sensitive but it doesn&#x27;t irritate it. Good stuff and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> ....what you now use is bar soap. Both clean, this just cleans better. The scrubbing ingredients are particularly useful if your life style creates dirt or oil on your skin. The strength of agents to remove that in a regular bar of soap would damage the skin whereas the scrubbing elements present here do the same thing without causing harm to the skin. Just as easy to use in the shower as with a sink, it applies easily and rinses off just as easily. (I think it&#x27;s better used in a shower but that&#x27;s personal preference.) One thing to remember is that there is a certain amount of grit in this that can get in your eyes. It&#x27;s easily washed out but if you&#x27;re not expecting it, there may be another surprize. Also when using this, I&#x27;d take out any lenses so that the cleansing agents can&#x27;t get under them.  (Another reason I prefer it in the shower, eyes can easily and quickly be cleaned.) Unlike some products whose efficacy is seen over time, this works the first time. Black heads are gone, skin smooths, pores open and all that in under a very few minutes. This isn&#x27;t a mask to be left on, it&#x27;s a replacement for soap. I use my hand to apply it and my finger tips to really get into the depressions around my nose and those cavities that develop as we age. And, by the way, using this adds flexibility that relaxes the furrows of age.This is a product specific made for men and addresses issues germane to men. What more can I say? Buy it. Try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> With only a few reviews about this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to purchase it but I made the right choice.  You need very little applied to your face, and you don&#x27;t need to scrub your face hard, or rub it into your skin too much.  It really does deep-clean and most guys like myself need something better than just using a bar of soap on the face which clogs the pores.  After I used the Nivea Face Scrub for the first time (this past week), I felt a slight burning sensation to my face after I left the shower.  However, there was no visual burning or redness on my face so I&#x27;m pretty confident it was just a result of the cleaning ingredients doing their job.  I plan on using this product 2-3 times a week as I think using it more would not serve the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff.  I bought something that looked just like it, but without the green \\&quot;Pre-Shave\\&quot; label on the front and he swore it wasn&#x27;t the same.  So, I buy on Amazon so that I don&#x27;t drive all over hoping to find it!  Saves money with the subscribe and save too!</li>
            <li> I bought the face scrub for my husband but he hates it. He complained that it was difficult to be rinsed thoroughly. Moreover, he always feels his face is not clean after use the scrub. So I think the scrub not fit for everyone.</li>
            <li> I noticed that several of the reviews are for the Nivea \\&quot;Energizing\\&quot; which was the original formula for the Nivea facial scrub.  That was a fantastic product that did wonders for my face.      Unfortunately Nivea discontinued that product and replaced it with the \\&quot;revitalizing\\&quot; formula which is 50% different ingredients and leaves me with skin that isn&#x27;t nearly as clear.    I&#x27;ve been searching all over for the old formula but it is nearly impossible to get.  No idea why Nivea decided to completely revamp the formula for what seemed like a very successful product but my guess is that they decided to replace the ingredients with cheaper alternatives.      I would give the Energizing formula 5 stars, the new formula is 3 at best.</li>
            <li> There are no other face scrubs that truly have the grit that this one does. Have tried many others but this one will always win out. Pack of 4 because the other half keeps stealing them.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I am not the type to clean my face with anything other than when I shower in the morning, using normal bath soap.  I am stationed in Afghanistan and the air here in Kabul is full of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.  I ordered the stuff to try to minimize what the air and dirt was doing to my face.  I cleans extremely well, including pores, and leaves my face tingling as if I had just had a facial.  I look forward to cleaning my face with the Nivea 3 times a week.  I will continue using it after my little adventure here is done.</li>
            <li> This face scrub works very well. The scrub is very course and rough but that&#x27;s what makes it work so well. When you rub it into your skin it takes off all the old skin, cleans your pores, and removes oil. Your face feels very smooth after using it. This scrub probably wouldn&#x27;t be good for someone with very sensitive skin, it will probably irritate it a lot. The scent is also pleasant in this face scrub. It seems to be the same scent that they use in some other Nivea for men products.  I&#x27;ve used this on multiple occasions and my face doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out from this product. A huge plus! Although I do have lotion on deck in case it does happen (Men, get \\&quot;[[ASIN:B00005375C Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal, 8 oz]]\\&quot; trust me, I never believed in a man using lotion until I tried this. No Girly smells here and it absorbs into your skin INSTANTLY).     I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave many reviews; however I deemed it necessary for this product.&lt;br /&gt;After my first use, I could feel my face breathing and my pod opened up. It definitely cleaned my face and I will continue to utilize the product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at Wal-Mart for $7 so you might want to check that out before you pay $20 here</li>
            <li> A good scrub and leaves your face soft and smooth. I use this product daily.</li>
            <li> I really like that the scrubbing particles in this product are fine and concentrated.  It has a mild, manly scent too.  I wish it left my face feeling more tingly, but maybe that will be in the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> Good product that gets the job done. Leaves your face feeling smooth and helps with razor bumps. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Nivea&#x27;s \\&quot;Revitalizing\\&quot; Face Scrub replaces the now-discontinued \\&quot;Energizing\\&quot; Face Scrub. Both products feature tiny abrasive particles that help remove dirt and unclog pores. Unfortunately, Nivea Energizing Face Scrub is inferior, in my opinion, to the product it replaced. The substantial abrasive, \\&quot;sandy\\&quot; feel of the Energizing scrub was the reason I used it. It worked well to scrub away dirt and dead skin. The Energizing Scrub is too smooth and \\&quot;gel-like\\&quot; in its consistency, and the abrasives are not as palpable and effective. I think it&#x27;s silly for Nivea to introduce another gel-like scrub into its line-up, since it already offers the excellent Oil Control and Sensitive Skin scrubs. The scent is pleasant, and it cleans skin; just not as well as the product it was designed to replace.</li>
            <li> This is the best (course) facial scrub I have used. It is course and does &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; feel like sand paper on your face, but this is what I want. I constantly have dried skin and this does an excellent job of removing the dead skin while cleaning my face. The smell is also very nice.</li>
            <li> this is great for my oily skin and i&#x27;m able to use it and see fast results.  different things have left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me with mixed results  but this one truly works  and i feel it is the best product for direct cleaning and scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this face wash because my clean and clear face wash was running low and I was noticing more pimples than usual on my forehead and temples. I really like this face wash. It smells great, it cleans well, and it has really helped to clear my face up. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s almost a little too harsh to use everyday. It&#x27;s pretty gritty and unless you really rinse your face off (or use it in the shower) it leaves little specks of sand behind. I think it would be hard on my face if I used it everyday. The container does say to use only 3-4 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the granules in this scrub when you use it, and it does feel refreshing. I suggest using it in small quantities as it is pretty strong.  As to whether it does anything, who can say, but I do enjoy how my face feels after using it.  The 4.4 oz tube is pretty sizable and they recommend you use it 2-3 times a week only, so each tube should last a couple of months at least.</li>
            <li> such great face wash, it has literally stopped all of my pimples</li>
            <li> This is the best scrubber out there.  I try not to be a metro, but damn I love this.  I don&#x27;t rate much, but when I do, I prefer this stuff!</li>
            <li> The price is really what caught my attention here. Amazon always has excellent bulk prices! The scrub is moderately beaded to help exfoliate, but there are better options out there if you&#x27;re trying to fight ingrowns. The tubes are moderately sized and I go through 1 every 2 months or so. Probably going to try something different next time though.</li>
            <li> Like all other Nivea German original product very good!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product over a year ago and I can already tell the difference in how clean my face is and my skin tone is better. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how dry it leaves my skin and I use this mainly in the shower. I have to lotion my face and hands often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this, make sure to get some good lotion too because keeping your skin moist is just as important.</li>
            <li> I have tried using many other companies and all causes rashes over my face. This one is good. Its small rough particles give a very fresh feeling after use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well. I have seen a change in my complextion. I would get ingrown hairs, and the product seems to keep them under control, as well as keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li> I gotta admit I was questioning my manliness when I first look into this product. I&#x27;m the type of guy who wears flannel, chops wood, eats meat n potatoes, and has many leather bound books. Putting my reservations aside I tried this product as directed and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It leaves my face nice and smooth after a shave. I try and use it for special occasions only though. I really don&#x27;t want my friends to comment on how pretty and smooth my face looks around the campfire eating beans n stuff.</li>
            <li> Its great to my face clean every day and to have all that I need when I want it so now I&#x27;m good for a While and plan on doing it again ,so Ilove ,love,love it</li>
            <li> Meant as a toner pre-shaving, effectively cleans the face. Smells like chemistry - which is sad. Most of the stuff in this segment has some kind of plant-based ingredient list that smells delicious (as opposed to like solvent). That said, does a great job getting the grease and dead skin off of your face. Whereas I can&#x27;t specifically complain about it - I&#x27;m going to try something else next time around.</li>
            <li> The Nivea Energizing Face Scrub is not only great for an active person like me but it also is great for a morning face cleanser. I have used many types of face scrubs that could not stand up to the test of removing oils, dirt and grease form the skin and deep pores (and keep it off!!). I run, swim, personal train, work in a kitchen all day, and while attending night school. This stuff has no problem getting trough the oils my face has at the end of the day as well as the morning. Thank you Nivea!</li>
            <li> love this product, helps a ton with acne and ingrown hairs. definitely recommend getting it at Walmart though, much much cheaper</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a smoking deal for 4 of them!  I would recommend this to any guy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have really coarse thick hair on my face and have lately been suffering from black-heads on my forehead. Nothing too bad but I have noticed 4-5 a week that I did not used to get. I have only used this a few times, however, I am noticing results already. I used it in the shower the other day prior to shaving and can say that I have not had that close of a shave in a LONG TIME. I had been looking at switching over to a new shaving regimen thinking my Fusion and gel were not the right combo. Add this baby to the mix and I&#x27;m right as rain. Not sure how people have a hard time rinsing this off of their face...I work on my cars and bikes and have been able to get oil/grease/gas off my head no problem. Use it in the shower if it is that hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back if I start noticing any issues with the product.</li>
            <li> SAVE MONEY ON FACE WASH!! SCRUBBLY GOO FOR ZITS WOO!! 5*****</li>
            <li> great product and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way best face soap for men gentle for everyday use too does no irritate my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea products for years, and it keeps my skin properly moisturized and clean. Highly Recommend! Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. I purchase this for my boyfriend and ended up keeping one for myself. I love the cool sensation that stays behind after I wash my face and the exfoliation beads in this scrub really pulls away dirt, makeup and sweat.</li>
            <li> This product USED TO BE the best face scrub out there. The old formulation would have really small micro beads which would open up all my pores on my acne prone nose and my face in general and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Their new formulation sucks to say the least. The microbeads have nothing micro about them. They are equivalent to the texture of harsh sand grit on sand paper. The new smell is nauseating and they added menthol to further irritate my skin. Bottom line get something else. This won&#x27;t help you get a better shave and much less so a clear complexion. Hope.they stop trying to cut cost at the consumers expense and bring back the old scrub.</li>
            <li> I prefer Neutrogena.  I read other reviews on this and gave it a try.  I like the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; that&#x27;s in it, but leaves a little residue behind.  I miss the clean feeling of other brand i used to use.</li>
            <li> I never used any face scrub product before, so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other brand.  I use other Nivea creams, so I went ahead with this purchase.  I used it for little over a week now and I feel rejuvenated and my face feels smoother every time I use it.  It being a scrub, it has some course particles in it, but not rough at all.  I hate using strong fragrance creams, while this is not fragrance free, I like the very light fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> Overall this is the best face wash that I have found for the price. It keeps my face clean, but does dry it out a bit so I do need to follow up with a moisturizer. If you already have dry skin, I am not sure this is the right face wash for you.</li>
