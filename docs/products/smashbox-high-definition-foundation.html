            <li>It was a great  product</li>
            <li>Good coverage.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This was some cheap feeling, streaky, orangey, cakey, not even as good as drug store brand foundation in a smashbox bottle.</li>
            <li>Authentic product.</li>
            <li>and I would buy more</li>
            <li>Love smash box products</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s ok......</li>
            <li>Best service ever thanks so much</li>
            <li>the product is good thanks</li>
            <li>I love Smashbox products and this foundation doesn&#x27;t disappoint, amazing full dewy coverage and lasts me most of the day with a decent primer underneath.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Smashbox cosmetics and I have used this before.</li>
            <li>This is not the rich smooth creamy foundation from Smashbox but some yucky imposter.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it is a knock off of smash box foundation.</li>
            <li>Full</li>
            <li>purchased on a special just love the coverage and the natural feel.</li>
            <li>I am taking a spot of and blending with my summer tinted moisturizer for more natural color w coverage.</li>
            <li>It was so watery and not even the right color as described in its description of the product.</li>
            <li>Most definitely returning!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 3 years and it is the only one I will ever use.  </li>
            <li>but this is old and doesn&#x27;t work as we as the products available today.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it was really runny.</li>
            <li>I tried shaking it up and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>smashbox found a new customer.</li>
            <li>It was much darker than the actual picture.</li>
            <li>and I 51 years old.</li>
            <li>Old, not shade described.</li>
            <li>That said, this was NOT at all like what I have purchased directly from Smashbox, Ulta, or Sephora.</li>
            <li>I loved this foundation; unfortunately, it was discontinued 2 years ago and replaced with the halo liquid.</li>
            <li>And the foundation actually evens out all the different tones in your skin--providing you get the right shade.</li>
            <li>First off when I opened this package the bottle was only half full, possibly used?!</li>
            <li>Generally when a shade comes in &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, you assume it&#x27;s going to be a paler shade.</li>
            <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t work correctly and the foundation is all lumpy inside the bottle with clear liquid separating from the actual foundation.</li>
            <li>I was thinking that the L was suppose to mean light</li>
            <li>it was so Tick really dark don&#x27;t even think is real  </li>
            <li>The foundation was super watery, and the bottle I received was half empty.</li>

            <li> I am of medium complexion and order the shade L4 and the foundation was EXTREMELY dark.</li>
            <li> It is too dark for me</li>
            <li> This ended up being extremely dark.</li>
            <li> Way too dark.</li>
            <li> Bottle was not full, but that was possibly due to separation.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box the foundation looked old and used, the pump is also broken.</li>
            <li> Already opened, watered down, and not the color they said it was.</li>
            <li> I was sad when they discontinued this item so if you are fan of this particular foundation</li>
            <li> its either gone off or not a genuine smash box product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Light L4&amp;#34; color is not light at all.</li>
            <li> Second off, I noticed the bottle was actually broken and there was no pump inside to get the makeup out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this to try to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and on the pale side, go for the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li> I just received this one week late.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible and so disappointed,  actually expected better from Smashbox!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this smashbox foundation it was broken</li>
            <li> When I actually decided to test the color it was absolutely awful!  </li>
            <li> Its a fake.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Horrible product. Pretty sure it is a knock off of smash box foundation. The foundation was super watery, and the bottle I received was half empty. I am of medium complexion and order the shade L4 and the foundation was EXTREMELY dark. Definitely ripped off.</li>
            <li> I just received this one week late. When I opened the box the foundation looked old and used, the pump is also broken.</li>
            <li> its either gone off or not a genuine smash box product. The pump doesn&#x27;t work correctly and the foundation is all lumpy inside the bottle with clear liquid separating from the actual foundation. you shake it up and it goes back to lumpy after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Already opened, watered down, and not the color they said it was.</li>
            <li> Authentic product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The only reason that i gave it two stars was because i like the way it applies with a brush which i usually use, but the order is WAY off. It is too dark for me I wear loreal true match in w2 which is a perfect match for me and this foundation shade is like 5 times darker. I was thinking that the L was suppose to mean light but i guess not.</li>
            <li> Product came runny and seperated. It was much darker than the actual picture.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Light L4&amp;#34; color is not light at all. It was about 4 shades darker than what I expected. I recommend trying out the shades at a authorized retailer or at a Smashbox counter before purchasing online!</li>
            <li> I loved this foundation; unfortunately, it was discontinued 2 years ago and replaced with the halo liquid.</li>
            <li> Generally when a shade comes in &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, you assume it&#x27;s going to be a paler shade. This ended up being extremely dark. If you are like me and on the pale side, go for the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade. To me, this felt like a medium shade.  Way too dark. With that being said, I also wasn&#x27;t impressed with the pump. I bought a Smashbox starter kit from a local store and the pump didn&#x27;t work either. Im assuming that Smashbox needs to create pumps that actually work. However,  I do like Smashbox. And the foundation actually evens out all the different tones in your skin--providing you get the right shade.</li>
            <li> Color has a lot of yellow in it.  Good coverage. I am taking a spot of and blending with my summer tinted moisturizer for more natural color w coverage.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER.  First off when I opened this package the bottle was only half full, possibly used?! Who knows?!?! Second off, I noticed the bottle was actually broken and there was no pump inside to get the makeup out. When I actually decided to test the color it was absolutely awful!  It was so watery and not even the right color as described in its description of the product. Most definitely returning! Absolutely horrible and so disappointed,  actually expected better from Smashbox!</li>
            <li> I love Smashbox products and this foundation doesn&#x27;t disappoint, amazing full dewy coverage and lasts me most of the day with a decent primer underneath. I was sad when they discontinued this item so if you are fan of this particular foundation, I would stock up especially with this price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this smashbox foundation it was broken had no pump it didn&#x27;t come Full I tried this foundation on my face it was so not my color it was so Tick really dark don&#x27;t even think is real  donot purchase it.</li>
            <li> Its a fake. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Definitely not a real smashbox product. When I got mine it was so runny and clumpy</li>
            <li> purchased on a special just love the coverage and the natural feel. I get a lot of compliments on my skin and I 51 years old. smashbox found a new customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 3 years and it is the only one I will ever use.  I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was a great  product and I would buy more</li>
            <li> Best service ever thanks so much the product is good thanks</li>
            <li> Old, not shade described. A lot darker than what ordered. Love smash box products but this is old and doesn&#x27;t work as we as the products available today. Also ordered fair and it is a tan or bronzed color.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and spf 15.  Covers brilliantly and protects and nurishes my skin.  Love it! Can&#x27;t use any other foundation now.</li>
            <li> Color was different than labeled. Product separated. Bottle was not full, but that was possibly due to separation. Really gross and oily. Do not purchase this to try to save a few bucks. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Empty. Why would you pay for that?  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok...... it was really runny. I tried shaking it up and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Smashbox cosmetics and I have used this before. That said, this was NOT at all like what I have purchased directly from Smashbox, Ulta, or Sephora. This was some cheap feeling, streaky, orangey, cakey, not even as good as drug store brand foundation in a smashbox bottle. Don&#x27;t be fooled. This is not the rich smooth creamy foundation from Smashbox but some yucky imposter.</li>
