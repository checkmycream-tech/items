            <li>I tried for the first time in one pharmacy store DRRR and after I order some more for my aunts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the MyChelle line.  First found it when I was about 45 (a little while back ;-), the gal selling it to me said it was great &amp; I was horrified at the price.  10+ yrs later I am still using MyChelle, I do look for it on sale - Amazon has the best $&#x27;s on MyChelle I&#x27;ve seen.  MyChelle is ALL natural, excellent stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are sick (cancer or other systemic illnesses), you will never use any other products on your face.  Other gals I know that have used it when they&#x27;ve been quite ill have found that the illness inside the body changes the alkalinity of the facial skin, and changes the efficacy of MyChelle on the sick skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MyChelle really does love my face, &amp; has for many years  ;-)  &amp; will for yrs to come...</li>
            <li> This product works great under my eyes and forehead.  I like how lite it goes on and instantly starts to tighten the skin immediately after application.  I use it every day and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product truly tightens my skin!  I love it!  The bottle I received had an older label so I was concerned if it had expired, but it works the same as the product in my current bottle with the newer label on it.  (Just for the record, I am 60 years old.)</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t care for this product at all. I saw no results whats so ever and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works!  Of course 35 years of smoking &amp; getting older (57) nothing can bring having a five year old&#x27;s complexion and taught skin but this really does a great job of firming the skin under the eyes, in the forehead area as well as those around the mouth. For you younger ladies- start using this stuff NOW! Don&#x27;t wait! Really great stuff!</li>
            <li> There are many firming serums on the market and with most its a very temporary firming effect as obviously gravity cannot be halted.....this is o.k but a little expensive as came from the U.S and subject to taxes etc.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars as not exceptional but fairly good for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Feels Great on skin ...be sure to apply with a liitle water... seems to work better  ... love it.will buy again</li>
            <li> I spread it on when I need courage.</li>
            <li> I tried for the first time in one pharmacy store DRRR and after I order some more for my aunts.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only me but, after I apply it I can tell the difference. I just want to keep using it every day. Recommended</li>
            <li> This product does feel as though there is a firming action after applying. The finish is semi-matte and works well for me. I do like this line of skin care, and am pleased Amazon offers this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Buy MyChelle Magnolia Eyes instead.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for 3 years now i am 65 and it works real well for me it has argline in that paralizes the  wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I truly don&#x27;t notice any difference. Not as good as the other MyChelle products I use.</li>
            <li> I would probably buy it again, there is an improvement.  Though of course I would like miracles.  It has a nice feel and easy application</li>
            <li> This IS a miracle. I put this on and can see the difference immediately...tighter, smoother skin. If you have wrinkles and your face has &amp;#34;fallen&amp;#34;, this is wonderful. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I think that is no better than any other  face cream.......It did nothing.... I wasted my time and money.Don&#x27;t waste yours!!!</li>

            <li> My pores look smaller and I&#x27;m not using as much makeup</li>
            <li> Great product and it arrived earlier than expected!  Thank you!</li>

            <li> I saw MyChelle on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s product database listed as one of the least dangerous and most natural products.  I decided to give it a whirl.  I am a 52 year old, and had been using Loreal regenerist firming serum.  This works just as well, if not better, and is less expensive and potentially harmful.  Recommend!</li>
