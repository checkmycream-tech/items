    <ol>
            <li>Apply after shower before bed, that works real good.</li>
            <li>The best compliment one can give a product</li>
            <li>and I must say this is perfect from date night  to day life, to gym life.a</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Awesome product  makes the boys happy</li>
            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>Worked great, Order 2 as I should of done.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great product will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li>The hint of menthol gives a nice cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel is a good texture and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, this works great for any place you want to keep things fresh</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like antiperspirants which just make me perspire more elsewhere, so I use this on underarms and even though I still perspire, there&#x27;s no odor.</li>
            <li>A definite Good Purchase!</li>
            <li>It is practically scent free, which I like.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>It really works well!!!</li>
            <li>No stinging on the&amp;#34; boys&amp;#34; and keeps them fresh and non itchy all day!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this kind of product, so I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to use the entire product in order for it to be of good use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so effective that even after walking in a warm sunlit afternoon, I still haven&#x27;t produced an order from down there.</li>
            <li>It has no talc, so it may not prevent friction like other products, but this is a great product if you are looking strictly for an odor neutralizer.</li>
            <li>I stink, particularly since after becoming overweight.  </li>
            <li>The only reason that I tried this pricy gel was more out of desperation than anything else.  </li>
            <li>First time user here,i sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>its been doing exactly what it suppose to.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really at a loss as to why it has mica in it.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it for a few weeks and so far so good...</li>
            <li>It smells good but is very  thin and kind of pricey and work moderately well</li>
            <li>I have to face up the fact that, no matter how many showers, kinds of soaps, or varieties of talcum powder done, used, or applied, I smell &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; after a few hours (sometimes it didn&#x27;t seem to be even that long.)  </li>
            <li>In any case, I discovered that the combined use of Toppcock Silver Odor Neutralizer Gel (applied every other day) and  Fresh Balls Lotion (applied after every shower; mixed with Toppcock when the two are &amp;#34;scheduled&amp;#34; for the same date of application) did the trick.  </li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t at least last all day!</li>
            <li> so maybe the manufacturers should consider marketing this with a less provocative name for those who don&#x27;t want raised eyebrows if someone wanders into their grooming area.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, but is slightly irritating to skin.</li>

            <li> This works great but I&#x27;m really at a loss as to why it has mica in it.  Does anyone actually need sparkles on their.. nether regions?  Luckily, it&#x27;s only enough to scare you when you have it in your hand and not enough to actually give the impression there was a party in your pants.. or wherever you chose to use it.  The hint of menthol gives a nice cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, this works great for any place you want to keep things fresh so maybe the manufacturers should consider marketing this with a less provocative name for those who don&#x27;t want raised eyebrows if someone wanders into their grooming area.</li>

            <li> Works well.  Will buy again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not convinced it actually does what it claims. I get sweaty a lot and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much. I don&#x27;t want to have to use the entire product in order for it to be of good use. Overall, I like the neutral scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering. I think it&#x27;s something that I will continue to experiment with.</li>

            <li> Works as advertised. First time user here,i sweat a lot. Apply after shower before bed, that works real good. After shower in the morning did not work for me. I guess it is mainly because our sweat glands are less active in the night.</li>
            <li> The best compliment one can give a product is that it works as promised. It works as promised.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Seems to do the job.  Will see how it performs during the summer heat.</li>
            <li> It really works well!!! And for hours!!!! I work co.strucyion and I must say this is perfect from date night  to day life, to gym life.a must have for all men.</li>
            <li> I works as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t at least last all day!</li>
            <li> Great product! No stinging on the&amp;#34; boys&amp;#34; and keeps them fresh and non itchy all day! A definite Good Purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, and does not get itchy like other products. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product  makes the boys happy</li>
            <li> I am a woman who bought this to go under my armpits as a natural deodorant not really working out.</li>
            <li> Works well as an odor neutralizer/deodorant. It is practically scent free, which I like. It has no talc, so it may not prevent friction like other products, but this is a great product if you are looking strictly for an odor neutralizer.</li>
            <li> It smells good but is very  thin and kind of pricey and work moderately well</li>

            <li> This is my first experience with this kind of product, so I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect. I like it. It doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as I expected from the product description, but dries quickly enough not to slow me down getting dressed. I perspire a lot, so I was eager for it to work well, and I found it worked well as claimed. Plus, I use it on underarms. I don&#x27;t like antiperspirants which just make me perspire more elsewhere, so I use this on underarms and even though I still perspire, there&#x27;s no odor. The gel is a good texture and goes on easily. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
