            <li>but it isn&#x27;t smell like the original.</li>
            <li>(you can tell if a manufacturer packages the product to be \\&quot;top shelf\\&quot;) is first class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To any formal, and to all cleanly dressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, light and earthy, it lasts forever, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>if you ask me; a strong smell, so caution how much you put on.</li>
            <li>A very balanced &amp; masculine warm citus scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, clean, soft cologne for a guy who likes natural smells.</li>
            <li>As stated before, if you are the avid collector, buy it.  </li>
            <li>Not weak and not over powering.</li>
            <li>but all are also on the weaker side of lasting a full day...</li>
            <li>I have a number of the Perry Ellis fragrances and all are fairly decent scents</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis makes a lot of pretty decent smelling perfumes and this one is definitely a crowd pleaser.</li>
            <li>, SO I SURPRISED HIM.</li>
            <li>If you have Bora Bora by Claiborne, it smells very similar, but Bora Bora lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li>Wow Factor is there, just not there for long.  </li>

            <li> Less price  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything that smells too harsh, like a solvent.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it too and it is very difficult to find a scent she really enjoys.</li>
            <li> If you have an extensive collection, like to blind buy just for the thrill of it, and can find Night for around $20.00 - go ahead and buy it.  </li>
            <li> Night ranks poorly.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like Perry Ellis \\&quot;Night\\&quot; for men.  It smells good and it&#x27;s not to citrus.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The women really love this stuff. Perry Ellis makes a lot of pretty decent smelling perfumes and this one is definitely a crowd pleaser. I&#x27;m always getting compliments from ladies with this stuffed sprayed on. It says toilette but, it is very strong. So only use a few spritz of it. It usually last for a few hours too. I will definitely be buying this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my wife smelled it in a magazine.  It&#x27;s basically half the price than what I saw at the mall, and my wife loves it.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> A very balanced &amp; masculine warm citus scent. Not weak and not over powering. Good for work or for the night out.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, clean, soft cologne for a guy who likes natural smells. I don&#x27;t like anything that smells too harsh, like a solvent. My wife likes it too and it is very difficult to find a scent she really enjoys.</li>
            <li> Nice, not too perfume-ie.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when wearing this. Can&#x27;t keep the ladies away sometimes and will have to resort to only one spray to get thru the day. Buy some good sneakers on Amazon to be able to run from some of the attention you may encounter</li>
            <li> Really nice smell. Sort of a Pine element. To any formal, and to all cleanly dressed. Sophisticated and intelligent if you ask me; a strong smell, so caution how much you put on.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance... not expensive and nice presentation</li>
            <li> The scent is surpassingly good for the price. I definitely would but it again</li>
            <li> I regularly get compliments on this fragrance. Personally one of my favorites for day or night.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this smells a lot like CK be but a bit more of a warm citrus scent and possibly slightly more peppery.</li>
            <li> Es un perfume de excelente calidad! lo recomiendo. Para las mejores ocasiones especiales y para seducir a las chicas que deseas.</li>
            <li> Smells real nice, masculine but without being overpowering. However one of the things I ask of my colognes is that they be long lasting. This one is not and for that reason, I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome Smell my favorite</li>
            <li> i BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NEPHEW BECAUSE HE DIDN&#x27;T HAVE ANY MORE. HE WAS HOLDING ON TO THE EMPTY BOTTLE AS A REMINDER, SO I SURPRISED HIM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, HE WAS THRILLED!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and really like the fragrance and the compliments I receive whenever I wear it. One application last a very long time. What also impress me was the cost and the speed of delivery. I highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell catches the attention of everyone&#x27;s nose plus smells better as each hour passes by I&#x27;m truly satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. I put it on before bed, because she is the only woman I need to impress.</li>
            <li> Good price but it isn&#x27;t smell like the original.</li>
            <li> this perrry ellis smell like 212 from carolina herrera the same smell i have this and the 212 soo if u looking for a 212 get this the same smell but Less price  u willl love it</li>
            <li> most perry ellis after shave an d cologne for men our good and have a refreshing smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, light and earthy, it lasts forever, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> On time, no hassle purchase.  Due to prime, it came in two days, just like that!</li>
            <li> I have a number of the Perry Ellis fragrances and all are fairly decent scents but all are also on the weaker side of lasting a full day... Night is no exception.  Great scent, coming out of the gates with clean citrus notes and finishing with a smooth amber wood and/or musk fragrance.  The scent is really nice.  For those reading my reviews, you know I am a big fan of a fragrance&#x27;s longevity.  Night ranks poorly.  I have worn the cologne once, and while impressed with the scent, I did have to apply 3 times during a normal business day (yes, I have that office job..) where I could still smell the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following one reapplication, I did receive an unsolicited compliment - meaning the potential Wow Factor is there, just not there for long.  Night can be worn any time of year and for any occasion. If you have Bora Bora by Claiborne, it smells very similar, but Bora Bora lasts much longer.  If you have an extensive collection, like to blind buy just for the thrill of it, and can find Night for around $20.00 - go ahead and buy it.  Throw it in the gym bag and use prior to the ride home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the bottle design and the packaging (you can tell if a manufacturer packages the product to be \\&quot;top shelf\\&quot;) is first class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Night 4 stars out of 5.  As stated before, if you are the avid collector, buy it.  Life - enjoy the ride...!!</li>
