            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Its not just good for blackheads its also good for squeezing oil out of your skin that causes pimples!</li>
            <li>The set appears to be made of good quality material and well made.  </li>
            <li>Great value and nice set.</li>
            <li>for the money this is a good kit.</li>
            <li>Packaging and tools look good, but tools did not do yhe job for me.  </li>
            <li>Also includes ear curettes, great for safely cleaning the ear canal.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the great reviews, but I&#x27;m just not feeling the love.</li>
            <li>Instructions would be nice to demonstrate which tool is best for different acne problems, plus the best technique for the using the lance.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It worked nicely.</li>
            <li>Brilliant for opening the pore in a very targeted fashion without any damage to the surrounding area.  </li>
            <li>and it was an easy out!</li>
            <li>It looks kind of cheap</li>
            <li>Better than pinching or scrubbing but not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once I had finally decided which two work the best.  </li>
            <li>Acne Extractor from CVS works better than these tools for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s work and well fit!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li>Wow what a kit just what the doctor ordered,  loved it!</li>
            <li>So I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Having multiple tools to choose from is great because you never know which one will do the trick.</li>
            <li>No instructions cheaply made</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>but I kept reading everyone&#x27;s reviews and decided to get the full set</li>
            <li>, the price was low for the value of the 1-3 really good tools and the rest of the tools can just be considered \\&quot;free\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>To get such a good product is lucky.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>There are not any instructions which would be super helpful</li>
            <li>It shipped reasonably quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I got the smaller set without the screw-on feature.</li>
            <li>I would recommend seeing a dermatologist to get professional advice on finding better tools.</li>
            <li>If you can find a use for even one of the attachments, it is probably worth it.</li>
            <li>and that alone just made my skin smoother and fresh.</li>
            <li>, it was just a few $ more anyway, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Thank you soo much!</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to figure out, but it is easy one you do.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a lot higher quality than it really is, but the photo is actually better than the actual product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, I would purchase again, and definitely get the full set and not just one or 2.</li>
            <li>It is cheap enough however, that it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy unless you&#x27;re a giant - pored guy with huge sebaceous deposits, the sort an archeologist could go at with a trowel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was very unsure if I even wanted this</li>
            <li>Very helpful in working on my sisters face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really practice</li>
            <li>I use my other extractor more.  </li>
            <li>I like the variety of tools that come with this; I generally use one of three, the whitehead sharp lancer, the spoon like scoop to clean large areas quickly, and the tiny scoop with the single hole which is great for getting individual blackheads.</li>
            <li>I am an older person and had a blackhead which didn&#x27;t want to be removed.</li>
            <li>This product is very complete.</li>
            <li>It did look very professional.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this worked!</li>
            <li>Ok quality bc when tightened into main attachment, it always comes a little loose.</li>
            <li>Complete accessories, meticulous division of labor.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t function completely.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if the open tools were sharper, and the spoon-like tools were much thinner, they would do the job.</li>
            <li>Showed up early.</li>
            <li>The kit is high quality, solid material.</li>
            <li>The zipper partially  tore away from the pouch (on one end about 4 inches tore) on the first use.</li>
            <li>At the same time to maximize the control treatment of wounds, completely without leaving pox and india.</li>
            <li>A professional should understand and give proper name brands.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately most of the tools (with exception for one) are much too thick and make it hard to use them reliably to target an area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are not the large easy to see and remove though, they are the small hard to get out type</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For those who are experts in the field they will know that the secret is fine tools with sharp thin edges targeted at specific areas and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> The tools are a decent quality however some do not tighten all the way and are a little wiggly....</li>
            <li> The pieces are so thick you are not able to push into blemishes and remove the one I got from Avon was so much better</li>
            <li> She suffers from many blackheads all over.</li>
            <li> The thickness of every single tool hinders you from getting the tool to &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; under acne or push into skin.</li>
            <li> I have the 5 piece set, basically the same as this except each tool is double ended where this one is just broken up into to smaller items but with the same amount of extractor ends.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these tools are far too thick to be useful in any facial application.</li>
            <li> not really what you want for this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered a smaller set as I have no clue how to use 75% of the tips without instructions or some sort of clue as to what they are used for.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the poor quality of the tapping (process of making male and female ends of bolts/bolt holes) that was made easier after screwing on each tip a few times, (and ultimately tightening with pliers)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the eye hole a few times but they don&#x27;t have a sharp enough edges to extract the center</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one exception to the tool is the sharp removal needle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not flimsy, extremely well made.</li>
            <li> I gave a few of these sets as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> My only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was the the individual pieces screw onto the middle base piece and it makes a metal grinding noise sometimes when you&#x27;re applying pressure to one end.</li>
            <li> Was not sure how it worked.</li>
            <li> Unless you have humongous pores, like big enough to march an elephant through, this kit is crap.</li>
            <li> Looks to confusing.  </li>
            <li> What I mean is because I bought the 10 piece</li>
            <li> So when I use whatever tool I&#x27;m using it&#x27;s shaky...</li>
            <li> and it is so frustrating.</li>
            <li> They loosen during use and that is irritating.</li>
            <li> I do not have terrible acne, I&#x27;m 31 and have occasional breakouts</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had extraction before at a dermatologist but that can get quite expensive.</li>
            <li> A bit kinda scary.  </li>
            <li> Popping pimples by hand is so bad for the skin</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is very complete. Complete accessories, meticulous division of labor. Can fully meet the demand for treatment of all. At the same time to maximize the control treatment of wounds, completely without leaving pox and india. To get such a good product is lucky. So I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well, a great value for the money. Also includes ear curettes, great for safely cleaning the ear canal.</li>
            <li> I have the 5 piece set, basically the same as this except each tool is double ended where this one is just broken up into to smaller items but with the same amount of extractor ends. I really like it. I was very unsure if I even wanted this but I kept reading everyone&#x27;s reviews and decided to get the full set, it was just a few $ more anyway, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I do not have terrible acne, I&#x27;m 31 and have occasional breakouts and it is so frustrating. Popping pimples by hand is so bad for the skin and I&#x27;ve had extraction before at a dermatologist but that can get quite expensive. Having multiple tools to choose from is great because you never know which one will do the trick. Sometimes I use 2-3 just on one area until I get the extraction. There are not any instructions which would be super helpful but you can watch video&#x27;s on youtube and that should help a lot. Definitely worth it, I would purchase again, and definitely get the full set and not just one or 2.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews, but I&#x27;m just not feeling the love. It looks kind of cheap and it doesn&#x27;t function completely. What I mean is because I bought the 10 piece it has the screw-on, screw-off feature as visible in the photo and the screw parts don&#x27;t screw in all the way. So when I use whatever tool I&#x27;m using it&#x27;s shaky... not really what you want for this sort of thing. I kind of wish I got the smaller set without the screw-on feature. I got the bigger set solely because of the flexibility of the screw-on feature and I completely regret the extra $3 spent. Get the smaller set.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these tools are far too thick to be useful in any facial application. The thickness of every single tool hinders you from getting the tool to &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; under acne or push into skin. There&#x27;s just no way to use these on your face, period. Perhaps if the open tools were sharper, and the spoon-like tools were much thinner, they would do the job. I would recommend seeing a dermatologist to get professional advice on finding better tools. A professional should understand and give proper name brands.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done once you know how to use each tool. I only use 2 or 3 out of the packet on my face. Ok quality bc when tightened into main attachment, it always comes a little loose. Not a big bother though you just have to tighten attachments often.</li>
            <li> The set appears to be made of good quality material and well made.  I have not used yet.  I gave a few of these sets as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Instructions would have been incredibly helpful.  Otherwise great product</li>
            <li> Very helpful in working on my sisters face. She suffers from many blackheads all over. They are not the large easy to see and remove though, they are the small hard to get out type so this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of having multiple tips to use for different problems,  but I have found that the tips do not stay screwed into the handle. They loosen during use and that is irritating.</li>
            <li> For those who are experts in the field they will know that the secret is fine tools with sharp thin edges targeted at specific areas and nothing more.  Unfortunately most of the tools (with exception for one) are much too thick and make it hard to use them reliably to target an area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one exception to the tool is the sharp removal needle.  Brilliant for opening the pore in a very targeted fashion without any damage to the surrounding area.  I&#x27;ve used the eye hole a few times but they don&#x27;t have a sharp enough edges to extract the center and instead you end up pushing and placing a lot of pressure on the surrounding area.  Better than pinching or scrubbing but not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the price was low for the value of the 1-3 really good tools and the rest of the tools can just be considered \\&quot;free\\&quot;.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great value and nice set.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a lot higher quality than it really is, but the photo is actually better than the actual product.  It is cheap enough however, that it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  If you can find a use for even one of the attachments, it is probably worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the different attachments. It is kind of hard to figure out, but it is easy one you do.</li>
            <li> The zipper partially  tore away from the pouch (on one end about 4 inches tore) on the first use. The tools are a decent quality however some do not tighten all the way and are a little wiggly.... still functional though.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product, so I&#x27;ve only used it once. It worked nicely. It&#x27;s not flimsy, extremely well made. Instructions would be nice to demonstrate which tool is best for different acne problems, plus the best technique for the using the lance. It&#x27;s going to be trial and error or some You-tube videos for me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this worked! I am an older person and had a blackhead which didn&#x27;t want to be removed. 30 seconds with the proper tool and it was an easy out! I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it did!!!</li>
            <li> for the money this is a good kit. great shipping too/</li>
            <li> The product is great. I wish they had an informational pamphlet or video that came with it to tell you the uses for each attachment. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I like the variety of tools that come with this; I generally use one of three, the whitehead sharp lancer, the spoon like scoop to clean large areas quickly, and the tiny scoop with the single hole which is great for getting individual blackheads. I usually do my Moroccan mud mask first then follow through with pore cleaning using the tools. My only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was the the individual pieces screw onto the middle base piece and it makes a metal grinding noise sometimes when you&#x27;re applying pressure to one end. Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with instructions and I had to use pliers to tighten the tips on once I had finally decided which two work the best.  I wish I had ordered a smaller set as I have no clue how to use 75% of the tips without instructions or some sort of clue as to what they are used for.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the poor quality of the tapping (process of making male and female ends of bolts/bolt holes) that was made easier after screwing on each tip a few times, (and ultimately tightening with pliers) it WORKS!</li>
            <li> Unless you have humongous pores, like big enough to march an elephant through, this kit is crap. Don&#x27;t buy unless you&#x27;re a giant - pored guy with huge sebaceous deposits, the sort an archeologist could go at with a trowel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If like me, you&#x27;re a woman with a reasonable complexion and a few blackheads, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Great service speedy shipping. Item is well made will purchase again.</li>
            <li> No instructions cheaply made</li>
            <li> Looks to confusing.  Was not sure how it worked. It did look very professional.  A bit kinda scary.  No directions.</li>
            <li> Packaging and tools look good, but tools did not do yhe job for me.  Acne Extractor from CVS works better than these tools for me.</li>
            <li> What an excellent assortment of tools, now I&#x27;ll have to study up on how to benefit from them all.  Excellent quality tools.  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> The pieces are so thick you are not able to push into blemishes and remove the one I got from Avon was so much better</li>
            <li> Ilove it! It&#x27;s really practice</li>
            <li> Swear I discovered alot of pimples that I have never seen on my face before. Its not just good for blackheads its also good for squeezing oil out of your skin that causes pimples! and that alone just made my skin smoother and fresh. It do sting a bit sometime but &amp;#34;no pain no gain&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great sturdy product with everything you need.  If you are looking for a blackhead kit, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> I use my other extractor more.  I like all of the attachments though.</li>
            <li> Showed up early. Easy to use &amp; clean. Just as pictured. Works great.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, well made and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The kit is high quality, solid material. I&#x27;ve loved using this on myself! It shipped reasonably quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> Wow what a kit just what the doctor ordered,  loved it!</li>
            <li> My father is plagued with boils on his back. This is the only product that can get to the embedded blackheads.</li>
            <li> Thank you soo much! It&#x27;s work and well fit!</li>
            <li> A must to any beauty regimen! Perfect case to keep all pieces organized.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Everything came as described.</li>
