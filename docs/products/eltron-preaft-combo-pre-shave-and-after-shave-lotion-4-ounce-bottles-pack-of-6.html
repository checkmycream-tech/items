    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Elton Pre/Afte Combo is a superb product.   </li>
            <li>I have the Nivea Norelco which is their best as I&#x27;ve tried em all up to date</li>
            <li>For some reason the best ones seem to become unavailable after a while.</li>
            <li>This one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I used them as stocking stuffers and gifts for my best friends.</li>
            <li>When I found this site on line I was very happy.</li>
            <li>This product is almost perfect.</li>
            <li>This product was sooooo close to being the perfect one.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I have been a user of Elton Pre/Aft for over five years and think it is the best shaving lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great!  </li>
            <li>This is the best pre shave or after shave lotion I have ever used since I have been shaving.</li>
            <li>What I like best about it is that I have no razor burn anymore plus a closer shave</li>
            <li>and this one&#x27;s a great choice.</li>
            <li>One of the benefits is that it is great as an after shave lotion as well.</li>
            <li>and now I am happy I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it works great for me, it may work great for you?</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-you may be able to buy just one bottle, but I&#x27;m happy I found the 6 pack!</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant non-overpowering aroma.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, but as a pre electric lotion it works well.</li>
            <li>I have searched and searched for a good electric pre shave.</li>
            <li>I have given a bottle to my father and my cousin and they loved it too.</li>
            <li>For people using electric razors it does a great job of getting the whiskers to stand up and also let&#x27;s the razor more so glide across your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s the best for setting up your beard and getting a great shave...</li>
            <li>Turned my top of the line Braun from great to amazing.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!!!!</li>
            <li>But, alone is amazing too.</li>
            <li>(not halloween kind)</li>
            <li>Nice consistency, odor, lubrication and skin treatment.  </li>
            <li>Aft Combo has proved to be the best by far.</li>
            <li>and I needed more.  </li>
            <li>the price was better than I used to pay.   </li>
            <li>, no razor burn, smells good, leaves face fresh.</li>
            <li>Also excellent in a second application as after shave.</li>
            <li>I like to use the Norelco for 1 day shaves, Braun for 2 or more.</li>
            <li>and it works fine--a lot better than aerosol shaving creams--and</li>
            <li>As it turned out much much better</li>
            <li>and I was glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe how over the years I have become more and more domesticated</li>
            <li>Like most of you I started out with</li>
            <li>, I got a closer and better shave.</li>
            <li>Much, much better than Williams Lectric Shave.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that Amazon was selling it and placed my order with them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and I am happy to say that it really works for me.</li>
            <li>More like 6 or 7</li>
            <li>, my face just feels better when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I do not put more on after I&#x27;ve completed shaving.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a better after shave lotion than pre shave.  </li>
            <li>Being able to use it before and after shaving is a convenient plus.</li>
            <li>It has a  nice pleasant fresh scent that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>Very soothing as an after shave with a very light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price from a dependable dealer.    </li>
            <li>These products burned and really did not assist in a good shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Using this stuff in the winter, when you skin is dry and flaky, is especially important, but I&#x27;ve also found it quite refreshing to use throughout the rest of the year.    </li>
            <li>you absolutely do need some kind of an after shave cream with any shaver, be it manual or electrical.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>very little.&lt;br /&gt;Always works except in high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing fragrance and great size for travelling.</li>
            <li>When the Great Recession of 2008 began, I was unable to purchase many things--my beloved Eltron</li>
            <li>Nice masculine scent!</li>
            <li>We buy it by the carton full.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years now and have always been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Be worth to note that perhaps electric shavers must be washed after using this product for it does have some kind of creamy lotion that might impregnate the inner blades, but I couldn&#x27;t say it would harm or not, since I do clean my shaver after each use.</li>
            <li>it does what it claims and I have the very reliable reviewers in amazon to thank for their accurate description of what it does.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>After my supply of this product runs out, I will try to find the Afta Fresh Scent on the internet or, see what else is out there.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>just as well as some of those high-priced pre-shave products made for &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I had tried Afta Pre Electric and my feelings were mixed, so I asked myself how much better can this product be?</li>
            <li>but I am starting to consider it has been for the better.</li>
            <li>The product worked better than the afore mentioned shave products but it left a lot of powder in my razor.</li>
            <li>When I rubbed the Eltron Lotion on my face for the first time, there was no burn.</li>
            <li>After my first shave, I was sold on Eltron.</li>
            <li>I would not use my Braun electic shaver without first putting on this lotion.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is the kind of item that you would qualify as an accessory more than a definite necessity but never the less</li>
            <li>To say the least I am very pleased with the purchase (quick delivery too) and knowing I can obtain additional supplies through Amazon.com</li>
            <li>It works well for even a slightly sweaty face, leaving a clean electric shave much superior to any pure liquid preshave (it is a balm type fluid).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use an electric shaver without it .... much better than the dry talc stuff.</li>
            <li>Spraying is more convenient, less messy &amp; more accurate.</li>
            <li>BUT The shaving experience was very rough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>almost too much so.</li>
            <li>Eltron is pricey, but works very well as an electric razor pre-shave (you could also use it as a shaving lotion for manual razors too, I&#x27;ve tried that</li>
            <li>Yes, it does work and I really thought it was a myth.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>, it absorbs so fast into my skin,</li>
            <li>Two, I really wish it had just a touch of a lubricant.  </li>
            <li>He likes the scent so much that he no longer applies his cologne.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone who shaves!</li>
            <li>He has fast growing facial hair and this allows him to shave very close and leave his skin really smooth.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The original Afta scent is nauseating to me and seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li>The other pre-shaves are mostly alcohol based and sting.  </li>
            <li>Helps give me a smooth comfortable shave with very little razor burn and zero skin reaction.</li>
            <li>I tried the dry powder stick and it seemed to work fine, but when it gets toward the end of the stick, it crumbles and falls apart</li>
            <li>I use more than a few drops, maybe because I have a large face?</li>
            <li>Later, I was able to restore this personal item to my &#x27;regulars&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Something they (companies) make you believe you need for a particular situation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>This little product is not to be taken lightly!</li>
            <li>so it takes a little more than 3 drops.</li>
            <li>I loved the Afta \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; pre shave, but it is impossible to find in my area.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to have it a little more oily, but then I don&#x27;t use it as my aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price per bottle can&#x27;t be beat, not even if you order direct from the manufacturer.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment and apparently for the amount you get a long lasting at that!</li>
            <li>A luxurious pre-post lotion like no other.</li>
            <li>I also just spent $17.95 purchasing a new cutter bar and foil.</li>

            <li> A luxurious pre-post lotion like no other.</li>
            <li> I also just spent $17.95 purchasing a new cutter bar and foil.</li>
            <li> means you&#x27;ll be storing this in your bathroom cabinet for a really long time.</li>
            <li> so I hope it stays around for a long time.</li>
            <li> A cream rather than a lotion -- and each bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than the others</li>
            <li> that by the time I am getting finished, my face is already getting too dry.  </li>
            <li> So last holiday season I purchased a 6-pack from Amazon, which cut the price down to around $2.50 per bottle.</li>
            <li> Before I found this product and for a period when I couldn&#x27;t purchase it, I tried a number of other pre shave products and Eltron Pre /</li>
            <li> I am confident you won&#x27;t be disappointed just like me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When the Great Recession of 2008 began, I was unable to purchase many things--my beloved Eltron Pre/Aft Shave Lotion being one.      Later, I was able to restore this personal item to my &#x27;regulars&#x27;.  This little product is not to be taken lightly!</li>
            <li> you absolutely do need some kind of an after shave cream with any shaver, be it manual or electrical. for manual, its a must. and this one&#x27;s a great choice.</li>
            <li> I have used Eltron Pre / Aft Combo for over 20 years. Before I found this product and for a period when I couldn&#x27;t purchase it, I tried a number of other pre shave products and Eltron Pre / Aft Combo has proved to be the best by far. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, purchasing it from my local electric shave shop.  However, they have gone out of business and I needed more.  I did a search and found that Amazon.com carries it and the price was better than I used to pay.   To say the least I am very pleased with the purchase (quick delivery too) and knowing I can obtain additional supplies through Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is a God send. Close shave, no razor burn, smells good, leaves face fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s the best for setting up your beard and getting a great shave... but I also travel - a lot, and I just can&#x27;t understand WHY they won&#x27;t make a 3 ounce size that TSA will approve! Hello... is anyone in the company listening???</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price from a dependable dealer.    [[ASIN:B001ET764O Eltron Pre/Aft Combo, Pre Shave &amp; After Shave Lotion, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know maybe it&#x27;s me BUT The shaving experience was very rough.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Back to Williams Lectric Shave for me.</li>
            <li> The Elton Pre/Afte Combo is a superb product.   It works well for even a slightly sweaty face, leaving a clean electric shave much superior to any pure liquid preshave (it is a balm type fluid). Also excellent in a second application as after shave.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. If you use an electric shaver, you need to at least try this lotion. If you&#x27;ve been \\&quot;burned\\&quot; by electric shavers in the past, give them another try in conjunction with the Pre/Aft Combo Lotion. You will NOT be disappointed. Using this stuff in the winter, when you skin is dry and flaky, is especially important, but I&#x27;ve also found it quite refreshing to use throughout the rest of the year.    The only downside -- if you could call it that -- is that you need to use so little of this stuff with each shave that purchasing six bottles at a time from Amazon means you&#x27;ll be storing this in your bathroom cabinet for a really long time. Amazon&#x27;s price per bottle can&#x27;t be beat, not even if you order direct from the manufacturer.    I&#x27;m also a big fan of [[ASIN:B000E59GMO Parks Shaver Cleaner]] and [[ASIN:B000E5BJVA Parks Shave Ease]], however, the pricing on these products here at Amazon is rather uncompetitive.</li>
            <li> A luxurious pre-post lotion like no other. Turned my top of the line Braun from great to amazing. I made a spray bottle mix, 1/2 this, 1/2 Lectricshave. AMAZING! Spray on, spread &amp; get the fastest/smoothest shave you ever had! Makes even inferior shavers like Norelco 3 headers work gr8! They ALWAYS irritate the neck. This solves that problem. I have the Nivea Norelco which is their best as I&#x27;ve tried em all up to date &amp; I don&#x27;t use the Nivea anymore, I use this. But not in the canister, just pre-applied. I like to use the Norelco for 1 day shaves, Braun for 2 or more. This stuff is Hi Class!  ENJOY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Recipe- Get a tiny {index finger} spray bottle. Put 1/2 this, 1/2 Lectric shave, leaving enuf room to shake it to mix. You may want to start with a small amount of each, not a  full bottle, to test it 1st. Shake to mix thoroughly each use. I prefer this as this stuff is so lavish, almost too much so. But, alone is amazing too. Try it. Spraying is more convenient, less messy &amp; more accurate. Lectric shave has its benefits as well.</li>
            <li> There have been pre-electric shave products to come and go. For some reason the best ones seem to become unavailable after a while. This one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used so I hope it stays around for a long time. One of the benefits is that it is great as an after shave lotion as well. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than the others but well worth it. I am confident you won&#x27;t be disappointed just like me.</li>
            <li> Eltron is pricey, but works very well as an electric razor pre-shave (you could also use it as a shaving lotion for manual razors too, I&#x27;ve tried that and it works fine--a lot better than aerosol shaving creams--and just as well as some of those high-priced pre-shave products made for &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34;). However, as an aftershave, Eltron doesn&#x27;t cut it...it&#x27;s way too runny and picks up whiskers and dirt on your face.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does work and I really thought it was a myth. Something they (companies) make you believe you need for a particular situation. I had tried Afta Pre Electric and my feelings were mixed, so I asked myself how much better can this product be? As it turned out much much better and I was glad I made the purchase. I use more than a few drops, maybe because I have a large face? (not halloween kind) but it works like a charm. I purposefully tried it without and then with it and the difference was substantial. In other words for those who shave electrically Eltron Pre/Aft Combo, Pre Shave &amp; After Shave Lotion, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6) is a serious asset. Well worth the investment and apparently for the amount you get a long lasting at that! I just can&#x27;t believe how over the years I have become more and more domesticated but I am starting to consider it has been for the better. Yes, this is the kind of item that you would qualify as an accessory more than a definite necessity but never the less it does what it claims and I have the very reliable reviewers in amazon to thank for their accurate description of what it does. I was not going to buy the other product anymore but this one did call my attention and now I am happy I made the purchase. Be worth to note that perhaps electric shavers must be washed after using this product for it does have some kind of creamy lotion that might impregnate the inner blades, but I couldn&#x27;t say it would harm or not, since I do clean my shaver after each use. Perhaps if it dried up? Word to the wise, but as a pre electric lotion it works well. 4 Plus Stars!</li>
            <li> Tired of face burns after using your electric razor? So was I, until about a year ago when my uncle gave me a bottle of Eltron Pre/Aft Shave Lotion. Like most of you I started out with the pre electric shaves from the drug stores. These products burned and really did not assist in a good shaving experience. Then I switched to a shave powder in a push up stick. The product worked better than the afore mentioned shave products but it left a lot of powder in my razor. This caused me to spend time cleaning my electric razor before and after shaves. Now before I go any further, I use a Braun model # 6520. I also just spent $17.95 purchasing a new cutter bar and foil. When I rubbed the Eltron Lotion on my face for the first time, there was no burn. I started to shave and to my surprise, I got a closer and better shave. After my first shave, I was sold on Eltron. Now you only use two or three drops, per shave. Trust me, thats all you need. Another perk with Eltron, is that a 4 ounce bottle lasts about a year. So last holiday season I purchased a 6-pack from Amazon, which cut the price down to around $2.50 per bottle. I used them as stocking stuffers and gifts for my best friends. Yes, I kept a couple of bottles for myself. Believe me, once you start using Eltron, you too will buy the 6-pack!</li>
            <li> This is a product that is not available in our immediate area. When I found this site on line I was very happy. The price,availability and the speed of delivery was amazing!!I will continue to order from them.</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for a good electric pre shave. Williams Lectric shave and the others like it are too watery and too oily. I loved the Afta \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; pre shave, but it is impossible to find in my area.  The original Afta scent is nauseating to me and seems to last all day.  I tried the dry powder stick and it seemed to work fine, but when it gets toward the end of the stick, it crumbles and falls apart which is  a waste of money.  This product is almost perfect. It has a  nice pleasant fresh scent that disappears quickly. It is very soothing.  I do have two complaints: One, it absorbs so fast into my skin, that by the time I am getting finished, my face is already getting too dry.  Two, I really wish it had just a touch of a lubricant.  After my supply of this product runs out, I will try to find the Afta Fresh Scent on the internet or, see what else is out there.  This product was sooooo close to being the perfect one.</li>
            <li> Much, much better than Williams Lectric Shave.  Nice consistency, odor, lubrication and skin treatment.  I just use it for pre-shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I won&#x27;t use anything else for my face, especially in this harsh climate!  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband who uses and electric shaver.  He uses it for both pre and after shave.  He likes the scent so much that he no longer applies his cologne.  Nice masculine scent!</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Elton Pre/Aft for over five years and think it is the best shaving lotion I have ever used. I highly recommend it to everyone who shaves!</li>
            <li> I have been using Pre/Aft daily for years.  When I tried to order another  6 bottles from the source I&#x27;ve used all this time, I found they were no longer in business so I went on line to find another vendor.  I was pleased that Amazon was selling it and placed my order with them.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Like your product. Helps give me a smooth comfortable shave with very little razor burn and zero skin reaction. My only suggestion is to have it a little more oily, but then I don&#x27;t use it as my aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  He has fast growing facial hair and this allows him to shave very close and leave his skin really smooth.  The other pre-shaves are mostly alcohol based and sting.  This does not.  We buy it by the carton full.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  I wouldn&#x27;t use an electric shaver without it .... much better than the dry talc stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best pre shave or after shave lotion I have ever used since I have been shaving. I have given a bottle to my father and my cousin and they loved it too. thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now and have always been very satisfied with the results. For people using electric razors it does a great job of getting the whiskers to stand up and also let&#x27;s the razor more so glide across your skin. I would recommend this product to anyone using a foil type razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and I am happy to say that it really works for me. I have a heavy, course beard so it takes a little more than 3 drops. More like 6 or 7 but it&#x27;s worth it. What I like best about it is that I have no razor burn anymore plus a closer shave, my face just feels better when I&#x27;m done. I do not put more on after I&#x27;ve completed shaving. I have tried them all thru the years but I kept going back to Afta. Well, I won&#x27;t be changing anymore. If your not happy with the product your using now, I would suggest you try this. Like I said, it works great for me, it may work great for you?</li>
            <li> I would not use my Braun electic shaver without first putting on this lotion. No irritation and I get the closest shave all the time.</li>
            <li> I do not like it as a preshave. Very soothing as an after shave with a very light pleasant scent. A cream rather than a lotion -- and each bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Eltron Pre Shave &amp; After Shave Lotion for around 15 years now. It you have an electric shaver (I prefer Braun) I suggest you give the Pre SHave Lotion a try.&lt;br /&gt;-you may be able to buy just one bottle, but I&#x27;m happy I found the 6 pack!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a better after shave lotion than pre shave.  I would prefer no odor but at least this is objectionable.</li>
            <li> Great product no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Need very little.&lt;br /&gt;Always works except in high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing fragrance and great size for travelling.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!!! As you read the product info, you always wonder if products like this are what they describe them as.  This one is.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it before and after shaving is a convenient plus. It also has a pleasant non-overpowering aroma.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this stuff. The company got sold and used to be called just Pre/Aft.  Now it&#x27;s called Eltron Pre Aft I believe.</li>
