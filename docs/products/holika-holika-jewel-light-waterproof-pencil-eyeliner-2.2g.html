            <li>PLUS excellent price!!</li>
            <li>I thought this eyeliner looked beautiful</li>
            <li>Beautiful color.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the eyeliner is a bit tacky however, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It also came with a couple samples which was a nice touch!</li>
            <li>The glitter isn&#x27;t too blindingly bright when blended in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very adorable and compliments my eyes.</li>
            <li>and for making the famous &#x27;aegyo sal&amp;#34; look (which is a must for me :P).</li>
            <li>I teach ice skating and the girls love the sparkle!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The order came on time, and it was nicely protected with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>worth the wait!!! :)</li>
            <li>easy to apply and speaks well too!</li>
            <li>But this eyeliner is perfect for highlighting the inner corner of your eyes (which i love to do!)</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>seller (emunah) was very nice to send me another pencil once the first one they sent got lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite &amp;#34;aegyo&amp;#34; eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cute color</li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;re supposed to get more product from it</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner has a nice, light pink/champagne color shimmer.</li>
            <li>It makes eyes look wider, more awake, and innocent.</li>
            <li>I really love the color and how it shimmers under my eye.</li>
            <li>I think it complements my skin tone better.</li>
            <li>Cute color</li>
            <li>Otherwise ok.</li>
            <li>but I broke off the tip of the eyeliner and can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get more out</li>
            <li>A must to create innocent angelic makeup look.</li>
            <li>The glitters are more noticeable than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love this highlight pencil, it make the perfect highlight color except for it has a few specks of glitter.</li>
            <li>The color was beautiful, but I only got about two uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>It had huge chunks of glitter in it, does not look as pictured.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The way it looks the smooth texture andeverything...1 problem mines not a pencil..it seem to be like a pen like those twistables eyeliners but the ITS NOT TWISTABLE...</li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is true to color and is creamy.</li>
            <li>Ok until eyeliner needed a sharpening (or roll up as is the case with this particular style of pencil).</li>
            <li>but you can only use the product at the very top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The quality of the eye liner is really good and much better than most american eye liners especially how much pigment this thing gives.</li>
            <li>this is so pretty!</li>
            <li>THIS IS SO PRETTY!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely order more colors!</li>
            <li>This is a super affordable light pink shimmery eyeliner that goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>To be honest i wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this product because i have tried a lot of similar product with unfavorable result.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite eye makeup essential as of right now.</li>
            <li>the light pink colour is cute and appears on the skin as beige with just a slight pink tone, so its perfect for highlighting and the under eyes as its not as in-your-face as whites/silvers!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I figured out how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty too</li>
            <li>Shimmer is great and awesome but glitter makes it look like i am crying or have watery eyes, and is dangerous for those with contact lenses.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>the glitter can be layered for a bold or natural look.</li>
            <li>So far the best inner corner highlighter I&#x27;ve found, it is long lasting and it sparkles like stars.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a smooth fine glitter all around, and not tiny specks of glitter showing up at different angles.</li>
            <li>It was had to much glitter in it, and there wasn&#x27;t any glitter in the picture.</li>
            <li>Unlike cheap glitter liners, the color and sparkle actually stay on all day!</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>(really brings out my eyes)</li>
            <li>AND fast delivery~</li>
            <li>It is not too much or not too little.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda hard to take off with a normal makeup wipe but use an oil based remover and you should be good.  </li>
            <li>These pens are super smooth, long lasting and sharpenable.</li>
            <li>It looks like a plastic twist-up gel eyeliner, but it&#x27;s actually a normal pencil eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Then this &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliner came right off when my eyes started watering, and it left glitter on my checks.</li>
            <li>and it was lovely, but it seemed to have broken soon after I got it.</li>
            <li>The tip of the pencil came broken however after sharpening, it worked just fine.</li>

            <li> do wish this was a twistable eyeliner because it gums up a little in a regular sharpener (the consistency is softer and more delicate than a typical sharpened pencil)</li>
            <li> seriously, its so pretty.</li>
            <li> The product is a sheer sparkly pink that is not too drastic.</li>
            <li> I have other shimmery eye liners in silver and white, but I like that this one is pink.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something more subtle like in the picture but the glitter is VERY obvious and too over-the-top for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that there is really nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beginning to go down</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t particularly say that the glitter is bad, Just personal preference.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a neutral shimmery slightly sparkly liner to wear for everyday but will be saving this one for a night out or Halloween instead.</li>
            <li> A little sparkle but not overdone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> However, if I layer it on too thickly it tends to look like my eyes look teary.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the glitter irritating my eyes or flaking off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The roll up function did not work at all, so after a handful of uses, this eyeliner is useless.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was very disappointing.</li>

            <li> The order came on time, and it was nicely protected with bubble wrap. It also came with a couple samples which was a nice touch! The eyeliner is true to color and is creamy. It stays on all day, but I do set it with some powder. The packaging of the eyeliner is a bit tacky however, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> this is so pretty! the light pink colour is cute and appears on the skin as beige with just a slight pink tone, so its perfect for highlighting and the under eyes as its not as in-your-face as whites/silvers! seriously, its so pretty. the glitter can be layered for a bold or natural look. this is my favorite eye makeup essential as of right now. seller (emunah) was very nice to send me another pencil once the first one they sent got lost in the mail. worth the wait!!! :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;aegyo&amp;#34; eyeliner. It&#x27;s very adorable and compliments my eyes.</li>
            <li> This took me forever to figure out. It looks like a plastic twist-up gel eyeliner, but it&#x27;s actually a normal pencil eyeliner. You sharpen it with a sharpener like any pencil eyeliner. I saw some reviews that said that they threw it away because they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to sharpen it. Don&#x27;t let that happen to you! It&#x27;s a really cute color and I&#x27;m glad I figured out how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I thought this eyeliner looked beautiful so I bought it, but when it came in the mail it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It was had to much glitter in it, and there wasn&#x27;t any glitter in the picture. Also when I put it on glitter got all over my face. I put it on my waterline, and it made my eyes water! Then this &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliner came right off when my eyes started watering, and it left glitter on my checks. Not to mention it looks like you can twist the bottom but you can only use the product at the very top. This eyeliner was very disappointing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Way too glittery for me, when I applied it to the inner corners of my eyes only chunks of glitter went on and it took a long time to finally wash them out. I was hoping for a neutral shimmery slightly sparkly liner to wear for everyday but will be saving this one for a night out or Halloween instead.</li>
            <li> The tip of the pencil came broken however after sharpening, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SO PRETTY! To be honest i wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this product because i have tried a lot of similar product with unfavorable result. But this eyeliner is perfect for highlighting the inner corner of your eyes (which i love to do!) and for making the famous &#x27;aegyo sal&amp;#34; look (which is a must for me :P). I would repurchase this. The product is a sheer sparkly pink that is not too drastic. The packaging is pretty too</li>
            <li> It had huge chunks of glitter in it, does not look as pictured. I was hoping for something more subtle like in the picture but the glitter is VERY obvious and too over-the-top for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented and easy to apply. It&#x27;s kinda hard to take off with a normal makeup wipe but use an oil based remover and you should be good.  I know you&#x27;re supposed to get more product from it but idk how. It&#x27;s beginning to go down and I would like to continue to use it... I haven&#x27;t used it in a while because of that fact.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil. It is not a retractable liner pen. You sharpen it yourself with a regular make up sharpener. Beautiful color. A little sparkle but not overdone. It has staying power as well. I did need one touch up. I want one in every color now!!</li>
            <li> I love this highlight pencil, it make the perfect highlight color except for it has a few specks of glitter. Shimmer is great and awesome but glitter makes it look like i am crying or have watery eyes, and is dangerous for those with contact lenses. Other than that there is really nothing wrong with it. I wouldn&#x27;t particularly say that the glitter is bad, Just personal preference.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner has a nice, light pink/champagne color shimmer. Unlike cheap glitter liners, the color and sparkle actually stay on all day! I use this on my lower waterline and around the corners of my eyes. It makes eyes look wider, more awake, and innocent. However, if I layer it on too thickly it tends to look like my eyes look teary. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the glitter irritating my eyes or flaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s very versatile. I&#x27;ve used it underneath my brows as a highlighter, and I&#x27;ve even blended some onto my lips and worn it underneath a sheer lip gloss. The glitter isn&#x27;t too blindingly bright when blended in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this was a twistable eyeliner because it gums up a little in a regular sharpener (the consistency is softer and more delicate than a typical sharpened pencil) but I wouldn&#x27;t say that is a problem. I&#x27;ll definitely order more colors!</li>
            <li> I needed another eye liner for my under eye because I currently use the rimmel london white eye shadow but it&#x27;s way too white. I really love the color and how it shimmers under my eye. (really brings out my eyes) The quality of the eye liner is really good and much better than most american eye liners especially how much pigment this thing gives. It gives just enough for highlighting under the eye..not something you would apply to your entire lid. PLUS excellent price!! AND fast delivery~ I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> These pens are super smooth, long lasting and sharpenable. I teach ice skating and the girls love the sparkle! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have other shimmery eye liners in silver and white, but I like that this one is pink. I think it complements my skin tone better. It goes on smoothly.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Tip fell off before I got out of package.</li>
            <li> Cute color and it was lovely, but it seemed to have broken soon after I got it.</li>
            <li> Too glittery. Otherwise ok. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a super affordable light pink shimmery eyeliner that goes on very smoothly. Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Cannot sharpen.  The color was beautiful, but I only got about two uses out of it.  Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I love it! The way it looks the smooth texture andeverything...1 problem mines not a pencil..it seem to be like a pen like those twistables eyeliners but the ITS NOT TWISTABLE...I feel like I paid for a pencil not a pen. The pen i that can only used 6 or 7 times only..I can only used the make up that I can see..There no twist or push not like a pencil where you can used a pencil sharpener</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but I broke off the tip of the eyeliner and can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get more out</li>
            <li> So far the best inner corner highlighter I&#x27;ve found, it is long lasting and it sparkles like stars. A must to create innocent angelic makeup look. Just one or two strokes add that extra charisma to your eyes.</li>
            <li> It is not too much or not too little.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply and speaks well too!</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what you see in the picture. The eyeliner goes on smooth. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was waterproof, but it wasn&#x27;t so noticeable by mid-day. The glitters are more noticeable than I thought. (Those hang around for the rest of the day.) I was hoping for a smooth fine glitter all around, and not tiny specks of glitter showing up at different angles.</li>
            <li> Ok until eyeliner needed a sharpening (or roll up as is the case with this particular style of pencil). The roll up function did not work at all, so after a handful of uses, this eyeliner is useless.</li>
