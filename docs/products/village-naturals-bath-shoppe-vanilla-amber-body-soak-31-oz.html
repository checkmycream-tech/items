            <li>The sandalwood has a wonderful, soothing aroma-?</li>

            <li>Great brand of bath salt, we are buying it from time to time for jacuzzi...</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?!!  </li>
            <li>I can say that this is a very nice product, not over powering</li>
            <li>Nice amount of salts for the price as well!</li>
            <li>These salts are a great value at 31 oz for a good price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a runner and walker, and take a fair number of Epsom salt baths.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy and is so nice in the bath.   </li>
            <li>This stuff smells soooo good.</li>
            <li>Amber smells spicy and is good harmony with vanilla.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, it just feels good to relax in a soaking tub.</li>
            <li>Together they make a good combo gift.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>The initial burst of vanilla aroma is wonderful and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love bath salts!</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent!!</li>
            <li>I love village naturals bath salts!</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s whirlpool safe, too!</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent, very relaxing</li>
            <li>The is a nice product.</li>
            <li>My Mother in law absolutely loved this and says she plans to order more.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance too.  </li>
            <li>I love this bath soak.</li>
            <li>All in all, satisfied with purchase.  </li>
            <li>ok though, like I had imagined \\&quot;vanilla amber\\&quot;</li>
            <li>would smell, though it&#x27;s not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Again and as always delivered way ahead of scheduled date and was pleased.</li>
            <li>and I just love the smell and how it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I used this product before and love it.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and the fragrance actually stays with you after the soak (unlike most scented soaks I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
            <li>smell was too strong.</li>
            <li>It came in a huge bottle and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>I think unless they are gently sheltered in a nice bubble-wrap cocoon, there is a 50/50 chance you&#x27;ll be returning</li>
            <li>Makes her feel all spoiled and happy when she takes a nice hot bath after a long winter day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually do not buy anything for only vanilla scent because it is too sweet, but this product is excellent.</li>
            <li>I wanted relaxation and instead received a stressful clean up.  </li>
            <li>Mildly scented with a light \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this product, very relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li>Many Thanks ;</li>
            <li>After about 30 seconds that lovely aroma disappears and turns into a very soapy chemical aroma.</li>
            <li>I do like the scent and amount that is given for the price not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too fragrant and it really does leave your skin soft and easy to exfoliate after a warm, relaxing soak.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky I had another container for it because the container it did come</li>
            <li>All of their salts are a little overwhelming, Lavender had the best smell interestingly enough because I&#x27;m not inclined toward Lavender.</li>
            <li>This smells like a 13 year olds version of Warm Vanilla Sugar mixed with plastic.</li>
            <li>relaxing, and made my skin feel so soft :)</li>
            <li>maybe a bit like a warm vanilla, but different.  </li>
            <li>After about ten minutes of using these crystals, I am ready for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>but it is just right.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Adding these salts to the water is positively LUXURIOUS!</li>
            <li>this was a gift so very appreciated too, worth the price..</li>
            <li>Very large inconvenience.   </li>
            <li>Maybe not as good as you would get from Bath &amp; Body, but at the price, its worth a little sacrifice.</li>
            <li>;-&gt; I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this, so maybe I&#x27;ll let him have some from the NEXT jar! :)</li>
            <li>A must have for all hot bath aficionados.</li>
            <li>The salts seem more of a focal point-skin feels terrific.</li>
            <li>Amazon wraps up the boxes pretty well</li>
            <li>After trying many oils, essences, salts, etc to get a vanilla scent, this finally fits the bill.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Just as the title says very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I will probably use this one just for a foot soak from now on so that I don&#x27;t notice the smell quite as much.</li>
            <li>I find using them in a bath to be very relaxing.</li>
            <li>very relaxing bath soak.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this -</li>
            <li>Use sparingly though, since too much will overpower the senses.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer a generous amount of salt to enjoy the buoyancy of the water in a meditative state.</li>
            <li>Nice soak and does have additional additives to the Dead Sea salts to moisturize skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft after bathtime too!!!</li>
            <li>so the amount received was better when compared to other salts.</li>
            <li>will purchase again and am very pleased with the aroma and the results of taking a bath after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon usually does a pretty good job packing things-these are the only things I have EVER had arrive busted.</li>
            <li>I do think that the company provides a decent amount of product for the price, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because the bath left my skin feeling soft and smooth and eased the ache in my muscles.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this particular scent or brand again.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend smelled it and wants to use some too, but so far I&#x27;ve been reluctant to part with any of it!</li>
            <li>After letting the tub run for a while, I added a generous handful of the salts and came back in five minutes to my bathroom smelling like vanilla Lysol fresh shower spray...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because pretty much every other review indicated that the smell was pleasant, but maybe it&#x27;s just because I use the Lysol fresh shower every morning that I associate the scent so strongly with bathroom</li>
            <li>this was a new experience.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it was pleasant, but heavy and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>They also leave my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried their Jasmine scent and it&#x27;s much lighter, barely there.</li>
            <li>Salts leaked out of package and caused huge mess, salt all over home.</li>
            <li>This was the 1st time I had ever purchased this product and was very pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li>more inclined to blame the sorta delicate container they are shipped in, though.</li>
            <li>which is what I prefer, more of a subtle hint of amber and vanilla in the bath..</li>
            <li>This bath soak is fantastic after a hard days work, especially in winter.</li>
            <li>Amazing after a long hard day to soothe tired, achy muscles and calm the mind and spirit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it can all be related to a salty odor, it&#x27;s much more chemically than any other bath salt</li>
            <li>I was not happy with the smell, too strong for me</li>

            <li> Soft sented and extremely relaxing.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> If possible buy this without any other items.</li>
            <li> The salts are also not colored, they&#x27;re just plain white.</li>
            <li> In these crazy times, this is a simple, luxurious, &amp; very affordable solution for what ails you!</li>
            <li> Bath Salt was all over inside of package and other items I purchased.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS PACKAGE!</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent and the jasmine white tea scent by village naturals, and I have to say I&#x27;m not thrilled with the scent of the vanilla amber.  </li>
            <li> , every time I order them, 2 out of 3 will arrive with the little crystal-thingies rattling around the box.</li>
            <li> Now, no one is looking for a container made of the same stuff Wolverine has coated all over his bones, but something a little sturdier will cut down on the returns.&lt;br /&gt;In summary: rocking product, lame packaging.</li>
            <li> Hard to say, but I&#x27;m thinking the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This may be because it was the least pungent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the aroma is tolerable and subtle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they could really go wrong with Vanilla</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love bath salts! I was at a hotel about 5 years ago and they sold Village Naturals salts. They sold the Sandalwood Amber scent and I LOVED IT! It seems like they dont sell it anymore, so I thought i would try these. NOPE. Not it! This smells like a 13 year olds version of Warm Vanilla Sugar mixed with plastic. Maybe a sneeze of Sandalwood, but thats being nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks. Next!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a runner and walker, and take a fair number of Epsom salt baths. I love the scent of this product, very relaxing and soothing. My boyfriend smelled it and wants to use some too, but so far I&#x27;ve been reluctant to part with any of it! ;-&gt; I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this, so maybe I&#x27;ll let him have some from the NEXT jar! :)</li>
            <li> Amazing after a long hard day to soothe tired, achy muscles and calm the mind and spirit. Fantastic scent!! Long lasting. A must have for all hot bath aficionados.</li>
            <li> I feel obligated to say I have yet to try the salts and have no opinion on the actual products quality yet.  When I received the package, the lid from bath salts was off. Bath Salt was all over inside of package and other items I purchased. Salts leaked out of package and caused huge mess, salt all over home. Very large inconvenience.   I wanted relaxation and instead received a stressful clean up.  BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS PACKAGE! If possible buy this without any other items.</li>
            <li> village naturals is a very good consistant product line. I do like the scent and amount that is given for the price not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This was the 1st time I had ever purchased this product and was very pleasantly surprised.   I&#x27;d definitely buy this brand of bath salts again.   It&#x27;s a great buy and is so nice in the bath.   Lovely fragrance too.  Can&#x27;t recommend the product highly enough if you want to pamper yourself.   Two BIG thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I love this bath soak. I was worried the smell would overwhelm me while I was in the tub but it is just right. It makes my skin so soft after bathtime too!!!</li>
            <li> Mildly scented with a light \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; smell.  All in all, satisfied with purchase.  Nice soak and does have additional additives to the Dead Sea salts to moisturize skin (vitamin E, I believe).  Price was competitive and is 31 oz so the amount received was better when compared to other salts.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells soooo good. It came in a huge bottle and at such a great price. Once i get low I will definitely order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very relaxing, and made my skin feel so soft :)</li>
            <li> Wow!  The scent is soooo soothing! Definitely a must have if your into this type of realxation!  Many Thanks ;o)</li>
            <li> Smells great, and the fragrance actually stays with you after the soak (unlike most scented soaks I&#x27;ve used).  Nice amount of salts for the price as well!</li>
            <li> Just a heads up that this product did not come as pictured. I&#x27;m lucky I had another container for it because the container it did come it wasn&#x27;t as display-worthy as this one. The salts are also not colored, they&#x27;re just plain white. They do smell ok though, like I had imagined \\&quot;vanilla amber\\&quot; would smell, though it&#x27;s not my favorite scent. I added a photo to the page of how it was shipped.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, very relaxing</li>
            <li> Great salts. Great smell. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my college-aged daughter who uses it all the time. I just need to keep it coming now!</li>
            <li> Just as the title says very pleasing. Soft sented and extremely relaxing. Again and as always delivered way ahead of scheduled date and was pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent and the jasmine white tea scent by village naturals, and I have to say I&#x27;m not thrilled with the scent of the vanilla amber.  I do think that the company provides a decent amount of product for the price, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this one.  After letting the tub run for a while, I added a generous handful of the salts and came back in five minutes to my bathroom smelling like vanilla Lysol fresh shower spray... I&#x27;m disappointed because pretty much every other review indicated that the smell was pleasant, but maybe it&#x27;s just because I use the Lysol fresh shower every morning that I associate the scent so strongly with bathroom cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;This scent just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s a shame because the bath left my skin feeling soft and smooth and eased the ache in my muscles. I will probably use this one just for a foot soak from now on so that I don&#x27;t notice the smell quite as much.</li>
            <li> These salts are a great value at 31 oz for a good price.  Have tried a lot of different salts &amp; these definitely add something different.  The salts seem more of a focal point-skin feels terrific. Great for mind &amp; body relaxation, soothe sore muscles. The sandalwood has a wonderful, soothing aroma-? maybe a bit like a warm vanilla, but different.  Found it to be helpful to encourage a salt-soak bath prior to calling it a night. Promotes a deep &amp; restful sleep.  Recommend someone keeping an eye on the bather as these salts are ultra-relaxing!  In these crazy times, this is a simple, luxurious, &amp; very affordable solution for what ails you!</li>
            <li> I can say that this is a very nice product, not over powering which is what I prefer, more of a subtle hint of amber and vanilla in the bath..this was a gift so very appreciated too, worth the price..</li>
            <li> The is a nice product. Maybe not as good as you would get from Bath &amp; Body, but at the price, its worth a little sacrifice.</li>
            <li> I love village naturals bath salts! The bath salts smell really great. I find using them in a bath to be very relaxing. They also leave my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> container for bath salts was as illustrated. i ordered five and four of the lids were taped so as not to spill the contents by a lid coming off during shipment. an earlier shipment was not packaged as well and the lid came off during shipment. very relaxing bath soak. will purchase again and am very pleased with the aroma and the results of taking a bath after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li> This is the best bath salt to soak in for me and I just love the smell and how it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about how it detoxifies and improves your circulation as described in the product page but I do like this a lot. It&#x27;s not too fragrant and it really does leave your skin soft and easy to exfoliate after a warm, relaxing soak.</li>
            <li> I usually do not buy anything for only vanilla scent because it is too sweet, but this product is excellent. Amber smells spicy and is good harmony with vanilla.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this - it&#x27;s not at all girly, but it is relaxing!  My boyfriend even uses it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these things. Makes her feel all spoiled and happy when she takes a nice hot bath after a long winter day.&lt;br /&gt;So why only 3 stars John?&lt;br /&gt;Because, every time I order them, 2 out of 3 will arrive with the little crystal-thingies rattling around the box. Amazon wraps up the boxes pretty well so the UPS guy doesn&#x27;t have a sea of bath salts on the floor of his truck..but I often end up just refusing the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it the container or is it Amazon? Hard to say, but I&#x27;m thinking the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon usually does a pretty good job packing things-these are the only things I have EVER had arrive busted. I think unless they are gently sheltered in a nice bubble-wrap cocoon, there is a 50/50 chance you&#x27;ll be returning it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more inclined to blame the sorta delicate container they are shipped in, though. Now, no one is looking for a container made of the same stuff Wolverine has coated all over his bones, but something a little sturdier will cut down on the returns.&lt;br /&gt;In summary: rocking product, lame packaging.</li>
            <li> I used this product before and love it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it just feels good to relax in a soaking tub. Adding these salts to the water is positively LUXURIOUS!</li>
            <li> Soak your stress away~~~!!! What&#x27;s not to love?!!  Buy it and go take a deep bath with zen music on, thank me later.</li>
            <li> After trying many oils, essences, salts, etc to get a vanilla scent, this finally fits the bill. Use sparingly though, since too much will overpower the senses.</li>
            <li> This bath soak is fantastic after a hard days work, especially in winter. After about ten minutes of using these crystals, I am ready for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Side note: I ran across these at Target for $3. Bonus is they carried 4 different scents and I could test smell them before purchase. All of their salts are a little overwhelming, Lavender had the best smell interestingly enough because I&#x27;m not inclined toward Lavender. This may be because it was the least pungent.&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;The smell was too strong. Hours after a bath I could still smell it in the air. Unfortunately it was pleasant, but heavy and overwhelming. I&#x27;ve tried their Jasmine scent and it&#x27;s much lighter, barely there. But is definitely preferable to the Vanilla Amber. I didn&#x27;t think they could really go wrong with Vanilla but I regret my choice.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for a Christmas gift along with a bath pillow. Together they make a good combo gift. My Mother in law absolutely loved this and says she plans to order more. Said they are nicer than what you would buy say at CVS, Walgreens, etc.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it before so this was a new experience.  Loved it.  Smelled great but not overpowering and not too flowery.  Just right.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the smell, too strong for me</li>
            <li> The initial burst of vanilla aroma is wonderful and very pleasant. After about 30 seconds that lovely aroma disappears and turns into a very soapy chemical aroma. I&#x27;m not sure if it can all be related to a salty odor, it&#x27;s much more chemically than any other bath salt I&#x27;ve ever use. If you use a frugal amount of the bath salt the aroma is tolerable and subtle. I personally prefer a generous amount of salt to enjoy the buoyancy of the water in a meditative state. I would not buy this particular scent or brand again.</li>
            <li> Great brand of bath salt, we are buying it from time to time for jacuzzi...</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she LOVES it. She says it&#x27;s whirlpool safe, too! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. Cheaper than buying at Target!</li>
