            <li> It provides a very slippery layer, which allows my razor to glide across my skin as I shave.  No more friction.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> This product is so sweet and leaves you so smooth and is EXACTLY what it is advertised for.....a &#x27;smooth&#x27; finish for all of that &#x27;down-there-hair&#x27; you wanna look good for.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of products that claim they don&#x27;t leave you with razor burn.  This is the only product I have found that lets me shave and never get razor burn on my neck or face.  Smells good, lathers nicely, no complaints.</li>
            <li> OUCH!  I had a rash on my neck for WEEKS after using this with a wet/dry cordless razor.  I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> unlike all the dumb commercials which show smooth shave - this is real. I used it today and its great. Highly recommended for people with sensitive skin and it gives a cool after effect.</li>
            <li> Gel is great product. I am very pleased with my purchase and will likely reorder once I need more.  Has cooling effect on skin.</li>
            <li> Strong smelling, not real pleasant...&lt;br /&gt;Unpleasant stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;Not as smooth as other lotions I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend this product. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bump Patrol products for a while now. I am one who has sensitive skin and when I shave it looks like amateur night at the butcher shop.&lt;br /&gt;This product along with the After Shave Treatment are part of my daily use and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to get these products in local stores but for some reason they are no longer available in my area, therefore&lt;br /&gt;I have been ordering them here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin like I do, this product does give good skin protection as well as a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Highly pleased with line of shaving products.</li>
            <li> This Worked well! I am Very satisfied with this product! I Would order it again. It was shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years because I am African American and have sensitive skin and complications with shaving.  Best product for me and my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and always get the closest shave without irritation.  paired with the aftershave, I have been using this awesome combo for over a year now and wont ever use anything else.</li>
            <li> Before using Bump Patrol, I used Magic Shave for roughly 20 plus years. I highly recommend Bump Patrol over Magic Shave. Bump Patrol gives me a much better shave than Magic Shave ever did. As long as Bump Patrol is on the market, I will continue to use the shave gel and after shave. Trust me once you go Bump Patrol, you&#x27;ll never want to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Been using Bump Patrol products for a few years and it has helped me alot.  My razor bumps and burns have been an issue for a long time. I have tried, Foam (Barbasol), Gel (Gillette), Art of Shaving, Lab Series, etc. none of them helped me as much as Bump Patrol has.  You must get the After Shave too, use them together.</li>
            <li> I did not like this. It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I suffer with extreme sensitive skin, and razor burn, which in conjunction created bums all over my face. My dermatologist prescribes two medication, both of which I will not comment on, but I digress, both items cost me on average $350 to $400 after insurance coverage, and both worked wonders on my face. My face was finally clean, however, the cost to value ratio made no sense to me so I decided to buy non-prescribed, shaving gel, and I was very lucky to stumble on to this item, and it continues to work great, which is better than I expected. I&#x27;m not sure where I would be if not for this gel. Excellent money saver, and works as good as prescribe items. How I use set item. Instead of first applying the shave gel, since I use trimmers, and I thought it could potentially damage my trimmers I decided to use it as my second to the last step before applying Bump Patrol Razor Bump Intensive Treatment (Sensitive Formula). Meaning I let this gel alleviate, the burning sensation my skin feel after shaving. Another pro, I notice is that if left on roughly 5-10 minute, help darkens one&#x27;s beard. Save your self some money and give it a try.</li>
            <li> For me the best product for shaving your beard. Last for a lot of time, with a tiny amount you Will have your face full of foam.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works about time I found something that actually does what it says... Which it came in bigger bottle size...</li>
            <li> I like it because it helps the razor to glide smoothly on your skin.I use to buy at our local store but now through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice product, received on time and every thing was excellent. Will  recommend to every one. I really appreciate the good service.</li>
            <li> I received  Bump Patrol Cool Shave Gel timely and have used it for nice smooth shaving.  Thanks for the quick response.</li>
            <li> Like the texture, the scent, its easy to wash or wipe. I don&#x27;t use anything else since I have started using this. I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Been using it for years and really makes for a smooth shave. I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin that would always make for painful razor bumps and rash after shaving with typical shaving cream. Since switching to this and following up with a Tend Skin aftershave, no problems at all. Awesome!</li>
