            <li>Great lathering</li>
            <li>A great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s still a very nice, earthy smell that isn&#x27;t flowery.</li>
            <li>Smells so good.</li>
            <li>The scent is good and has some staying power for a shave cream.  </li>

            <li>Nice smelling, whips up a good lather.</li>
            <li>34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34;,  and 2 times better quality!</li>
            <li>Love Trumper shaving cream!</li>
            <li>The moisturizing is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving cream that I&#x27;ve ever used and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it really is the best soap out there.</li>
            <li>With just a bit more water it makes a good amount of lather.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up nice and provides a nice lubricant barrier.</li>
            <li>and this came in a nice re sealable container that I might keep my conk soap in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great smell but is not overpowering, it lathers up well with just a small amount, and best of all it eliminates razor burn for me.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how smooth it is (better then shaving soap in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>This product lathers nicely and makes shaving easy on your face.</li>
            <li>way it could be better would be if it was cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Miles better than the drug store stuff.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood scent is sofisticated and not overpowering but definitely notable even well after you shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to use a bit more cream to create a thicker lather for a better shave.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is simply the best lathering soap I have tried, and I have tried Taylor&#x27;s, Art of shaving, Proraso, Colonel conks.</li>
            <li>so I think there is better value elsewhere.</li>
            <li>sandalwood better than Trumper&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have used this for over 5 years and it is excellent and properly priced</li>
            <li>We both love the fragrance and he loves the way it lathers.</li>
            <li>Get their Coconut version if you want something with better lather.</li>
            <li>Not to mention three blades shaves better than one.</li>
            <li>This is a one of my favorite shaving creams.</li>
            <li>The tub lasts forever - you do not need much product at all to build a great lather.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that it smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>This particular cream just feels great going on.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful old fashioned space.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>This a nice mild none chemical smell sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li>These tubs last forever so don&#x27;t worry about the price- you spend more than this at happy hour tightwad</li>
            <li>Trumper&#x27;s shaving cream is great, but you definitely need a brush to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>Before you buy this soap I strongly recommend trying a sample before you invest 30+ dollars for something you don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>It honestly is average at best.</li>
            <li>This is hands down THE BEST I have ever found and</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is smooth, holds it&#x27;s form and leaves moisture in the skin.</li>
            <li>(Although I still enjoy using my Proraso soap as well)/</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaves with this.  </li>
            <li>Really smooth shave</li>
            <li>I find it to be a fantastic bargain in terms of of price versus performance.</li>
            <li>Fantastic lather.</li>
            <li>So, you&#x27;re thinking about DE/Safety razor shaving and you want to go all in with the brush, and old school shave cream-the good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has a kind of a classic barbershop type smell</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m still on the original container and will probably need to re-order in January.</li>
            <li>Ever since the first time I walked into the Geo F. Trumper store on Jermyn Street in London I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the sandalwood shaving cream for my Dad about 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure you will also become a fan.</li>
            <li>nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont be fooled by the high price, this product is an excellent value when you consider how long a jar lasts.</li>
            <li>This is my third type of soap/cream and so far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Its good, and its very creamy and soft; but; where is the sandalwood scent?</li>
            <li>Like most sandalwood scents the severe reduction of harvesting of sandalwood has resulted in most formulations dropping actual sandalwood oil from their formulations.</li>
            <li>I started using this product recently and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I normally like Truefitt and Hill&#x27;s sandalwood cream (which smells great) and will be going back.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed at how well this lathers with my new Perfecto shaving brush and how nice a shave I obtained.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the cost?  </li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent that is  invigorating and definitely manly.</li>
            <li>Worth the money?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;TOBS is pretty close and half the price, but this is still a great cream.</li>
            <li>As for it&#x27;s primary function as a shaving cream, I rate this as a decent performer.</li>
            <li>and you feel real classy with the fine shave</li>
            <li>In my opinion, I get a better, richer lather and use less product than with comparable creams like Art of Shaving, so Trumper&#x27;s lasts longer (and is a better value).</li>
            <li>; personally i find the creams are far superior in lathering compared to soaps.</li>
            <li>And because so little is needed, it&#x27;s a surprisingly good value.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch from the canned lather to a brush and lathering soap, so this was my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am having to re-train myself on how much cream I need to put on the brush!  </li>
            <li>I shave with this soap 2-3 times a week, and I am just now getting to the bottom of my first jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It generates a rich moist lather with s good cushion and is very slick.</li>
            <li>Bottom, to easily grab it, since it contours to your palm.&lt;br /&gt;easy open lid, with tracks on the side to help when wet.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
            <li>A very decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li>A tiny amount foams up prodigiously and lubricates well to provide a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I really like the sandalwood scent of Edwin Jagger and Art of Shaving, as a comparison.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>My TBOS has a much better scent while this has really no scent of anything at all.</li>
            <li>, that is really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>so you really need a brush to use it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this shave cream.  </li>
            <li>Good, thick lather.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way, has a great but not overpowering scent and my razor glides across my face.</li>
            <li>classic scent.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great manly scent that is subtle enough as to not be overbearing.</li>
            <li>It seems like going back to an old style safety razor is three steps backward in technology and is much less safe and more likely to result in nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Fairly new to &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34</li>
            <li>All time favorite shave product thus far is the Proraso soap in the green tub which I could buy 3 tubs of compared to one of the Trumper&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Nice, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>You really only need to sweep your brush lightly to get a small amount, which is more than enough for three passes.</li>
            <li>Only takes a small amount for a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Seems that you only need very little to lather up, so should last a good while.  </li>
            <li>This has been my least favorite of the sandalwood scents I have tried.</li>
            <li>item says \\&quot;Geo F. Trumper Soft Shaving Cream Jar, Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>F. Trumper Soft Shaving Cream in Bowl, Sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;Sold</li>
            <li>There are a few others out there that are definitely &#x27;solids&#x27; but you will like this one for sure.  </li>
            <li>It is expensive, but this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t originally familiar with the sandalwood fragrance and it took a few days to grow accustomed to it.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but absolutely worth the indulgence!</li>
            <li>The scent is less musky and super floral.  </li>
            <li>there such a thing as a new and old version of this cream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quite slick and give comfortable shave although I use Mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large jar too, so I can only assume that it will last me quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nice and lubricates well, even after a few days of growth, but the scent is not very nice (to me).</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the scent and overall</li>
            <li>Nice but not overly fragrant, smooth shaving on par with my other shave cream products and less expensive.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice thick slick foam that smells</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount of product on your brush to whip up a rich lather that is very slick.  </li>
            <li>Quite expensive, but may actually be cost effective if it lasts as long as I think it may.  </li>

            <li> It generates a rich moist lather with s good cushion and is very slick.</li>
            <li> Bottom, to easily grab it, since it contours to your palm.&lt;br /&gt;easy open lid, with tracks on the side to help when wet.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
            <li> A very decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount foams up prodigiously and lubricates well to provide a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I really like the sandalwood scent of Edwin Jagger and Art of Shaving, as a comparison.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My TBOS has a much better scent while this has really no scent of anything at all.</li>
            <li> , that is really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> so you really need a brush to use it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Good, thick lather.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, has a great but not overpowering scent and my razor glides across my face.</li>
            <li> classic scent.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great manly scent that is subtle enough as to not be overbearing.</li>
            <li> It seems like going back to an old style safety razor is three steps backward in technology and is much less safe and more likely to result in nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Fairly new to &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34</li>
            <li> All time favorite shave product thus far is the Proraso soap in the green tub which I could buy 3 tubs of compared to one of the Trumper&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Nice, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> You really only need to sweep your brush lightly to get a small amount, which is more than enough for three passes.</li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount for a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Seems that you only need very little to lather up, so should last a good while.  </li>
            <li> This has been my least favorite of the sandalwood scents I have tried.</li>
            <li> item says \\&quot;Geo F. Trumper Soft Shaving Cream Jar, Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> F. Trumper Soft Shaving Cream in Bowl, Sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;Sold</li>
            <li> There are a few others out there that are definitely &#x27;solids&#x27; but you will like this one for sure.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t originally familiar with the sandalwood fragrance and it took a few days to grow accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but absolutely worth the indulgence!</li>
            <li> The scent is less musky and super floral.  </li>
            <li> there such a thing as a new and old version of this cream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quite slick and give comfortable shave although I use Mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large jar too, so I can only assume that it will last me quite a while.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nice and lubricates well, even after a few days of growth, but the scent is not very nice (to me).</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the scent and overall</li>
            <li> Nice but not overly fragrant, smooth shaving on par with my other shave cream products and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice thick slick foam that smells</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount of product on your brush to whip up a rich lather that is very slick.  </li>
            <li> Quite expensive, but may actually be cost effective if it lasts as long as I think it may.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a shaving cream product that lathers as much as this does with such a small amount.  </li>
            <li> As numerous other comments indicate, I would echo a similar opinion on the fragrance level of this shaving cream as &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My expectation is that this tub will last for at least 9 months to a year which makes it a decent value.  </li>
            <li> It takes so little of this to produce a thick lather, I&#x27;m not sure when I will need more, but I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Lathers up well and doesn&#x27;t dry out on my face like the some others I have tried (like the overpriced kelp cream I purchased at the Art Of Shaving at the mall).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go back to any other cream after using this!</li>
            <li> I put a bit on a wet brush and put the brush in a dry shaving mug and take it into the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor for a few years now, and still occasionally did a regular razor shave, but now I have been using the electric razor much less.  </li>
            <li> Once you use it a few times, you&#x27;ll be surprised just how little of the product you need for up to three shaving passes.  </li>
            <li> I anticipate it will last at least 8 months at the rate I&#x27;m using it, possibly longer.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to conventional shaving cream, it&#x27;s harder to use.</li>
            <li> I look forward to testing some other scents but wouldn&#x27;t have any reservation recommending this one.  </li>
            <li> Will be trying other Trumper shave creams.</li>
            <li> have other Sandalwood items from Geo F Trumper and they all are OKAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> review is NOT consistent with other reviews</li>
            <li> and it seems I&#x27;ve hardly scratched the surface of the total amount of material.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I believe this jar will last me at least 2 months.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle and doesn&#x27;t last long after the shave, but then I use an unscented moisturizer after the shave, and this seems to neutralize the scent.  </li>
            <li> but with the little amount needed for each shave, I imagine this bottle will last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells like baby diaper cream a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Plus you use so little</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off</li>
            <li> Hard to detect if a person is not very close to you.  </li>
            <li> Dried shaving cream is all over the shaving cream container and inside the box.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that the cake is firm</li>
            <li> and this smells harsh without any trace of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> He continues to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the container, at least 7-8% of the shaving cream is missing due to the leakage..</li>
            <li> The smell is so subtle and manly.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this cream, but I do like others that cost less</li>
            <li> Subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wild about the sandalwood scent of this shaving cream, but the lather is ABSURD!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my third type of soap/cream and so far the best I&#x27;ve tried. You really only need to sweep your brush lightly to get a small amount, which is more than enough for three passes. A little goes a very long way, has a great but not overpowering scent and my razor glides across my face.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of shaving gel, foam, and cream in my day and could never shave without getting razor burn. This is hands down THE BEST I have ever found and I will never try anything else again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell but is not overpowering, it lathers up well with just a small amount, and best of all it eliminates razor burn for me. It may not be the cheapest on the market but with the little amount needed for each shave, I imagine this bottle will last me at least a year. (I shave about once every 3 days)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving cream that I&#x27;ve ever used and smells really good. The moisturizing is amazing as well. I definitely recommend this product and I hope this never gets obsolete or discontinued.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch from the canned lather to a brush and lathering soap, so this was my first purchase.  I was absolutely amazed at how well this lathers with my new Perfecto shaving brush and how nice a shave I obtained.  I have been using an electric razor for a few years now, and still occasionally did a regular razor shave, but now I have been using the electric razor much less.  The scent is very subtle and doesn&#x27;t last long after the shave, but then I use an unscented moisturizer after the shave, and this seems to neutralize the scent.  It takes so little of this to produce a thick lather, I&#x27;m not sure when I will need more, but I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the smell of it when i shave my head</li>
            <li> Smells so good. Only takes a small amount for a nice close shave. Face feels great after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wild about the sandalwood scent of this shaving cream, but the lather is ABSURD!  I have never used a shaving cream product that lathers as much as this does with such a small amount.  It&#x27;s a large jar too, so I can only assume that it will last me quite a while.  I am having to re-train myself on how much cream I need to put on the brush!  The scent is less musky and super floral.  To me, it smells like baby diaper cream a little bit.  I really like the sandalwood scent of Edwin Jagger and Art of Shaving, as a comparison.  I&#x27;ll try another scent of Geo Trumper just because the lather is so good!</li>
            <li> Trumper has been and remains one of the best.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is smooth, holds it&#x27;s form and leaves moisture in the skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice thick slick foam that smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Very classic scent.&lt;br /&gt;Only way it could be better would be if it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;TOBS is pretty close and half the price, but this is still a great cream.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go back to any other cream after using this!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN SHAVING WITH A GEO. TRUMPER BADGER BRUSH AND SANDALWOOD SHAVE CREAM FOR OVER 20&lt;br /&gt;YEARS. THERE IS NO SHAVE CREAM THAT EVEN APPROACHES IT FOR GLIDING ABILITY AND GENTLENESS i STILL&lt;br /&gt;HAVE MY CHINA TRUMPER CREAM JAR WHICH I CHERISH DEARLY. IF TRUMPER CEASED PRODUCTION I WOULD HAVE TO GROW A BEARD!</li>
            <li> This review is for my husband.  He says that if he must shave, this makes it bearable and is a necessary indulgence.  Now nothing else will do.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  Not overpowering at all.  Lathers up great.  Just picked up my second jar.</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality&lt;br /&gt;Attention to detail:&lt;br /&gt;round Bottom, to easily grab it, since it contours to your palm.&lt;br /&gt;easy open lid, with tracks on the side to help when wet.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING leather Quality!&lt;br /&gt;Same Price as Retail &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34;,  and 2 times better quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shave cream now for about a month. Miles better than the drug store stuff. A small amount goes a long way. Helps give a nick-free close shave. The sandalwood scent is sofisticated and not overpowering but definitely notable even well after you shave (this was what I was looking for). Will definitely be my go to shaving cream from now on!</li>
            <li> As numerous other comments indicate, I would echo a similar opinion on the fragrance level of this shaving cream as &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34;. I wasn&#x27;t originally familiar with the sandalwood fragrance and it took a few days to grow accustomed to it. I look forward to testing some other scents but wouldn&#x27;t have any reservation recommending this one.  As for it&#x27;s primary function as a shaving cream, I rate this as a decent performer. I anticipate it will last at least 8 months at the rate I&#x27;m using it, possibly longer.  Update Dec 2, 2015 I&#x27;ve learned to use a bit more cream to create a thicker lather for a better shave. I shave about 2 times per week, give or take.  That said, I&#x27;m still on the original container and will probably need to re-order in January.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Fairly new to &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34; personally i find the creams are far superior in lathering compared to soaps. (Although I still enjoy using my Proraso soap as well)/ This particular cream just feels great going on. Not cheap, but absolutely worth the indulgence! I ge an excellent shave with no razor burn at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaves with this.  Good, thick lather.  The scent is good and has some staying power for a shave cream.  Will be trying other Trumper shave creams.</li>
            <li> One of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shaving creams. Put a dab of cream in my left palm while I&#x27;m in the shower, lather for 30 seconds with a silver tip badger brush...and make a sensual process of scraping hair off my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about a year now, and I am still on the same jar. I shave with this soap 2-3 times a week, and I am just now getting to the bottom of my first jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply the best lathering soap I have tried, and I have tried Taylor&#x27;s, Art of shaving, Proraso, Colonel conks. The smell is so subtle and manly. The sandalwood skin food has a slightly different smell, but they match rather nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont be fooled by the high price, this product is an excellent value when you consider how long a jar lasts. Not to mention it really is the best soap out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve used TOBS before and was impressed but the Geo. F Trumper is definitely a step above. I&#x27;ve yet to have any irritation using this and it feels great.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this cream, but I do like others that cost less so I think there is better value elsewhere. This has been my least favorite of the sandalwood scents I have tried. I like both Art of Shaving and Edwin Jagger sandalwood better than Trumper&#x27;s. All time favorite shave product thus far is the Proraso soap in the green tub which I could buy 3 tubs of compared to one of the Trumper&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over 5 years and it is excellent and properly priced</li>
            <li> Bought this just looking for something that might help with razor burn.  I was pleasantly surprised by the scent and overall fell of the cream.  Plus you use so little I believe this jar will last me at least 2 months.  I use just a dab with my shave brush and it makes a plenty of foam for me.  I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product lathers nicely and makes shaving easy on your face.</li>
            <li> Trumpet is the best. It&#x27;s an experience each time you shave</li>
            <li> Its good, and its very creamy and soft; but; where is the sandalwood scent? Not even close. My TBOS has a much better scent while this has really no scent of anything at all. Is it worth the cost?  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. We both love the fragrance and he loves the way it lathers. If you&#x27;re used to conventional shaving cream, it&#x27;s harder to use. He had to watch YouTube videos to learn how to use the cream and shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff. Lathers up well and doesn&#x27;t dry out on my face like the some others I have tried (like the overpriced kelp cream I purchased at the Art Of Shaving at the mall).</li>
            <li> A very decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, whips up a good lather.</li>
            <li> The product I received seems to be an open-box product. The box containing the shaving cream had wrinkles as if someone had opened it. Furthermore, the interior of the box shows signs of severe leakage. Dried shaving cream is all over the shaving cream container and inside the box. Upon opening the container, at least 7-8% of the shaving cream is missing due to the leakage..</li>
            <li> Get their Coconut version if you want something with better lather. These tubs last forever so don&#x27;t worry about the price- you spend more than this at happy hour tightwad and this will last a year.</li>
            <li> Came on time and great product! Really smooth shave and you feel real classy with the fine shave this gives you.</li>
            <li> Love Trumper shaving cream! A tiny amount foams up prodigiously and lubricates well to provide a very close and comfortable shave. Subtle scent. And because so little is needed, it&#x27;s a surprisingly good value.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out shaving with a safety razor recently and chose to use this cream with it.  I am very pleased with how smooth it is (better then shaving soap in my opinion).  I had no idea what sandalwood smelled like but I thought I would take my chances and it turned out good.  It has a kind of a classic barbershop type smell, that is really what I was looking for.  I might try out different ones in the future but this has such a traditional scent I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice, subtle scent.  Hard to detect if a person is not very close to you.  Quite slick and give comfortable shave although I use Mach 3 razor.  It seems like going back to an old style safety razor is three steps backward in technology and is much less safe and more likely to result in nicks and cuts.  Not to mention three blades shaves better than one. Seems that you only need very little to lather up, so should last a good while.  Quite expensive, but may actually be cost effective if it lasts as long as I think it may.  I&#x27;ve been using it a month and it seems I&#x27;ve hardly scratched the surface of the total amount of material.</li>
            <li> I started using this product recently and am very pleased with it.  You only need a tiny amount of product on your brush to whip up a rich lather that is very slick.  My expectation is that this tub will last for at least 9 months to a year which makes it a decent value.  The sandalwood smell is good without being overpowering.  Just keep in mind that the cake is firm so you really need a brush to use it.  I&#x27;ve no doubt that when I&#x27;m almost done with this I&#x27;ll order another.  Great product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but this is good stuff. I put a bit on a wet brush and put the brush in a dry shaving mug and take it into the shower. With just a bit more water it makes a good amount of lather.  Very good shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is a one of my favorite shaving creams. I find it to be a fantastic bargain in terms of of price versus performance. It generates a rich moist lather with s good cushion and is very slick. It has a nice scent that is  invigorating and definitely manly. Like most sandalwood scents the severe reduction of harvesting of sandalwood has resulted in most formulations dropping actual sandalwood oil from their formulations. That&#x27;s the case here. But, it&#x27;s still a very nice, earthy smell that isn&#x27;t flowery. I keep this cream in regular rotation.</li>
            <li> So, you&#x27;re thinking about DE/Safety razor shaving and you want to go all in with the brush, and old school shave cream-the good stuff.  There are a few others out there that are definitely &#x27;solids&#x27; but you will like this one for sure.  Once you use it a few times, you&#x27;ll be surprised just how little of the product you need for up to three shaving passes.  Absolutely recommend this shave cream.  I also use the GF Trumper Sandalwood Skin Food for aftershave.  Great pairing.</li>
            <li> The best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used abd great smell. Currently using a Merkur DE Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people rave about this.  It honestly is average at best.</li>
            <li> Smells like a cigarette ashtray.&lt;br /&gt;I have other Sandalwood items from Geo F Trumper and they all are OKAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is NOT consistent with other reviews so I am wondering if I received a DIFFERENT formula.&lt;br /&gt;Is there such a thing as a new and old version of this cream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I purchased was in a bowl like that shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;This item says \\&quot;Geo F. Trumper Soft Shaving Cream Jar, Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I purchased was the following:&lt;br /&gt;Geo F. Trumper Soft Shaving Cream in Bowl, Sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: RoyalShave (seller profile)</li>
            <li> It lathers nice and lubricates well, even after a few days of growth, but the scent is not very nice (to me). I like sandalwood shave cream and this smells harsh without any trace of sandalwood. Before you buy this soap I strongly recommend trying a sample before you invest 30+ dollars for something you don&#x27;t like. I normally like Truefitt and Hill&#x27;s sandalwood cream (which smells great) and will be going back. I only give this cream 2 stars for the scent, it would be 4 or 5 if the scent doesn&#x27;t bother you.</li>
            <li> Great lathering and I feel like James bond when I use it!</li>
            <li> Trumper&#x27;s shaving cream is great, but you definitely need a brush to get the most out of it. The tub lasts forever - you do not need much product at all to build a great lather. In my opinion, I get a better, richer lather and use less product than with comparable creams like Art of Shaving, so Trumper&#x27;s lasts longer (and is a better value). Scent is obviously subjective, but to me the Sandalwood is &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; woodsy but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> A great shaving cream.  Worth the money?  Probably not but what the heck!</li>
            <li> IMHO the best shaving cream money can buy, end of story. Great manly scent that is subtle enough as to not be overbearing. Fantastic lather. A quality product through and through. I&#x27;ve used both this and the Limes, and like them both, I have some coconut scent waiting in the wings as a travel cream (tube)</li>
            <li> Best shave ever.  Have used this product for 11 years.  Never varies this amount lasts about 1 year.</li>
            <li> Tried Geo F. Trumper after reading numerous reviews. Nice but not overly fragrant, smooth shaving on par with my other shave cream products and less expensive. This a nice mild none chemical smell sandalwood fragrance. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ever since the first time I walked into the Geo F. Trumper store on Jermyn Street in London I fell in love.  It is a beautiful old fashioned space.  You can imagine Edwardian gentlemen stopping off for a shave.  I originally bought the sandalwood shaving cream for my Dad about 15 years ago.  He continues to use it everyday.  My brother opted for the lime.  Every male friend and family that I have I introduced to this wonderful product has also become a fan.  Did I mention that it smells lovely.  Get it.  I am pretty sure you will also become a fan.</li>
            <li> Not the best I ever used but it&#x27;s pretty good. Lathers up nice and provides a nice lubricant barrier. The smell is a little off but it&#x27;s not bad at all. I might try a different scent next time. Also I travel about 10 months a year and this came in a nice re sealable container that I might keep my conk soap in.</li>
