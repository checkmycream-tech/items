            <li>It s the best &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>a delightful aroma.  </li>
            <li>Afta is the best product on the market for an after shaving lotion/cream.  </li>
            <li>It is the best there is at soothing razor burn from either an electric razor or a bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>I have used Afta since 1977 and still find it to be the best there is.  </li>
            <li>It is most invigorating!!!</li>

            <li>A good value for the dollar, and it keeps the wife happy.</li>
            <li>Nice try!</li>
            <li>Great lotion, good smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a moisturizing after shave with a good perfume in cologne like concentration, this would be a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best after shave in the market for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my face smooth</li>
            <li>I liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving this hard-to-find aroma for years</li>
            <li>Always a great skin moisturizer with just the right fragrance</li>
            <li>Well the price was right, the product arrived quickly and the smell is great!</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin better than Gillette after shave but unlike Gillette, the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li>You had better stock up on it through Amazon while you still can.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this product and I love the way he smells after shaving.  </li>
            <li>after-shave creams, and it is much much better.  </li>
            <li>Obviously I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I have  used this for years, but buying 5 at a time here is even greater</li>
            <li>and I noticed right away, but not in a good way</li>
            <li>Just picture a 65 year old man going on a date and slapping this stuff on trying to smell like a million dollars but instead smelled like the 1950&#x27;s lol.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune like all of those other brands do and it is a wonderful after shave.</li>
            <li>It is still available in Europe.  </li>
            <li>Original AFTA was a blueish cream that</li>
            <li>After Shave Conditioner is a wonderfully smooth and very protective cream to use on your closely-shaven skin on your face!!  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want that sweet smelling after shave lotion, try this.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and pleasant, and much nicer than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; scent of the same product name.  </li>
            <li>I like both this Fresh scented Afta and the Original scented.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really the only way I can describe it lol.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly as described.</li>
            <li>It dry&#x27;s quickly and has a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>It says fresh scent</li>
            <li>but it really just smells old and strong</li>
            <li>Very happy, please note my notes on the other Afta shave balm purchased at the same time in relation to sending product directly to NZ.</li>
            <li>I prefer Purchasing certain Items in bulk, rather than going to a Store and Buying one Item at a time.  </li>
            <li>Very very highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satified with this transaction.</li>
            <li>I have sensititve skin, so using the Orange Edge along with the Afta really works well for me.</li>
            <li>He says it is very soothing to his skin.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to the skin,</li>
            <li>This product really protects your face after shaving.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented , in a couple different varieties.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it way to strong in scent but it also smells like an old man in my opinion(no disrespect intended) like something my grandfather would wear.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, subtle fragrance that has garnered many compliments over the years from the women I have held close.</li>
            <li>your skin.you&#x27;ll feel brand new and refreshed after you use it.</li>
            <li>My 28 year old boyfriend just bought this</li>
            <li>It disappears into the skin within 10 seconds, but leaves your face soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Wish they sold this in a store near me</li>
            <li>But man, does it cool down razor burn.  </li>
            <li>The fragarance is subtle and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>but no other after shave is as soothing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Afta is becoming very hard to find in local stores.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This after-shave gel is difficult to find, but is well worth the effort to get it.  </li>
            <li> Finding the Fresh scent in my local grocery stores is almost impossible, so Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than those other \\&quot;Mennen\\&quot;</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using Mary Kay for Men products, one a conditioner and one a balm with a fragrance.</li>

            <li> Have received  compliments in the past for the scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on line because sometimes it is difficult to purchase at local stores.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores these days.  </li>
            <li> but if you are under the age of 50 I&#x27;d be shocked.  </li>
            <li> This way, when I go to the store I won&#x27;t be disappointed when it&#x27;s not on the shelf again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  Shipped promptly.    Wish I could find it at the store.</li>
            <li> Used for decades. Always a great skin moisturizer with just the right fragrance</li>
            <li> I have used Mennen After Shave Lotion for many years but this particular brand has become impossible to get in my area, so I went to Amazon.com and purchased this item. I&#x27;m very satified with this transaction.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Only after shave my husband uses and takes care after shave dryness</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart. It moisturizes my skin better than Gillette after shave but unlike Gillette, the smell lasts all day. Walmart&#x27;s price was about $2, the same as Gillette. If you are looking for a moisturizing after shave with a good perfume in cologne like concentration, this would be a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for yeras.  It s the best &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; product I have found.  I have sensititve skin, so using the Orange Edge along with the Afta really works well for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best, most soothing aftershave lotion that I have ever used.  I do not understand why Colgate Palmolive decided to quit selling it in the United States.  It is still available in Europe.  You had better stock up on it through Amazon while you still can.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I am a fan of Mennen products.  This skin conditioner is great after a shave, or a great, &amp;#34;slap-on,&amp;#34; before heading out the door.  The fragarance is subtle and refreshing.  I have been using this product for years and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells like the 80s!  But man, does it cool down razor burn.  Hard to find in the stores these days.  When do I use it?  Afta I shave, that&#x27;s when.</li>
            <li> My 28 year old boyfriend just bought this and I noticed right away, but not in a good way lol.  Not only is it way to strong in scent but it also smells like an old man in my opinion(no disrespect intended) like something my grandfather would wear. I&#x27;m not sure how old the men are who are giving this 5 stars but if you are under the age of 50 I&#x27;d be shocked.  It says fresh scent but it really just smells old and strong, it&#x27;s really the only way I can describe it lol.  Just picture a 65 year old man going on a date and slapping this stuff on trying to smell like a million dollars but instead smelled like the 1950&#x27;s lol. It&#x27;s just not my cup of tea, I prefer something milder and not so in your face or muskey.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my face smooth</li>
            <li> Mennen AFTA After Shave Conditioner is a wonderfully smooth and very protective cream to use on your closely-shaven skin on your face!!  It is most invigorating!!!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and I love the way he smells after shaving.  He says it is very soothing to his skin.</li>
            <li> The local store didn&#x27;t carry this.  I bought this for my husband, because I can stand the smell without sneezing.  After a while the smell goes away.  I recommend this and it arrived quickly and in good condition.  It is very soothing to the skin,</li>
            <li> This after-shave gel is difficult to find, but is well worth the effort to get it.  It is totally hydrating and soothing after shaving, with no burning at all.  It disappears into the skin within 10 seconds, but leaves your face soft and hydrated.  The scent is very mild and pleasant, and much nicer than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; scent of the same product name.  Very very highly recommended.  It is cheaper than those other \\&quot;Mennen\\&quot; after-shave creams, and it is much much better.  I go out of my way to ship it to my US address, so that I can bring it back to Canada.</li>
            <li> I liked. My wife had trouble with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product really protects your face after shaving. I have been using it for years and in my opinion it has reduced the tendency of the development of wrinkles. If you don&#x27;t believe me try it.</li>
            <li> i use a norelco shaver and have for years i look fore word to rubbing it on after a shave it cools any burning you have and conditiones your skin.you&#x27;ll feel brand new and refreshed after you use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for over 25 years...have tried other new scents from other brand names over the years but no other after shave is as soothing without being greasy. It has a fresh, subtle fragrance that has garnered many compliments over the years from the women I have held close.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly as described. Good price. Will order again.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want that sweet smelling after shave lotion, try this.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 40 years with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I prefer Purchasing certain Items in bulk, rather than going to a Store and Buying one Item at a time.  This Purchase was an ideal one for me.  James  L.  Powell</li>
            <li> Well the price was right, the product arrived quickly and the smell is great! This was a good buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an electric shaver.  This aftershave is soothing and removes and razor burn and helps heal any nicks.  It dry&#x27;s quickly and has a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> ... as my wife likes to call it. Finding the Fresh scent in my local grocery stores is almost impossible, so Amazon to the rescue. A good value for the dollar, and it keeps the wife happy.</li>
            <li> the only thing that appeared the same was the container.  Original AFTA was a blueish cream that&lt;br /&gt;had a delightful aroma.  This stuff is a lotion with a blah aroma.  Nice try!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, good smell but not overpowering. Wish they sold this in a store near me</li>
            <li> Very happy, please note my notes on the other Afta shave balm purchased at the same time in relation to sending product directly to NZ.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and never had any reason to try something else. Obviously I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Afta is the best product on the market for an after shaving lotion/cream.  It is the best there is at soothing razor burn from either an electric razor or a bladed razor.  I have used Afta since 1977 and still find it to be the best there is.  I like both this Fresh scented Afta and the Original scented.  Afta is becoming very hard to find in local stores.  Definitely worth purchasing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lightly scented , in a couple different varieties.  Have received  compliments in the past for the scent.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Same as the other Mennen AFTA Pre Shave</li>
            <li> I bought this product on line because sometimes it is difficult to purchase at local stores.  I have used this product for years and it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune like all of those other brands do and it is a wonderful after shave. I think I bought it in a bulk amount of five and I will do it again when the last container runs out! This way, when I go to the store I won&#x27;t be disappointed when it&#x27;s not on the shelf again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this hard-to-find aroma for years and I can tell he&#x27;s shaving from another part of the house.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best after shave in the market for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have  used this for years, but buying 5 at a time here is even greater</li>
            <li> I need an aftershave skin conditioner that will get rid of the redness, irritation, and add moisture to my skin. Previously, I was using Mary Kay for Men products, one a conditioner and one a balm with a fragrance. These are no longer offered by Mary Kay. I found the Afta After Shave Skin Conditioner to do the job of both a conditioner and a balm with a fragrance in one. And the price is a fraction of the cost!</li>
