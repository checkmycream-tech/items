            <li>Excellent all went well thru the whole process</li>
            <li>As the oils mix with your own, the fragrance continues to evolve and improve.</li>

            <li>I love it,just as I always have..and the fact that it was such a good price,makes me love it more</li>
            <li>A personal mood-enhancer that makes me think of pleasant things and of being in a lovely flower garden with a variety of flowers, with no one overwhelming smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am thinking the makers of Givenchy Gentleman should meet up with Lesley Jones and reward her for the amazing advertising she accomplished with the book Carnage!  </li>
            <li>Thankfully when I got it today,  I was thrilled that it was so good,  (not sweet, more musky which I prefer)  </li>
            <li>But the main item itself is worthwhile for sure.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate you asking if I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>AND IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>good for everyday use, not too overpowering and not my favorite givenchy scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been around a long time and there is a good reason for that.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Value, great product very difficult to find, I have used this as my signature cologne since I was 17 years old.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon !!</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s not fake!  </li>
            <li>Still a good scent however and probably not much longer on themarket.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price you pay for it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomment this product, especially for a special gift or Valentine&#x27;s day. :)</li>
            <li>Little to sweet smelling but still nice</li>
            <li>The people I purchase this for have enjoyed the lasting fragrance of Givenchy Gentleman for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return it!</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much as it is very strong.  </li>
            <li>have used Gentleman Givenchy for years ;this is my first time ordering from amazon.com,&amp; found the whole ordering process quite professional &amp;  user friendly.    </li>
            <li>After another long 9 hour flight I was still able to smell the perfume on my wrist and it helped uplift my spirits</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s when I decided to buy a large bottle.</li>
            <li>This is for real men.</li>
            <li>Others who have questioned &amp;#34; is this the real thing ./or</li>
            <li>Gentle, doesn&#x27;t linger with you, and it maintains its&#x27; fragrance for some hours.  </li>
            <li>It was ok but wasn&#x27;t the same givenchy gentlemen that I got for my husband (boyfriend) at the time in early 80&#x27;s  </li>
            <li>Great cologne masculine but subtle.</li>
            <li>(not something I normally do!)  </li>
            <li>Most women find it extremely pleasing.</li>
            <li>This is the classic fragrance for men.  </li>
            <li>It is mellow and a decent price...</li>
            <li>The &#x27;bar&#x27; to match Givenchy Gentleman is just too high.</li>
            <li>(highly recommend this book)  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loooved the old one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also about comparing it  to anything new that comes on the market.  </li>
            <li>Classic and masculine.</li>
            <li>first time I tried it I was wandering through the tax-free shops at some international airport in Europe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I compared my new fragancy adquire, and my old one they are not&lt;br /&gt;similar.</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered, the scent is like the old Givenchy my husband uses only this one</li>
            <li>It is very, very different from the real thing to which I am accustomed.</li>
            <li>While the packaging looks absolutely authentic, I can only conclude that the product inside is not genuine.</li>
            <li>It is distinctive, subtle and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>will buy this again when I run out, even though this is not an inexpensive purchase, and the bottle and paper label are quite ordinary and almost look cheap.</li>

            <li> The only negative is that it begins to fade after about 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> However, Both my husband and I remember it having a stronger base of patchouli than this  latest bottle.</li>
            <li> Hate to think i may  not be able to find it soon.</li>
            <li> I have a half used bottle on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I tried a single spray from the new bottle, and hated the smell.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully complex scent</li>
            <li> This will drive the lady&#x27;s crazy</li>
            <li> We were disappointed to conclude that this Gentleman by Givenchy for Men Eau de Toilette, a so called \\&quot;knock off\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> WOMEN and MEN will go crazy!!</li>
            <li> My partner, goes crazy too!!!</li>

            <li> Good product  makes me smell good!!!</li>
            <li> lOVE THE FRAGRANCE, AND IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered, the scent is like the old Givenchy my husband uses only this one</li>
            <li> girl next door loves it</li>
            <li> Somehow this suits my sense of smell and I feel like a happy camper after a whiff if this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I was wandering through the tax-free shops at some international airport in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I put some on my wrist as I liked the smell, and to try and reduce the sense of air-sickness from being in a cramped aircraft for 8 plus hours. After another long 9 hour flight I was still able to smell the perfume on my wrist and it helped uplift my spirits everytime I smelled it during the flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I decided to buy a large bottle. A personal mood-enhancer that makes me think of pleasant things and of being in a lovely flower garden with a variety of flowers, with no one overwhelming smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again when I run out, even though this is not an inexpensive purchase, and the bottle and paper label are quite ordinary and almost look cheap. But the main item itself is worthwhile for sure.</li>
            <li> Excellent Value, great product very difficult to find, I have used this as my signature cologne since I was 17 years old. (45 years).</li>
            <li> I saw the article from someone claiming that this product was not even close to the original(10 years ago cologne)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I decided to buy one,and this person is right/I compared my new fragancy adquire, and my old one they are not&lt;br /&gt;similar.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed to conclude that this Gentleman by Givenchy for Men Eau de Toilette, a so called \\&quot;knock off\\&quot;. We suggest you check you supply source.</li>
            <li> It was ok but wasn&#x27;t the same givenchy gentlemen that I got for my husband (boyfriend) at the time in early 80&#x27;s  I absolutely loooved the old one. Maybe there&#x27;s two gentlemen  He kept it but said it wasn&#x27;t same. If you have another gentlemen that s different  I would love to try sample.  Thanks so much!  I really appreciate you asking if I was satisfied.  Tam</li>
            <li> One of the best Men&#x27;s scents ever...However, Both my husband and I remember it having a stronger base of patchouli than this  latest bottle. Still a good scent however and probably not much longer on themarket.</li>
            <li> have used Gentleman Givenchy for years ;this is my first time ordering from amazon.com,&amp; found the whole ordering process quite professional &amp;  user friendly.    thanks Amazon !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 40 years still love it</li>
            <li> The people I purchase this for have enjoyed the lasting fragrance of Givenchy Gentleman for over 30 years.  It&#x27;s not just habit. It&#x27;s also about comparing it  to anything new that comes on the market.  The &#x27;bar&#x27; to match Givenchy Gentleman is just too high.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a dear friend that used this scent back in the 60&#x27;s.  Would recommend this fragrance to everyone considering it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and have used it every day for years. I have a half used bottle on my shelf. I tried a single spray from the new bottle, and hated the smell. It smells like burnt wood. It is very, very different from the real thing to which I am accustomed. While the packaging looks absolutely authentic, I can only conclude that the product inside is not genuine. I have great faith in Amazon, have purchased perfume from them before which was fine, but in this case I am convinced they are being fooled somewhere along the supply chain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;Gentleman\\&quot; for years and found that it is one of those items in life one never tires of. Numerous times I&#x27;ve been asked the name of my cologne with the comment that the inquirer wanted to buy some for either personal use or a gift.</li>
            <li> This is for real men. If you looking for that manly scent, here it is. This will drive the lady&#x27;s crazy</li>
            <li> This is the classic fragrance for men.  Be careful not to use too much as it is very strong.  It is worth the price you pay for it.  It&#x27;s been around a long time and there is a good reason for that.  Classic and masculine.</li>
            <li> Little to sweet smelling but still nice</li>
            <li> Great cologne masculine but subtle.</li>
            <li> Others who have questioned &amp;#34; is this the real thing ./or the same thing you get in a retail store ? The answer is yes, without doubt.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is awesome have been buying it for over 20 years as gifts[[ASIN:B000UI7QEA Gentleman Cologne by Givenchy for Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 oz / 100 Ml]]</li>
            <li> The BEST of the BEST right here....Wear this at night....WOMEN and MEN will go crazy!! Plus, the scent lasts forever!!&lt;br /&gt;I get tons of comments when I wear this cologne out....My partner, goes crazy too!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully complex scent</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like I remember from the 70s and 80s.  Hope it&#x27;s not fake!  Too much hassle to return it! Better not contain urine like I read occurs in counterfeit cologne.  😱</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. His favorite.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading a book by Lesley Jones called Carnage... (My most favorite book this year!)  one of the characters in the book wears it,  so I actually bought it without a preview smell! (not something I normally do!)  Thankfully when I got it today,  I was thrilled that it was so good,  (not sweet, more musky which I prefer)  I cannot wait to give it to my husband this Christmas.  I am thinking the makers of Givenchy Gentleman should meet up with Lesley Jones and reward her for the amazing advertising she accomplished with the book Carnage!  (highly recommend this book)  I am betting many of her fans purchased this product after reading her books.  plus,  it really does smell very good!</li>

            <li> Excellent all went well thru the whole process</li>
            <li> This is not a me too fragrance. It is distinctive, subtle and sophisticated. As the oils mix with your own, the fragrance continues to evolve and improve. The only negative is that it begins to fade after about 5-6 hours.</li>

            <li> man must have fragrance!</li>
            <li> good for everyday use, not too overpowering and not my favorite givenchy scent but it is nice otherwise. It is mellow and a decent price...</li>
            <li> a little stronger than I expected but like the fragrance very much</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I have used for a long time and I love it I have a little problem with this one, It doesn&#x27;t seem to last long as others have done.</li>
