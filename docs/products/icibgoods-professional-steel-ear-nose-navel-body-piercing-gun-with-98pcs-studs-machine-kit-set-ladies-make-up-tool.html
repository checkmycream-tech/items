            <li>C: it works perfect</li>
            <li>and for a very good price</li>
            <li>the gun works great...</li>
            <li>I was not to happy.</li>
            <li>Happy that I got my gun sooner then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I ordered my own gold piercings, that were from the US.</li>
            <li>The plastic ones are not all that good.</li>
            <li>It is a good pairing gun</li>
            <li>OK so I did receive this today (October 14 2014!)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good quality for how cheap it is</li>
            <li>i already used it to pierce the top of my ear and my nose.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so it came super early which is great!</li>
            <li>Love it, easy to use, on time shipping :)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m excited too!</li>
            <li>The piercing gun was fine, but the earrings that came with it were very cheap.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>But everything else works fine</li>
            <li>Lol idk if I should actually try it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and looks strong.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a really cheap gun</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s and clean</li>
            <li>well this gun worked pretty well</li>
            <li>I do need to have it cleaned very well first.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34; looked like it had already been used and was really worn out.  </li>
            <li>and it wont work very well,</li>
            <li>And then then the red marker (very cheap looking) barely shows....</li>
            <li>But other then that I love it.</li>
            <li>I opened the case and my mirror actually fell right into my lap!</li>
            <li>I used this for personal use very easy to use on ears and comes with sharp earrings</li>
            <li>so they dont have to be bought also brand new and not used</li>
            <li>and sure enough there was a little bag of backs in there.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it only for ear piercings because if you do your nose it may hurt more because of all the hard skin around the nose</li>

            <li> that when they have gotten guns it was dirty and cheap made and this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> And comes with a bunch of really sharp earrings</li>
            <li> but when you pull the trigger to hard the object in the back falls!</li>
            <li> and its not cheap made.</li>
            <li> It comes in a veryyy tight package !</li>
            <li> They were not appealing to the eye whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I ended up not using it at all because the last thing I want is to use a seriously dirty piercing gun.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was bad that the mirror was not stuck on it</li>
            <li> Case came broken</li>
            <li> Gun was already broken.</li>
            <li> It is shipped from China, and the box was dirty and it looked like it had just been laying around on the ground before being shipped.  </li>
            <li> This product is of HORRIBLE quality.  </li>
            <li> I just recommend buying the earrings from a beauty supply theses earrings are horrible.</li>

            <li> I used this for personal use very easy to use on ears and comes with sharp earrings so they dont have to be bought also brand new and not used</li>
            <li> everything its said to be. got it on time. and its not cheap made.</li>
            <li> well this gun worked pretty well but when you pull the trigger to hard the object in the back falls!</li>
            <li> This product is of HORRIBLE quality.  It is shipped from China, and the box was dirty and it looked like it had just been laying around on the ground before being shipped.

            <li> I don&#x27;t like the earrings and they did not come with backs....I had to buy some...the gun works great...I just recommend buying the earrings from a beauty supply theses earrings are horrible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. I do need to have it cleaned very well first. It came from China, and looks like it has been used. There are no instructions, but I think I can figure it out. I&#x27;m happy that I ordered my own gold piercings, that were from the US.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it only for ear piercings because if you do your nose it may hurt more because of all the hard skin around the nose</li>
            <li> Package came earlier than expected! Mine did come with backs! I did a double look in the packaging it came in and sure enough there was a little bag of backs in there. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m excited too!</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s good quality for how cheap it is</li>
            <li> I would prefer the steel back. The plastic ones are not all that good.</li>
            <li> OK so I did receive this today (October 14 2014!) When it was supposed to be here on  oct 23-nov 7th so it came super early which is great! It comes in a veryyy tight package ! I opened the case and my mirror actually fell right into my lap! And then then the red marker (very cheap looking) barely shows.... The earings looks pretty dull ... And the machine is the only thing that looks &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;....Lol idk if I should actually try it... But then again I should&amp; when I do I&#x27;ll definitely re do the review...</li>
            <li> It is a good pairing gun I like it alot you need a to put some backs on the earings and have rule eating in the pairing gun kit but that all I have to say</li>
            <li> The piercing gun was fine, but the earrings that came with it were very cheap. They were not appealing to the eye whatsoever. I was not to happy.</li>
            <li> Happy that I got my gun sooner then the post date and it&#x27;s and clean I&#x27;ve read post that when they have gotten guns it was dirty and cheap made and this ain&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s clean and looks strong. The only thing that was bad that the mirror was not stuck on it but I do have glue to fix that lil problem. But other then that I love it. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one just to have two.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a really cheap gun and it wont work very well, but I&#x27;ve been using it a lot and it works perfectly. and for a very good price</li>
            <li> great product! i already used it to pierce the top of my ear and my nose. Easy to use. And comes with a bunch of really sharp earrings</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use, on time shipping :)</li>
            <li> Only problem is the backs. No problem gun will get it in and just add back after removing gun.</li>
            <li> Love it. C: it works perfect</li>
            <li> Case came broken But everything else works fine</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Gun was already broken.</li>
