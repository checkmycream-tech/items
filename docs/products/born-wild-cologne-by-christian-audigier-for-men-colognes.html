            <li>The cologne was shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Although, he did think it was a bit strong and plans to use it for winter.</li>
            <li>what I dont like about them is that, the majority of them have this strong scent, that after a while make me sort of nauseous.  </li>
            <li>I thk ths kind is more 4 n older man</li>
            <li>and luckily I found this!</li>
            <li>HUGE bottle compared to what you get in the department stores.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find it online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>fantastic scent, dont think about buying it, just buy it.</li>

            <li>Originally purchased the hearts and daggers and had to continue in the Ed Hardy series.</li>
            <li>Soft scent, very pleased with this cologne</li>
            <li>I got this in the 0.25 oz originally</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty strong, so I will advise to use lightly.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and the next time I saw him he was wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I was reading the review before purchasing  and got several good reviews.</li>

            <li>Thank you so much !!</li>
            <li>THE SCENT LAST VERY LONG AND FOR THE PRICE IT WAS IS A GREAT BUY.I WILL BE BUYING MORE FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS</li>
            <li>It took a week for my Cologne to arrive but boy was it worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a really warm woody smell, if you ever owned Lacoste Essential</li>
            <li>To me it feels like it lasted roughly 6-7 hours whereas others i&#x27;ve owned lasted a good 12.</li>
            <li>Really smells good and stays for quiet a while</li>
            <li>Wow love it.. will  purchase again.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the little bottles, now I get the much bigger one and everyone is happy!!</li>
            <li>A bit too strong for my taste, it smells like old man cologne</li>
            <li>That lasted him a year and liked it so much that he would only wear it for formal events.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, came in 3 days of purchase.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I know Macy&#x27;s sells the very same one as this but for waaaaaay much more money, that being said I checked if Amazon had it in a cheaper price</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I think I smelled every bottle of cologne in the store before picking this one and evidently it was a hit.  </li>
            <li>Great long lasting smell</li>
            <li>At first it smelled horrid</li>
            <li>I dont like wearing other scents than my own (after a shower..lol).  </li>
            <li>This was $27.00 for 3 and a half times more product!</li>
            <li>nice fragance,but could last a little longer when sprayed on.anyhow i think it would cost more if so.was the case.</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp, unusual, manly, sexy, and sensual to name a few of the comments I received wearing it the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Great for school, everyday wear, even after the GYM; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for night use, (I&#x27;ll explain later)</li>
            <li>The bottle is covered by a plastic shell/sleeve which is the design of the whole cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it keep you the whole day fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ultra fast delivery...</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper then the mall...</li>
            <li>This is 3.4 ounces and is the real deal...</li>
            <li>Delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li>more than I have had from ANY other cologne/Eu De Toilette/etc.</li>
            <li>For your better half</li>
            <li>smell is where the main point is about it...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a decent scent if  you just want to showcase it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice masculine scent for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, fresh clean scent, and priced right, a 3.4 ounce bottle will last awhile.</li>
            <li>I make sure I get him a few bottles at a time</li>
            <li>It smells a lot like my old favorite cologne -- Armani Code -- but is well below half the price.</li>
            <li>I have been looking in the stores where I live and couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that it was brand new, sealed, and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s completely gone like it was never there.</li>
            <li>I also wear some high end fragrances on different occasion yet</li>
            <li>So, 18 months later he told me he&#x27;s finally out of it and wants to know where i got it because he looked online at perfumania</li>
            <li>It smells like a really dark herbal citrus mix, I can&#x27;t really explain it!</li>
            <li>My first one lasted a year and a half with almost daily use.  </li>

            <li> more than I have had from ANY other cologne/Eu De Toilette/etc.</li>
            <li> For your better half</li>
            <li> smell is where the main point is about it...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a decent scent if  you just want to showcase it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice masculine scent for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, fresh clean scent, and priced right, a 3.4 ounce bottle will last awhile.</li>
            <li> I make sure I get him a few bottles at a time</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like my old favorite cologne -- Armani Code -- but is well below half the price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking in the stores where I live and couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that it was brand new, sealed, and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s completely gone like it was never there.</li>
            <li> I also wear some high end fragrances on different occasion yet</li>
            <li> So, 18 months later he told me he&#x27;s finally out of it and wants to know where i got it because he looked online at perfumania</li>
            <li> It smells like a really dark herbal citrus mix, I can&#x27;t really explain it!</li>
            <li> My first one lasted a year and a half with almost daily use.  </li>
            <li> So i secretly got this sent to him, 13.6X as big as the last bottle, and he was so excited to get it a couple days later.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is pretty tall, taller than any other I&#x27;ve previously owned.</li>
            <li> The only problems is that it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> , it was a lot bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> We previously bought a bottle from Ross for the same price, but it was only 1.4 ounces.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend every guy try it at least once.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not much into perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Big ounces for little money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all the package comes extremely protected so you don&#x27;t have to fear about it being damaged or mistreated.</li>
            <li> and I do not feel like a D-bag for wearing it like all other Ed Hardy products</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Son for Christmas according to the amazon ratings and other buyers remarks.  </li>
            <li> and i gave it to my boyfriend as a small 3 month present.</li>
            <li> weak scent doesn&#x27;t last long doesn&#x27;t smell like one in the store i tried.</li>
            <li> when my father bought me some he paid like 25 for a bottle half this size</li>
            <li> and they didnt have it for less than $75 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> Masculine with a hint of fruity smell to it, very subtle though not over powering.</li>
            <li> this is going to be my everyday fragrance for price I pay.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the cologne would be fake, old, or a tester.</li>
            <li> I sit in front of a computer wearing a T-shirt and jeans all day long, that&#x27;s my casual office avatar and for that I don&#x27;t need an expensive brand fragrance.</li>
            <li> This cologne was very hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> The cologne is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> ill start out with</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and I love the Ed Hardy Fragrances; he get compliments when he wears it :-)</li>
            <li> The cost compared to the cost in a store was unbeilvable !!  I purchased it for my son for Christmas....I loved the scent and the next time I saw him he was wearing it.  I would call it a winner!!!!</li>
            <li> Another great product I love this Ed hardy product, bought several so my kid would stop coming and using mine!.</li>
            <li> I love Ed Hardy scents; This was a great buy for the size bottle you get and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a must have. For your better half</li>
            <li> Good cologne at first smells strong like a musk but once its on for a while it starts to fade into a nice smell and lasts ....over all impressed</li>
            <li> It took a week for my Cologne to arrive but boy was it worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the package comes extremely protected so you don&#x27;t have to fear about it being damaged or mistreated. It comes in the box as advertised in the images. The bottle itself is pretty tall, taller than any other I&#x27;ve previously owned. The bottle is covered by a plastic shell/sleeve which is the design of the whole cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is where the main point is about it... Its a really great sexy smell... It smells like a really dark herbal citrus mix, I can&#x27;t really explain it! But it&#x27;s a really warm woody smell, if you ever owned Lacoste Essential it&#x27;s kind of like it. Great for school, everyday wear, even after the GYM; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for night use, (I&#x27;ll explain later) but it&#x27;s a decent scent if  you just want to showcase it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is the duration of the product. To me it feels like it lasted roughly 6-7 hours whereas others i&#x27;ve owned lasted a good 12. It&#x27;s a shame because the scent is just so damn good!</li>
            <li> I have been looking in the stores where I live and couldn&#x27;t find it.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Big ounces for little money!</li>
            <li> I sit in front of a computer wearing a T-shirt and jeans all day long, that&#x27;s my casual office avatar and for that I don&#x27;t need an expensive brand fragrance. I also wear some high end fragrances on different occasion yet this is going to be my everyday fragrance for price I pay. Its very fresh and holds some 5 hrs pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my stepson for Christmas.  It smells great!!!  It&#x27;s as good as any Mens Cologne twice the price.  It reminds me of the original Ralph Lauren &amp;#34;Polo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the cologne would be fake, old, or a tester. I looked through the reviews on here and I thought that it was a low enough risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that it was brand new, sealed, and in pristine condition. At $20, it&#x27;s a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty strong, so I will advise to use lightly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for our anniversary. I know Macy&#x27;s sells the very same one as this but for waaaaaay much more money, that being said I checked if Amazon had it in a cheaper price and luckily I found this! Shipping was very fast, came in 3 days of purchase. When my boyfriend unwrapped it and opened the box he loved the awesome packaging and so did I! Not to mention it smells so good! I totally recommend buying this on Amazon. Saved me a lot of money and not to mention my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> My son gets lots of compliments from teen girls.</li>
            <li> This is a good scent parfum for men it keep you the whole day fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this tor all men.who loves a great scent.</li>
            <li> Tried this product because there were so many great reviews.  Its not bad, but for me isn&#x27;t as great as I was anticipating.  Might be just the ticket for some, but I probably will not reorder.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts quite awhile and have received alot of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> This is Exactly what I wanted!!!! Smells amazing and the wife loves it too!!! I&#x27;d buy it again for sure!!!</li>
            <li> i will get more of it so that this one doesnt finish on time and it attracts a lot of ladies coz of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, got many compliments from all kinds of people on how nice it is.  Clean, crisp, unusual, manly, sexy, and sensual to name a few of the comments I received wearing it the first couple of weeks.  Highly recommend every guy try it at least once.</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle compared to what you get in the department stores. I get lots of compliments from women on how this smell. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Awesome my dad loves the smell . Thank you so much !! this is exactly what I wanted. Will be shopping here in future.</li>
            <li> Smells good and manly.  Lots of compliments.... more than I have had from ANY other cologne/Eu De Toilette/etc.</li>
            <li> i guess my son really liked it since i can smell it wafting out of this room all the time! lol .</li>
            <li> Nice masculine scent for everyday use. The only problems is that it doesn&#x27;t last that long. three hours at most and then it&#x27;s completely gone like it was never there.</li>
            <li> ill start out with, it was a lot bigger than i expected. when my father bought me some he paid like 25 for a bottle half this size and i paid 15 for this one. must get!!</li>
            <li> Great Smell, shipped fast. My first one lasted a year and a half with almost daily use.  Will buy every time I run out of cologne .  Great product</li>
            <li> Ultra fast delivery...AAAAAAAAA++++++++ in my book</li>
            <li> THE SCENT LAST VERY LONG AND FOR THE PRICE IT WAS IS A GREAT BUY.I WILL BE BUYING MORE FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband. He loved it. Although, he did think it was a bit strong and plans to use it for winter.</li>
            <li> weak scent doesn&#x27;t last long doesn&#x27;t smell like one in the store i tried. would not purchase again, no interest</li>
            <li> cologne is something I can always purchase and get amazing feedback.  I used to buy the little bottles, now I get the much bigger one and everyone is happy!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I got a couple of compliments on it. I love it. It&#x27;s my new favorite and I will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really smells good and stays for quiet a while</li>
            <li> I love this scent on my husband!!</li>
            <li> I am very aware of my husbands presence when he wears this cologne. I absolutely love the scent and it lasts all day. I make sure I get him a few bottles at a time so he doesn&#x27;t run out. ;)</li>
            <li> I dont like wearing other scents than my own (after a shower..lol).  And I&#x27;m not much into perfumes.  what I dont like about them is that, the majority of them have this strong scent, that after a while make me sort of nauseous.  I decided to give this one a try after some reviews I read and heard on youtube... Im glad I did... I love this stuff... this one is just sublime!</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite man cologne.  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for him several years ago and he has stuck with this one scent ever since.  I think I smelled every bottle of cologne in the store before picking this one and evidently it was a hit.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the girls will find you irresistible if you wear this!</li>
            <li> Speedy shipment from this dealer. This cologne was very hard to find in stores so I was thrilled to find it online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Once again, Amazon delivers its products in perfect condition!  This cologne smells good on anyone who wears it.  My boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great value, great scent.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong for my taste, it smells like old man cologne, the smell gave me a headache</li>
            <li> Love this one, so I bought a 1 oz bottle at Walmart it was $25.00. This was $27.00 for 3 and a half times more product! Super deal for a super product</li>
            <li> nice fragance,but could last a little longer when sprayed on.anyhow i think it would cost more if so.was the case.</li>
            <li> I was reading the review before purchasing  and got several good reviews. I order this for my husband for his birthday. We both love the smell</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne. It smells a lot like my old favorite cologne -- Armani Code -- but is well below half the price. Very nice stuff, great value, and a distinctive and spiffy bottle.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x60;s okay.  Fruity yet manly and I do not feel like a D-bag for wearing it like all other Ed Hardy products</li>
            <li> I just started wearing this brand after wearing Issy products for 15 years.  I love all of the types.  nice bottle also</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Son for Christmas according to the amazon ratings and other buyers remarks.  He really likes it and it smells great. Happy with my purchase and delivery!!</li>
            <li> Its 100% genuine.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one from Macy&#x27;s in 2010 and since then I&#x27;m stuck onto this amazing fragnance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best from Christian Audigier Men range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> fantastic scent, dont think about buying it, just buy it. Long lasting, fresh clean scent, and priced right, a 3.4 ounce bottle will last awhile. A no brainer, sure thing, will keep the ladies coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Wow love it.. will  purchase again.</li>
            <li> People have different tastes so for me I don&#x27;t like it. If u could smell it that would  be a better option.</li>
            <li> Great long lasting smell</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of the best&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned.  Originally purchased the hearts and daggers and had to continue in the Ed Hardy series.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this perfume..But, is an excellent comercial presentation!</li>
            <li> Soft scent, very pleased with this cologne</li>
            <li> Got this for my hubby... I love the smell of this and so does he! It was so much cheaper then the mall... I get this once a year from amazon!</li>
            <li> smells great and shipped really fast</li>
            <li> Amazing seller. The cologne was shipped out very quickly. The cologne is very hard to find. We previously bought a bottle from Ross for the same price, but it was only 1.4 ounces. This is 3.4 ounces and is the real deal...Love Ed Hardy...it was a birthday present for my fiance and arrived in plenty of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do no hesitate to purchase from this seller. Simply awesome... A+A+A+</li>
            <li> I got this in the 0.25 oz originally and i gave it to my boyfriend as a small 3 month present. That lasted him a year and liked it so much that he would only wear it for formal events. So, 18 months later he told me he&#x27;s finally out of it and wants to know where i got it because he looked online at perfumania and they didnt have it for less than $75 plus shipping. So i secretly got this sent to him, 13.6X as big as the last bottle, and he was so excited to get it a couple days later. He wears it almost every day now.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, let me tell you, this scent is absolutly wonderful, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen, the ladies will swoon over you when you put this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, amazing product, fast shipment, just perfect!</li>
            <li> Masculine with a hint of fruity smell to it, very subtle though not over powering. I don&#x27;t like fruity colognes either. Wish this was stronger for longer. But who knows, I can&#x27;t smell myself for hours because I get used to the scent.</li>
            <li> After a year of letting it sit this smells great! At first it smelled horrid but once it had some time it smells great!</li>
            <li> Was what I thought it would be. Delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li> 4 me its not my style...it has a spicy smell 2 it...im 30 n 4 me the spice smell is no gd...I thk ths kind is more 4 n older man</li>
