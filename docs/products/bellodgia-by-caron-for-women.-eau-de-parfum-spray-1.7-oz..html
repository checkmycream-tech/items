    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Bellodgia is not something you can find even in the best stores anymore.</li>
            <li>She was soooo happy with it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Eau de parfum can be wonderful</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;time, perfect!  </li>
            <li>A truly beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>This scent comes from France during the great Art Nouveau period.</li>
            <li>The House of Caron Paris is still one of the world&#x27;s great perfumers.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent.</li>
            <li>and I always loved it.  </li>
            <li>Just lovely!</li>
            <li>not overpowering like so many of the perfumes that&lt;br /&gt;are in vogue today!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>First I couldn&#x27;t remember the name but remembered wearing it along with my best friend somewhere in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Still it is a nice carnation based scent.</li>
            <li>I had this fragrance many years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The men at my job love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>but it is ok.  </li>
            <li>Mom used it many yearfs ago.</li>
            <li>Now seems a bit more astringent than I remember it.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of carnation with a touch of clove, this is for you.  </li>
            <li>I wealthy woman for whom I babysat wore it</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Possibly the best carnation fragrance of all time.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is my favorite</li>
            <li>I would love to be able to find the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is truly a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is the most wonderful soft, romantic, and feminine fragrance I&#x27;ve experienced in years.</li>
            <li>- so pleased it&#x27;s still available.  </li>
            <li>I saw it for sale on Amazon and was excited to be able to purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was excited to order it and am enjoying it as I write.</li>
            <li>I reason I always loved it because it reminds me of the viburnum bush, my favorite flower, which blooms in early spring.  </li>
            <li>Starting wearing this perfume after receiving it as a gift many years ago...so happy to find it&lt;</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon easily.</li>
            <li>A gorgeous classic fragrance that I never tire of.  </li>
            <li>So many &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; perfumes and colognes are fruity and/or sweet smelling and gives me a headache</li>
            <li>Thank you for having this supply available.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have it back again.</li>
            <li>I became acquainted with Bellodgia because a very lovely french woman I worked with wore it</li>
            <li>It smells better after it has been on for a while than it does at first.</li>
            <li>But, rest assured when that special someone nuzzles up to your graceful neck he will be blown away.</li>
            <li>My husband bought me this perfume for my birthday since it was such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Not as sweet as I remember.  </li>
            <li>The order was very easy to complete and the product was shipped promptly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Such a light lovely scent...</li>
            <li>It is light and powdery like a carnation, but there&#x27;s a dash of spice that makes it a deep, layered, memorable scent.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>When it came, it was exactly what I ordered and expected for a good price.</li>
            <li>And very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I wear this daily and get many compliments.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like I remember</li>
            <li>Clean, sweet, and fresh yet rich and lush at the same time.  </li>
            <li>but this is a gentle and fragrant mix of flowers with a highlight of carnations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic floral that is suited to all occasions.</li>
            <li>In the 50&#x27;s, while in high school, I worked at Lord &amp; Taylor.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the new stuff in the purple box figuring I would try once more, and this time it actually seemed to be the same scent I remembered.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural scent of carnation, not the synthetic type.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried Bellodgia that came in the new box two years ago, it did not seem the same to me at all</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and have been wearing Bellodgia since I was in 8th grade.  </li>
            <li>Felt the fragrance might be old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you who have used this fragrance in the past - is the Bellodgia perfume that is available again, the same formula as it used to be?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A gorgeous classic fragrance that I never tire of.  I don&#x27;t know if Caron is still producing this scent, but I hope so.  Thank you for having this supply available.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this perfume for my birthday since it was such a good deal. It&#x27;s ok. It smells better after it has been on for a while than it does at first.</li>
            <li> I bought this vintage perfume out of curiosity and also because it was based with carnations and cloves. What a surprise! It is simply intoxicating and leaves you with the impulse to continue sniffing it. The men at my job love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I wear this daily and get many compliments. Strangers will stop me and ask what the scent is. It&#x27;s a long lasting scent and a small spray on the pulse points of the wrists is all you really need.Bellodgia is not something you can find even in the best stores anymore. It&#x27;s a classic floral that is suited to all occasions. They changed the box and label to purple- so the product picture needs to be updated at Amazon. The first time I tried Bellodgia that came in the new box two years ago, it did not seem the same to me at all and I returned it. I even wrote to Caron to ask what had changed- they never answered me, however.Then I looked everywhere to find something similar and just could not. I ordered the new stuff in the purple box figuring I would try once more, and this time it actually seemed to be the same scent I remembered. I am happy to have it back again.</li>
            <li> My sister used to wear this years ago when I was a child and I always loved it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like I remember but it is ok.  It seems a little lemony or astringent like.  Not as sweet as I remember.  I reason I always loved it because it reminds me of the viburnum bush, my favorite flower, which blooms in early spring.  Oh well, close but no cigar.</li>
            <li> In the 50&#x27;s, while in high school, I worked at Lord &amp; Taylor.  I became acquainted with Bellodgia because a very lovely french woman I worked with wore it and she smelled so divine.  The carnations I planted this year in my garden brought this memory forward.  I must have this perfume and will be ordering it - so pleased it&#x27;s still available.  A truly beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent. Mom used it many yearfs ago. Now seems a bit more astringent than I remember it. Still it is a nice carnation based scent.</li>
            <li> The price was right. The order was very easy to complete and the product was shipped promptly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!  I chased down a woman in the elevator to ask her what she was wearing and she told me this.  I ordered it an it smells nothing like what she was wearing.  This stuff is yuck!  :(</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of carnation with a touch of clove, this is for you.  This is a very natural scent of carnation, not the synthetic type.  Carnations are a rather spicy type of flower but this perfume with it&#x27;s touch of clove ( but not over done ) just adds to it&#x27;s beauty.  Very long lasting too, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and have been wearing Bellodgia since I was in 8th grade.  I wealthy woman for whom I babysat wore it and I fell in love with it.  It is my is my signature fragrance and I wear nothing else.  Perfumes come and go but Bellodgia will remain forever.   It is not overpowering like today&#x27;s fragrances (it came out in 1927) But, rest assured when that special someone nuzzles up to your graceful neck he will be blown away.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful soft, romantic, and feminine fragrance I&#x27;ve experienced in years. Just lovely!</li>
            <li> Felt the fragrance might be old.  Scent was not as I remembered it, and I have been wearing this for 30 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom.  She says it still smells the way it did years ago when she used to wear it.  She was soooo happy with it!  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best carnation fragrance of all time.  Clean, sweet, and fresh yet rich and lush at the same time.  And very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The Eau de toilette is awful it was sent to me in error.&lt;br /&gt;The Eau de parfum can be wonderful</li>
            <li> too bad it is only in the parfum spray and the body powder and lotion aren&#x27;t.  this is a total stand by for me.</li>
            <li> Starting wearing this perfume after receiving it as a gift many years ago...so happy to find it&lt;br /&gt;again.  Have ordered before from other supplier and it was old, with no fragrance.  This&lt;br /&gt;time, perfect!  Such a light lovely scent...not overpowering like so many of the perfumes that&lt;br /&gt;are in vogue today!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is my favorite but it can be hard to find and expensive. I found it on Amazon easily. When it came, it was exactly what I ordered and expected for a good price. I&#x27;ll be doing it again.</li>
            <li> I had this fragrance many years ago, and loved it.  I saw it for sale on Amazon and was excited to be able to purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the fragrance I used to have.  It smells like alcohol, and burns my skin when I spray it on.  I had my daughter try it too, and the effect was the same.  After looking around on different sites, even this packaging is different.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot return it because of Amazon&#x27;s policy about hazardous waste, so this was an expensive lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have used this fragrance in the past - is the Bellodgia perfume that is available again, the same formula as it used to be?  I would love to be able to find the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the scent my grandmother wore, and I&#x27;ve kept it on hand for 40 years. This scent comes from France during the great Art Nouveau period. It is light and powdery like a carnation, but there&#x27;s a dash of spice that makes it a deep, layered, memorable scent. The House of Caron Paris is still one of the world&#x27;s great perfumers. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> First I couldn&#x27;t remember the name but remembered wearing it along with my best friend somewhere in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.  It is truly a lovely fragrance.  So many &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; perfumes and colognes are fruity and/or sweet smelling and gives me a headache but this is a gentle and fragrant mix of flowers with a highlight of carnations.  When I saw it on amazon I was excited to order it and am enjoying it as I write.</li>
