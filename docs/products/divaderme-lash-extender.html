            <li>It&#x27;s tricky to get the hang of it in the beginning, but after a couple tries, it works great!</li>
            <li>I had seen this demonstrated on the Dr Oz show and thought it looked easy.</li>
            <li>It does fall off easily.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>, I was not disappointed my lashes are thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a shot because my eyelashes really pop now.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a NEW tube of mascara that you have</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it does much for my lashes.</li>
            <li>This is worth getting.  </li>
            <li>You have to apply a wet mascara first, then apply the fibers which don&#x27;t apply easily, then apply more mascara.  </li>
            <li>Put your \\&quot;new\\&quot; mascara on first, than apply the Divaderme, than reapply</li>
            <li>so it is nice and wet.  </li>
            <li>Experiment before you go somewhere to be sure that you use it to it&#x27;s \\&quot;fullest\\&quot; potential.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the product and the service!</li>
            <li>The many fibers that fall on your cheeks have to be brushed away.  </li>
            <li>This little eyelash \\&quot;cheater\\&quot; is an amazing invention.</li>
            <li>My lashes really do look longer.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t really see any difference with or without it.</li>
            <li>It really works very well to lengthen my lashes.  </li>
            <li>, you can build it up as much as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this works just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>I will only probably use it on special occasions out.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the directions and LOOK DOWN into a mirror when applying.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that if I dont have my liquid lash extensions on, I feel like I am missing something</li>
            <li>I can have great length without using having to use fake lashes.</li>
            <li>Super long lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that you lean over and look down into a mirror to keep the flecks from getting in your eyes when you apply.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is incredible don&#x27;t be afraid to try you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li>(but with the clear mascara, they look natural.)</li>
            <li>You only put the lash extender on the very tips of your mascara applied to lashes.  </li>
            <li>Remember to ROLL the lash extender on just the tips, much like mascara for the final layer.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts</li>
            <li>I just wet my finger and wiped it right out.  </li>
            <li>The fibers do fall on your face, but it comes with a small brush to remove them easily.  </li>
            <li>and it really works my lashes look long and bushy.</li>
            <li>I did use a heated eyelash curler (point your hair dryer on it for few seconds) and it worked just fine and made more dramatic.</li>
            <li>I definitely didn&#x27;t know if this could possibly live up to the promise of giving you longer fuller lashes</li>
            <li>Try putting it on with a clear mascara for a lighter daily look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on mascara that I decided to just give it a try after hearing about it on a Dr. Oz show.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a moist mascara and not when it&#x27;s already half dried out.</li>
            <li>The only con i have found was ordering one bottle because my 24 yr old is using it constantly.</li>

            <li> This product is priced a little too high for what it delivers.</li>
            <li> At first it is a little messy because the fibers have a tendency to flake off the brush, but as you get use to it you can minimize the amount that falls off.  </li>
            <li> I just had to get used to it and be careful not to get it too close to my eyes, only on the ends to lengthen.  </li>
            <li> This product only comes in black, wish it was dark brown as it is pretty stark on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> and so your mascara won&#x27;t dry before you get a chance to put on the DivaDerm.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think i could have known how this product worked from any other information prior to purchasing other than a review like mine, which i didn&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> I just use the little facial towels to wipe after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> i expected a wet application.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking to get lash extensions but not that affordable at $150-$250 dollars for only a few weeks..</li>
            <li> and you have to frequently change mascara tubes because it becomes too thick.</li>
            <li> A few hours later in the restroom I had dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The Texture of Divaderme is little dry fibers that cling to the wet mascara.</li>
            <li> It did feel a little dry</li>
            <li> Otherwise the little loose fibers will fall onto your skin.</li>
            <li> REALLY NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.  </li>
            <li> By the time 10PM rolled around, they had REDUCED it down to $17.94.  </li>
            <li> When you are applying it you have to look down into a mirror, and some of the fibers do fall on the mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the little lashes getting everywhere</li>
            <li> The little lashes do not stay on your lashes and get all over your face, etc.  </li>
            <li> It tends to clump a little so your lashes don&#x27;t look whispy.</li>
            <li> defienetly extends lashes but can be a little messy.  </li>
            <li> I use this with ELF Clear Mascara, and I&#x27;ve gotta tell you, it makes my eyelashes look fake</li>
            <li> do recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a wow factor, but it&#x27;s quite expensive for mascara.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> but the few that fall off brush off your skin with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked multiple times if I was wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Just apply your usual mascara, use Divaderme over the ends of your eyelashes and apply mascara again to seal it.</li>
            <li> but the small fibers get into my eyes at times and also in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is not as hard to use as reported.</li>
            <li> Plus its less expensive than Latisse which can run $100.00 per bottle.  </li>
            <li> No more fake lashes for me.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very messy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I had a gift-card, so</li>
            <li> It helps thicken and lengthen your lashes so they look like fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is a bad, bad product.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> No matter what you read this is a terrible product.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used the Divaderme Lash extender on numerous occasions. My lashes really do look longer. I had seen this demonstrated on the Dr Oz show and thought it looked easy. You need to follow the instructions specifically. Put your \\&quot;new\\&quot; mascara on first, than apply the Divaderme, than reapply your mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros--your lashes look longer and thicker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons--More timely than applying regular mascara. Also, would occasionally flake off into my eye. [[ASIN:B00247PLOC Divaderme Lash Extender]]</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the directions and LOOK DOWN into a mirror when applying.  Otherwise the little loose fibers will fall onto your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this with ELF Clear Mascara, and I&#x27;ve gotta tell you, it makes my eyelashes look fake (but with the clear mascara, they look natural.) I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the little lashes getting everywhere (And I put my mascara on last, too.) I&#x27;ve been asked multiple times if I was wearing fake eyelashes. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I had a gift-card, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a wow factor, but it&#x27;s quite expensive for mascara. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with severely sensitive/contact bearing eyes. I wear contacts and noticed that sometimes I felt like there was something in there (I can&#x27;t be sure it was the mascara, though, but I thought I should mention it.)</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It&#x27;s important that you lean over and look down into a mirror to keep the flecks from getting in your eyes when you apply.  Make sure you have a good fresh mascara as well.  Super long lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered the DIVADERME Lash Extender (Lashes in a Bottle), after seeing a product like this demonstrated on Dr. Oz TV show.  Got it thru Hair Extensions Company.  Love it!  I give it 4*stars because of the pricey tag on it.  It ended up being around $23.00.  I left it in my cart at Amazon.com on a Sunday afternoon.  By the time 10PM rolled around, they had REDUCED it down to $17.94.  I am blond with short stubby blond lashes.  This product is pretty great.  Follow the directions on the box it comes in.  Make sure to use a NEW tube of mascara that you have so it is nice and wet.  If you don&#x27;t, the lash extender won&#x27;t stick.  Think of the mascara as the &#x27;glue.&#x27;  Put on your Mascara, then Lash Extender, then mascara again as final glue.  You only put the lash extender on the very tips of your mascara applied to lashes.  This product only comes in black, wish it was dark brown as it is pretty stark on my complexion.  Because of price for the Lash Extender I will only probably use it on special occasions out.  I had no problems applying it.  Remember to ROLL the lash extender on just the tips, much like mascara for the final layer.  I did use a heated eyelash curler (point your hair dryer on it for few seconds) and it worked just fine and made more dramatic. I definitely will buy this product again.  Good Luck ladies, your gonna love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it looked like it worked on the Dr. Oz show.  However, I can&#x27;t really see any difference with or without it.</li>
            <li> This is worth getting.  It makes your eyelashes stand out.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you read the directions and follow them.  It does what it says.  It extends and increases the lash.</li>
            <li> Looks wonderful.  The thickest fullest lashes I&#x27;ve ever had.  I was so pleased.  A few hours later in the restroom I had dark circles under my eyes.  It does fall off easily.  Experiment before you go somewhere to be sure that you use it to it&#x27;s \\&quot;fullest\\&quot; potential.  If you think you look better, you feel better about yourself.  You be the judge.</li>
            <li> saw this on dr. oz show and thought it would be a sure bet.  i followed the directions to use a good mascara and then apply divaderme.  i expected a wet application.  it&#x27;s a bottle of tiny hair-like pieces.  it also says to keep a tissue under your eye when you apply, as the hair-like pieces go everywhere.  even though you do that, they still go everywhere, throughout the day.  this is the problem.  they don&#x27;t stay where they&#x27;re put.  i suppose you would have to put a lot of mascara on and then apply the extender lashes.  i don&#x27;t use a lot of mascara and prefer a cleaner look for daytime.  i don&#x27;t think i could have known how this product worked from any other information prior to purchasing other than a review like mine, which i didn&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> defienetly extends lashes but can be a little messy.  better to apply before adding makeup so that you are able to wipe off excess particles.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  It really works very well to lengthen my lashes.  The fibers do fall on your face, but it comes with a small brush to remove them easily.  I use these often, and would recommend them to everyone.  Thank you so much for the product and the service!</li>
            <li> This product totally works! It is not as hard to use as reported. If you&#x27;re use to wearing mascara you&#x27;ll have no problem. You&#x27;ll get so carried away with the length &amp; fullness you might forget to put on the last coat of mascara to seal it. Don&#x27;t forget. Do one eye at a time to see the difference and so your mascara won&#x27;t dry before you get a chance to put on the DivaDerm. You will love this product. Try putting it on with a clear mascara for a lighter daily look.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. The minute you apply it to your eyelashes you get powder all over your cheeks.  I didn&#x27;t see any extension results.  What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I love this lash extender. I can have great length without using having to use fake lashes. The only drawback would be it clumps your mascara product. You have to use lash extender on top of your mascara and you have to frequently change mascara tubes because it becomes too thick.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I just had to get used to it and be careful not to get it too close to my eyes, only on the ends to lengthen.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very messy and difficult to use. I only used it a couple of times and the fibers have globbed up at the tip and don&#x27;t apply to the lashes any longer.  The many fibers that fall on your cheeks have to be brushed away.  You have to apply a wet mascara first, then apply the fibers which don&#x27;t apply easily, then apply more mascara.  REALLY NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever!  I have short lashes and don&#x27;t have a lot of them. This stuff sticks to your mascara, you can build it up as much as you&#x27;d like. I prefer to use 2 coats, sometimes 3 of the Lash Extender on my mascara. It helps thicken and lengthen your lashes so they look like fake eyelashes. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on mascara that I decided to just give it a try after hearing about it on a Dr. Oz show. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a shot because my eyelashes really pop now.  I got some inside my eye and it didn&#x27;t irritate it. I just wet my finger and wiped it right out.  It did feel a little dry but that was it - no burning like you get with mascara. The Texture of Divaderme is little dry fibers that cling to the wet mascara. At first it is a little messy because the fibers have a tendency to flake off the brush, but as you get use to it you can minimize the amount that falls off.  I just use the little facial towels to wipe after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> No matter what you read this is a terrible product.  The little lashes do not stay on your lashes and get all over your face, etc.  There should be a health warning with it because they also get in your eyes.  This is a bad, bad product.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! It&#x27;s tricky to get the hang of it in the beginning, but after a couple tries, it works great!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. It is easy to apply and it does much for my lashes. No more fake lashes for me. Lash extensions does it!!!</li>
            <li> This little eyelash \\&quot;cheater\\&quot; is an amazing invention. For those women, who have short eyelashes like me, it&#x27;s a must-have. Easy to use with amazing results. Just apply your usual mascara, use Divaderme over the ends of your eyelashes and apply mascara again to seal it. Make sure you use a moist mascara and not when it&#x27;s already half dried out. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> The product does make your lashes appear longer, however; it&#x27;s expensive and doesn&#x27;t work any better than drug store products currently on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a good while and it really works my lashes look long and bushy. This product is easy to remove and it&#x27;ll make your lashes look like falsies!</li>
            <li> This product is priced a little too high for what it delivers. I&#x27;ll likely keep it and use it sparingly. It tends to clump a little so your lashes don&#x27;t look whispy.</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t know if this could possibly live up to the promise of giving you longer fuller lashes but it did!  I saw reviews regarding the pieces that come off but the few that fall off brush off your skin with no problem.  And they didn&#x27;t fall off throughout the day.  If you use mascara, then the extender on the tips of your lashes and then mascara again, you will not have this problem.  I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts so I was worried about irritation but it did not bother my eyes whatsoever.  I figured I needed to write this review because I do wish my lashes were a bit longer and this does the trick.  Not one mascara I have used could do what this does.</li>
            <li> I have been looking to get lash extensions but not that affordable at $150-$250 dollars for only a few weeks..so I see Dr. Oz promoting these lash fibers but they don&#x27;t give you the brand and i take a chance and order the Divaderme lash extender..Well ladies let me tell you this stuff is GREAT! It makes my lashes thicker and longer. You control both apply till your heart is content..They don&#x27;t fall off or shed as some people have said but you do have to follow directions. The only con i have found was ordering one bottle because my 24 yr old is using it constantly. Seriously, this stuff is incredible don&#x27;t be afraid to try you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was a add on purchase. All the reviews said it worked well, I was not disappointed my lashes are thicker and longer. Love it.</li>
            <li> I saw this product or a similiar one on the Dr. Oz show and I have to say I love love love it....My lashes instantly looked longer and my eyes looked bigger. When you are applying it you have to look down into a mirror, and some of the fibers do fall on the mirror but none have gotten into my eye.  I am an eye doctor and patients ask me about Latisse which is a presciption product that gives you longer lashes....I have to say, this works just as good if not better! Plus its less expensive than Latisse which can run $100.00 per bottle.  I love it so much that if I dont have my liquid lash extensions on, I feel like I am missing something....It&#x27;s great.. I recommend you give it a try, but beware: you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> Mentioned on Dr OZ but it is not a product I will buy again, in fact ended up throwing it away, product comes off on face while applying</li>
            <li> This product does work well but the small fibers get into my eyes at times and also in the skin around my eyes.</li>
