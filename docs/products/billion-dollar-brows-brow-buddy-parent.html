            <li>I have to be honest, the eyebrow pencil works great.  </li>
            <li>For getting a good line for the brows, it works well.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at it.</li>
            <li>very easy to use, well designed, good quality.</li>
            <li>Great, easy to use product.</li>
            <li>This is where this product comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Would be nice with diagrahm or pictures with it in box.</li>
            <li>Good as advertise and easy instructions.</li>
            <li>Very easy and precise!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ingenious but didn&#x27;t need it?</li>
            <li>love it and all my girlfriends have found their shape as well.</li>
            <li>While this did give me  a better idea of where my browns should start, arch and end</li>
            <li>Definitely measured my brows perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Needs more instructions with it, but can figure it out.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but it works wonderfully, Came promptly and in good condition,I have always had a hard time shaping my eyebrows, and menepause made my tails fall out</li>
            <li>You can find many sites on line with better FREE how-to instructions.  </li>
            <li>A novice would be better off purchasing a cheap stencil kit and then bookmarking some of their favorite eyebrow webpages.</li>
            <li>I love the concept and it works fine</li>
            <li>Different and unique kit for forming the perfect brow for you.</li>
            <li>Brows are the most important feature on your face.</li>
            <li>The cost is too high for something that can be done using a ruler, a white pencil, a large mirror with good lightning and a good pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;There are many Youtube  videos that DIY shaping eyebrows and they offer great help.</li>
            <li>Icould never get it quite right free hand are with the many stencils I have tried!</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery plus a perfect little eyebrow tool to keep your brows groomed in between waxes.</li>
            <li>just confirmed my angles were on point.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think that this tool really did anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>I suppose you could get really nice brows if you hold it straight</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I am a permanent makeup artist and I find brow tools to be an indispensable part of my business.  </li>
            <li>Very useful tool to help mark out the eyebrow points onto the face.</li>
            <li>Its just a very cheap, lightweight piece of plastic and the marking pencil, I don&#x27;t really get it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok... don&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li>I found this nifty tool and now my brows are more symmetric and natural looking!  </li>
            <li>Highly recomended !!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth your 20$</li>
            <li>and am able to recreate a fairly natural looking tail in the right shape thanks to this.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast and everything that it said it came with was included.</li>
            <li>Lost most my hair with chemo treatments and not all has grown back.</li>
            <li>but I wish the white pencil that came with it was better quality.</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that helps me perfect my thick eyebrows.</li>
            <li>There are so many tutorials online that show you how to find these points by simply lining up certain points on your nose to certain points of your eye using a pencil.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>you can just press it gently to your skin and will leave a mark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need this fancy contraption to do that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for inventing this.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to purchase these</li>
            <li>Very helpful in understanding how to correctly &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought this was going to really make a difference in the way I shape my eyebrows...</li>
            <li>You live and learn!</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to grow my real hair back....</li>
            <li>The tool is a joke, it asks you to line it up in different places so that you can determine the exact spot where your eyebrows should begin,, arch and end.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were not as clear as they could have been.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing this can do that a simple pencil or anything else with a straight edge can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>Most women know how to fix their eyebrows by using a thin pencil to make your 3 marks in order to produce natural looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s kind of expensive for a piece of plastic, but beauty knows no boundaries.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> perfect tool for perfect brows!</li>
            <li> This has to be the STUPIDEST thing I have ever used! It doesn&#x27;t even explain HOW to use it!! Total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I use this item to draw on eyebrows for my clients in order to create a flawless pattern to then tattoo permanent brows on!!! It works perfectly and helps with lining everything up. Couldn&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> Different and unique kit for forming the perfect brow for you.</li>
            <li> God why did I ever buy this product? It&#x27;s ingenious but didn&#x27;t need it? Didn&#x27;t help me get perfect eyebrows just confirmed my angles were on point. My quest for the perfect brow continues.</li>
            <li> love it and all my girlfriends have found their shape as well.</li>
            <li> There is no need for the pen. you can just press it gently to your skin and will leave a mark.&lt;br /&gt;I have sparse eyebrows so this doesnt work for me.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, great tool idea, helps you to make your brows perfect (or your client ones, if you are a brow design/ makeup artist) even when you did not drink your coffee yet!</li>
            <li> Brows are the most important feature on your face. They can either make or break your entire look. I have a difficult time with mine because they naturally grow uneven, in different directions and one is higher than the other. I thought this guide would help me determine symmetry. While this did give me  a better idea of where my browns should start, arch and end i didn&#x27;t think that this tool really did anything spectacular. I could have just used a pencil. I don&#x27;t think this is worth the money. Just use the pencil trick you will get the same idea.</li>
            <li> Saw this on youtube and then she said Amazon carried it. Took me awhile to decide if I would try it. First time was almost perfect and the pencil that comes with it just blends in flawless . Ordered extra pencils and plan on doing my eyebrows myself from now on. The tool is such a lightweight easy to use gadget that makes learning something like this less scary for me. Will replace it if something happens to this one and will never use any other brow pencil.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I may have been using wrong, I watched a few videos on utube but still did not work. The instructions were not as clear as they could have been. When I tried using it, I felt like my eyebrows were to close together.</li>
            <li> Very easy and precise! Good tool!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, the eyebrow pencil works great.  There really is no need for the gadget it comes with.  Most women know how to fix their eyebrows by using a thin pencil to make your 3 marks in order to produce natural looking eyebrows.  You live and learn!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing this can do that a simple pencil or anything else with a straight edge can&#x27;t do.  It&#x27;s used to find critical areas of your eyebrow (such as where to start it, arch it, and end it).  There are so many tutorials online that show you how to find these points by simply lining up certain points on your nose to certain points of your eye using a pencil.  You really don&#x27;t need this fancy contraption to do that.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be the answer to all my eyebrow problems.  The tool is a joke, it asks you to line it up in different places so that you can determine the exact spot where your eyebrows should begin,, arch and end.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be very helpful.  It also includes a step by step picture how-to.  The pictures are not good quality and were no help to me.  Save yourself the money. You can find many sites on line with better FREE how-to instructions.  A novice would be better off purchasing a cheap stencil kit and then bookmarking some of their favorite eyebrow webpages.</li>
            <li> It works as designed I guess.  Once I used it, I did not need to use it again.  For getting a good line for the brows, it works well.  I just do not use it now after I figured out how to shape the brow.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a ton of other stencils and my brows were always crooked!  I found this nifty tool and now my brows are more symmetric and natural looking!  Thanks for inventing this.</li>
            <li> Good as advertise and easy instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tattoo artist who also does permanent makeup and this thing saves my life on a daily basis,great product.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery plus a perfect little eyebrow tool to keep your brows groomed in between waxes. Great to bring with you when traveling.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived very fast and everything that it said it came with was included. Loved it.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase these but I am NOT good at making my eyebrows look even. I&#x27;ve never been good at it. After accidentally shaving my eyebrow off during a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; I just shaved them both off and got permanent eyebrows drawn on. After a while those fade and I really wanted to grow my real hair back....which has taken forever! During the process I started to use a fill in and wax to make them grow the way I wanted. This is where this product comes in handy. I like. It&#x27;s simple, not overly expensive and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I guess you can use a ruler if you wanted but I found these a lot easier for me.</li>
            <li> The description of this item made it seem as though shaping your eyebrows would be a no-brainer. It&#x27;s supposed to eliminate human error and give you &amp;#34;perfect brows&amp;#34;...ummm not really. I suppose you could get really nice brows if you hold it straight and if you unfold both sides to the same position. I could have done without.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Cheaply made. Can do the same thing with small ruler. Manufacturer should be ashamed of this garbage.</li>
            <li> Great item to do perfect brows.  Never knew how to do my eyebrows until I saw this tool on U tube.  I think it&#x27;s kind of expensive for a piece of plastic, but beauty knows no boundaries.  Works like it says and now I have brows again.  Lost most my hair with chemo treatments and not all has grown back.</li>
            <li> Very helpful in understanding how to correctly &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but it works wonderfully, Came promptly and in good condition,I have always had a hard time shaping my eyebrows, and menepause made my tails fall out I use it all the time.  and am able to recreate a fairly natural looking tail in the right shape thanks to this. Icould never get it quite right free hand are with the many stencils I have tried!</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use product. Finally, a product that helps me perfect my thick eyebrows. Took a while to get the hang of, but when u get it your eyebrows will thank you!</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought this was going to really make a difference in the way I shape my eyebrows...I suppose the name, billion dollar brow lol. Actually I suppose it could be a helpful tool for those who are just beginning to understand shaping brows. Its just a very cheap, lightweight piece of plastic and the marking pencil, I don&#x27;t really get it. I say save your money, watch a YOUTUBE video</li>
            <li> Definitely measured my brows perfectly!  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recomended !!!</li>
            <li> I love the concept and it works fine but I wish the white pencil that came with it was better quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... don&#x27;t really use it what so ever though</li>
            <li> Wife says it can be difficult to use, but it works!</li>
            <li> Not sure if you need this tool, I don&#x27;t see the hype behind this product....</li>
            <li> Needs more instructions with it, but can figure it out.Can still use as basic design. Would be nice with diagrahm or pictures with it in box.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows make or break a face. Beautifully shaped brows make eyes stand out in a face. Shaping brows is an art, but the brow buddy kit is not a fool proof method to shape eyebrows. The cost is too high for something that can be done using a ruler, a white pencil, a large mirror with good lightning and a good pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;There are many Youtube  videos that DIY shaping eyebrows and they offer great help. Us them.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth your 20$</li>
            <li> I am a permanent makeup artist and I find brow tools to be an indispensable part of my business.  This brow tool is excellent and helps me get perfect brows in no time at all. very easy to use, well designed, good quality.</li>
            <li> One of the best beauty purchases this year1</li>
            <li> Bought this brow kit for my makeup tattooing business. Very useful tool to help mark out the eyebrow points onto the face.</li>
            <li> Yes the best tool and I will recommend it to my friends.  Thank you invent this tools. I love it</li>
