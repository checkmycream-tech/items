    <ol>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush!</li>
            <li>It performs as well as a best badger brush and no animal odor.</li>
            <li>Makes a great lather too!</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a very good starter brush.</li>
            <li>Incredible value at this price.</li>
            <li>Happy I did.</li>
            <li>it is great</li>
            <li>What impressed me about the brush is how easy it is to lather soap/cream.  </li>
            <li>Good brush.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it still does a good job of lathering up and application.  </li>
            <li>This one is almost as good.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed the first time I used this product, was not expecting it to work as well as it does.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I used it, and it was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect for creams or soft soaps like Cella.  </li>
            <li>brissels on your face doesn&#x27;t lather as good but still does a pretty good job</li>
            <li>This is much better.</li>
            <li>Love this compared the bore or badger hair brushes it doesn&#x27;t shed or leave</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Omega Syntex is one of my favorite brushes.  </li>
            <li>This more than does the job.</li>
            <li>and it is supposedly a better exfoliator.</li>
            <li>However, the standard is not always the best for everybody.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it and didn&#x27;t expect to like it this much.</li>
            <li>Love this synthetic, works well.</li>
            <li>The great thing about that is you don&#x27;t need to worry about this brush ever drying out completely.</li>
            <li>If price is the most important factor to you</li>
            <li>Have more important things to do than worry about debating the virtues (and smell) of boar bristle.</li>
            <li>for the brush itself, this synthetic brush is pretty nice, all things considered.  </li>
            <li>Easy to load &amp; easy to clean after a shave.  </li>
            <li>also enjoy there is no pre-soak required, and no need to break-in the bristles over the course of a couple weeks the way you do with a boar brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more prickly and requires a little more product, but in both these respects, it&#x27;s still as good as my Best Badger brush.</li>
            <li>One nice thing so far is NO BRISTLE FALLOUT!  </li>
            <li>It also rinses through quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>An excellent brush for beginners to wet shaving, such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Proraso soap, I am able to make gobs of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better than a smelly badger (if that&#x27;s what they really are?) brush.</li>
            <li>Have never had a synthetic brush, but this one seems similar to boar, feels good, works well.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;-Is easy to clean and will not trap bacteria like natural fiber</li>
            <li>Price is right and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>This brush does not shed like natural badger or boar and feels comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>First time using a product like this.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t put a dent in your pocket book compared to the higher end</li>
            <li>In my opinion the higher priced Parker is well worth it, even though about $10 more than the Omega, it still costs much less than most quality natural brushes</li>
            <li>and it seems to bounce back to its original shape after a rinse/shake in fairly quick order.</li>
            <li>good for travel, hard to lather with as it is so floppy, but for the price and for the perks of not having animal smell, or the need to soak it or store it properly, It is worth trying.</li>
            <li>While I was really pleased with the Parker synthetic as a replacement for the natural bristle brush, was much less pleased with the Omega brush.</li>
            <li>Size was a bit small for my bear paws but good for traveling</li>
            <li>Soft, bristles don&#x27;t come out, lightweight for traveling, and drys quickly.</li>
            <li>I started conducting some tests, and found I got the same reaction when I shaved and when I used my roommate&#x27;s German Shepherd for a pillow, and realized with a shock both that I would need to give up shaving for good and that I would,need to get a new pillow.</li>
            <li>This brush was very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold scents as much as hair brushes.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to switch to a murker straight blade shaver.</li>
            <li>You could let the whole thing soak in water for a month and it would be like-new.</li>
            <li>You could even use it and keep it in the shower, along with your straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also most badgers are beaten to death in china for their hair and skinned alive by local villagers who are paid by the government for the skins to make things like badger brushes.</li>
            <li>I have relegated the Omega to my travel bag and gone back to my old Parker for day to day use and now appreciate even more.</li>
            <li>This brush is easy to dry, no odor, keeps its shape better than all other brushes.</li>
            <li>I wanted a travel brush that was cheap, would dry fast, and work well.</li>
            <li>I will report back later if I find something interesting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds water decent, just not as well as a silvertip badger brush.  </li>
            <li>This seems to get high reviews from everybody, and I concur.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how good the longevity the brush is since I have been using it only for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>The synthetic bristles feel soft, and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>After opening the package, the initial highlight for me was the lack of strong animal smell so characteristic of badger or boar</li>
            <li>Many people prefer natural (badger or some other fur) brushes, but this is definitely the way to start.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad brush, not really that soft but lathers well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, and the handle is molded, not lathe-turned, but the little Omega Syntex gets the job done as well as anything does.</li>
            <li>brush I got is a clear green&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I had an issue with the natural material in my old brush coming out during use.</li>
            <li>degrade like natural fiber&lt;</li>
            <li>; I said, &amp;#34;how could I betray that old badger hair brush?&amp;#34; I said.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>and I think nearly equals their performance.  </li>
            <li>The brush has enough body to build a good lather, thick enough to hold water, yet fairly soft.  </li>
            <li>Using it with a shave stick whipped up the lather pretty quickly, but not quite as well as my Omega Mixed Midget that&#x27;s been broken-in over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not long after after falling hopelessly in love with the excessive ritualism of shaving with a badger hair brush and straight edge, I started to notice a general trend of my overprotective sinuses starting to talk back, like when my mom me to summer camp with spf 400 sunscreen.</li>
            <li>overall, I&#x27;d give it 4 stars for the ease of use, good lathering ability, and mediocre water holding ability.</li>
            <li>Like any other brush, soak the brush in hot water for a couple minutes, remove excess water from the brush, and have at it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well and builds up a lot of lather with minimal soap.</li>
            <li>Not only is it 100% synthetic, it doesn&#x27;t shed like my old badger brush did.</li>
            <li>Natural brushes usually have a break in period, and also a certain smell when they arrive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to badger brushes, this brush is a little firmer, but not by much.  </li>

            <li> The grip may be a bit on the small side for my large mitts, but it is not a big issue.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be holding up, but the brush is very soft with little body (spring).  </li>
            <li> As a fan of the old school wet shaves, I prefer the boar brushes over badger due to the stiffness/backbone.  </li>
            <li> The hubby likes this little brush and it&#x27;s holding up well so far.</li>
            <li> brush is both firm and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put it halfway between a stiff brush and a soft brush.  </li>
            <li> Usually use a natural bristle brush for shaving and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t loose hairs which is a plus.</li>
            <li> the Parker is my choice, it would be hard for me to tell the difference between the Parker and a natural brush.  </li>
            <li> Stiff enough to use any soaps I want.</li>
            <li> I have a high quality Omega synthetic brush that I use daily, but it&#x27;s too expensive to take on a camping trip.</li>
            <li> Synthetic brushes have the advanages of no animal products, therefore no wet animal smell, they require less care, hold up well over time and usually much less expensive than natural brushes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-You can leave unused soap on the brush, since the brush wont deteriorate, so you  waste a lot less soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of nasty.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Parker to replace a fairly expensive natural brush.</li>
            <li> With this brush you get what you pay for, no more.  </li>
            <li> Using it for hard soaps, it does work...</li>
            <li> plus is it doesn&#x27;t NEAR as bad as hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> Attached a cord to the base, so it could dry upside down in the shower.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s also pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just silly not to try it.</li>
            <li> disappointing</li>
            <li> That was a bad week.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs and this adds a touch of pampering.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake that badger hair is obtained cruelly at the cost of the badgers life, and for all you know a badger brush from China could be dog or horse hair, because there is zero oversight or regulation in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Usually use a natural bristle brush for shaving and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  Happy I did. Soft, bristles don&#x27;t come out, lightweight for traveling, and drys quickly. Price is right and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed the first time I used this product, was not expecting it to work as well as it does.&lt;br /&gt;But considering I am replacing a product that I have used for over 39 years it is great</li>
            <li> This brush does not shed like natural badger or boar and feels comfortable on the skin. For the price it&#x27;s an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Good brush.  Size was a bit small for my bear paws but good for traveling</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush to go with my recent DE razor purchase. I didn&#x27;t want to get a animal-hair brush and chose a synthetic instead. I use this brush with the Proraso shaving soap. It works really well and builds up a lot of lather with minimal soap. It also rinses through quickly and cleanly. Overall, it is low maintenance and does its job quite well. I do not use a stand with the brush and it seems to bounce back to its original shape after a rinse/shake in fairly quick order. The grip may be a bit on the small side for my large mitts, but it is not a big issue. I am not sure how good the longevity the brush is since I have been using it only for a couple of weeks. I will report back later if I find something interesting.</li>
            <li> First time using a product like this. After reading reviews I could not support the brushes with boar bristles. The killing conditions are as severe as the baby fur seals.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is both firm and soft. Stays intact. Doesn&#x27;t lose bristles. I hate shaving my legs and this adds a touch of pampering.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving brush. I have had shaving brushes made from badger hair and pig whiskers. This is much better.</li>
            <li> Great brush! It performs as well as a best badger brush and no animal odor. The brush also seems to lather faster and doesn&#x27;t absorb product. This brush was very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Order says red,&lt;br /&gt;Label says red,&lt;br /&gt;The brush I got is a clear green&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Love this compared the bore or badger hair brushes it doesn&#x27;t shed or leave brissels on your face doesn&#x27;t lather as good but still does a pretty good job I just didn&#x27;t like the others leaving brissels  on my face</li>
            <li> I bought this when I started using a safety razor.  The synthetic bristles feel soft, and dry quickly.  Many people prefer natural (badger or some other fur) brushes, but this is definitely the way to start.  Natural brushes usually have a break in period, and also a certain smell when they arrive.  This is not the case with synthetic brushes.  For the price, this is a very good starter brush.</li>
            <li> The hubby likes this little brush and it&#x27;s holding up well so far.</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush, not really that soft but lathers well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Stiff enough to use any soaps I want. Doesn&#x27;t hold scents as much as hair brushes. Also doesn&#x27;t loose hairs which is a plus.</li>
            <li> As a fan of the old school wet shaves, I prefer the boar brushes over badger due to the stiffness/backbone.  However, this brush is an acception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is an affordable brush.  It won&#x27;t put a dent in your pocket book compared to the higher end brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to badger brushes, this brush is a little firmer, but not by much.  What impressed me about the brush is how easy it is to lather soap/cream.  Like any other brush, soak the brush in hot water for a couple minutes, remove excess water from the brush, and have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is it doesn&#x27;t NEAR as bad as hair brushes.  Easy to load &amp; easy to clean after a shave.  Omega Syntex is one of my favorite brushes.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to dry, no odor, keeps its shape better than all other brushes. Incredible value at this price.</li>
            <li> This happens to be a lot softer than I had thought it was going to be.  That being said, it still does a good job of lathering up and application.  One nice thing so far is NO BRISTLE FALLOUT!  If that is an annoyance for you like it was for me, then this is one brush you should take a look at and for the price it&#x27;s just silly not to try it.</li>
            <li> An excellent brush for beginners to wet shaving, such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Proraso soap, I am able to make gobs of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell like a boar brush, and an alternative solution if you have an animal thing.</li>
            <li> This seems to get high reviews from everybody, and I concur. I wanted a travel brush that was cheap, would dry fast, and work well. This more than does the job. I have a high quality Omega synthetic brush that I use daily, but it&#x27;s too expensive to take on a camping trip. This one is almost as good. It&#x27;s a little more prickly and requires a little more product, but in both these respects, it&#x27;s still as good as my Best Badger brush. It works up plenty of lather.I get a three-pass shave without going back to the bowl. It&#x27;s light weight, and the handle is molded, not lathe-turned, but the little Omega Syntex gets the job done as well as anything does.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the natural material in my old brush coming out during use. This omega has never once shed on me.</li>
            <li> Not only is it 100% synthetic, it doesn&#x27;t shed like my old badger brush did. Makes a great lather too!</li>
            <li> After opening the package, the initial highlight for me was the lack of strong animal smell so characteristic of badger or boar brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush itself, this synthetic brush is pretty nice, all things considered.  I&#x27;d put it halfway between a stiff brush and a soft brush.  It would be perfect for creams or soft soaps like Cella.  Using it for hard soaps, it does work... but it lacks that extra oomf you get from a short boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy there is no pre-soak required, and no need to break-in the bristles over the course of a couple weeks the way you do with a boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds water decent, just not as well as a silvertip badger brush.  Using it with a shave stick whipped up the lather pretty quickly, but not quite as well as my Omega Mixed Midget that&#x27;s been broken-in over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;d give it 4 stars for the ease of use, good lathering ability, and mediocre water holding ability.</li>
            <li> good for travel, hard to lather with as it is so floppy, but for the price and for the perks of not having animal smell, or the need to soak it or store it properly, It is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use animal products but I wanted to switch to a murker straight blade shaver. They require a brush like this to lather the soap. I was thinking about getting a badger brush because it seems to be the standard and it is supposedly a better exfoliator. However, the standard is not always the best for everybody. I chose this synthetic brush for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, a badger brush will degrade and the bristles fall out, basically because water rots the hair. That&#x27;s kind of nasty. Also most badgers are beaten to death in china for their hair and skinned alive by local villagers who are paid by the government for the skins to make things like badger brushes. That&#x27;s also pretty nasty. Make no mistake that badger hair is obtained cruelly at the cost of the badgers life, and for all you know a badger brush from China could be dog or horse hair, because there is zero oversight or regulation in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This synthetic brush will not degrade over time. You could let the whole thing soak in water for a month and it would be like-new. The great thing about that is you don&#x27;t need to worry about this brush ever drying out completely. You could even use it and keep it in the shower, along with your straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does exfoliate, as well as the simple act of a razor gliding across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion this brush:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t stink like a badger&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t degrade like natural fiber&lt;br /&gt;-Is easy to clean and will not trap bacteria like natural fiber&lt;br /&gt;-Is inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-Does not cost a life to make&lt;br /&gt;-You can leave unused soap on the brush, since the brush wont deteriorate, so you  waste a lot less soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helped!</li>
            <li> Way better than a smelly badger (if that&#x27;s what they really are?) brush.</li>
            <li> Not long after after falling hopelessly in love with the excessive ritualism of shaving with a badger hair brush and straight edge, I started to notice a general trend of my overprotective sinuses starting to talk back, like when my mom me to summer camp with spf 400 sunscreen. I started conducting some tests, and found I got the same reaction when I shaved and when I used my roommate&#x27;s German Shepherd for a pillow, and realized with a shock both that I would need to give up shaving for good and that I would,need to get a new pillow. That was a bad week.&lt;br /&gt;But then came the synthetic shaving brush! &amp;#34;It won&#x27;t be the same,&amp;#34; I said, &amp;#34;how could I betray that old badger hair brush?&amp;#34; I said.&lt;br /&gt;Well I used it, and it was pretty awesome. Now I&#x27;m back to knicking my neck on a daily basis, pretending I know how to shave like a proper hipster boss.</li>
            <li> With this brush you get what you pay for, no more.  It does seem to be holding up, but the brush is very soft with little body (spring).  I bought it to replace a Parker synthetic brush I had used for several years after I dropped it in the shower and broke off part of the handle.  I had purchased the Parker to replace a fairly expensive natural brush. I bought this Omega because of the lower price and the reviews. While I was really pleased with the Parker synthetic as a replacement for the natural bristle brush, was much less pleased with the Omega brush. Synthetic brushes have the advanages of no animal products, therefore no wet animal smell, they require less care, hold up well over time and usually much less expensive than natural brushes. Between the Omega and Parker the Parker is my choice, it would be hard for me to tell the difference between the Parker and a natural brush.  The brush has enough body to build a good lather, thick enough to hold water, yet fairly soft.  I have relegated the Omega to my travel bag and gone back to my old Parker for day to day use and now appreciate even more. In my opinion the higher priced Parker is well worth it, even though about $10 more than the Omega, it still costs much less than most quality natural brushes and I think nearly equals their performance.  If price is the most important factor to you the Omega will get the job done.  It just does not feel as solid as I prefer.</li>
            <li> Have never had a synthetic brush, but this one seems similar to boar, feels good, works well.  I am happy with it and didn&#x27;t expect to like it this much.</li>
            <li> Love this synthetic, works well. Have more important things to do than worry about debating the virtues (and smell) of boar bristle. Attached a cord to the base, so it could dry upside down in the shower.</li>
