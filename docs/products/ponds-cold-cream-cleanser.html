            <li>It is a very good buy.  </li>
            <li>This product is very good and incredibly beautifull.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li>NOT A MOISTIZER,BUT A GREAT CLEANSER.</li>
            <li>the pores greatly.</li>
            <li>Great product, I just wish they made it unscented.</li>

            <li>Great product works good for me.</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>and this works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cleanser that was effective and moisturizing without spending 50 bucks a container.</li>
            <li>this product is also good for a general face cleaning as well as excellent at removing make-up.</li>
            <li>Great product, good price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>a good deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal, good price, a clean face, what more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>This is the best thing to use if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I first cleanse my face with a very warm washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was appreciated greatly.</li>
            <li>Yes, I Love, Love, love, love  it....</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff, but they changed the formula, and it burns my eyes when removing eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to get this again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This was my mother&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could have her around to buy her more of her favorite things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gentle: Many scrubs or exfoliants, including makeup remover wipes, will cause irritation acne break outs on my skin.</li>
            <li>, what more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>Not a wrinkle in sight! :)</li>
            <li>...cleanses off makeup better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>The scent could be better but it did not bother me.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really great after using it for a few weeks, and since it is so rich, I do t hVe to add a moisturizer to my evening routine (great with a newborn in the house!).</li>
            <li>This was a nice, big jar of it for a great price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, makes the skin soft.</li>
            <li>Cheap, gentle &amp; works good, but will leave an oily residue</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>So this is a product I really wanted to review because it is freaking amazing.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a new favorite!</li>
            <li>Not the original.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fragrance, no over-powering scent or perfume.</li>
            <li>I massaged it in and then wiped/rinsed it in the shower and--strange but true</li>
            <li>This cream is super greasy for my combination skin</li>
            <li>The longer you leave the product on the more sensitive your skin will be!</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought a 3.5 oz at CVS and it worked better than face wipes and makes me feel clean and dry after using instead of oily.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I could never bring myself to throw those beautiful white glass jars away -- not until I had a whole closet full of them, that is, and decided it was either me or the jars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years, but always come back to Pond&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to wait for results: They were clearer in the first two days I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better: It&#x27;s inexpensive and I can get it at my local grocery store.  </li>
            <li>First of all, when I opened the jar, my husband wanted to know what the &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; was.  </li>
            <li>First, it removed all of my make-up, including mascara and liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always tended to find the most success with those &amp;#34;tried and true&amp;#34; products that have been used by parents, grandparents, and great grandparents, and Pond&#x27;s cold cream is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Someone suggested I use it as a sort of aftershave, and I was willing to try it out.</li>
            <li>if you do what it says in the directions , it leaves your skin silky smooth and really soft</li>
            <li>If the bottom line was the issue, I would be willing to pay a few more cents to keep the original product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you guys very, very much.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>I currently use a soft dry washcloth to remove most of the cream and then follow with a splash of water :)</li>
            <li>Was very happy to get the Ponds Cold Cream.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>Once a night before I go to bed, I will gather some on a reusable makeup remover cloth and gently exfoliate my skin before rinsing it off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for both a face cleanser and a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very practical product and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I Bought this to remove Waterproof mascara and it really worked also</li>
            <li>I used to love how soft it left the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Something about mineral oil molecules being too large, which is one of those things that sounds as though it could either be counterintuitive but true, or it could be somebody&#x27;s fuzzily-reasoned idea that doesn&#x27;t actually work in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more luck with acne control just using Ponds every night than I have with any other acne formulated product.</li>
            <li>cream has a light texture, the scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t have an intimidatingly long list of really wild chemical ingredients (it&#x27;s mostly mineral oil and beeswax, although there are a couple of parabens and preservatives that I&#x27;m not too crazy about).</li>
            <li>Find something that is extremely soft and be extremely gentle!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic and this never triggers a reaction, cleans well and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>the new plastic jars Ponds comes in now.</li>
            <li>my skin feels very soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>only word of caution is to be gentle when you remove the product from your face!</li>
            <li>I have no regrets with this product and Iwill absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I recommend wiping it off with a wet rag or washing it off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stubborn: To actually remove Ponds from your face, even with a rag, is not as easy as wiping your face and drying off.</li>
            <li>--it does clear pores.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 93 and has used this cream almost all of her adult life.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have developed a reaction to it after all these years.</li>
            <li>It smells like what would happen if you made old ladies into flowers and then made those flowers into a cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was surprised she hadn&#x27;t been using it already.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ponds has been extremely gentle to my skin not only as a makeup remover but as a general cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have also not experienced any of the burning or intense tingling sensations that some of the other reviewers mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing: Ponds does a great job of moisturizing and soothing dry</li>
            <li>It also left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>cold cream is also available in a much smaller cute little jar, if you are curious try that one before buying the full size!</li>
            <li>My skin is generally oily and acne prone</li>
            <li>I will buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Ponds cold cream.</li>
            <li>I FORTUNEATELY HAVE GOOD SKIN, I WATCHED MY MOM USE THIS COLD CREAM</li>
            <li>To my absolute shock, I didn&#x27;t get a single pimple or ingrown hair, and not only that, my face felt smoother than it has in my entire life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s uneven, has acne but is also flaky and super dry.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using an old washcloth instead of a nice soft one and it was pretty painful :/  </li>
            <li>Does not burn my skin like other cold creams and my face feels clean and smooth all the time.</li>

            <li> I FORTUNEATELY HAVE GOOD SKIN, I WATCHED MY MOM USE THIS COLD CREAM</li>
            <li> To my absolute shock, I didn&#x27;t get a single pimple or ingrown hair, and not only that, my face felt smoother than it has in my entire life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uneven, has acne but is also flaky and super dry.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using an old washcloth instead of a nice soft one and it was pretty painful :/  </li>
            <li> Does not burn my skin like other cold creams and my face feels clean and smooth all the time.</li>
            <li> I used a new jar after receiving it this week and within 15 minutes felt a slight burning sensation all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a makeup this product couldn&#x27;t remove; waterproof to long lasting, Ponds will remove it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a long, long time.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t broken out and I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> is extremely oily or greasy feeling upon initial application.</li>
            <li> When used on acne or any other area of broken skin this product does tingle/sting a bit, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling well moisturized and after following it with my usual Witch Hazel as toner</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I avoided cold cream for years because I have super oily, acne-prone, skin, and I figured that an oil-based cream was the last thing</li>
            <li> When I use it as an overnight spot treatment the spot is either completely dried up or drastically reduced by the next morning!</li>
            <li> I leave the washcloth  on several minutes, then apply a fairly heavy layer of cream.  </li>
            <li> I miss the heavy milk white glass jars this stuff used to come in.</li>
            <li> Other than that this product is a wonder.</li>
            <li> No special trips, no high prices, and I don&#x27;t have to use gobs of it</li>

            <li> I started using this product about a month ago, and I wish I had considered it sooner!  My skin is generally oily and acne prone but my skin loves this product!  If you have oily skin it is probably counter intuitive to use a product that is oily and greasy, but in reality it is what your skin needs to balance itself. I use this cold cream as a makeup remover,a mask,  a nighttime cleanser, and even an overnight spot treatment for stubborn cystic acne.  When used on acne or any other area of broken skin this product does tingle/sting a bit, but the results are well worth it. When I use it as an overnight spot treatment the spot is either completely dried up or drastically reduced by the next morning! I have also noticed a slight reduction in the redness/roughness of some of my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;My only word of caution is to be gentle when you remove the product from your face! Find something that is extremely soft and be extremely gentle! I made the mistake of using an old washcloth instead of a nice soft one and it was pretty painful :/  The longer you leave the product on the more sensitive your skin will be! I currently use a soft dry washcloth to remove most of the cream and then follow with a splash of water :)&lt;br /&gt;This cold cream is also available in a much smaller cute little jar, if you are curious try that one before buying the full size!</li>
            <li> Was very happy to get the Ponds Cold Cream.  Have been using it since I got it.  It is a very good buy.  I will buy for this seller again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of pond&#x27;s to begin with but when I saw this removed makeup I thought I would give it a chance. It was hard to find one that sjsbf irritate my eyes! I have cystic acne prone combination skin and this works amazingly. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes at all, and removed every trace of my waterproof makeup. It left my skin feeling well moisturized and after following it with my usual Witch Hazel as toner my skin feels very soft and not greasy at all. This is definitely a new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing to use if you have sensitive skin.  I use it generously to take off makeup at night and then wash my face.  I used to use the those makeup remover wipes and the makeup remover before and my skin had a horrible reaction.  I think this is the best product to use on your face.</li>
            <li> This cream is super greasy for my combination skin and I broke out from it. I ended up using it on my body. It smells good. I won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
            <li> I bought a 3.5 oz at CVS and it worked better than face wipes and makes me feel clean and dry after using instead of oily.</li>
            <li> As advertised and on time.  On a Sunday</li>
            <li> My wife says its wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> Have used Pond&#x27;s for years !!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time.  Does not burn my skin like other cold creams and my face feels clean and smooth all the time.</li>
            <li> Really? Mineral oil has that reviews?</li>
            <li> I purchased this after racing a review on The Small Things Blog.  My skin feels really great after using it for a few weeks, and since it is so rich, I do t hVe to add a moisturizer to my evening routine (great with a newborn in the house!). However, it doesn&#x27;t fully remove my mascara, but few things do.  I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Not the original. Why would they ever change it? Switching to making my own cold cream with mineral oil, water and borax.</li>
            <li> Cheap, gentle &amp; works good, but will leave an oily residue</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as one of her birthday presents. She&#x27;s 93 and has used this cream almost all of her adult life. It hasn&#x27;t changed except for the price but she&#x27;s worth it. It arrived on time and was appreciated greatly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream since I was a teenager.  It removes makeup quickly and completely.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years, but always come back to Pond&#x27;s.  It has a clean fragrance, no over-powering scent or perfume.</li>
            <li> Yes, I Love, Love, love, love  it....I will buy again in the near future. Thanks you guys very, very much.</li>
            <li> Love it..Have used it for years and always will.</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff, but they changed the formula, and it burns my eyes when removing eye makeup.  It&#x27;s as if they added a menthol base to it. Going to have to find something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes now. Why can&#x27;t manufacturers leave well enough alone?!  I used to love how soft it left the skin around my eyes.  8-(</li>
            <li> So this is a product I really wanted to review because it is freaking amazing. I have problem skin. It&#x27;s uneven, has acne but is also flaky and super dry. This stuff seems to make all of that disappear. It also seems to be reducing the appearance of some premature wrinkles. Love love LOVE this product and I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I avoided cold cream for years because I have super oily, acne-prone, skin, and I figured that an oil-based cream was the last thing I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally started reading up on it, a lot of people swore that it would work for cleansing oily skin but wouldn&#x27;t clog pores.  Something about mineral oil molecules being too large, which is one of those things that sounds as though it could either be counterintuitive but true, or it could be somebody&#x27;s fuzzily-reasoned idea that doesn&#x27;t actually work in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wish I had tried it years ago.  I massaged it in and then wiped/rinsed it in the shower and--strange but true--it does clear pores.  I didn&#x27;t even have to wait for results: They were clearer in the first two days I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better: It&#x27;s inexpensive and I can get it at my local grocery store.  No special trips, no high prices, and I don&#x27;t have to use gobs of it so a jar lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Ponds cold cream. But I have noticed that it is starting to burn my face, which it never did before. Perhaps I have developed a reaction to it after all these years. It may just be me and not the cream.</li>
            <li> have used this for years</li>
            <li> Totally excellent. This product is very good and incredibly beautifull. On time and with a perfect package. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to get this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was looking for a cleanser that was effective and moisturizing without spending 50 bucks a container.This is that product.This arrived on time and intact.</li>
            <li> oily yet doesn&#x27;t remove makeup</li>
            <li> I FORTUNEATELY HAVE GOOD SKIN, I WATCHED MY MOM USE THIS COLD CREAM AND I USE IT ALSO FOR REMOVING MAKEUP.  DOES THE BEST JOB OF REMOVING MASCARA, BLUSH AND ALL MAKEUP W/O DRYING YOUR FACE. NOT A MOISTIZER,BUT A GREAT CLEANSER.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great, makes the skin soft. note use a little and add if needed, don&#x27;t pile on like soap or shampoo. use hot face cloth wiping in sections and rising the towel, repeat until no more. Do this at night and leave a bit on to use as mosterizer.&lt;br /&gt;clears the pores greatly. I do this twice a week in the evening.</li>
            <li> Used this as a base and then as a cleanser for grease paint makeup during a cirque performance. It made a huge difference. My process:&lt;br /&gt;-Apply a thin coat of cold cream to absorb into skin&lt;br /&gt;-Apply grease paint&lt;br /&gt;-After the show, coat face in cold cream&lt;br /&gt;-Wipe off&lt;br /&gt;-Remove remainder of grease paint with Johnson&#x27;s baby soap</li>
            <li> This used to be one of the best products on the market.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 20 years. Unilever changed the formula six months ago in March 2012 I was told by a customer rep.  I used a new jar after receiving it this week and within 15 minutes felt a slight burning sensation all over my face.  I had to wash it off immediately.  I called the number on the back of the jar and the phone rep acknowledged the formula change and will send a postage paid envelope so I can send them the jar.  It is unfortunate and sad to see such a superior face cream turned into another mediocre product.  If the bottom line was the issue, I would be willing to pay a few more cents to keep the original product.  It&#x27;s important to call and tell them what you think (1-800-909-9493) or go to their website: [...]</li>
            <li> After years of spending $$$ for fancy moisturizers, I always go back to the basics of Ponds. Does the job for very little money.</li>
            <li> The only reason this product has four stars is because of the smell. It smells like what would happen if you made old ladies into flowers and then made those flowers into a cleanser. Other than that this product is a wonder. I have seriously dry flaky facial skin and it just makes my makeup look terrible. Once I started using this my problem was immediately gone. So far I haven&#x27;t broken out and I also have very sensitive skin. Great product, I just wish they made it unscented.</li>
            <li> This was my mother&#x27;s favorite.  I could only find it on Amazon so would order her one when she ran out.  She has passed away now and her jar of Pond&#x27;s was almost gone.  I wish I could have her around to buy her more of her favorite things.</li>
            <li> Burns my skin when applying sometimes.</li>
            <li> After using this product, it is the only thing I will ever use to remove my makeup every again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amount: This is quite a lot of product for the price. You also need very little product to remove makeup or cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup-Remover: Makeup? What makeup? I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a makeup this product couldn&#x27;t remove; waterproof to long lasting, Ponds will remove it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle: Many scrubs or exfoliants, including makeup remover wipes, will cause irritation acne break outs on my skin. I have had no such problems with Ponds. I have also not experienced any of the burning or intense tingling sensations that some of the other reviewers mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing: Ponds does a great job of moisturizing and soothing dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatile: I do not only use this as a make-up remover, I use it as a cleaner/exfoliator. Once a night before I go to bed, I will gather some on a reusable makeup remover cloth and gently exfoliate my skin before rinsing it off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: There is a perfumed or clinical odor about Ponds that is unpleasant and extremely pungent upon application. However, the smell does dissipate rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy/Oily: Ponds claims that you can use this product and then leave it on if so desired. I doubt it, it&#x27;s texture is extremely oily or greasy feeling upon initial application. I recommend wiping it off with a wet rag or washing it off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stubborn: To actually remove Ponds from your face, even with a rag, is not as easy as wiping your face and drying off. You have to make a couple passes with a wash cloth in order to fully remove the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ponds has been extremely gentle to my skin not only as a makeup remover but as a general cleanser. I&#x27;ve had more luck with acne control just using Ponds every night than I have with any other acne formulated product. I have no regrets with this product and Iwill absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Package was busted.  Cream everywhere.  Smells great though....</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using it as a make up remover.  First of all, when I opened the jar, my husband wanted to know what the &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; was.  I did not expect it to smell so bad.  I decided I could stand the stink, so I used it anyway and it burned my skin.  I will never purchase it again.  I will look for something else to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, fast delivery, what more could you ask for?  Will use this site again!&lt;br /&gt;Such a good deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal, good price, a clean face, what more could you ask for?  I would use this site again!</li>
            <li> I like the item it is as it was described to me affective cleanser however it is not addictive in removing eye makeup</li>
            <li> I use this product as a weekly mask. I first cleanse my face with a very warm washcloth.  I leave the washcloth  on several minutes, then apply a fairly heavy layer of cream.  After 15-20 minutes I remove the cream.  My face nows feels well moisturized!  this product is also good for a general face cleaning as well as excellent at removing make-up.</li>
            <li> Great product works good for me.</li>
            <li> I miss the heavy milk white glass jars this stuff used to come in. I&#x27;ve been using it a long, long time. On the other hand, I could never bring myself to throw those beautiful white glass jars away -- not until I had a whole closet full of them, that is, and decided it was either me or the jars. It&#x27;s easier to part with the new plastic jars Ponds comes in now. Just got my mom a jar too. I was surprised she hadn&#x27;t been using it already.</li>
            <li> I have used ponds cold cream to remove make up every night for 20 years.  I am highly allergic and this never triggers a reaction, cleans well and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> My elder aunts ALWAYS had Pond&#x27;s on their dressing tables. From the time I began to use makeup in my teens to my current age, it is what I&#x27;ve used to remove the day from my face. Not a wrinkle in sight! :)</li>
            <li> ...cleanses off makeup better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  This was a nice, big jar of it for a great price.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used to remove my makeup. Does a thorough job without harming my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product worked very well for me. First, it removed all of my make-up, including mascara and liquid eyeliner. It also left my skin feeling very soft. The scent could be better but it did not bother me. If you have very dry skin I would definitely recommend this for both a face cleanser and a light moisturizer. I have used other PONDS products in the past and they have never bothered me. Very practical product and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Your grandmother? She was onto something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always tended to find the most success with those &amp;#34;tried and true&amp;#34; products that have been used by parents, grandparents, and great grandparents, and Pond&#x27;s cold cream is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that responds badly to cold, dry conditions, as well as things like shaving— I always breakout after I shave. Enter Pond&#x27;s. Someone suggested I use it as a sort of aftershave, and I was willing to try it out. Historically, it&#x27;s been marketed as a cleanser and makeup remover for women, but I was shocked at how well it worked on my face. I shaved as normal, which usually irritates my face and causes breakouts and ingrown hairs in the days that follow, but I applied Pond&#x27;s cold cream on my face afterward, let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then washed it off. To my absolute shock, I didn&#x27;t get a single pimple or ingrown hair, and not only that, my face felt smoother than it has in my entire life. I started washing my face regularly with this stuff and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a light texture, the scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t have an intimidatingly long list of really wild chemical ingredients (it&#x27;s mostly mineral oil and beeswax, although there are a couple of parabens and preservatives that I&#x27;m not too crazy about). Even still, this stuff has worked wonders for me. Now I get what grandmothers everywhere swore by it.</li>
            <li> this product is a traditional formula that remains unchanged. but it. it does what it is supposed to do. no gimmics or falses results!</li>
            <li> I Bought this to remove Waterproof mascara and it really worked also if you do what it says in the directions , it leaves your skin silky smooth and really soft</li>
