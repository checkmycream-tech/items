            <li>These are perfect for the tanning salon at my gym.  </li>
            <li>These were perfect...</li>
            <li>they are perfect</li>
            <li>Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly and are a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>They had great customer service too.</li>
            <li>Outstanding!!  </li>
            <li>Cheap great buy!!</li>
            <li>love these!</li>
            <li>I have never used these kind of goggles before, so it may just be that they are all like that</li>
            <li>really nice feel to them.</li>
            <li>I really liked these.</li>
            <li>my gym requires the members to bring their own.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these because my gym requires you to provide your own eye protection for tanning.</li>
            <li>THESE GOGGLES ARE FLEXIBLE AND VERY COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These glasses are a most for using an RF machine and for a lazier machine.  </li>
            <li>but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>and if you love the sun as I do- save your eyes.</li>
            <li>Its barely covers my beautiful eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash, stays in place well, and does the job.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly, and I don&#x27;t need the strap when I&#x27;m laying down in the bed.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast and I love the color!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I find them comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer was great about it though and even after I told them not to worry, it wasn&#x27;t necessary to replace the cord, I&#x27;d find some elsewhere, they sent replacement anyway!  </li>
            <li>I purchased these to use for when I get my UV-B light treatments at the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>The light treatment system they use is a stand up one</li>
            <li>I LOVE the pretty purple too.</li>
            <li>have used these before and love them because they have a very slim profile.  </li>
            <li>They are comfortable and seem to fit everyone just fine, from my 4-year-old granddaughter, to every adult that&#x27;s tried them on.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to protect my eyes when I use red light therapy on my face - but the red lights are still really bright on my eyes, even when I put duct tape over the eye openings!  </li>
            <li>Work real well!!</li>
            <li>They are soft, they were ok.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are nice salon quality goggles and if I ever require another pair I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t exactly what I thought, when I got them.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely prefer these, because they are softer and more flexible.</li>
            <li>THEY DON&#x27;T LET ANY LIGHT IN AT THE CORNER OF YOUR EYES.&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE SUPER SUNNIES THAT CAME WITH OUR TANNING UNIT WHICH ARE RIGID, HARD TO&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave them 4 starts because the middle part of the goggles could be made in a way that you can make it short or longer to fit better your eyes.</li>
            <li>And turning over from back to front and/or vice versa is also made easy by the strap.</li>
            <li>and I have no basis for real comparison.</li>
            <li>Ladies, you can find an RF machine on ebay at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I like these, just really hug my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Very lite and flexible.  </li>
            <li>the sun is much stronger now</li>
            <li>This eye wear is really comfortable and the string is long enough to adjust it to fit as you like.  </li>
            <li>They do what you need them to at half the price, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A LITTLE MORE</li>
            <li>they fit very well on my small eyes.</li>
            <li>They are a nice thick plastic with a velvet like feel, they are extremely dark and definitely block the light from your eyes.</li>
            <li>Better than the hard plastic I used before.</li>
            <li>TO BLOCK THE LIGHT, AND NOT COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d looked everywhere for this elastic cord in the right size, but finally found it, in a terribly obvious place, after all!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this company &amp; will buy again!!</li>
            <li>They do not fully seal closed the whole eye area.  </li>
            <li>You might be interested and the cost is going down</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Would have given it a 5 star rating, but was missing the cord when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Weird.  </li>

            <li> I bought these to protect my eyes when I use red light therapy on my face - but the red lights are still really bright on my eyes, even when I put duct tape over the eye openings!  Weird.  Otherwise, I find them comfortable.  Perhaps they are not made for the purpose that I am using them?</li>
            <li> They do what you need them to at half the price, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Would have given it a 5 star rating, but was missing the cord when it arrived.  The manufacturer was great about it though and even after I told them not to worry, it wasn&#x27;t necessary to replace the cord, I&#x27;d find some elsewhere, they sent replacement anyway!  Outstanding!!

            <li> They are soft, they were ok. I gave them 4 starts because the middle part of the goggles could be made in a way that you can make it short or longer to fit better your eyes.</li>
            <li> They work just like they are supposed to, but I rarely use them because they are uncomfortable. I have never used these kind of goggles before, so it may just be that they are all like that and I have no basis for real comparison.</li>
            <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These glasses are a most for using an RF machine and for a lazier machine.  If you have personally invested in either of these&lt;br /&gt;machine, these glasses are a necessity.  What is an RF Machine?  Google it.  You might be interested and the cost is going down&lt;br /&gt;every day.  Ladies, you can find an RF machine on ebay at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I like these, just really hug my eyes.  They definitely protect them, but I don&#x27;t see how they would work for someone with bigger or rounder eyes.</li>
            <li> Been using three months with no issues. Easy to wash, stays in place well, and does the job. Doesn&#x27;t give you raccoon eyes either.</li>
            <li> really nice feel to them. Feel durable &amp; flexible. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> what I can I say...tanning goggles....</li>
            <li> I really liked these. They shipped fast and I love the color! Cheap great buy!! Work real well!! Would def. buy again</li>
            <li> THESE GOGGLES ARE FLEXIBLE AND VERY COMFORTABLE. THEY DON&#x27;T LET ANY LIGHT IN AT THE CORNER OF YOUR EYES.&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE SUPER SUNNIES THAT CAME WITH OUR TANNING UNIT WHICH ARE RIGID, HARD TO&lt;br /&gt;ADJUST TO BLOCK THE LIGHT, AND NOT COMFORTABLE. THE EVO FLEX SUNNIES COST A LITTLE MORE BUT ARE WELL&lt;br /&gt;WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Hurts my face, either side of my nose it presses into my eye area.</li>
            <li> This eye wear is really comfortable and the string is long enough to adjust it to fit as you like.  I have other goggles for tanning but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for the tanning salon at my gym.  Unlike your typical tanning salon where they provide tanning goggles my gym requires the members to bring their own.  These were perfect...</li>
            <li> They work perfectly, and I don&#x27;t need the strap when I&#x27;m laying down in the bed. They had great customer service too.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t exactly what I thought, when I got them.  They do not fully seal closed the whole eye area.  But the strap helps.  And turning over from back to front and/or vice versa is also made easy by the strap.</li>
            <li> love these! they fit very well on my small eyes. no raccoon eyes or tan lines whatsoever they are perfect</li>
            <li> have used these before and love them because they have a very slim profile.  Thus you do not get raccoon eyes/white circles around eyes.  Very lite and flexible.  Better than the hard plastic I used before.</li>
            <li> Save your eyes- the sun is much stronger now and if you love the sun as I do- save your eyes.</li>
            <li> I got these in several colors after my husband got me a tanning bed.  They are comfortable and seem to fit everyone just fine, from my 4-year-old granddaughter, to every adult that&#x27;s tried them on.  (My granddaughter doesn&#x27;t tan - she just likes to wear them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one pair that is made of a harder plastic and I definitely prefer these, because they are softer and more flexible.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use for when I get my UV-B light treatments at the dermatologist.  The light treatment system they use is a stand up one and I needed goggles that had a head band included to keep them in place.  They work perfectly and are a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price. Sturdy and comfy. No problems!</li>
            <li> These work just as they&#x27;re supposed to! I LOVE the pretty purple too.</li>
            <li> I have a average size female head and this pair was too small. Its barely covers my beautiful eyes. Meh!</li>
            <li> I purchased these because my gym requires you to provide your own eye protection for tanning. These get the job done. They are a nice thick plastic with a velvet like feel, they are extremely dark and definitely block the light from your eyes. They did come with a string but since I use a lay down tanning bed I didn&#x27;t put the string on mine, but would recommend using the string for a stand up bed. Overall, these are nice salon quality goggles and if I ever require another pair I will purchase these again.</li>
