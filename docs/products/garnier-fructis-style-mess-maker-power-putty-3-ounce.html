    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>- drugstore to salon quality, and this inexpensive putty works the best for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>Great sturdy product that helps hold my sons spiked hair up.</li>
            <li>a great product for molding longer hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy I ordered 2 of these babies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to make a hoarder of me, now that I&#x27;ve found something so good</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>I used a putty of theirs with great success</li>
            <li>Honestly, my hair has never looked better-</li>
            <li>If I had a nickle for every hair styling product I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;d be rich - not one even begins to approach how easy this is to use and what a great result it gives.</li>
            <li>putty is much more liquidy than the LOreal stuff and therefor requires a bit more per application, but it comes at 3 oz to LOreals 1.7 oz</li>
            <li>I love about the LOreal putty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to keep an eye on it in stores to make sure it doesn&#x27;t go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m updating this after many months now of using this product.  </li>
            <li>definitely the best paste/putty out there, and trust me</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Probably would have worked better if my hair was a bit shorter</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many hair products.</li>
            <li>I tried many different gels and none of them worked as great as this and didn&#x27;t flake ever.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a product I use daily.</li>
            <li>I am growing my hair back out from shaving it off (my daughter lost her hair to chemo/bone marrow transplant, and we shaved our heads together), and while having it shaved was actually surprisingly nice, growing it out has been more challenging.  </li>
            <li>Works marvelously on my hair and its not like rock hard on it either.</li>
            <li>I get full day hold without having to add anything after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>Big benefit is that it keeps your hair pliable/moldable - no crunchiness, but good strength all day</li>
            <li>and I love it better than any other hair product I have had.</li>
            <li>I saw this in a local major drugstore chain and decided to try it and really could not be more thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>have short and very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>very pasty works well with mildly stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out, and my sister bought me the &amp;#34;surfer look&amp;#34; one, which is just like this, and I actually like that one more.  </li>
            <li>Only problem I had is its an add on but besides that I love it.</li>
            <li>Good control with a heavy sticky feel.</li>
            <li>My hair is now long enough that it doesn&#x27;t need it so much, so it works great.</li>
            <li>It is the only kind of putty or paste that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the most effective way to apply this product is to massage it into towel dried hair, then blow dry and let the product and heat condition my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really helps put my hair where I want it.  </li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t put too much on, it works</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s there to really tell?</li>
            <li>is you could style your hair and walk out the door knowing it was styled right and would look natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re looking something to add style, as long as you don&#x27;t have to add lots, like I have, you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>very cheap for how great it works, sucks that its hard to get sometimes.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well - not sure if I will purchase more - you really need to hand style as you putting the putty in your hair</li>
            <li>Normally keep my hair pretty short, and this has the right amount of strength.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best stuff, and the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used that responds so well to simply being added to damp hair and then blown dry.  </li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and love how it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>feels very smooth and blends out well; doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of mark or trace of its use, makes your hair look messy naturally.</li>
            <li>product is great and WAY cheaper than the American Crew product I used in the past!!</li>
            <li>I usually purchase this from my grocery store, but Amazon has a better price.  </li>
            <li>all natural look</li>
            <li>I have short to medium length straight hair.</li>
            <li>With this product there is ~10 minute dry time, much like hair gel</li>
            <li>I typically use a stiff gel but when my hair grows out a bit, the Mess Maker works great for molding to the shape or direction you want.</li>
            <li>It works - smells nice - can be a little greasy if you apply too much - so a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li>ONE complaint is that sometimes I have had to apply a bit more than normal, due to having hair that is short and it won&#x27;t stand up without it, and I&#x27;ve noticed the putty will get flaky.  </li>
            <li>If you work with it too much while on your hair it weighs it down.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely break down if Fructis ever discontinues this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been very happy with fructis products but very UNhappy with how they seem to be always discontinuing things!  </li>
            <li>(Surprisingly it has bad reviews here on Amazon, but I never tried the previous formula that everyone wants back...</li>

            <li> I have been very happy with fructis products but very UNhappy with how they seem to be always discontinuing things!  </li>
            <li> (Surprisingly it has bad reviews here on Amazon, but I never tried the previous formula that everyone wants back...</li>
            <li> and then I need to run my hands through it to break it up and get the messy but natural style I like.</li>
            <li> (maybe 2.5 inches long now).  </li>
            <li> I put it on my wet short hair and don&#x27;t have to use anything else except hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a product that went on so dry.  </li>
            <li> I massage about a dime sized portion into damp hair and then blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> once dry</li>
            <li> The container looks small, but one will usually last me 5 months, so in the long run it is the same (if not cheaper) than hair gel.</li>
            <li> Was not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;I gel my hair, bro!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike lots of other products I&#x27;ve tried this is neither waxy feeling nor hard/sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> This was not exactly the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t terrible, it&#x27;s why I want some good putty instead of hair gel</li>
            <li> Unless the one I tried IS the previous formula, and I didn&#x27;t realize it...</li>
            <li> Normally I would then follow that up with adding some other product to get the desired messy look....totally unnecessary!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little tricky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Inadvertent downside - if your hair is a little longer and you get caught in wind, don&#x27;t let anyone take a picture.</li>
            <li> I wish they would stop changing their products every few months.</li>
            <li> small amount gives body ; non greasy</li>
            <li> Product seems to be getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li> its fake, not a real one.</li>
            <li> and so it fails in that respect.</li>
            <li> I always hated the greasy hair that gel would leave behind on my medium-length hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very pasty works well with mildly stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a friend and I love it better than any other hair product I have had.</li>
            <li> Garnier stopped producing surfer hair variant for this garbage. I wish they would stop changing their products every few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a product that went on so dry.  It really helps put my hair where I want it.  Product seems to be getting hard to find.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I am a devoted LOreal Studio Line Overworked Hair Putty guy, but Amazon increased their price on that product to the point where I figured I had to try an alternative and I ended up purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This putty is much more liquidy than the LOreal stuff and therefor requires a bit more per application, but it comes at 3 oz to LOreals 1.7 oz so that is a wash if they were sold for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about the LOreal putty is you could style your hair and walk out the door knowing it was styled right and would look natural. With this product there is ~10 minute dry time, much like hair gel and then I need to run my hands through it to break it up and get the messy but natural style I like. While this isn&#x27;t terrible, it&#x27;s why I want some good putty instead of hair gel and so it fails in that respect.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this from my grocery store, but Amazon has a better price.  I like the way it holds my hair, but I do tend to add water to give it a slightly different look.</li>
            <li> I use this alot.  One jar lasts for over 4 months and it works well.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well - not sure if I will purchase more - you really need to hand style as you putting the putty in your hair so it&#x27;s a little tricky.  If you work with it too much while on your hair it weighs it down.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with fructis products but very UNhappy with how they seem to be always discontinuing things!  I used a putty of theirs with great success and then they quit making it.  I saw this in a local major drugstore chain and decided to try it and really could not be more thrilled with it.  Garnier, PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue it!  You&#x27;re going to make a hoarder of me, now that I&#x27;ve found something so good I&#x27;m going to have to keep an eye on it in stores to make sure it doesn&#x27;t go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short and very fine hair.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different mousses and so called body-infusing products...none of them really add any body nor do they get me that messy look I want.  This product somehow manages to do both.  I may use it a bit differently...I massage about a dime sized portion into damp hair and then blow dry it.  Normally I would then follow that up with adding some other product to get the desired messy look....totally unnecessary!  Run my fingers through, hair spray and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike lots of other products I&#x27;ve tried this is neither waxy feeling nor hard/sticky feeling.  End of the day yes I know I have product in my hair, but it feels matte, not waxy or greasy and responds well to me messing it up or rearranging if I want to.  But I don&#x27;t need to, the hold and body it gives are both excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally converted to his as my only product.....now if Fructis will only leave it here for us to enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update)  I&#x27;m updating this after many months now of using this product.  I will absolutely break down if Fructis ever discontinues this product.  This is hands down the best stuff, and the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used that responds so well to simply being added to damp hair and then blown dry.  The dryer does 99% of the styling work - once dry I just have to run my hands through the hair a bit and go.  I get full day hold without having to add anything after blow drying.  Honestly, my hair has never looked better- people comment that it looks fuller and I didn&#x27;t do anything but start using this product.  Amazing.  If I had a nickle for every hair styling product I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;d be rich - not one even begins to approach how easy this is to use and what a great result it gives.</li>
            <li> I always hated the greasy hair that gel would leave behind on my medium-length hair. This stuff not only holds up well, but it also allows me to fix my hair without it looking like I dipped my head in a vat of oil! The container looks small, but one will usually last me 5 months, so in the long run it is the same (if not cheaper) than hair gel.</li>
            <li> Great sturdy product that helps hold my sons spiked hair up. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great price for a product I use daily.</li>
            <li> Ordered a bunch of Fructis product on a recommendation from my hairdresser... product is great and WAY cheaper than the American Crew product I used in the past!!</li>
            <li> I am growing my hair back out from shaving it off (my daughter lost her hair to chemo/bone marrow transplant, and we shaved our heads together), and while having it shaved was actually surprisingly nice, growing it out has been more challenging.  I came across this stuff in the store and gave it a try.  It helped give some style and made my hair look a LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONE complaint is that sometimes I have had to apply a bit more than normal, due to having hair that is short and it won&#x27;t stand up without it, and I&#x27;ve noticed the putty will get flaky.  But if you don&#x27;t put too much on, it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out, and my sister bought me the &amp;#34;surfer look&amp;#34; one, which is just like this, and I actually like that one more.  (Surprisingly it has bad reviews here on Amazon, but I never tried the previous formula that everyone wants back...and I like the current surfer one they have out.  Unless the one I tried IS the previous formula, and I didn&#x27;t realize it...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re looking something to add style, as long as you don&#x27;t have to add lots, like I have, you&#x27;ll be fine.  My hair is now long enough that it doesn&#x27;t need it so much, so it works great. (maybe 2.5 inches long now).  But I still prefer the surfer look to this one.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to really tell? Scoop a bit out, rub it in, and it holds all day.</li>
            <li> small amount gives body ; non greasy</li>
            <li> As advertised and cheaper than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> a great product for molding longer hair. I typically use a stiff gel but when my hair grows out a bit, the Mess Maker works great for molding to the shape or direction you want.</li>
            <li> definitely the best paste/putty out there, and trust me, I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of the brands and types out there. very cheap for how great it works, sucks that its hard to get sometimes. feels very smooth and blends out well; doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of mark or trace of its use, makes your hair look messy naturally.</li>
            <li> It works - smells nice - can be a little greasy if you apply too much - so a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;I gel my hair, bro!&amp;#34; look. It doesn&#x27;t flake or clump either, all day. I tried many different gels and none of them worked as great as this and didn&#x27;t flake ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I ordered 2 of these babies. Works marvelously on my hair and its not like rock hard on it either. I couldn&#x27;t find this one anywhere in stores where I lived so that&#x27;s why I ordered it online. Only problem I had is its an add on but besides that I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and love how it makes my hair look. I recommend it to anyone looking for that all natural look</li>
            <li> its fake, not a real one.</li>
            <li> Good control with a heavy sticky feel.</li>
            <li> This was not exactly the look I was going for. It made my hair straw-like. Probably would have worked better if my hair was a bit shorter</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is the only kind of putty or paste that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Only gel I use. Normally keep my hair pretty short, and this has the right amount of strength. Big benefit is that it keeps your hair pliable/moldable - no crunchiness, but good strength all day (so you can reshape and reset your hair if it gets windblown, you have to wear a cap, etc.). And you can get it with Subscribe-and-Save, which is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inadvertent downside - if your hair is a little longer and you get caught in wind, don&#x27;t let anyone take a picture. Your hair will look like you were just electrocuted.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Was not at all what I expected.  It is &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and no hold to it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have short to medium length straight hair. I&#x27;ve found that the most effective way to apply this product is to massage it into towel dried hair, then blow dry and let the product and heat condition my hair.  I then finish with an additional portion and hairspray. I have tried many many hair products. - drugstore to salon quality, and this inexpensive putty works the best for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I put it on my wet short hair and don&#x27;t have to use anything else except hairspray.</li>
