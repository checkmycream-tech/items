            <li>but it didn&#x27;t a female impersonator but awesome doing makeup tips to make up tricks</li>
            <li>I chose a five because I love this kit.</li>
            <li>I love how it looks on my face.</li>

            <li>I love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Love, love.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it doesnt seem worth it with all the shipping, and wait time.</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love it, i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love Sleek Makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite color cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot...</li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m sure makeup artists would too.  </li>
            <li>love it -</li>
            <li>I wore it for a week to work,I received so many compliments on my makeup.</li>
            <li>Good for contouring,  the contour shade is the right shade for it (does not have red/orange undertones, but more taupe ones).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product plus the price is great.  </li>
            <li>But, the the color shown was a cool brown I was looking for, instead it was a orangy warm brown that didn&#x27;t create contour</li>
            <li>Either way, if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap but good, and something worth your while I&#x27;d suggest you invest in this.</li>
            <li>i have tried so many bronzers and highlighters,this makes it SOOO EASY.</li>
            <li>I love it, originally I thought the color medium would be too light, mostly because almost anytime something says that the color is medium</li>
            <li>its so easy and compact.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t cake up; easy to layer</li>
            <li>It blends perfectly for my Asian fair skin (yellow undertone).</li>
            <li>contour came out beautiful but broke me out badly later that day</li>
            <li>and they work fine..</li>
            <li>It also has a nice big mirror in it which i love!</li>
            <li>The medium is too light for me.</li>
            <li>I am going to try and order the light and see if that suits my skin color</li>
            <li>With that said, this is a product worth buying, just make sure you match your skin color correctly.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and easy to blend and looks natural ...</li>
            <li>10 days to arrive, TOTALLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>I almost thought of buying the dark one, because after all it is contour so a lighter color would not be ideal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>Get the right fan brush though!</li>
            <li>I am in the tan complexion area so the shade medium is just right with me!</li>
            <li>overall its a good product</li>
            <li>I really like using the contouring side more than the highlight</li>
            <li>The highlight is also very nice but the sparkles are just a tiny bit too noticeable for my taste, but its still nice enough to use.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer and highlighter :) definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery considering it was supposed to take a lot longer.</li>
            <li>Let it be said that I am new to contouring however, but this stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I love the contour kit but having a sensitive skin, I tend to break out.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>and I found that the dark powder matched exactly to my skin.... not so great for contouring.</li>
            <li>Super Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>I think it is superior to other products out there.</li>
            <li>I use the right one for highlight.</li>
            <li>Very easy to blend especially with a brush.  </li>
            <li>but it only took 10 days, so THANK YOU (lucky girl -the seller) and about the product I LOVE</li>
            <li>I could probably use the dark version of this, but I&#x27;m chocolate brown and loved this product.</li>
            <li>Works great for African American brown skin.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not to say that the contour isn&#x27;t nice as well - really makes a difference in the final makeup finish.</li>
            <li>Love this contour color for my tan asian skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first impression on the item, but I will update as I use it.</li>
            <li>Its pretty.</li>
            <li>Learning how to contour and these colors for medium skin are exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I definitely like this.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm, is not an expensive product, and comes with a wonderful highlighter.</li>
            <li>Maybe a little darker brown than most people need but with a light stoke of a brush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the highlighter part because I have other highlighter, but the times that I have used it, it came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The highlight is very pretty and looks natural on the skin!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not being photographed regularly, my guess is more subtlely is better than less subtlety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to do the contour yet, but I love the high liter omg, smooth ...</li>
            <li>It really defines and helps to shape your face.</li>
            <li>so you can adjust how much you want to contour your face.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to go with the Real Techniques brushes as Sarah uses this brand of contouring in her videos.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t recommend if you know you get bumps fast by anything</li>
            <li>It really makes me look like I have sculpted features.</li>
            <li>It arrived so fast too.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect that it will arrive that fast.</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m listen if any one wants to let me no...</li>
            <li>Such a great simple contour palette (especially since I don&#x27;t know what I am doing yet).  </li>
            <li>This contour kit is a lot better than I expected!</li>
            <li>SO glad I didn&#x27;t get the Dark.</li>
            <li>I love the dark shade, but since I do not like a lot of shimmer on my face the lighter shade I do not use.</li>
            <li>I even use the highlighter on my eyelids sometimes for a pretty natural look.</li>
            <li>The bronzer is also decent..</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>This review is mainly for RM Cosmetics, they are based in the UK.</li>
            <li>just an everyday mom who wanted to add a little fun to getting ready and feel good....</li>
            <li>I had high hope for this duo and Sleek Makeup did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>It is a very subtle, but when the light hits the top of the cheekbones it gives a sheen.  </li>
            <li>Picture colors are very true, and will work well will skin tones with deep blues and red undertones.  </li>
            <li>First off, the price was unbelievably low for something that works so very well.</li>
            <li>Use to contour right under my cheek bones and highlight above where the blush goes.  </li>
            <li>i only really use the bronzer, but i love it because it shows up very nicely on my African American skin</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like too too much is that it was an undertone hinting more towards red than yellow-</li>
            <li>this highlight adds shimmer which im not a big fan of, and the contour is pretty dark so have a light hand while applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a caramel 400 in Revlon Colour Stay and the medium looks natural on me!</li>
            <li>I like that the lighter part has a little shine to it because it catches the light.</li>
            <li>Did I get an old one?</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>I do wish the highlighter was a big shinier, however I&#x27;ve only tried applicating with one type of brush; I&#x27;m sure different applicators will allow for different looks.</li>
            <li>Still trying to master using this, but so far has not given me the glowing and contoured looked I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I have golden skin (I usually wear Golden Bisque - Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li>It was good, as everyone explained  I like that its not really dark, but just right too bad</li>
            <li>It is pretty dark, i&#x27;m mexican and it works pretty well for me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s usually too light.</li>
            <li>However I must say that even though I ordered a medium, it was still pretty dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used contouring makeup before, I simply purchased this experimentally.</li>
            <li>The highlighter is slightly shimmery, which is nice and gives a subtle glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>But I really had to blend out the medium because of how dark it was.</li>
            <li>I use to contour with a bronzer and it would barely show up, but with this kit I instantly see the effect.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is very beige, I&#x27;m slightly tan</li>
            <li>The dark side of the compact gives my face the illusion of high cheekbones &amp; gives definition to the rest of my face.</li>

            <li> I am really loving this pallet.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brown color that isn&#x27;t too saturated in order to achieve the semblance of &amp;#34;shadows&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Also has mirror with it which comes in handy.</li>
            <li> so it is very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and blend.</li>
            <li> the compact was nice and the powder was very smooth and covered well</li>
            <li> The light side of the compact give my eyes a bright (and refreshed) look.</li>
            <li> Best contour kit I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  </li>
            <li> Also had easy to follow directions along with the contour kit!</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation, pretty sturdy packaging.  </li>
            <li> this product is really pretty and great colour for the contour, not orange or shimmery&lt;</li>
            <li> Texture is very smooth</li>
            <li> I love sleek products...</li>
            <li> I love it this  product for contouring.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> but it would be better if it was on a lighter skin</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t a female impersonator but awesome doing makeup tips to make up tricks</li>
            <li> I chose a five because I love this kit.</li>
            <li> I love how it looks on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the highlighter</li>
            <li> I hope that helps love</li>
            <li> Love the colors.  </li>
            <li> I have medium olive skintone woth yellow undertone and the medium is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love, love.</li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it doesnt seem worth it with all the shipping, and wait time.</li>
            <li> IT LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love it, i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love Sleek Makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite color cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot...</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m sure makeup artists would too.  </li>
            <li> love it -</li>
            <li> I wore it for a week to work,I received so many compliments on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Good for contouring,  the contour shade is the right shade for it (does not have red/orange undertones, but more taupe ones).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product plus the price is great.  </li>
            <li> But, the the color shown was a cool brown I was looking for, instead it was a orangy warm brown that didn&#x27;t create contour</li>
            <li> Either way, if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap but good, and something worth your while I&#x27;d suggest you invest in this.</li>
            <li> i have tried so many bronzers and highlighters,this makes it SOOO EASY.</li>
            <li> I love it, originally I thought the color medium would be too light, mostly because almost anytime something says that the color is medium</li>
            <li> its so easy and compact.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t cake up; easy to layer</li>
            <li> It blends perfectly for my Asian fair skin (yellow undertone).</li>
            <li> contour came out beautiful but broke me out badly later that day</li>
            <li> and they work fine..</li>
            <li> It also has a nice big mirror in it which i love!</li>
            <li> The medium is too light for me.</li>
            <li> I am going to try and order the light and see if that suits my skin color</li>
            <li> With that said, this is a product worth buying, just make sure you match your skin color correctly.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and easy to blend and looks natural ...</li>
            <li> 10 days to arrive, TOTALLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I almost thought of buying the dark one, because after all it is contour so a lighter color would not be ideal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> Get the right fan brush though!</li>
            <li> I am in the tan complexion area so the shade medium is just right with me!</li>
            <li> overall its a good product</li>
            <li> I really like using the contouring side more than the highlight</li>
            <li> The highlight is also very nice but the sparkles are just a tiny bit too noticeable for my taste, but its still nice enough to use.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer and highlighter :) definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery considering it was supposed to take a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Let it be said that I am new to contouring however, but this stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I love the contour kit but having a sensitive skin, I tend to break out.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> and I found that the dark powder matched exactly to my skin.... not so great for contouring.</li>
            <li> Super Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> I think it is superior to other products out there.</li>
            <li> I use the right one for highlight.</li>
            <li> Very easy to blend especially with a brush.  </li>
            <li> but it only took 10 days, so THANK YOU (lucky girl -the seller) and about the product I LOVE</li>
            <li> I could probably use the dark version of this, but I&#x27;m chocolate brown and loved this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for African American brown skin.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not to say that the contour isn&#x27;t nice as well - really makes a difference in the final makeup finish.</li>
            <li> Love this contour color for my tan asian skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first impression on the item, but I will update as I use it.</li>
            <li> Its pretty.</li>
            <li> Learning how to contour and these colors for medium skin are exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I definitely like this.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm, is not an expensive product, and comes with a wonderful highlighter.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little darker brown than most people need but with a light stoke of a brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the highlighter part because I have other highlighter, but the times that I have used it, it came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The highlight is very pretty and looks natural on the skin!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not being photographed regularly, my guess is more subtlely is better than less subtlety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to do the contour yet, but I love the high liter omg, smooth ...</li>
            <li> It really defines and helps to shape your face.</li>
            <li> so you can adjust how much you want to contour your face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the Real Techniques brushes as Sarah uses this brand of contouring in her videos.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend if you know you get bumps fast by anything</li>
            <li> It really makes me look like I have sculpted features.</li>
            <li> It arrived so fast too.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect that it will arrive that fast.</li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m listen if any one wants to let me no...</li>
            <li> Such a great simple contour palette (especially since I don&#x27;t know what I am doing yet).  </li>
            <li> This contour kit is a lot better than I expected!</li>
            <li> SO glad I didn&#x27;t get the Dark.</li>
            <li> I love the dark shade, but since I do not like a lot of shimmer on my face the lighter shade I do not use.</li>
            <li> I even use the highlighter on my eyelids sometimes for a pretty natural look.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is also decent..</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> This review is mainly for RM Cosmetics, they are based in the UK.</li>
            <li> just an everyday mom who wanted to add a little fun to getting ready and feel good....</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this duo and Sleek Makeup did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It is a very subtle, but when the light hits the top of the cheekbones it gives a sheen.  </li>
            <li> Picture colors are very true, and will work well will skin tones with deep blues and red undertones.  </li>
            <li> First off, the price was unbelievably low for something that works so very well.</li>
            <li> Use to contour right under my cheek bones and highlight above where the blush goes.  </li>
            <li> i only really use the bronzer, but i love it because it shows up very nicely on my African American skin</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like too too much is that it was an undertone hinting more towards red than yellow-</li>
            <li> this highlight adds shimmer which im not a big fan of, and the contour is pretty dark so have a light hand while applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a caramel 400 in Revlon Colour Stay and the medium looks natural on me!</li>
            <li> I like that the lighter part has a little shine to it because it catches the light.</li>
            <li> Did I get an old one?</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> I do wish the highlighter was a big shinier, however I&#x27;ve only tried applicating with one type of brush; I&#x27;m sure different applicators will allow for different looks.</li>
            <li> Still trying to master using this, but so far has not given me the glowing and contoured looked I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I have golden skin (I usually wear Golden Bisque - Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li> It was good, as everyone explained  I like that its not really dark, but just right too bad</li>
            <li> It is pretty dark, i&#x27;m mexican and it works pretty well for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually too light.</li>
            <li> However I must say that even though I ordered a medium, it was still pretty dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used contouring makeup before, I simply purchased this experimentally.</li>
            <li> The highlighter is slightly shimmery, which is nice and gives a subtle glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> But I really had to blend out the medium because of how dark it was.</li>
            <li> I use to contour with a bronzer and it would barely show up, but with this kit I instantly see the effect.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is very beige, I&#x27;m slightly tan</li>
            <li> The dark side of the compact gives my face the illusion of high cheekbones &amp; gives definition to the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I am not super dark, but I am not super light either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light-skinned black woman and this stuff is DARK, but the key to the medium and really any contour color is to apply with a lighter hand and blend.</li>
            <li> I almost wonder if it&#x27;s too subtle, or was my last bronzer not subtle enough?</li>
            <li> I recently discovered contouring but could not find a matte powder that is dark enough for my skin color.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have a small hand, and the item barely covers the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> Shipped sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Came in as expected.</li>
            <li> I am an NC42 and it provides an extremely natural and subtle bronzing effect.</li>
            <li> , you need to blend, extremely pigmented.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; part was way too dark</li>
            <li> but i should have ordered the dark.</li>
            <li> If you are  medium dark this wok out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably need dark this summer.</li>
            <li> I tend to fall into the range between medium and dark.</li>
            <li> The picture (Dark) is the kit that I wish I ordered.</li>
            <li> I use the dark shade all the time for the hollows of my cheeks, under the chin, etc.</li>
            <li> I am AA, dark caramel complexion</li>
            <li> but i think i should of order the lighter one this one is a little too dark</li>
            <li> but if a little darker get dark.</li>
            <li> Both colors come off matte even though the highlight looks like its a little shimmery.  </li>
            <li> have a heavy contour for stage</li>
            <li> (I also spray tan a few times a months)</li>
            <li> It completely transforms my face without looking fake.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you something though, I looked through a few youtube videos and dared to buy the medium nonetheless.</li>
            <li> The product has a weird smell to it which is the only let down for some people</li>
            <li> It may be small but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and it is a small case so even when i&#x27;m done with the product</li>
            <li> too glittery too orangy :S</li>
            <li> Too thick of a brush will make a bruise like appearance.... ick</li>
            <li> Very small in size;</li>
            <li> The highlighter is subtle and does not look overly shiny..</li>
            <li> This seriously upgraded my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the color might be too dark for me</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; was not a shimmer at all but a dull pink-nude that disappeared as soon as you put it on. :(</li>
            <li> just made my face look dirty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love sleek products...so compact and pigmented...excellent</li>
            <li> i have tried so many bronzers and highlighters,this makes it SOOO EASY.

            <li> I like it but i think i should of order the lighter one this one is a little too dark but i can wear it in the summer when my skin gets tan. It has shimmer in it which i dont kinda like but its a good product.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I&#x27;m medium skin tone. (africanamerican) both powders stay on your skin and don&#x27;t clump. Would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> Did I get an old one? The &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; part was way too dark and I am a medium olive-tone. It was chalky and blending was not happening. The &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; was not a shimmer at all but a dull pink-nude that disappeared as soon as you put it on. :(</li>
            <li> I love it this  product for contouring.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I wish that I had bought it in a darker color, but the contour powder still works nicely with my skin tone. I don&#x27;t really use the highlighter part because I have other highlighter, but the times that I have used it, it came out pretty nice. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I could probably use the dark version of this, but I&#x27;m chocolate brown and loved this product. The highlight is AWESOME! Not glittery and just perfect. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I just started wanting to contour my face...especially the nose. This is an amazing product. I learned about this product from a YouTube makeup video and had to have it. Recommend this product for anyone trying to contour their face.</li>
            <li> I think this is good for a build but it would be better if it was on a lighter skin it doesn&#x27;t show up on the darker skin I think the tone should be deeper for darker skin I needed a shade darker I thought it was going to show up on my skin but it didn&#x27;t a female impersonator but awesome doing makeup tips to make up tricks I know that it needs to be on my desk in because of me doing have a heavy contour for stage</li>
            <li> I love the contour kit but having a sensitive skin, I tend to break out. However, I still take my chances. Love this kit though!</li>
            <li> I chose a five because I love this kit. I use to contour with a bronzer and it would barely show up, but with this kit I instantly see the effect. I love how it looks on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the highlighter but i should have ordered the dark. The medium is too light for me. overall its a good product</li>
            <li> It is a really great tool for your makeup kit. However I must say that even though I ordered a medium, it was still pretty dark. I have golden skin (I usually wear Golden Bisque - Bare Minerals) But I really had to blend out the medium because of how dark it was. I am going to try and order the light and see if that suits my skin color better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i would definitely recommend this product. It really defines and helps to shape your face.</li>
            <li> Really good contour kit. i only really use the bronzer, but i love it because it shows up very nicely on my African American skin</li>
            <li> Great for contouring and highlighting! I am nc40/ Revlon colorstay Carmel/Iman Clay 2 in color and this contour shade is perfect. SO glad I didn&#x27;t get the Dark.</li>
            <li> This product is amazingly pigmented and the price for it is amazing! I was afraid the color might be too dark for me but it blends out really nice! The highlight is very pretty and looks natural on the skin! The product has a weird smell to it which is the only let down for some people but i don&#x27;t mind. It also has a nice big mirror in it which i love! If you are looking for a great contour and highlight duo I&#x27;d reccomend this one!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How good? I love this kit! It blends perfectly for my Asian fair skin (yellow undertone). Texture is very smooth so it is very easy to blend. Gives you a flawless finish. For the shipping? It arrived earlier than ETA...that&#x27;s a freaking plus! Packaging? Very nice and it came with contouring guide. Worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non so far. I did not break out or anything so overall this product is now on my checklist!</li>
            <li> This contour kit is a lot better than I expected! It may be small but it gets the job done. Very easy to use and blend. The only downside is that it took three weeks to get to me but it was worth the wait. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> It is a great palette!  I have a olive skin tone and medium shows up well on my skin.  It isn&#x27;t longlasting, for me (because of my oily skin) but we can make it last with some setting powder or mist.  Great pigmentation, pretty sturdy packaging.  Very small in size; smaller than I expected.  I have a small hand, and the item barely covers the palm of my hand.  But good quality, good color for contouring.  I layered on the contour color and it didn&#x27;t cake up; easy to layer so you can adjust how much you want to contour your face.  I am yet to be impressed by the highlight because i like strong highlights.  It is a very subtle, but when the light hits the top of the cheekbones it gives a sheen.  It is not a glittery highlight.  Both colors come off matte even though the highlight looks like its a little shimmery.  Very easy to blend especially with a brush.  One big plus is that it comes with a mirror and it is a small case so even when i&#x27;m done with the product, i&#x27;ll probably use it as a hand mirror.  This is my first impression on the item, but I will update as I use it.</li>
            <li> It works well for a NC40 - NC42 skintone.. The highlighter is subtle and does not look overly shiny.. The bronzer is also decent.. I have used these as eyeshadows as well and they work fine..</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the Real Techniques brushes as Sarah uses this brand of contouring in her videos. I am Caucasian with olive skin (I also spray tan a few times a months) and I got the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> the color work perfect for me I tend to be a NC 45 in Mac I hope that helps love</li>
            <li> this highlight adds shimmer which im not a big fan of, and the contour is pretty dark so have a light hand while applying.</li>
            <li> use it everytime I apply makeup</li>
            <li> I liked this product it is excellent and its good quality and buy it again, and in carving a perfect face</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer and highlighter :) definitely recommend. If you are  medium dark this wok out but if a little darker get dark. I&#x27;ll probably need dark this summer.</li>
            <li> Love the colors.  Picture colors are very true, and will work well will skin tones with deep blues and red undertones.  You&#x27;ll have to be patience in receiving it, but it will eventually get to you.</li>
            <li> contour came out beautiful but broke me out badly later that day so I don&#x27;t recommend if you know you get bumps fast by anything</li>
            <li> this product is really pretty and great colour for the contour, not orange or shimmery&lt;br /&gt;my colour is tanned and this fits me perfectly</li>
            <li> In the picture it looks like the highlight is punk but its goldish. Its pretty. I got my friendsto buy this. It works and blends so well and looks great. I have medium olive skintone woth yellow undertone and the medium is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This seriously upgraded my makeup routine. It really makes me look like I have sculpted features. I love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light-skinned black woman and this stuff is DARK, but the key to the medium and really any contour color is to apply with a lighter hand and blend. It arrived so fast too. Why don&#x27;t US drugstores carry make-up this good?</li>
            <li> Learning how to contour and these colors for medium skin are exactly what I need. I am Mexican and Hawaiian, so my skin is olive toned.. I am not super dark, but I am not super light either. The highlighter is just enough. Get the right fan brush though! Too thick of a brush will make a bruise like appearance.... ick</li>
            <li> This contour kit is my life!!! Its contours flawlessly and without shimmer. I am in the tan complexion area so the shade medium is just right with me! It also comes with imstructions! (SAY WHAT???)</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  It is a great bronzer and highlighter.</li>
            <li> Love, love. love this product.  It makes such a difference when I apply this on my face.  I am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;m Mexican and I got the Medium. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I should have went one shade darker because this is too close to my skin color. With that said, this is a product worth buying, just make sure you match your skin color correctly. One shade darker if you are using it for contouring your makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the dark shade, but since I do not like a lot of shimmer on my face the lighter shade I do not use. Works great for African American brown skin. The packaging and shipping were excellent.</li>
            <li> I dont get what all the hype is about. It&#x27;s nothing special. This is a good product, but it doesnt seem worth it with all the shipping, and wait time. And not to mention it is pretty small. It is smaller than the E.L.F. brand of blush and contour kit. I wont be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup expert by any means, but I did a lot of research before buying this set and I must say, I think it is superior to other products out there. I am an NC42 and it provides an extremely natural and subtle bronzing effect. I almost wonder if it&#x27;s too subtle, or was my last bronzer not subtle enough? Since I&#x27;m not being photographed regularly, my guess is more subtlely is better than less subtlety. I do wish the highlighter was a big shinier, however I&#x27;ve only tried applicating with one type of brush; I&#x27;m sure different applicators will allow for different looks. All in all, a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect that it will arrive that fast. I LOVE It! I use this as a replacement of my contour palette. I use the right one for highlight. Will definitely buy again! 👍👍 I Recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great! I don&#x27;t know why drug store brands haven&#x27;t thought of this! Use to contour right under my cheek bones and highlight above where the blush goes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> too glittery too orangy :S</li>
            <li> 10 days to arrive, TOTALLY WORTH IT! it said it would took 3 weeks to arrive but it only took 10 days, so THANK YOU (lucky girl -the seller) and about the product I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT, my skin tone is like rihanna&#x27;s (just to name someone) and I bought Medium, I worked good! thanks again</li>
            <li> Easiest contour I have ever done. Let it be said that I am new to contouring however, but this stuff is magical. It completely transforms my face without looking fake.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is very beige, I&#x27;m slightly tan so I ordered this in medium. The contour color is perfect,  a matte brown, it&#x27;s not orangey or sparkly whatsoever. The highlight is also very nice but the sparkles are just a tiny bit too noticeable for my taste, but its still nice enough to use.</li>
            <li> Came before arrival date and very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> Shipped sooner than expected. Decent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to do the contour yet, but I love the high liter omg, smooth ...I have to learn the contour that&#x27;s why I bought it , I&#x27;m listen if any one wants to let me no...</li>
            <li> Bought the medium shade. Good for contouring,  the contour shade is the right shade for it (does not have red/orange undertones, but more taupe ones). The pigmentation is very nice, however I have not used the highlighting color on my favorite.  I am MAC NC-42, Lancome 410 Bisque W, and Nars Syracuse for reference.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and good quality product, recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this pallet to contour my face and nose. It gives an amazing finish. I like that the lighter part has a little shine to it because it catches the light. It is almost the texture of mineral powder. I am really loving this pallet.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I definitely like this. I love it, originally I thought the color medium would be too light, mostly because almost anytime something says that the color is medium it&#x27;s usually too light. I tend to fall into the range between medium and dark. I almost thought of buying the dark one, because after all it is contour so a lighter color would not be ideal. Let me tell you something though, I looked through a few youtube videos and dared to buy the medium nonetheless. I love it, i absolutely love it. It works like a charm, is not an expensive product, and comes with a wonderful highlighter. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like too too much is that it was an undertone hinting more towards red than yellow- it&#x27;s not overpowering but enough to notice it sometimes. Either way, if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap but good, and something worth your while I&#x27;d suggest you invest in this.</li>
            <li> I love Sleek Makeup It&#x27;s my favorite color cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot... This review is mainly for RM Cosmetics, they are based in the UK. I&#x27;ve ordered many of the Sleek Makeup from RM Cosmetics, the customer service is great. all my items are shipped un-damaged, and in  timely fashion.</li>
            <li> This contour kit is a great buy! I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;eyeing&amp;#34; this item for some time and should have bought it sooner! I&#x27;m a caramel 400 in Revlon Colour Stay and the medium looks natural on me! I really like using the contouring side more than the highlight but that&#x27;s not to say that the contour isn&#x27;t nice as well - really makes a difference in the final makeup finish.</li>
            <li> I was wanting to experiment with contouring - I&#x27;m no makeup artist....just an everyday mom who wanted to add a little fun to getting ready and feel good....I love this product and I&#x27;m sure makeup artists would too.  Goes on nicely and easy to blend and looks natural ... I don&#x27;t wear foundation...</li>
            <li> Of all the products I use for contouring and highlighting, this is beez kneez! Everything you need all in one! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> The highlight is shimmery and the brown is matte. I be only used it twice in an attempt to highlight and contour as I&#x27;ve never done it before. It did come with nose, cheek and face contour instructions. Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It was good, as everyone explained  I like that its not really dark, but just right too bad it&#x27;s not in stores</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely. Maybe a little darker brown than most people need but with a light stoke of a brush it does a good job. I will buy it again. Also works as  well as a eye shadow. For the price you can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li> The picture (Dark) is the kit that I wish I ordered. But over all good product</li>
            <li> AWESOME value. I use the dark shade all the time for the hollows of my cheeks, under the chin, etc. It&#x27;s a nice brown color that isn&#x27;t too saturated in order to achieve the semblance of &amp;#34;shadows&amp;#34;. The highlighter is slightly shimmery, which is nice and gives a subtle glow to the skin. I even use the highlighter on my eyelids sometimes for a pretty natural look. I bought two! And I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Super Fast Delivery! The color was also perfect for my skin tone and I am African American. Also had easy to follow directions along with the contour kit! Also has mirror with it which comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Such a great simple contour palette (especially since I don&#x27;t know what I am doing yet).  Gives me amazing cheekbones!</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this duo and Sleek Makeup did not disappoint.  Takes some practice but sure does the job!</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery considering it was supposed to take a lot longer. I recently discovered contouring but could not find a matte powder that is dark enough for my skin color. I heard reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. It works beautifully and the medium is perfect for my caramel complexion. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used contouring makeup before, I simply purchased this experimentally. First off, the price was unbelievably low for something that works so very well. The dark side of the compact gives my face the illusion of high cheekbones &amp; gives definition to the rest of my face. The light side of the compact give my eyes a bright (and refreshed) look. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great color. Can be doubled as an eyeshadow with the highlight on the lid and the bronzer on the crease.</li>
            <li> Best contour kit I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  I highly recommend this product plus the price is great.  This product also fits perfectly inside my travel cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Still trying to master using this, but so far has not given me the glowing and contoured looked I had hoped for.  Will keep trying</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping with intact packaging. I am AA, dark caramel complexion and I found that the dark powder matched exactly to my skin.... not so great for contouring. I maybe should of gotten then darker one... The highlighter is awesome though.</li>
            <li> love it - I&#x27;m a MAC NW45 and it works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Love this! Great deal!</li>
            <li> the compact was nice and the powder was very smooth and covered well But, the the color shown was a cool brown I was looking for, instead it was a orangy warm brown that didn&#x27;t create contour just made my face look dirty.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to see how it compared to my MAC blush and highlighter.  I wore it for a week to work,I received so many compliments on my makeup. I thought it was a great product,  so I used it on my models for the fashion show I did last month.  I have to that it added that extra ump! I will be ordering this product again</li>
            <li> Got the product yesterday. Came in as expected. Would order again!</li>
