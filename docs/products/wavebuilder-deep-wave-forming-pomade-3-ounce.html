            <li> On the can it says it&#x27;s the best wave forming pomade... And they&#x27;re not lying, the instructions says apply a small amount to hair and brush vigorously.  You follow these exact directions and you&#x27;ll see it doing it&#x27;s job.  I suggest after you&#x27;re finished brushing for a while to spray your hair with warm water and repeat the brushing step again, my 360 waves are coming in nice in a short period of time thanks to wave builder products.  So far I have no complaints about this product and if you use it I think you&#x27;d feel the same way.  So I must give Wave Builder DEEP WAVE 5 STARS!!!</li>

            <li> Great product, arrived fast and does exactly what it says. Would recommend to anyone. Wavebuilder products live uo to their name.</li>
            <li> the deep wave pomade is simply great, I will definately be ordering more, not too greasy and easy to work with on your hair.</li>
