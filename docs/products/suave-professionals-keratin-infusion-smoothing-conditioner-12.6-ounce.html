            <li>The leave in conditioner is  totally awesome too.</li>
            <li>have to say this system works great!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>Good product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continually impressed</li>
            <li>When I redo my keratin treatment I will be using a sulfate-free shampoo and this wonderful conditioner</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>, every girl deserves beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>who had experienced the amount of hair loss from this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I read reviews about this cream rinse being so great.</li>
            <li>For the price its a great buy.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>Suave has offered an amazing product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li>, I bet the results will be amazing!  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and it works magic on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>(I have a lot of hair both length and volume wise).</li>
            <li>I enjoy the Suave professionals line and this is a great addition!!</li>
            <li>fear is Suave will decide to discontinue it at some point as seems to be what manufacturers do with a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>GREAT RESULTS, like better than Wen &amp; Hair One but will rotate all to avoid build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says : Definately buying more ..and  would recommend to all with curly or wavy unmanageable hair !&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products from drugstore to salon, and this is certainly one of the best.</li>
            <li>It has great slippage and leaves my curls (3/3b) shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t believe a Suave product could make my hair look and feel so amazing, so i was waiting for a catch.</li>
            <li>I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as my own.</li>
            <li>(OK, I LOVED the leave-in serum, but will write another review).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use heat of any kind on her hair.</li>
            <li>The results were alright, after all I didn&#x27;t expect any spectacular results from a dollar store conditioner.  </li>
            <li>When I apply it, I can work tangles out very easily in the shower, and my hair feels light and well-conditioned with a good amount of shine to it.</li>
            <li>Loved the way it made my hair sleek and smooth.  </li>
            <li>By far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Keratin infused products are now becoming more popular, but I won&#x27;t bother spending more money on higher priced products when Suave&#x27;s Keratin Infusion does a beautiful job.  </li>
            <li>pros to this conditioner is that if you use a heat styler, this product is super good for your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this Keratin Infusion product line.</li>
            <li>Do you want healthy hair?</li>
            <li>Then you NEED to buy this.. best Suave product that I have ever used in my entire life!</li>
            <li>I tried the conditioner, for many monthes an found out it contains achcol and</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li>It also controls frizz much better than the Matrix brand I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>I wonder if using the shampoo too helps even more?</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>More like 4x</li>
            <li>Words cannot express how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This helps your hair get so much more moisture from the conditioner, and still allows the shampoo to remove a bit of the dulling parts of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Sincerely Bernadette</li>
            <li>i literally couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it though.</li>
            <li>To me it works like most conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair feel even better after I let it sit in my hair for about three minutes.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So okay, when I heard that Nicole Richie was attached to this product--I rolled my eyes and said, &#x27;Sure, whatever&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a conditioner that can fix this problem and give my hair more bounce and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I always be sure to shampoo thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>and I ran a comb through my hair, making sure every strand was covered.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I wash my hair out thoroughly to avoid build up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with my hair, it smelled so nice, it was silky smooth and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Every time I brush it seems more manageable and it also feels nicer to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for more than 4 months with no problems.</li>
            <li>But I would say that the manly smell of this conditioner makes it a better choice for a man than for a woman.  </li>
            <li>Since I have so much hair, it&#x27;s also great that this stuff is so cheap.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it would do my natural hair just as great as my weave.</li>
            <li>Then I put a huge amount of the suave keratin conditioner on all the hair that&#x27;s below the roots and make sure I get all the ends</li>
            <li>She has naturally curly hair and this one leaves it looking the  way it is , curly , plus shiny and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in the conditioner is that strong or bat at all and people have complimented my nice smelling hair, something that rarely happens.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in the conditioner is that strong or bat at all and people have complimented my nice smelling hair, something that rarely happens.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>Then as I kept using it, i started noticing strands and balls of hair would fallout so easily.</li>
            <li>I feel as though the hydrolyzed keratin keeps the hair strong minimizing tangles, frizz as well as shedding.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product at first.</li>
            <li>I have tried way more conditioners and hair products on my curly (3a/b), super frizzy hair than I could ever count.  </li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair smooth and silky when used with Pantese silky miosture whip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but there is a chemical edge to it, and it is nowhere as pleasant to apply as Devacurl One Condition or Wen Fig, my other two favorite conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use the coordinating shampoo before and the smooth and shine serum after.</li>
            <li>The remaining hair looks smooth and sleek---but the breakage is god-awful.</li>
            <li>whilst i am all for cheap drugstore brands, i always considered Suave to be just too cheap drugstore.</li>
            <li>and the dimethicone really coats the hair softening it and giving it that nice luster and sheen.</li>
            <li>It was then that I noticed how silky and smooth my hair felt.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair super easy to comb out after washing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have found that it cleans my hair pretty well and smooths it while I am washing, allowing me to better scrub my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Having finally figured out that many others experienced balding from Pantene, I stopped, and returned to normal light hair loss.</li>
            <li>This was hands down the best system I have ever used from the first shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Wow am I glad!</li>
            <li>She has tried a lot many other conditioners but nothing was as good as this one she says.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try, not really expecting great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used EVERYTHING for my long, wavy highhighted hair and this is, by far, the best product.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to last a good while on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a fair amount of damage from color treatments, daily blow drying and styling.  </li>
            <li>also if your hair is wavy it really defines the wave I love that</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put any product in my hair after I got out the shower because I wanted to see the full effects.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way my hair felt after I used this conditioner - soft and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I have more than an inch of new growth but because of this, I don&#x27;t need a touch up!</li>
            <li>Consider yourselves extremely lucky.</li>
            <li>Will likely hand off the rest of the bottle to a Caucasian friend who will be able to use it... :)</li>
            <li>While it was drying it looked super</li>
            <li>So far this product had been very useful in providing smoothness and healthy looking/feeling hair.</li>
            <li>At first I was getting super smooth and shiny hair, but eventually I started getting a bunch of scalp pimples all over my head.</li>
            <li>At first it worked well for my hair, making it shiny, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a Suave user because, in the past, their products haven&#x27;t usually impressed me much.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say my hair is in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li>I use a good scalp shampoo, like the new Clear scalp, or head and shoulders, or neutrogena dandruff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so amazed a cheap conditioner can give such good results far better than any professional brand I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>drawback is that it has a lot of silicone, which many consider to be damaging to natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li>Six months later, STILL LOVING IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my hair had such a great smell to it and it was so soft</li>
            <li>- halfway through the day i noticed my usually flat, fine hair had more shine and bounce to it.</li>
            <li>I hope to update but as of right now, so worth the money.</li>
            <li>, also I do not use this product in my natural hair mainly because I do not wash my own hair</li>
            <li>So I have been experimenting on finding the right hair product since I moved here.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;d have had to shave my head right afterwards.  </li>
            <li>and she was right one the money with this one.</li>
            <li>, when the hair dries, it&#x27;s fine, but while damp, there is a greasy slickness that reminds me of the old Jheri Curls (</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use shampoo due to the type of water we have here and the use of a softener so a good conditioner is an absolute must.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as I have a shower full of \\&quot;anti frizz\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners that don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>am hoping that the same or better results will be achieved with continued use.</li>
            <li>It makes our hair soft, smooth and detangles well.</li>
            <li>First of all, I feel the need to clarify that I do not use the shampoo along with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this conditioner, I was amazed.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to use it a second time.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is really pretty too</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this conditioner again, I love it.</li>
            <li>it was the first time Id ever seen some shine...</li>
            <li>I shampooed first with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since (Soap Nuts) is a sulfate free shampoo, it completely removes any &#x27;slip&#x27; from your hair so trying to detangle without a &#x27;slippery&#x27; conditioner would be a nightmare on my 4b hair.  </li>
            <li>So I was in the store with my hands on the keratin treatment and with all the warnings on the side I decided to try the conditioner first.</li>
            <li>I have giant bald patches on the top of my head</li>
            <li>I am gonna say the same thing that many others have said.</li>
            <li>During the first wash with the shampoo, I immediately noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using just the conditioner for about two months now and still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo/conditioner combo</li>
            <li>It rinses away clean ,leaving my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always surprised by the great, everyday results.</li>
            <li>I came here expecting to find all 1-star reviews and nothing positive about this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used every other product from expensive salon brands to mega chain store best sellers, and this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this as I generally think of suave as a cheap brand.</li>
            <li>I pretty much always use one bottle of something and then try something else because nothing cuts the frizz for me.  </li>
            <li>I will be able to let my hair grow long again.</li>
            <li>I was literally becoming bald in the back of my head at this time.</li>
            <li>My 3c/4a hair was super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Sure, they may work a bit better than drugstore brands,  but in my opinion it&#x27;s not worth the extra 30 dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is essentially what a brazilian blowout does, coat your hair in lots of keratin then run a 400F straightener over it, and results for that last around 6 months until it starts to look less perfect.</li>
            <li>Use conditioner first, on the ponytail part and ends of the hair mainly, and let it sit in your hair while you&#x27;re showering.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t wear too much perfume.</li>
            <li>In time, you will start to go bald, like really bald.</li>
            <li>Not to mention ,it smells real</li>
            <li>i have very frizzy hair and this conditioner smooths hair, leaves it shinny.</li>
            <li>Straightning is much easier.</li>
            <li>I like it because a big bottle was dirt cheap</li>
            <li>and I could use as much as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I plan to redo thetreatment very soon.  </li>
            <li>My hair can be very greasy at times towards the scalp area</li>
            <li>Overall, this conditioner is effective (especially for the price)</li>
            <li>After a week of usage, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant amount of hair on the floor from simply combing.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day and leave a conditioner in for about 10 minutes to moisturize better before rinsing.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s always a significant amount of greasiness to my hair that feels like product left in my hair.  </li>
            <li>When it was finished drying I was delighted by the results, it actually calmed some of my waves down, my hair was shiny, sleek, silky, and had movement to it.  </li>
            <li>I am actually without a halo of frizz right now (yay!).</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a great substitute for frizz issues or just to get that sleek, smooth look, and while not perfect, it does a solid job!</li>
            <li>The smell was also nice,  not like usual conditioner, sort of like a perfume.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and wavy when it is dry, so I figured that it was best to comb it when wet.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a white girl with really soft, unmanageable can&#x27;t-hold-any-shape-at-all fine hair, but lots of it, try this.</li>
            <li>As a African American women, I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells clean but the smell is very over powering even after you dry your hair...</li>
            <li>and it really helps get it beautifully straight shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does leave my hair smooth and soft, but if I don&#x27;t shampoo well enough before applying, my hair ends up being sticky by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford high end stuff and</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and felt healthy, and my hair was extremely manageable when I went to straighten and style it.</li>
            <li>For reference I have baby fine, long hair, which has lowlights/highlights, and it is naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>frizzy- maybe even a little more so than normal.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this not hoping for much, and I was extremely surprised.  </li>
            <li>(Vidal-Sassoon VS783) and voila - soft, shiny, moving, STRAIGHT hair.</li>
            <li>Even when I&#x27;m rinsing it all out, even wet, my hair just FEELS so light and silky.</li>
            <li>Even when I&#x27;m rinsing it all out, even wet, my hair just FEELS so light and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy in some places and straight in others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a Keratin treatment before, or any type of coloring or highlights, so I just assumed that was normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking the normal 50 or so strands a day.  </li>
            <li>Then, rinse it out, and shampoo as normal.</li>
            <li>I rarely use any heat on my hair, especially now because it&#x27;s summer.  </li>
            <li>Not overly thick and rises away nicely.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product is much better than the regular Suave Professionals conditioner for dry, frizzy hair and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the keratin that my hair is loving or what but even my second day hair was really</li>
            <li>I bought the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion condition because about a month ago, I used the New Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 day Smoothing kit</li>
            <li>When the store is out of it or featuring a new product I order it on line.</li>
            <li>I would not change for the new product</li>
            <li>My new go to conditioner and shampoo</li>
            <li>OMG I did not have one tangle/mat in my hair and believe me with 2 inches of new growth that is a miracle in itself.</li>
            <li>After that I lathered on some of the new conditioner</li>
            <li>This may sound like a lot of trouble, but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed a vast improvement after the first use of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for almost 2 months now, and I used it daily for the first two weeks until I realized</li>
            <li>I rarely get those unless I go for a whole week without washing, but I was washing every day or every other day so it shouldn&#x27;t have been happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you look up keratin, it is supposed to be a protein essential in hair and nails, but it is also the main ingredient in those super gross and smelly sebaceous cysts.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind, if you think it&#x27;s falling out more than usual and you use this product, it probably is.  </li>
            <li>first time i put this in my hair - and i only got it because it said \\&quot;compare to Kerastase\\&quot;</li>
            <li>So when I first got these products I only tried them because I saw it on a reality show that they used it on a model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Let me tell you that my hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>and I actually didn&#x27;t rinse it all out, but I&#x27;ve used it several times since then, rinsing and rinsing and rinsing and rinsing some more in the shower and always wind up with the same results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not flowers and fruits and pretty things.</li>
            <li>it started breaking my hair if your are trying to find a cheap way to get a keritain  treatment or conditiner its not made for african american hair it leaves it soft but not made for our relaxed or natural hair</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a great substitute for frizz issues or just to get that sleek, smooth look, and while not perfect, it does a solid job!salon version, which do work better, but are way too expensive.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my scalp began to itch and burn, and then I developed hives all over my body, starting first with my head (scalp) and neck, and then spreading everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>Next I applied a nickel-sized amount of natural oil to my hair (kukui nut) finished with my hand held hair dryer with large comb attachment  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle deep conditioner because of the very high ratings,  </li>
            <li>I do leave out a tiny bit of my natural hair at the top when I wear weave and for the the little bit of hair that I leave out I use it to cowash and makes my leave out look just like the weave effortless blending and flowing.</li>
            <li>my hair is full of body and hardly any frizz after the first time using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Then I take the Clear scalp conditioner and put about a quarter sized amount just on the scalp.</li>
            <li>My sister recommended this product and I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li>I see a definite difference in the curl definition and my hair, which I comb with my fingers in the shower to minimize damage, was much smoother and easier to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used on virgin hair (my 1 year old), it defrizzed her hair and loosened the kink.</li>
            <li>It was soft, manageable and lays better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of daily use, my hair is improving and much easier to style:</li>
            <li>i think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>All I know is that this Keratin Infusion Conditioner works and keeps my frizzy ends controlled and my hair soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t what happens if direct heat is applied.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe how much I&#x27;d been paying for the salon version, which do work better, but are way too expensive.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed that my hair can be very brittle, especially towards the ends.  </li>
            <li>Before purchasing this conditioner I was using one of Suave&#x27;s natural brands (the coconut one).  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair manageable, soft and takes out the frizz</li>
            <li>The waves didn&#x27;t come back like this normally do!  </li>
            <li>Please be careful before using - maybe a patch test first?</li>
            <li>The ONLY new thing was this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is no longer dry, but very moisturized with no frizz.</li>
            <li>I have dry and very damaged hair from dying my hair so much,my hair was breaking off</li>
            <li>There was NOTHING else new in my life - nothing new that I ate, drank, or wore and no new detergents, soap or similar items.  </li>
            <li>shampoo and conditioner is just amazing; it moisturizes and softens my hair, and it radically reduces my frizz issues, while also magically not making my hair limp and</li>
            <li>My boyfriend barely notices when I highlight my hair and even complimented on the softness and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to be on wen, then ojon, until it became too expensive unless I skimp on the amount, but I find that being generous with a cheaper but still good conditioner is better than using just a dime sized expensive</li>
            <li>What made it even worse was I also used the suave keratin infusion serum, making my hair fallout even more into bits of pieces.</li>
            <li>(Not out of poor hygiene, because my hair is very damaged and they say its better to wash it less often to let the natural oils strengthen your hair.)</li>
            <li>I have long, thin, very straight hair with lots of breakage, so it&#x27;s a miracle when my hair actually looks smooth.</li>
            <li>just wish it was available without the fragrance because it&#x27;s so strong that it makes me sick while I&#x27;m in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it much after I put my slew of other products on</li>
            <li>I flat ironed it, and it looked like a professional blow out.  </li>
            <li>It transformed my hair texture completely and left my hair shiny, bouncy, and totally effortless to style.  </li>
            <li>But I continued my hair regimen like usual (a leave in conditioner, hair serum and a light gel) and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually blow dry or flatten my hair, which probably helps keep my hair smooth and my ends controlled</li>
            <li>but the ends seem a bit &#x27;puffy&#x27; and the waves general come back on my crown within a day.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves the hair soft and manageable all week long.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, wavy hair, which is frizzly pretty much</li>
            <li>ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am black with really curly hair</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s natural then, for some people, especially those with oil prone skin, to develop scalp problems if you use keratin shampoo on a long term daily basis.</li>
            <li>Ordinarily after I flat iron it, it looks all right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had good or bad results.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The price is excellent as well.</li>
            <li> The price is awesome to boot.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I must say I was rather impressed with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I find this hair product excellent.</li>
            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner is  totally awesome too.</li>
            <li> have to say this system works great!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> Good product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continually impressed</li>
            <li> When I redo my keratin treatment I will be using a sulfate-free shampoo and this wonderful conditioner</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> , every girl deserves beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> who had experienced the amount of hair loss from this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this cream rinse being so great.</li>
            <li> For the price its a great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Suave has offered an amazing product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> , I bet the results will be amazing!  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and it works magic on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> (I have a lot of hair both length and volume wise).</li>
            <li> I enjoy the Suave professionals line and this is a great addition!!</li>
            <li> fear is Suave will decide to discontinue it at some point as seems to be what manufacturers do with a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> GREAT RESULTS, like better than Wen &amp; Hair One but will rotate all to avoid build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says : Definately buying more ..and  would recommend to all with curly or wavy unmanageable hair !&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products from drugstore to salon, and this is certainly one of the best.</li>
            <li> It has great slippage and leaves my curls (3/3b) shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe a Suave product could make my hair look and feel so amazing, so i was waiting for a catch.</li>
            <li> I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as my own.</li>
            <li> (OK, I LOVED the leave-in serum, but will write another review).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use heat of any kind on her hair.</li>
            <li> The results were alright, after all I didn&#x27;t expect any spectacular results from a dollar store conditioner.  </li>
            <li> When I apply it, I can work tangles out very easily in the shower, and my hair feels light and well-conditioned with a good amount of shine to it.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my hair sleek and smooth.  </li>
            <li> By far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Keratin infused products are now becoming more popular, but I won&#x27;t bother spending more money on higher priced products when Suave&#x27;s Keratin Infusion does a beautiful job.  </li>
            <li> pros to this conditioner is that if you use a heat styler, this product is super good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this Keratin Infusion product line.</li>
            <li> Do you want healthy hair?</li>
            <li> Then you NEED to buy this.. best Suave product that I have ever used in my entire life!</li>
            <li> I tried the conditioner, for many monthes an found out it contains achcol and</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li> It also controls frizz much better than the Matrix brand I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I wonder if using the shampoo too helps even more?</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> More like 4x</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This helps your hair get so much more moisture from the conditioner, and still allows the shampoo to remove a bit of the dulling parts of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Sincerely Bernadette</li>
            <li> i literally couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it though.</li>
            <li> To me it works like most conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair feel even better after I let it sit in my hair for about three minutes.</li>
            <li> and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So okay, when I heard that Nicole Richie was attached to this product--I rolled my eyes and said, &#x27;Sure, whatever&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a conditioner that can fix this problem and give my hair more bounce and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I always be sure to shampoo thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> and I ran a comb through my hair, making sure every strand was covered.  </li>
            <li> I always make sure I wash my hair out thoroughly to avoid build up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with my hair, it smelled so nice, it was silky smooth and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Every time I brush it seems more manageable and it also feels nicer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for more than 4 months with no problems.</li>
            <li> But I would say that the manly smell of this conditioner makes it a better choice for a man than for a woman.  </li>
            <li> Since I have so much hair, it&#x27;s also great that this stuff is so cheap.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it would do my natural hair just as great as my weave.</li>
            <li> Then I put a huge amount of the suave keratin conditioner on all the hair that&#x27;s below the roots and make sure I get all the ends</li>
            <li> She has naturally curly hair and this one leaves it looking the  way it is , curly , plus shiny and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in the conditioner is that strong or bat at all and people have complimented my nice smelling hair, something that rarely happens.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in the conditioner is that strong or bat at all and people have complimented my nice smelling hair, something that rarely happens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li> Then as I kept using it, i started noticing strands and balls of hair would fallout so easily.</li>
            <li> I feel as though the hydrolyzed keratin keeps the hair strong minimizing tangles, frizz as well as shedding.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product at first.</li>
            <li> I have tried way more conditioners and hair products on my curly (3a/b), super frizzy hair than I could ever count.  </li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair smooth and silky when used with Pantese silky miosture whip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful, but there is a chemical edge to it, and it is nowhere as pleasant to apply as Devacurl One Condition or Wen Fig, my other two favorite conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use the coordinating shampoo before and the smooth and shine serum after.</li>
            <li> The remaining hair looks smooth and sleek---but the breakage is god-awful.</li>
            <li> whilst i am all for cheap drugstore brands, i always considered Suave to be just too cheap drugstore.</li>
            <li> and the dimethicone really coats the hair softening it and giving it that nice luster and sheen.</li>
            <li> It was then that I noticed how silky and smooth my hair felt.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair super easy to comb out after washing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have found that it cleans my hair pretty well and smooths it while I am washing, allowing me to better scrub my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Having finally figured out that many others experienced balding from Pantene, I stopped, and returned to normal light hair loss.</li>
            <li> This was hands down the best system I have ever used from the first shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Wow am I glad!</li>
            <li> She has tried a lot many other conditioners but nothing was as good as this one she says.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try, not really expecting great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used EVERYTHING for my long, wavy highhighted hair and this is, by far, the best product.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to last a good while on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a fair amount of damage from color treatments, daily blow drying and styling.  </li>
            <li> also if your hair is wavy it really defines the wave I love that</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put any product in my hair after I got out the shower because I wanted to see the full effects.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way my hair felt after I used this conditioner - soft and healthier.  </li>
            <li> I have more than an inch of new growth but because of this, I don&#x27;t need a touch up!</li>
            <li> Consider yourselves extremely lucky.</li>
            <li> Will likely hand off the rest of the bottle to a Caucasian friend who will be able to use it... :)</li>
            <li> While it was drying it looked super</li>
            <li> So far this product had been very useful in providing smoothness and healthy looking/feeling hair.</li>
            <li> At first I was getting super smooth and shiny hair, but eventually I started getting a bunch of scalp pimples all over my head.</li>
            <li> At first it worked well for my hair, making it shiny, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a Suave user because, in the past, their products haven&#x27;t usually impressed me much.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say my hair is in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li> I use a good scalp shampoo, like the new Clear scalp, or head and shoulders, or neutrogena dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so amazed a cheap conditioner can give such good results far better than any professional brand I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> drawback is that it has a lot of silicone, which many consider to be damaging to natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li> Six months later, STILL LOVING IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my hair had such a great smell to it and it was so soft</li>
            <li> - halfway through the day i noticed my usually flat, fine hair had more shine and bounce to it.</li>
            <li> I hope to update but as of right now, so worth the money.</li>
            <li> , also I do not use this product in my natural hair mainly because I do not wash my own hair</li>
            <li> So I have been experimenting on finding the right hair product since I moved here.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d have had to shave my head right afterwards.  </li>
            <li> and she was right one the money with this one.</li>
            <li> , when the hair dries, it&#x27;s fine, but while damp, there is a greasy slickness that reminds me of the old Jheri Curls (</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use shampoo due to the type of water we have here and the use of a softener so a good conditioner is an absolute must.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as I have a shower full of \\&quot;anti frizz\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners that don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> am hoping that the same or better results will be achieved with continued use.</li>
            <li> It makes our hair soft, smooth and detangles well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I feel the need to clarify that I do not use the shampoo along with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this conditioner, I was amazed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to use it a second time.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is really pretty too</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this conditioner again, I love it.</li>
            <li> it was the first time Id ever seen some shine...</li>
            <li> I shampooed first with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since (Soap Nuts) is a sulfate free shampoo, it completely removes any &#x27;slip&#x27; from your hair so trying to detangle without a &#x27;slippery&#x27; conditioner would be a nightmare on my 4b hair.  </li>
            <li> So I was in the store with my hands on the keratin treatment and with all the warnings on the side I decided to try the conditioner first.</li>
            <li> I have giant bald patches on the top of my head</li>
            <li> I am gonna say the same thing that many others have said.</li>
            <li> During the first wash with the shampoo, I immediately noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using just the conditioner for about two months now and still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo/conditioner combo</li>
            <li> It rinses away clean ,leaving my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always surprised by the great, everyday results.</li>
            <li> I came here expecting to find all 1-star reviews and nothing positive about this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used every other product from expensive salon brands to mega chain store best sellers, and this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this as I generally think of suave as a cheap brand.</li>
            <li> I pretty much always use one bottle of something and then try something else because nothing cuts the frizz for me.  </li>
            <li> I will be able to let my hair grow long again.</li>
            <li> I was literally becoming bald in the back of my head at this time.</li>
            <li> My 3c/4a hair was super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Sure, they may work a bit better than drugstore brands,  but in my opinion it&#x27;s not worth the extra 30 dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is essentially what a brazilian blowout does, coat your hair in lots of keratin then run a 400F straightener over it, and results for that last around 6 months until it starts to look less perfect.</li>
            <li> Use conditioner first, on the ponytail part and ends of the hair mainly, and let it sit in your hair while you&#x27;re showering.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t wear too much perfume.</li>
            <li> In time, you will start to go bald, like really bald.</li>
            <li> Not to mention ,it smells real</li>
            <li> i have very frizzy hair and this conditioner smooths hair, leaves it shinny.</li>
            <li> Straightning is much easier.</li>
            <li> I like it because a big bottle was dirt cheap</li>
            <li> and I could use as much as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I plan to redo thetreatment very soon.  </li>
            <li> My hair can be very greasy at times towards the scalp area</li>
            <li> Overall, this conditioner is effective (especially for the price)</li>
            <li> After a week of usage, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant amount of hair on the floor from simply combing.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and leave a conditioner in for about 10 minutes to moisturize better before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s always a significant amount of greasiness to my hair that feels like product left in my hair.  </li>
            <li> When it was finished drying I was delighted by the results, it actually calmed some of my waves down, my hair was shiny, sleek, silky, and had movement to it.  </li>
            <li> I am actually without a halo of frizz right now (yay!).</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a great substitute for frizz issues or just to get that sleek, smooth look, and while not perfect, it does a solid job!</li>
            <li> The smell was also nice,  not like usual conditioner, sort of like a perfume.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and wavy when it is dry, so I figured that it was best to comb it when wet.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a white girl with really soft, unmanageable can&#x27;t-hold-any-shape-at-all fine hair, but lots of it, try this.</li>
            <li> As a African American women, I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells clean but the smell is very over powering even after you dry your hair...</li>
            <li> and it really helps get it beautifully straight shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does leave my hair smooth and soft, but if I don&#x27;t shampoo well enough before applying, my hair ends up being sticky by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford high end stuff and</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and felt healthy, and my hair was extremely manageable when I went to straighten and style it.</li>
            <li> For reference I have baby fine, long hair, which has lowlights/highlights, and it is naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> frizzy- maybe even a little more so than normal.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this not hoping for much, and I was extremely surprised.  </li>
            <li> (Vidal-Sassoon VS783) and voila - soft, shiny, moving, STRAIGHT hair.</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m rinsing it all out, even wet, my hair just FEELS so light and silky.</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m rinsing it all out, even wet, my hair just FEELS so light and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy in some places and straight in others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a Keratin treatment before, or any type of coloring or highlights, so I just assumed that was normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking the normal 50 or so strands a day.  </li>
            <li> Then, rinse it out, and shampoo as normal.</li>
            <li> I rarely use any heat on my hair, especially now because it&#x27;s summer.  </li>
            <li> Not overly thick and rises away nicely.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product is much better than the regular Suave Professionals conditioner for dry, frizzy hair and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the keratin that my hair is loving or what but even my second day hair was really</li>
            <li> I bought the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion condition because about a month ago, I used the New Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 day Smoothing kit</li>
            <li> When the store is out of it or featuring a new product I order it on line.</li>
            <li> I would not change for the new product</li>
            <li> My new go to conditioner and shampoo</li>
            <li> OMG I did not have one tangle/mat in my hair and believe me with 2 inches of new growth that is a miracle in itself.</li>
            <li> After that I lathered on some of the new conditioner</li>
            <li> This may sound like a lot of trouble, but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a vast improvement after the first use of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost 2 months now, and I used it daily for the first two weeks until I realized</li>
            <li> I rarely get those unless I go for a whole week without washing, but I was washing every day or every other day so it shouldn&#x27;t have been happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you look up keratin, it is supposed to be a protein essential in hair and nails, but it is also the main ingredient in those super gross and smelly sebaceous cysts.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind, if you think it&#x27;s falling out more than usual and you use this product, it probably is.  </li>
            <li> first time i put this in my hair - and i only got it because it said \\&quot;compare to Kerastase\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So when I first got these products I only tried them because I saw it on a reality show that they used it on a model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that my hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> and I actually didn&#x27;t rinse it all out, but I&#x27;ve used it several times since then, rinsing and rinsing and rinsing and rinsing some more in the shower and always wind up with the same results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not flowers and fruits and pretty things.</li>
            <li> it started breaking my hair if your are trying to find a cheap way to get a keritain  treatment or conditiner its not made for african american hair it leaves it soft but not made for our relaxed or natural hair</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a great substitute for frizz issues or just to get that sleek, smooth look, and while not perfect, it does a solid job!salon version, which do work better, but are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my scalp began to itch and burn, and then I developed hives all over my body, starting first with my head (scalp) and neck, and then spreading everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> Next I applied a nickel-sized amount of natural oil to my hair (kukui nut) finished with my hand held hair dryer with large comb attachment  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle deep conditioner because of the very high ratings,  </li>
            <li> I do leave out a tiny bit of my natural hair at the top when I wear weave and for the the little bit of hair that I leave out I use it to cowash and makes my leave out look just like the weave effortless blending and flowing.</li>
            <li> my hair is full of body and hardly any frizz after the first time using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Then I take the Clear scalp conditioner and put about a quarter sized amount just on the scalp.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product and I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li> I see a definite difference in the curl definition and my hair, which I comb with my fingers in the shower to minimize damage, was much smoother and easier to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used on virgin hair (my 1 year old), it defrizzed her hair and loosened the kink.</li>
            <li> It was soft, manageable and lays better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of daily use, my hair is improving and much easier to style:</li>
            <li> i think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> All I know is that this Keratin Infusion Conditioner works and keeps my frizzy ends controlled and my hair soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t what happens if direct heat is applied.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how much I&#x27;d been paying for the salon version, which do work better, but are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that my hair can be very brittle, especially towards the ends.  </li>
            <li> Before purchasing this conditioner I was using one of Suave&#x27;s natural brands (the coconut one).  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair manageable, soft and takes out the frizz</li>
            <li> The waves didn&#x27;t come back like this normally do!  </li>
            <li> Please be careful before using - maybe a patch test first?</li>
            <li> The ONLY new thing was this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is no longer dry, but very moisturized with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have dry and very damaged hair from dying my hair so much,my hair was breaking off</li>
            <li> There was NOTHING else new in my life - nothing new that I ate, drank, or wore and no new detergents, soap or similar items.  </li>
            <li> shampoo and conditioner is just amazing; it moisturizes and softens my hair, and it radically reduces my frizz issues, while also magically not making my hair limp and</li>
            <li> My boyfriend barely notices when I highlight my hair and even complimented on the softness and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to be on wen, then ojon, until it became too expensive unless I skimp on the amount, but I find that being generous with a cheaper but still good conditioner is better than using just a dime sized expensive</li>
            <li> What made it even worse was I also used the suave keratin infusion serum, making my hair fallout even more into bits of pieces.</li>
            <li> (Not out of poor hygiene, because my hair is very damaged and they say its better to wash it less often to let the natural oils strengthen your hair.)</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, very straight hair with lots of breakage, so it&#x27;s a miracle when my hair actually looks smooth.</li>
            <li> just wish it was available without the fragrance because it&#x27;s so strong that it makes me sick while I&#x27;m in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it much after I put my slew of other products on</li>
            <li> I flat ironed it, and it looked like a professional blow out.  </li>
            <li> It transformed my hair texture completely and left my hair shiny, bouncy, and totally effortless to style.  </li>
            <li> But I continued my hair regimen like usual (a leave in conditioner, hair serum and a light gel) and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually blow dry or flatten my hair, which probably helps keep my hair smooth and my ends controlled</li>
            <li> but the ends seem a bit &#x27;puffy&#x27; and the waves general come back on my crown within a day.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves the hair soft and manageable all week long.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair, which is frizzly pretty much</li>
            <li> ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am black with really curly hair</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s natural then, for some people, especially those with oil prone skin, to develop scalp problems if you use keratin shampoo on a long term daily basis.</li>
            <li> Ordinarily after I flat iron it, it looks all right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good or bad results.</li>
            <li> actually, it was Aussie&#x27;s volumizing conditioner \\&quot;aussome volume\\&quot; (which did nothing for me, although had smashing reviews) - and found my hair flat and frizzy again.</li>
            <li> Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Dry Hair - \\&quot;EXTREME</li>
            <li> I usually blow dry it straight or let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> It feels very soft and much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Seeing how well keratin worked for my hair, when I was shopping I decided to give Suave&#x27;s new keratin conditioner a try, it was only a few dollars</li>
            <li> I used both the shampoo and conditioner, and flat ironed my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried getting by with smaller amounts of conditioner, but then it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair at all and my hair is still dry.</li>
            <li> Not much to really say about this ,except it does work very well and is not too heavy like some conditioners.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair and applied the conditioner, I left the conditioner on for about 30 minutes as a deep conditioner.and</li>
            <li> less frizz, less flyaways and straight wihtout using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and shedding and my hair continues to be soft and moisturized after a blow dry and flat</li>
            <li> I washed it (bar style black soap), conditioned with Suave almond shea conditioner then COMPLETELY TOWEL DRIED her hair and applied this as a leave in plus natural oil (mixture of coconut and olive).</li>
            <li> I am a white female who highlights my naturally dark brown straight-ish hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact HEAT IS ENCOURAGED because it will infuse the keratin into your hair making it smoother and shinier not just for one wash but for the long run.</li>
            <li> unless it starts falling out , which seems to be the issue with some people judging by the reviews, i&#x27;m going to use it as long as it&#x27;s produced.</li>
            <li> on it (i love Kerastase, but it&#x27;s really expensive considering how often i wash and mess with my hair)</li>
            <li> This conditioner has done wonders for my hair,  What once was flat, dull hair has become lively and thicker.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how long I stand under the shower head rinsing this conditioner out, once I get out of the shower and dry my hair or let it air dry -  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was due to highlighting my hair or medical problems or even perhaps the conditioner I use.</li>
            <li> I have never had overly greasy hair, infact my hair is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I had been using Matrix Hydro Dry Hair mask for conditioner at $22+ a bottle, before I found this conditioner.</li>
            <li> kinda dry..</li>
            <li> I put my hair in a ponytail and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> When it was dry</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy or dry and it was so, so manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, in my case, I&#x27;d abused my hair by bleaching and coloring the heck out of it, plus the dry heat of the SW.</li>
            <li> When I dry it, it&#x27;s so manageable that I don&#x27;t even have to comb it</li>
            <li> When I dry it, it&#x27;s so manageable that I don&#x27;t even have to comb it</li>
            <li> flat.&lt;br /&gt;Another big secret, that I use with this conditioner too, that has really improved my hair quality, is \\&quot;co</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing it out the past few months and boy, it hasn&#x27;t been pretty.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh my baby-soft hair down, actually makes my hair feel and look thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> Instead, I co-washed my hair (Suave rosemary mint CONDITIONER) then applied at least a quarter-sized amount of this new Suave keratin infusion smoothing conditioner to BARELY TOWEL DRIED hair as a leave in.</li>
            <li> Suave customer care is writing responses to negative reviews on Amazon, asking people to email their corporate customer service email, saying that they \\&quot;are very concerned\\&quot;, but they don&#x27;t respond even after I have sent this complaint to their corporate email address.</li>
            <li> you have dry, frizzy or unmanageable hair, you need to try this!</li>
            <li> After a wash I always put in oil while its wet n let it dry in but its still fizzy n</li>
            <li> It tends to get very dry the longer it gets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sad this isn&#x27;t going to work out because I LOVE the way this conditioner smells! :(</li>
            <li> i have heard terrible things about all of their products and ingredients used, and been largely unimpressed with most of their stuff.</li>
            <li> After a year&#x27;s regimen of deep conditioning and strengthening via a different product line, I can&#x27;t believe that my hard work is ruined by a mystery ingredient in the Suave Smoothing Keratin Infusion conditioner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Smoothing Conditioner a month ago, desperate for something to help smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> And then I started losing my hair at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few bottles of this for my wife , and she&#x27;s simply loves it.  </li>
            <li> Ocasionally I will dye or highlight it every few months a tiny bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with frizz.  </li>
            <li> I bought a giant bottle a few months ago</li>
            <li> I recommend that everybody tries this product</li>
            <li> Being the frugal person that I am, and at $5 a bottle for a suave product, I will finish out this bottle, hoping for different results every time and having to wear my hair in a pony tail everyday to help hide the visible greasiess, but I will not purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> WITH A SINGLE USE!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight, kinky, curly hair thats always frizzy and dry..</li>
            <li> Note that even in a 4 hour keratin treatment where they use a bunch of the product on your hair, none of it is being rubbed consciously into your scalp, because this stuff is NOT good for the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you get the same (if not better) results</li>
            <li> And from the looks of other Sauve reviews on Amazon, they aren&#x27;t responding to other customer&#x27;s complaints either.</li>
            <li> I thought it was due to my birth control pills</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t put two and two together until i used some other conditioner -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Suave products for years with no problem.  </li>
            <li> It made me extremely upset</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, thin with a few thicker sections, and because I am growing it long it is pretty damaged from a lack of cutting.  </li>
            <li> worked wonders with frizz control, but I had to stop using it because I was losing an average of a handful of hair a day.</li>
            <li> and when it was dry, ran my fingers through it to break up my curls a little bit and was astonished that the frizz disappeared!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that would work on my hair, I&#x27;m serious, I moved to Florida from the West Coast Desert and my hair frizzes and tangles so easy that its been impossible to keep it long.  </li>
            <li> I even broke down and bought the Kerastase products and returned them promptly because they didn&#x27;t work and cost almost $200.  </li>
            <li> have frizzy wavy hair, and while the ponytail part is generally fine, the hair around my face generally is just so fluffy frizzy horrible and the ends are dry and static-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like an entire handful (granted I have very small hands- but still).  </li>
            <li> Frizziness isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d ever had to deal with in other climates and other types of shampoos and/or conditioners left it feeling incredibly dry, the frizz scary and my hair screaming for some help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with relaxed hair just beyond my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair and let it air dry as I watched TV, as usual.  </li>
            <li> and &#x27;slipperized&#x27; my tangled mess and allowed me to do my finger combing with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put the oil in wet like usual n when it dried, her hair had close to zero strays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year</li>
            <li> I am so thankful that I didn&#x27;t use the entire Keratin system, or I would probably be much worse off than I am already.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day, leave it in as instructed for a few minutes and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> and it never feels heavy</li>
            <li> I use this every day, leave it in as instructed for a few minutes and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> and it never feels heavy</li>
            <li> Maybe that had to do with the type of water in the SW (hard water that&#x27;s softened with sodium pellets) or the state of my hair as of today or a dozen other reasons.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried a suave product in at least 10 years but a friend with curly hair recommended this and since it was less than $4 (and I usually spend between $10 and $25 on a conditioner)</li>
            <li> Usually some of the frizz might go away</li>
            <li> I parted and braided her hair as usual.</li>
            <li> that, if not more.</li>
            <li> By week 7 the dreaded mats and tangles begin to appear which makes me anxious to apply a relaxer.</li>
            <li> It does not fit the bill!  </li>
            <li> Certainly less expensive than some other brands</li>
            <li> Sometimes it will seem lifeless and very stiff.  </li>
            <li> And the strong perfumey smell was so awful</li>
            <li> shocked that the 5 previous reviewers of this product don&#x27;t have the same complaints that I do.</li>
            <li> I finished out the bottle and bought another conditioner for 3 times the price and have a thick layer of frizz all over my head once again.  </li>
            <li> As a Caucasian woman with thick curly hair, it&#x27;s frizzy all the time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick wirey hair</li>
            <li> but at the same time angry that this product was even approved to be sold in stores causing my hair loss!</li>
            <li> I want to write this review especially for people who are getting bad results with these.</li>
            <li> The sight of it actually makes me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> for those that don&#x27;t like the heavy perfume smell, they need that perfume to make this product usable, as natural keratin smells horrific, like what your hair smells like if you go for 2 weeks without washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, I quit this stuff and within a day and my hair fall reduced at least by 60 percent, IN A DAY!</li>
            <li> (at least it is for me)!  </li>
            <li> Hated that it was falling out at an alarming rate after I started using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few months now and let me tell you, it had made my hair FALLOUT like CRAZY!</li>
            <li> This product was even worse than Pantene was.  </li>
            <li> The ends were really dried out dead and frizzy, puffing out, looking tortured and just horrible.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have very thick, corkscrew curly hair....and lots of it!</li>
            <li> thank goodness I never did the expensive keratin treatment</li>
            <li> But I was desperate when, again, I was scanning the hair aisle at Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of very expensive products on my hair &amp; none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of very expensive salon brands.  </li>
            <li> Why are all the ones that seem to work so well, so bad for your hair?</li>
            <li> but I hate breathing in that toxic smell.  </li>
            <li> and I just hate it.  </li>

            <li> I just used the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner (along with the Shampoo)and after one washing I have noticed an improvement in my hair. It feels very soft and much less frizzy. It even has a bounce to it. Suave has offered an amazing product at a very fair price. You must try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that the same or better results will be achieved with continued use. I look forward to finding out.</li>
            <li> I love this Keratin Infusion product line. As a African American women, I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product but since I had a coupon I decided to give it a try. Well, it works. I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as my own. It makes our hair soft, smooth and detangles well. The price is excellent as well.</li>
            <li> Suave hit the nail on the head! Do you want healthy hair? Then you NEED to buy this.. best Suave product that I have ever used in my entire life!</li>
            <li> I tried the conditioner, for many monthes an found out it contains achcol and it started breaking my hair if your are trying to find a cheap way to get a keritain  treatment or conditiner its not made for african american hair it leaves it soft but not made for our relaxed or natural hair</li>
            <li> First of all, I feel the need to clarify that I do not use the shampoo along with this conditioner. I have a combination of problems with my hair, so I paired this conditioner along with Herbal Essences Hello hydration shampoo. The first time I used this conditioner, I was amazed. My hair was soft and felt healthy, and my hair was extremely manageable when I went to straighten and style it. That lasted for all about 18 hours. I personally only wash my hair once every three days. (Not out of poor hygiene, because my hair is very damaged and they say its better to wash it less often to let the natural oils strengthen your hair.) Before I switched to this hair regimen, I was using wen. I never had a problem with my hair getting overly greasy. With this conditioner, I notice my hair getting greasy within twelve hours. Even if I did wash my hair every day, this would not work. I have never had overly greasy hair, infact my hair is extremely dry. I&#x27;ve tried getting by with smaller amounts of conditioner, but then it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair at all and my hair is still dry. It&#x27;s a lose/lose situation with this product. I will not continue using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion condition because about a month ago, I used the New Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 day Smoothing kit and I wanted a conditioner that would help &#x27;Maintain\\&quot; my look until the next treatment. Not much to really say about this ,except it does work very well and is not too heavy like some conditioners. It rinses away clean ,leaving my hair very soft and shiny. I also use the coordinating shampoo before and the smooth and shine serum after. I feel this product is much better than the regular Suave Professionals conditioner for dry, frizzy hair and the cost is about the same. Certainly less expensive than some other brands and you get the same (if not better) results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true!  You can find everything you seek on Amazon.com.  This conditioner has done wonders for my hair,  What once was flat, dull hair has become lively and thicker.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product and I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.  I washed my hair with Devacurl&#x27;s \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; and used this product as a leave-in conditioner.  I see a definite difference in the curl definition and my hair, which I comb with my fingers in the shower to minimize damage, was much smoother and easier to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is that it has a lot of silicone, which many consider to be damaging to natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, when the hair dries, it&#x27;s fine, but while damp, there is a greasy slickness that reminds me of the old Jheri Curls (not that I ever had one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not crazy about the smell.  It&#x27;s not awful, but there is a chemical edge to it, and it is nowhere as pleasant to apply as Devacurl One Condition or Wen Fig, my other two favorite conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep using this product and will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Smoothing Conditioner a month ago, desperate for something to help smooth my hair. I have very thick, wavy hair, which is frizzly pretty much 24/7.  I am kicking myself for not reading the online reviews for this Sauve Keratin line of products.  Immediately after applying this conditioner, my scalp started burning. I&#x27;ve never had a Keratin treatment before, or any type of coloring or highlights, so I just assumed that was normal.  Until clumps of my hair starting falling out. I immediately rinsed the conditioner out &amp; then shampooed &amp; conditioned (with a non-Suave brand of products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast foward 3 weeks, and my hair is STILL falling out by the handful. The sight of it actually makes me sick to my stomach. I am so scared that this isn&#x27;t going to stop.  My scalp is still burning as well, and there is nothing I&#x27;ve found that has helped. I&#x27;ve been to several salons, and they are all telling me that there is nothing I can do at this point to reverse the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shocked that the 5 previous reviewers of this product don&#x27;t have the same complaints that I do. Consider yourselves extremely lucky. I am so thankful that I didn&#x27;t use the entire Keratin system, or I would probably be much worse off than I am already.  If you want to keep your hair, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take my advice- Suave customer care is writing responses to negative reviews on Amazon, asking people to email their corporate customer service email, saying that they \\&quot;are very concerned\\&quot;, but they don&#x27;t respond even after I have sent this complaint to their corporate email address. And from the looks of other Sauve reviews on Amazon, they aren&#x27;t responding to other customer&#x27;s complaints either.</li>
            <li> After a week of usage, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant amount of hair on the floor from simply combing. After a year&#x27;s regimen of deep conditioning and strengthening via a different product line, I can&#x27;t believe that my hard work is ruined by a mystery ingredient in the Suave Smoothing Keratin Infusion conditioner. The remaining hair looks smooth and sleek---but the breakage is god-awful. Don&#x27;t believe I will continue to use. Will likely hand off the rest of the bottle to a Caucasian friend who will be able to use it... :)</li>
            <li> I have tried way more conditioners and hair products on my curly (3a/b), super frizzy hair than I could ever count.  I pretty much always use one bottle of something and then try something else because nothing cuts the frizz for me.  I hadn&#x27;t tried a suave product in at least 10 years but a friend with curly hair recommended this and since it was less than $4 (and I usually spend between $10 and $25 on a conditioner) I figured it was worth a try.  I will say that I had to use a TON of it to get through my hair- like an entire handful (granted I have very small hands- but still).  And the strong perfumey smell was so awful I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to use it a second time.  But I continued my hair regimen like usual (a leave in conditioner, hair serum and a light gel) and let my hair air dry.  While it was drying it looked super frizzy- maybe even a little more so than normal.  But I left it alone and when it was dry, ran my fingers through it to break up my curls a little bit and was astonished that the frizz disappeared!  Usually some of the frizz might go away but I had virtually none!  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the keratin that my hair is loving or what but even my second day hair was really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was available without the fragrance because it&#x27;s so strong that it makes me sick while I&#x27;m in the shower.  I don&#x27;t notice it much after I put my slew of other products on but I hate breathing in that toxic smell.  I finished out the bottle and bought another conditioner for 3 times the price and have a thick layer of frizz all over my head once again.  I may just start wearing a gas mask in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It smells wonderful and it works magic on my curly hair. It has great slippage and leaves my curls (3/3b) shiny and frizz free. I am actually without a halo of frizz right now (yay!). When I apply it, I can work tangles out very easily in the shower, and my hair feels light and well-conditioned with a good amount of shine to it. The price is awesome to boot. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products from drugstore to salon, and this is certainly one of the best.</li>
            <li> I purchase this not hoping for much, and I was extremely surprised.  I used both the shampoo and conditioner, and flat ironed my hair in the morning.  My hair is naturally wavy, thin with a few thicker sections, and because I am growing it long it is pretty damaged from a lack of cutting.  Ordinarily after I flat iron it, it looks all right but the ends seem a bit &#x27;puffy&#x27; and the waves general come back on my crown within a day.  Not with this!  I flat ironed it, and it looked like a professional blow out.  The waves didn&#x27;t come back like this normally do!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have very thick, corkscrew curly hair....and lots of it! It tends to get very dry the longer it gets. I noticed a vast improvement after the first use of this product. It is no longer dry, but very moisturized with no frizz. Love the scent. I was hesitant to try this as I generally think of suave as a cheap brand. Please don&#x27;t let this sway you. I&#x27;ve used a lot of very expensive products on my hair &amp; none of them worked. This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> For reference I have baby fine, long hair, which has lowlights/highlights, and it is naturally wavy. I usually blow dry it straight or let it dry naturally. I absolutely love this conditioner. I had been using Matrix Hydro Dry Hair mask for conditioner at $22+ a bottle, before I found this conditioner. I love the way it makes my hair feel softer. It also controls frizz much better than the Matrix brand I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is really pretty too and it seems to last a good while on my hair. It makes my hair super easy to comb out after washing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this conditioner again, I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight, kinky, curly hair thats always frizzy and dry.. After a wash I always put in oil while its wet n let it dry in but its still fizzy n kinda dry.. I used Tresseme curly hair shampoo n this conditioner... I put it in, combed it through, n let it set for about 5 min... I put the oil in wet like usual n when it dried, her hair had close to zero strays n it was the first time Id ever seen some shine... Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I want to write this review especially for people who are getting bad results with these. I&#x27;ve had this for almost 2 months now, and I used it daily for the first two weeks until I realized I couldn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t. At first I was getting super smooth and shiny hair, but eventually I started getting a bunch of scalp pimples all over my head. I rarely get those unless I go for a whole week without washing, but I was washing every day or every other day so it shouldn&#x27;t have been happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look up keratin, it is supposed to be a protein essential in hair and nails, but it is also the main ingredient in those super gross and smelly sebaceous cysts. Not just a pimple, but a cyst. I think it&#x27;s natural then, for some people, especially those with oil prone skin, to develop scalp problems if you use keratin shampoo on a long term daily basis. The key here is to NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE RUB THIS STUFF INTO YOUR SCALP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros to this conditioner is that if you use a heat styler, this product is super good for your hair. In fact HEAT IS ENCOURAGED because it will infuse the keratin into your hair making it smoother and shinier not just for one wash but for the long run. That is essentially what a brazilian blowout does, coat your hair in lots of keratin then run a 400F straightener over it, and results for that last around 6 months until it starts to look less perfect. Note that even in a 4 hour keratin treatment where they use a bunch of the product on your hair, none of it is being rubbed consciously into your scalp, because this stuff is NOT good for the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered that works for me is as follow: I use a good scalp shampoo, like the new Clear scalp, or head and shoulders, or neutrogena dandruff. Then I take the Clear scalp conditioner and put about a quarter sized amount just on the scalp. Then I put a huge amount of the suave keratin conditioner on all the hair that&#x27;s below the roots and make sure I get all the ends (I have a lot of hair both length and volume wise). This may sound like a lot of trouble, but it really makes a difference. Since I have so much hair, it&#x27;s also great that this stuff is so cheap. I used to be on wen, then ojon, until it became too expensive unless I skimp on the amount, but I find that being generous with a cheaper but still good conditioner is better than using just a dime sized expensive stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, this stuff will work if you use something else for your scalp, and heat is a plus. I don&#x27;t recommend the shampoo from this line, just the conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. for those that don&#x27;t like the heavy perfume smell, they need that perfume to make this product usable, as natural keratin smells horrific, like what your hair smells like if you go for 2 weeks without washing.</li>
            <li> I must say I was rather impressed with this conditioner.  I shampooed first with [[ASIN:B003P85MAM NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Dry Hair - \\&quot;EXTREME Hair\\&quot; - Unscented - 16oz. Made with USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC Soap Nuts / Soap Berries!]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since (Soap Nuts) is a sulfate free shampoo, it completely removes any &#x27;slip&#x27; from your hair so trying to detangle without a &#x27;slippery&#x27; conditioner would be a nightmare on my 4b hair.  Enter the Suave Keratin Infusion, it took charge, got in there and &#x27;slipperized&#x27; my tangled mess and allowed me to do my finger combing with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I applied the Suave Professionals Leave-in Serum, but that&#x27;s another review.  (OK, I LOVED the leave-in serum, but will write another review).</li>
            <li> UPDATE 6 14 2012. Six months later, STILL LOVING IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL POST: I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE. I&#x27;m black with relaxed hair just beyond my shoulders. I DID NOT FOLLOW PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. Instead, I co-washed my hair (Suave rosemary mint CONDITIONER) then applied at least a quarter-sized amount of this new Suave keratin infusion smoothing conditioner to BARELY TOWEL DRIED hair as a leave in. Next I applied a nickel-sized amount of natural oil to my hair (kukui nut) finished with my hand held hair dryer with large comb attachment  (Vidal-Sassoon VS783) and voila - soft, shiny, moving, STRAIGHT hair. I have more than an inch of new growth but because of this, I don&#x27;t need a touch up! Works wonders for stretching, will DEFINITELY save me money. GREAT RESULTS, like better than Wen &amp; Hair One but will rotate all to avoid build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used on virgin hair (my 1 year old), it defrizzed her hair and loosened the kink. I don&#x27;t use heat of any kind on her hair. I washed it (bar style black soap), conditioned with Suave almond shea conditioner then COMPLETELY TOWEL DRIED her hair and applied this as a leave in plus natural oil (mixture of coconut and olive). I parted and braided her hair as usual. It was soft, manageable and lays better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL WITH A SINGLE USE!! I hope to update but as of right now, so worth the money. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> So I was in the store with my hands on the keratin treatment and with all the warnings on the side I decided to try the conditioner first. Wow am I glad! I read all the horror stories about the treatment and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy it. As a Caucasian woman with thick curly hair, it&#x27;s frizzy all the time. This conditioner smells clean but the smell is very over powering even after you dry your hair...like perfume so I wouldn&#x27;t wear too much perfume. It works! my hair is full of body and hardly any frizz after the first time using the conditioner. I wonder if using the shampoo too helps even more? I highly recommend it as I have a shower full of \\&quot;anti frizz\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners that don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> So far this product had been very useful in providing smoothness and healthy looking/feeling hair. I enjoy the Suave professionals line and this is a great addition!!</li>
            <li> Wait a month or two before writing a review.  In time, you will start to go bald, like really bald. I have giant bald patches on the top of my head and I look hideous.</li>
            <li> Suave Keratin Smoothing Cond. worked wonders with frizz control, but I had to stop using it because I was losing an average of a handful of hair a day. I&#x27;m not kidding, I quit this stuff and within a day and my hair fall reduced at least by 60 percent, IN A DAY! I had to start using Fall Fight Cond. by Garnier Fructis.</li>
            <li> I find this hair product excellent. When the store is out of it or featuring a new product I order it on line. I would not change for the new product</li>
            <li> I have dry and very damaged hair from dying my hair so much,my hair was breaking off so I saw this and thought I would give it a try.I wet my hair and applied the conditioner, I left the conditioner on for about 30 minutes as a deep conditioner.and I tied a plastic bag on my head to trap in heat.After about 30 minutes I took off the plastic bag and rinsed out my hair.Then I brushed my hair out with a wire comb.My hair is super thick and wavy when it is dry, so I figured that it was best to comb it when wet.I put my hair in a ponytail and let it air dry.When it was dry and I took out the ponytail, my hair had such a great smell to it and it was so soft and mmmm I just can&#x27;t say enough about it.Perfect.Buying this conditioner from now on.</li>
            <li> I am gonna say the same thing that many others have said. I really liked this product at first. And then I started losing my hair at an alarming rate. I thought it was due to my birth control pills so I stopped them but didn&#x27;t see any improvement  I finally realized it was this conditioner. I have stopped using it but have not had my hair grow back yet.</li>
            <li> Package received in a timely manner, however, imagine my surprise when I opened it to find a two pack of shampoo instead of conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a white female who highlights my naturally dark brown straight-ish hair.  I have a fair amount of damage from color treatments, daily blow drying and styling.  This was hands down the best system I have ever used from the first shampoo.  After 2 weeks of daily use, my hair is improving and much easier to style: less frizz, less flyaways and straight wihtout using a flat iron.  I have used every other product from expensive salon brands to mega chain store best sellers, and this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> My new go to conditioner and shampoo</li>
            <li> I ordered a few bottles of this for my wife , and she&#x27;s simply loves it.  She has tried a lot many other conditioners but nothing was as good as this one she says. She has naturally curly hair and this one leaves it looking the  way it is , curly , plus shiny and feeling great. Not to mention ,it smells real nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says : Definately buying more ..and  would recommend to all with curly or wavy unmanageable hair !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leena Rubin : The leave in conditioner is  totally awesome too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have bought it locally since finding it on amazon.  I recommend this product to any one with curly or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my hair sleek and smooth.  Hated that it was falling out at an alarming rate after I started using it for a few weeks.  I&#x27;m not talking the normal 50 or so strands a day.  More like 4x that, if not more. Ugh.  Had the same problem with Pantene. Why are all the ones that seem to work so well, so bad for your hair? Having finally figured out that many others experienced balding from Pantene, I stopped, and returned to normal light hair loss. This product was even worse than Pantene was.  My shirt at the end of the day looked like I rolled on the floor of a hair salon. Today I checked the internet and found tons of others are posting about their hair loss issues with Suave Keratin.  Yep, I&#x27;m quitting this one too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jealous if any of you can use this stuff without losing your hair! Just keep in mind, if you think it&#x27;s falling out more than usual and you use this product, it probably is.  Hope this review helps save a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy wavy hair, and while the ponytail part is generally fine, the hair around my face generally is just so fluffy frizzy horrible and the ends are dry and static-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and conditioner is just amazing; it moisturizes and softens my hair, and it radically reduces my frizz issues, while also magically not making my hair limp and flat.&lt;br /&gt;Another big secret, that I use with this conditioner too, that has really improved my hair quality, is \\&quot;co-washing.\\&quot; Use conditioner first, on the ponytail part and ends of the hair mainly, and let it sit in your hair while you&#x27;re showering. Then, rinse it out, and shampoo as normal. This helps your hair get so much more moisture from the conditioner, and still allows the shampoo to remove a bit of the dulling parts of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry, frizzy or unmanageable hair, you need to try this!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that would work on my hair, I&#x27;m serious, I moved to Florida from the West Coast Desert and my hair frizzes and tangles so easy that its been impossible to keep it long.  So I have been experimenting on finding the right hair product since I moved here. I have finally found a conditioner that controls the frizz and has made my hair manageable.  I will be able to let my hair grow long again. Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;I Love this product PLEASE don&#x27;t change it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Sincerely Bernadette</li>
            <li> Keratin infused products are now becoming more popular, but I won&#x27;t bother spending more money on higher priced products when Suave&#x27;s Keratin Infusion does a beautiful job.  Not overly thick and rises away nicely.  I have this on auto-ship so I&#x27;m never without.</li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair smooth and silky when used with Pantese silky miosture whip.</li>
            <li> whilst i am all for cheap drugstore brands, i always considered Suave to be just too cheap drugstore. i have heard terrible things about all of their products and ingredients used, and been largely unimpressed with most of their stuff. however. first time i put this in my hair - and i only got it because it said \\&quot;compare to Kerastase\\&quot; on it (i love Kerastase, but it&#x27;s really expensive considering how often i wash and mess with my hair) - halfway through the day i noticed my usually flat, fine hair had more shine and bounce to it. i literally couldn&#x27;t stop touching it. i didn&#x27;t put two and two together until i used some other conditioner - actually, it was Aussie&#x27;s volumizing conditioner \\&quot;aussome volume\\&quot; (which did nothing for me, although had smashing reviews) - and found my hair flat and frizzy again. i couldn&#x27;t believe a Suave product could make my hair look and feel so amazing, so i was waiting for a catch. It never came! i think i&#x27;m going to stick to it as my go-to conditioner - it&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh my baby-soft hair down, actually makes my hair feel and look thicker and fuller. unless it starts falling out , which seems to be the issue with some people judging by the reviews, i&#x27;m going to use it as long as it&#x27;s produced. if you&#x27;re a white girl with really soft, unmanageable can&#x27;t-hold-any-shape-at-all fine hair, but lots of it, try this. i think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> With curly, sometimes frizzy hair, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a product that will eliminate the frizz.  I&#x27;ve used other Suave products for years with no problem.  After using this product, my scalp began to itch and burn, and then I developed hives all over my body, starting first with my head (scalp) and neck, and then spreading everywhere else.  There was NOTHING else new in my life - nothing new that I ate, drank, or wore and no new detergents, soap or similar items.  The ONLY new thing was this stuff.  I am now on prednisone to treat the body-wide itchy, burning hives since nothing else worked.  I have never been an allergic-to-things type of person, so I never gave any thought to using this product.  I have now read that keratin can cause allergies, so thank goodness I never did the expensive keratin treatment or I&#x27;d have had to shave my head right afterwards.  Please be careful before using - maybe a patch test first?</li>
            <li> I am a african american female who likes to stretch my relaxer application between 12 to 14 weeks. By week 7 the dreaded mats and tangles begin to appear which makes me anxious to apply a relaxer. I had tried baggying my hair and using several different products which worked to some degree.  I used this product to cowash my hair at 10 weeks post.....OMG I did not have one tangle/mat in my hair and believe me with 2 inches of new growth that is a miracle in itself. I dont know what the PH is for this product but I think it smoothes my cuticles which prevents the hair from tangeling. My 3c/4a hair was super soft and manageable. This is a holy grail product for me and I will start using it earlier in my stretch.... This conditioner was recommended on tressbuzzs&#x27; blog page and she was right one the money with this one. Love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this product it makes your hair fall out (at least it is for me)!  I&#x27;m done with it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few months now and let me tell you, it had made my hair FALLOUT like CRAZY! At first it worked well for my hair, making it shiny, smooth, and manageable. Then as I kept using it, i started noticing strands and balls of hair would fallout so easily. What made it even worse was I also used the suave keratin infusion serum, making my hair fallout even more into bits of pieces. I was literally becoming bald in the back of my head at this time. It made me extremely upset and I thought it was due to highlighting my hair or medical problems or even perhaps the conditioner I use. So I did some research and I came upon others as well who had experienced the amount of hair loss from this conditioner. I was relieved to find out the cause but at the same time angry that this product was even approved to be sold in stores causing my hair loss! So to anyone who thinks this might work well for your hair, think again and read the reviews because it&#x27;s ONLY a matter of time your hair would be SHEDDING like mine!</li>
            <li> So when I first got these products I only tried them because I saw it on a reality show that they used it on a model.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this system works great!  I have extremely thick wirey hair and it really helps get it beautifully straight shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does leave my hair smooth and soft, but if I don&#x27;t shampoo well enough before applying, my hair ends up being sticky by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t use the keratin shampoo though, so that could make a difference. I have long, thin, very straight hair with lots of breakage, so it&#x27;s a miracle when my hair actually looks smooth. Overall, this conditioner is effective (especially for the price) but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this cream rinse being so great. It does not fit the bill!  It leaves my hair greasy after a day or two! I don&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now I only use the conditioner as a co wash for my Brazilian hair weave. By far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used I co wash my weave with it once a week and it leaves the hair soft and manageable all week long. I feel as though the hydrolyzed keratin keeps the hair strong minimizing tangles, frizz as well as shedding. also if your hair is wavy it really defines the wave I love that and the dimethicone really coats the hair softening it and giving it that nice luster and sheen. salon quality at a budget price so if you don&#x27;t have this what are you waiting for? Note: I&#x27;ve never used the shampoo I don&#x27;t use shampoo too often, also I do not use this product in my natural hair mainly because I do not wash my own hair I have my stylist do it and she uses salon quality products but I&#x27;m sure it would do my natural hair just as great as my weave. I do leave out a tiny bit of my natural hair at the top when I wear weave and for the the little bit of hair that I leave out I use it to cowash and makes my leave out look just like the weave effortless blending and flowing. 28oz bottle purchased @ Wal-Mart for $5.99</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it though. To me it works like most conditioners I&#x27;ve used. For the price its a great buy.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try, not really expecting great results. During the first wash with the shampoo, I immediately noticed a difference. My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped or fragile. The conditioner made my hair feel even better after I let it sit in my hair for about three minutes. Let me tell you that my hair has never felt so soft! I didn&#x27;t put any product in my hair after I got out the shower because I wanted to see the full effects. My hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy or dry and it was so, so manageable. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and shedding and my hair continues to be soft and moisturized after a blow dry and flat ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am black with really curly hair and I love this stuff. I won&#x27;t be using any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> i have very frizzy hair and this conditioner smooths hair, leaves it shinny. Straightning is much easier. I will definitely purchase again.  Good product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a Suave user because, in the past, their products haven&#x27;t usually impressed me much. I&#x27;ve never had good or bad results. So okay, when I heard that Nicole Richie was attached to this product--I rolled my eyes and said, &#x27;Sure, whatever&#x27;. But I was desperate when, again, I was scanning the hair aisle at Target. I can&#x27;t afford high end stuff and nothing else I was buying and wasting money on was working--including Aveeno, Dove, L&#x27;Oreal and John Frieda. So there I was, and there is was this Suave product I&#x27;d dismissed but it was obscenely low priced. I thought, &#x27;What the heck, maybe just maybe...&#x27;, and fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in my case, I&#x27;d abused my hair by bleaching and coloring the heck out of it, plus the dry heat of the SW. I&#x27;ve been growing it out the past few months and boy, it hasn&#x27;t been pretty. The ends were really dried out dead and frizzy, puffing out, looking tortured and just horrible. Frizziness isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d ever had to deal with in other climates and other types of shampoos and/or conditioners left it feeling incredibly dry, the frizz scary and my hair screaming for some help. Maybe that had to do with the type of water in the SW (hard water that&#x27;s softened with sodium pellets) or the state of my hair as of today or a dozen other reasons. Who knows? All I know is that this Keratin Infusion Conditioner works and keeps my frizzy ends controlled and my hair soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use shampoo due to the type of water we have here and the use of a softener so a good conditioner is an absolute must. I&#x27;ve been using just the conditioner for about two months now and still on my first bottle. I&#x27;m continually impressed and I&#x27;m always surprised by the great, everyday results. I don&#x27;t usually blow dry or flatten my hair, which probably helps keep my hair smooth and my ends controlled so I don&#x27;t what happens if direct heat is applied. In any case, it&#x27;s so affordable. I really can&#x27;t believe how much I&#x27;d been paying for the salon version, which do work better, but are way too expensive. I use this every day, leave it in as instructed for a few minutes and rinse it out. Even when I&#x27;m rinsing it all out, even wet, my hair just FEELS so light and silky. When I dry it, it&#x27;s so manageable that I don&#x27;t even have to comb it and it never feels heavy or like I didn&#x27;t get it all out. I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in the conditioner is that strong or bat at all and people have complimented my nice smelling hair, something that rarely happens. Anyway, this is a great substitute for frizz issues or just to get that sleek, smooth look, and while not perfect, it does a solid job!salon version, which do work better, but are way too expensive.

            <li> Just for reference, in case I can relate to somebody; I&#x27;m Caucasian and I have medium-thick hair that is boob length.  My hair is naturally wavy in some places and straight in others.  I rarely use any heat on my hair, especially now because it&#x27;s summer.  Ocasionally I will dye or highlight it every few months a tiny bit but I never noticed any severe damage I can&#x27;t fix with a regular trim.  Overall I would say my hair is in pretty good shape.  I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with frizz.  My hair is naturally pretty slick.  However, I have noticed that my hair can be very brittle, especially towards the ends.  Sometimes it will seem lifeless and very stiff.  I&#x27;ve tried Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle deep conditioner because of the very high ratings,  it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a conditioner that can fix this problem and give my hair more bounce and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now  I shampoo with Tresemme&#x27;s moisturizing shampoo.  I bought a giant bottle a few months ago and I have found that it cleans my hair pretty well and smooths it while I am washing, allowing me to better scrub my scalp.  I may try a different brand of shampoo once I run out.  I wash my hair every other day and leave a conditioner in for about 10 minutes to moisturize better before rinsing.  Before purchasing this conditioner I was using one of Suave&#x27;s natural brands (the coconut one).  I like it because a big bottle was dirt cheap and I could use as much as I wanted.  The results were alright, after all I didn&#x27;t expect any spectacular results from a dollar store conditioner.  I was never a fan of very expensive salon brands.  Sure, they may work a bit better than drugstore brands,  but in my opinion it&#x27;s not worth the extra 30 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a keratin treatment off of ebay a year ago that worked wonders and lasted for about 6 months.  It transformed my hair texture completely and left my hair shiny, bouncy, and totally effortless to style.  I plan to redo thetreatment very soon.  Seeing how well keratin worked for my hair, when I was shopping I decided to give Suave&#x27;s new keratin conditioner a try, it was only a few dollars so I felt that I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I followed my regular shower routine.  My hair can be very greasy at times towards the scalp area so I always be sure to shampoo thoroughly.  After that I lathered on some of the new conditioner and I ran a comb through my hair, making sure every strand was covered.  It was then that I noticed how silky and smooth my hair felt.  The smell was also nice,  not like usual conditioner, sort of like a perfume.  I tied up my hair and waited about 10 minutes before washing out.  I always make sure I wash my hair out thoroughly to avoid build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I towel dried my hair and let it air dry as I watched TV, as usual.  I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with my hair, it smelled so nice, it was silky smooth and bouncy.  When it was finished drying I was delighted by the results, it actually calmed some of my waves down, my hair was shiny, sleek, silky, and had movement to it.  From then on my hair&#x27;s condition seemed to improve.  Every time I brush it seems more manageable and it also feels nicer to the touch.  My boyfriend barely notices when I highlight my hair and even complimented on the softness and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so amazed a cheap conditioner can give such good results far better than any professional brand I&#x27;ve used.  I will also try the serum and I will definitely be stocking up!  When I redo my keratin treatment I will be using a sulfate-free shampoo and this wonderful conditioner, I bet the results will be amazing!  I recommend that everybody tries this product and I hope you get the same results as me, every girl deserves beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I came here expecting to find all 1-star reviews and nothing positive about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I just hate it.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how long I stand under the shower head rinsing this conditioner out, once I get out of the shower and dry my hair or let it air dry -  there&#x27;s always a significant amount of greasiness to my hair that feels like product left in my hair.  The first time I used this shampoo/conditioner combo I thought it was just a fluke.. my mistake and I actually didn&#x27;t rinse it all out, but I&#x27;ve used it several times since then, rinsing and rinsing and rinsing and rinsing some more in the shower and always wind up with the same results.  Being the frugal person that I am, and at $5 a bottle for a suave product, I will finish out this bottle, hoping for different results every time and having to wear my hair in a pony tail everyday to help hide the visible greasiess, but I will not purchase it again.  I&#x27;m pretty sad this isn&#x27;t going to work out because I LOVE the way this conditioner smells! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used EVERYTHING for my long, wavy highhighted hair and this is, by far, the best product.  I used to use Sebastian Laminates religiously until they discontinued it.  I even broke down and bought the Kerastase products and returned them promptly because they didn&#x27;t work and cost almost $200.  I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for more than 4 months with no problems. It makes my hair manageable, soft and takes out the frizz consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fear is Suave will decide to discontinue it at some point as seems to be what manufacturers do with a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cheaper in town than online though.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way my hair felt after I used this conditioner - soft and healthier.  But I would say that the manly smell of this conditioner makes it a better choice for a man than for a woman.  It&#x27;s definitely not flowers and fruits and pretty things.</li>
