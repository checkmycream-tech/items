            <li>this is a great new toy and for the price i couldn&#x27;t pass up on it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>To just blame the mail carrier would be easy but the perfect condition of the envelop makes me doubt that, this was just poor follow through on the part of the shipper hobbytoolsupply.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Just as described, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>A Stainless Steel Spur should be ok to get to my home in decent condition, it is STEEL!</li>
            <li>Gotta love the old Wartenberg wheel.</li>
            <li>first timers, and was fun</li>
            <li>This is the first Wartenberg Pinwheel I&#x27;ve bought and as a beginner</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>Maybe ok for a more seasoned sub, but I am not particularly satisfied with the quality of this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what is described.</li>
            <li>I read reviews first.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp - just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Good thing there are many other choices in who I buy from, because if I see the name hobbytoolsuply next to a product I&#x27;m moving on... and I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li>I find this easy to use, clean, and less intimidating that I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>All the pins are straight and even and the seller wrapped it in some tissue to keep the pins from piercing the plastic holder it was in.</li>
            <li>Still functional and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I use this in fetish play and it is well made for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Even when used gently there is still a slight...bite to it.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, but low priced.</li>
            <li>Overall not bad at all.</li>
            <li>This was medically sealed and is very responsive to touch, meaning you can use it gently or press harder for a more intense experience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little unnerved by what many people are using this for.</li>
            <li>The points are sharp and the wheel moves freely.  </li>
            <li>Points are sharp, and pivot functions smoothly.</li>
            <li>Obviously I will have to find a more permanent holder for it, but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li>Just feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li>I used it on my girl, and it drove her wild.  </li>
            <li>How wild?  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it nicer is if it was surgical grade steel instead of stainless and if it was made in the U.S.A. instead of Pakistan.</li>
            <li>The wheel has enough play from side to side that it can jam on the axle, causing it to stop and posing a potential risk of minor injury if the spikes are accidentally dragged across skin, instead of rolling smoothly over.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>It took me two seconds to examine the spur and grasp that several of the spikes were bent, you would think at least they could do that, is this really too much to ask?!</li>
            <li>it is I was expecting it to be a little more heavy</li>
            <li>It is pretty, but the wheel catches alot, it is loose, and it isn&#x27;t as sharp as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>You can make it hurt at little or as much as you and your partner like.</li>
            <li>It gets a little hitched up when you roll it too fast.</li>

            <li> It gets a little hitched up when you roll it too fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny and got a decent weight for something so small.</li>
            <li> so it feels strange to hold, but</li>
            <li> No real complaints overall</li>
            <li> Fun but lose, the wheel wobbles from side to side making consistent pressure difficult to achieve and would make this device useless medically and acceptable for play but only in brief bursts</li>
            <li> it really gives a heightened sensation n a little pain if you press hard</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.</li>
            <li> Does what is expected</li>
            <li> When I order items from amazon or any products for home delivery I expect some rough handling throughout shipping, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t order a dozen eggs or Faberge eggs for that matter.</li>
            <li> As expected, dr recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> Besides the pulse for which it was invented, could be used along a metal ruler to perforate paper or other material</li>
            <li> Enjoy--and be careful!</li>
            <li> Weird at first.  </li>
            <li> Damn it&#x27;s sharp!  </li>
            <li> but the little sleeve the item comes in was torn apart by the sharp prongs, so find an alternative way to store.</li>
            <li> Very sharp points, like tac board tacs.....</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  </li>
            <li> very sharp.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be beat for less than $4.</li>
            <li> The wheel wobbles a little and is not as pointy as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Might be a bit delicate around the pinwheel portion, as it seems a bit loose but it works.</li>
            <li> Not a cheaply made wheel.</li>
            <li> I find it to be quit startling to feel run across various parts of my body while blindfolded.</li>
            <li> But at least it&#x27;s not from China!</li>

            <li> perfect. comes with a pouch. very pleased.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> well made tool. good buy for your money. recommend</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Everything as expected. More words now yadda yadda yadda. I dont understand why so many words are needed. But here goes....words</li>
            <li> It works ok.. If you hook up a violet wand to your self and use this it will work EVEN BETTER!!</li>
            <li> This was medically sealed and is very responsive to touch, meaning you can use it gently or press harder for a more intense experience.  This is the first Wartenberg Pinwheel I&#x27;ve bought and as a beginner I find this easy to use, clean, and less intimidating that I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Good quality, sharp points, love it!</li>
            <li> Pinwheel arrived in good condition and I bought it used. It&#x27;s shiny and got a decent weight for something so small. All the pins are straight and even and the seller wrapped it in some tissue to keep the pins from piercing the plastic holder it was in. Obviously I will have to find a more permanent holder for it, but that was to be expected. It spins freely and I see no issues with catching and dragging like one reviewer said. Looks exactly like the one in the picture. Can&#x27;t be beat for less than $4.</li>
            <li> Great for sensation play!  Alternate this with ice and then a good leather strap for some real fun!  Make you sub squirm and beg</li>
            <li> Some of the points have burs</li>
            <li> Fun but lose, the wheel wobbles from side to side making consistent pressure difficult to achieve and would make this device useless medically and acceptable for play but only in brief bursts</li>
            <li> Product arrived in very good conditions and fast.&lt;br /&gt;The qualiy is allright. It was made in Pakhistan.&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel and with pointed edges.</li>
            <li> Damn it&#x27;s sharp!  But oh so nice</li>
            <li> Very sharp points, like tac board tacs..... super fun to use!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Use it during BDSM play and it&#x27;s probably one of my favorite toys and I have converted many to adoring this. You can make it hurt at little or as much as you and your partner like.</li>
            <li> Needed some adjusting but works well as it should.</li>
            <li> I paid .69 cents for this, and its perfect for the price I paid, its sharp, rolls smoothly and is shiny. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is I was expecting it to be a little more heavy so it feels strange to hold, but thats just a personal problem. Shipping was prompt, but the packaging was a bit off. The envelope it came in was fine but the little sleeve the item comes in was torn apart by the sharp prongs, so find an alternative way to store.</li>
            <li> Besides the pulse for which it was invented, could be used along a metal ruler to perforate paper or other material</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. For the price it&#x27;s probably one of the things I like to use the most in sensual play. Functional and to the  &amp;#34;point&amp;#34; hehe :)</li>
            <li> Does what is expected</li>
            <li> Gotta have the basics!</li>
            <li> Fairly solid, but underwhelming quality.  The wheel has enough play from side to side that it can jam on the axle, causing it to stop and posing a potential risk of minor injury if the spikes are accidentally dragged across skin, instead of rolling smoothly over.  This makes it a risky choice with a nervous and easily spooked partner.  Maybe ok for a more seasoned sub, but I am not particularly satisfied with the quality of this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what is described. It&#x27;s not a bad product. Just feels a little cheap. The wheel wobbles a little and is not as pointy as others I&#x27;ve used. Still functional and delivery was fast. No real complaints overall</li>
            <li> An interesting sensation play instruments for your play partner. I find it to be quit startling to feel run across various parts of my body while blindfolded. ​</li>
            <li> Gives the pleasure/pain in the right places and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for kinky fun</li>
            <li> This was not that prickly.  I got a 5 pinwheel that is much better.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just as described.</li>
            <li> Gotta love the old Wartenberg wheel. Have had just the best time playing with this goodie. And what a price, can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price! Works great, light weight, what else can be said about it? Tests the nervous system very effectively and would be a perfect addition to the Physical Therapists arsenal of tools.</li>
            <li> When I order items from amazon or any products for home delivery I expect some rough handling throughout shipping, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t order a dozen eggs or Faberge eggs for that matter. A Stainless Steel Spur should be ok to get to my home in decent condition, it is STEEL! Well that&#x27;s not the case with the one I received, several of the spikes were bent on the wheel. To just blame the mail carrier would be easy but the perfect condition of the envelop makes me doubt that, this was just poor follow through on the part of the shipper hobbytoolsupply. It took me two seconds to examine the spur and grasp that several of the spikes were bent, you would think at least they could do that, is this really too much to ask?! Good thing there are many other choices in who I buy from, because if I see the name hobbytoolsuply next to a product I&#x27;m moving on... and I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> this is a great new toy and for the price i couldn&#x27;t pass up on it. it doesnt run as smooth as i would have liked but its still lots of fun</li>
            <li> Have some sensual fun with this!</li>
            <li> As expected, dr recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I use this in fetish play and it is well made for a reasonable price.  The points are sharp and the wheel moves freely.  Enjoy--and be careful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little unnerved by what many people are using this for. That said, for its proper use as a diagnostic tool it does the job as intended.</li>
            <li> Feels lovely is all I can say!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp - just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Great device for play!!!</li>
            <li> I read reviews first. There where some burs to contend with but easy fix. Got here in a timely manner. Was in good shape. Overall not bad at all.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive wheel, OK for the price. Functional.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> I love it. Even when used gently there is still a slight...bite to it.</li>
            <li> my Mistress and i love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sooooo much fun, a great product.</li>
            <li> Provides the requisite sensations.</li>
            <li> I love the heaviness of this item. Definitely a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> It is what it says.  Might be a bit delicate around the pinwheel portion, as it seems a bit loose but it works.</li>
            <li> Product is as described. Points are sharp, and pivot functions smoothly. Get some kind of case to protect it though.</li>
            <li> as described and on time</li>
            <li> it works perfectly well.  I am very pleased.  I&#x27;d order it again in a second.  I used it on my girl, and it drove her wild.  How wild?  Use your imagination.</li>
            <li> It is pretty, but the wheel catches alot, it is loose, and it isn&#x27;t as sharp as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just as described, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the construction of this piece. Not a cheaply made wheel.</li>
            <li> very sharp. it makes a unique tinglely feeling. first timers, and was fun</li>
            <li> This Wartenberg Pinwheel works just fine. It glides nicely and the pins are plenty pokey for whatever you&#x27;re using this for. The only thing that would make it nicer is if it was surgical grade steel instead of stainless and if it was made in the U.S.A. instead of Pakistan. But at least it&#x27;s not from China! Happy Sensations!!!</li>
            <li> Got the reaction I desired from my patients. :)</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t let her see this, or she would have never agreed to it in the bedroom.  But blindfolded and cuffed, she loved it.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but low priced. Does the job, but question longevity.</li>
            <li> The price is good for a starter peice. I do notice the warble in the wheel.  It gets a little hitched up when you roll it too fast.</li>
            <li> Great for BDSM play.....it really gives a heightened sensation n a little pain if you press hard</li>
            <li> Weird at first.  Great later</li>
            <li> HIgh quality, amazing price and quick delivery.</li>
