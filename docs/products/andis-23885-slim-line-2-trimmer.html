            <li>Used it for a trip over seas and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Works great for trimming my beard and touch up work when my fiance cuts my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great feature is you can plug it in when the charge starts to die and use it as a plug in trimmer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought for boyfriend and he has been using it - working great.  </li>
            <li>Great product works great</li>
            <li>I immediately liked it, and now after using for some time I have to say this is the best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>good value for what it costs.</li>
            <li>Good clipper i bought as a gift to my brother take on the road with him</li>
            <li>I especially love the guides curved edges as they smoothly go over my jaw/chin and don&#x27;t poke my nose when trimming my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent feel, power, smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>looked like a good buy</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like it has a lot of power, but it cuts perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how powerful this trimmer is even on battery power.</li>
            <li>If you change the blades out to better ones it trims your mustache and beard up very nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite trimmers!</li>
            <li>These are amazing trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The battery on this thing lasts forever which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice product; it does what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li>so he can have his own.</li>
            <li>Has a handy zipper bag to hold the attachments when not in use</li>
            <li>So far the blades have been performing perfectly.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice traveling trimmer with better blades installed.</li>
            <li>and I think they are generally the best trimmers in the market.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 and 5 day guards for beard trimming</li>
            <li>I love the features of this Andis.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts me two shaves and a bit more, but that includes armpits and some quality time south of the border.</li>
            <li>My favorite attachment, and i was wondering if i can buy replacements?</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime too!  </li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t imagine that anything sold as a trimmer wouldn&#x27;t be able to trim a beard.</li>
            <li>These trimmers do not cut lower than edging trimmer but are okay for traveling.</li>
            <li>These do not yank on the kids hair and leave a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li>but it is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Love it this my third one of these, they are all great</li>
            <li>Good value for a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Far superior to the many battery operated &amp;#34;cheapos&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had over the years.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, easily package for traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The guards are perfect for keeping a well-groomed goatee and the bare teeth are close-cutting but gentle.</li>
            <li>it seemed to do fine without a guard on it</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the trimmer is sleek, ergonomically designed and contoured to fit into your hand for precise control.  </li>
            <li>This is an everlasting product, have been using almost every other day and keep loving it more and more.</li>
            <li>If you use with no comb, you will not have a clean looking cut.</li>
            <li>They will keep your hair looking clean.</li>
            <li>I am not that happy with the comb selection as it does not really have any in between sizes or adjustments.  </li>
            <li>It is professional grade hair care that you should own in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good for traveling internationally.</li>
            <li>I was lucky</li>
            <li>Other than that, nice product for that quick touch up when you don&#x27;t want or have time to bring out the more powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>.. kept it&#x27;s charge whole trip!!  </li>
            <li>The blade is professional and make very smooth cuts.  </li>
            <li>Great little trimmer...</li>
            <li>I purchased this Andis trimmer and I love it and the old one went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>powerful trimmer operates with a cord or cordless as it is rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they should be more rounded like the old ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>every morning I leave the house with that fresh trim look.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than 90% of the trimmers you will find that say for professional use yet work 100% better.  </li>
            <li>but these wont give you that fresh look from the barber.</li>
            <li>If you want a fresh looking trim get the Andis edging trimmers, I have these also for use at home.</li>
            <li>I finally wore out my old beard trimmer so after a good recommendation from a friend I bought the Andis.</li>
            <li>Does a good job maintaining a tight stubble look.</li>
            <li>* Six attachment combs for 3 day, 5 day, 7 day, ¼ inch, 3/8 inch and ½ inch trimming for the latest facial styling of your beard.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I bought the Slimline 2 first</li>
            <li>Better than you could get for the same amount of money at like a Walmart or something!  </li>
            <li>I could see the quality and workmanship the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Coming from the Norelco, which always snapped out and cut me, the fine teeth on this device rarely grab any skin, and when they do there&#x27;s no bleeding and only momentary pain.</li>
            <li>The blade covers are very easy to snap on and off and cover a wide range of beard depths.  </li>
            <li>Does fine job on back of neck, but bites when used to trim a beard.  </li>
            <li>The wide range of attachments makes it easy to find just the right one.  </li>
            <li>comment I would really have is if you plan on using it for a close shave (I didn&#x27;t) it doesn&#x27;t cut real close.</li>
            <li>While the casing is plastic the feel of this trimmer is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This trimmer can be use more that just for trimming facial hair or outlining, but for complete close head</li>
            <li>This trimmer did not provide a clean cut look, even after multiple attempts.  </li>
            <li>However, if you listen to the motor upon start up, it takes a second or two before it gets up to full speed.  </li>
            <li>when check the blades you can tell that it has been used,,,,, shouldnt be selling things as new when they are not,!</li>
            <li>Under the \\&quot;Product Details\\&quot; section of the Amazon page it says \\&quot;Origin: USA\\&quot;, which was one of the main reasons I decided to buy this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it if your looking for one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But still seem to be high quality and reliable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was highly upset and had to return it.</li>
            <li>After a few months I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I feel that people always complain about a product</li>
            <li>We have gone through about 10 different styles of cordless trying to find the right ones and these are it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer in the past and I liked it so much I bought my son the same trimmer</li>
            <li>new country, which is why i ordered it.</li>
            <li>The batteries are Ni-MH for superior performance and less battery charge memory effects than other types of rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you will not believe the difference when you compare it to your old battery powered trimmers!</li>
            <li>I thought I should test it out first to know what to expect when I used it later.</li>
            <li>However, I do wish that the blades were as sharp as my Outliner II, as I can&#x27;t cut as cleanly as I do with those.</li>
            <li>The unit also feels a little cheap with its plastic exterior design.  </li>
            <li>That last thing it does very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and this particular model if you are looking for a step up from the typical consumer trimmers.</li>
            <li>this guy is selling this product as new,,, but it is not,,,,,, the box did not have a single seal,,,,,,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Designed for a professional, one overnight charge would let you use it all day long without a recharge.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t have the feel of a heavy weight or durable unit, it is does the job consistently and met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Even with the unit plugged in, it has a slow start before it reaches its full RPM&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>So I charge it up the night before and when I used it the next day, it started off cutting beautifully and all of a sudden in less than 10 mins</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t come with a plug adapter for other countries - Europe, UK , Asia.&lt;br /&gt;- Small bottle of oil that is critical to keeping it running smooth and reducing blade damage and wear.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not super high quality</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me a new charger would have cost only about $5 less with shipping than just buying a whole new trimmer, so that is why I got the new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and yet cut softly, and the wireless usage is a plus.  </li>
            <li> With proper maintenance, see this product lasting long.</li>
            <li> We will definitely be continuing to use these for a long time.</li>
            <li> The blades are stainless steel and cut extremely close with fine mesh cutting teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds a charge over long periods of time and is so portable.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how long I charged it</li>
            <li> Additionally, with no comb guide on, this does not cut very cleanly, it will leave stubble which is also disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I will say is that it seems that the plastic attachments have gotten slightly thinner and harder to put on and remove since the last one I bought.</li>
            <li> I charged it initially before using, and a few weeks later charged it again.</li>
            <li> I originally gave these clippers 3 stars but knocked it down to one since the battery failed to hold a charge after several uses.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to trim my beard without having any catch, and wow was I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was worse than useless as I spend more time cleaning it and trying to get it to work than actually getting to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was only getting a few minutes of run time before it would sputter out.</li>
            <li> Slower than expected run speed, but works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> minus charger</li>
            <li> it just jammed up and wouldn&#x27;t trim.</li>
            <li> but once i added a guard to just trim my beard the hairs just jammed in the teeth and pulled on them.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> The plastic combs are too sharp, and they irritate the skin,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because on the transformer the date code was from 2013, even though I bought them June of 2014 and the other pair August of 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great.the other day baby got in the bathroom drawer</li>
            <li> I had my previously trimmer for about 8 years until just the other day when I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday or every other day while traveling.</li>
            <li> I find that frustrating for someone with a shorter beard, i find that it can only go slightly longer or shorter</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any trouble with power at all.  </li>
            <li> Works with the cord if battery is dead</li>
            <li> and now im missing 1 of the attachments.</li>
            <li> It is no better than a $10 Wal-Mart piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained about the power, while others raved about the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> but this thing sucks.  </li>
            <li> This only got a four from me because the cord sticks out awkwardly and makes it rock in its holder.  </li>
            <li> With that said, I dont know if thick hair will choke the motor and cause it to stop.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to be a beard/goatee trimmer, not for cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> so I ignore the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> My husband hated this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality of these clippers.</li>
            <li> Horrible Customer Service through Andis!  </li>
            <li> The Blades on this trimmer are pathetic!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good value for a decent trimmer. it&#x27;s not super high quality but it is pretty good quality. good value for what it costs.</li>
            <li> Gives the best shave ever. With proper maintenance, see this product lasting long. So far the blades have been performing perfectly.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, it had mixed reviews.  Some people complained about the power, while others raved about the trimmer.  After a few months I am really pleased.  It works well and I don&#x27;t have any trouble with power at all.  Almost gave it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Good clipper i bought as a gift to my brother take on the road with him</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of people I had a trimmer that used  two AAA batteries.  It was worse than useless as I spend more time cleaning it and trying to get it to work than actually getting to use it.  I purchased this Andis trimmer and I love it and the old one went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powerful trimmer operates with a cord or cordless as it is rechargeable.  It has a T-blade designed for trimming and shaping your beard, mustache, around your ears and around your hairline.  The blades are stainless steel and cut extremely close with fine mesh cutting teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed for a professional, one overnight charge would let you use it all day long without a recharge.  For me I only need to charge it about once every two weeks.  It features a dual voltage charger for 120 and 240 VAC operation for travelers.  The batteries are Ni-MH for superior performance and less battery charge memory effects than other types of rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kit includes:&lt;br /&gt;* Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;* Trimmer stand&lt;br /&gt;* Six attachment combs for 3 day, 5 day, 7 day, ¼ inch, 3/8 inch and ½ inch trimming for the latest facial styling of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;* Dual voltage charger&lt;br /&gt;* Blade brush&lt;br /&gt;* Blade guard&lt;br /&gt;* Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the trimmer is sleek, ergonomically designed and contoured to fit into your hand for precise control.  It is professional grade hair care that you should own in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one and you will not believe the difference when you compare it to your old battery powered trimmers!</li>
            <li> Holds a charge over long periods of time and is so portable. Highly recommend purchasing.  Go out and get one!</li>
            <li> Trying to figure out the charging of this device.  LOL....new country, which is why i ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is good for traveling internationally. On the downside, the blade cannot be adjusted so you cannot trim very low. I originally gave these clippers 3 stars but knocked it down to one since the battery failed to hold a charge after several uses. Regardless of how long I charged it I was only getting a few minutes of run time before it would sputter out. I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality of these clippers.</li>
            <li> Under the \\&quot;Product Details\\&quot; section of the Amazon page it says \\&quot;Origin: USA\\&quot;, which was one of the main reasons I decided to buy this trimmer. I wanted to support American workers.  I am on the edge of returning this because of that misleading information.  It is in fact made in China.</li>
            <li> The plastic combs are too sharp, and they irritate the skin,&lt;br /&gt;they should be more rounded like the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;There is no european adaptator plug included.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for man-scaping, gets every where you want to go -- head to toe! I love the 3 and 5 day guards for beard trimming</li>
            <li> great price great product</li>
            <li> Used it for a trip over seas and it worked great. Granted it does not perform as well as an outliner trimmer but it did the job to keep me trimmed while away from the states. Would definitely recommend for international travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite trimmers!</li>
            <li> this guy is selling this product as new,,, but it is not,,,,,, the box did not have a single seal,,,,,, when check the blades you can tell that it has been used,,,,, shouldnt be selling things as new when they are not,!</li>
            <li> The battery on this thing lasts forever which is nice.  I am not that happy with the comb selection as it does not really have any in between sizes or adjustments.  Its the set sizes and you have to deal with it.  I find that frustrating for someone with a shorter beard, i find that it can only go slightly longer or shorter then I like.  Additionally, with no comb guide on, this does not cut very cleanly, it will leave stubble which is also disappointing.  If you use with no comb, you will not have a clean looking cut.</li>
            <li> Nice product; it does what it suppose to do. However, if you listen to the motor upon start up, it takes a second or two before it gets up to full speed.  With that said, I dont know if thick hair will choke the motor and cause it to stop.  Even with the unit plugged in, it has a slow start before it reaches its full RPM&#x27;s.  The unit also feels a little cheap with its plastic exterior design.  Other than that, nice product for that quick touch up when you don&#x27;t want or have time to bring out the more powerful stuff.  I keep mine on the bathroom sink next to the toothbrush and every morning I leave the house with that fresh trim look.</li>
            <li> Overal: Although it doesn&#x27;t have the feel of a heavy weight or durable unit, it is does the job consistently and met my expectations. Light weight, easily package for traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This trimmer can be use more that just for trimming facial hair or outlining, but for complete close head shaves.&lt;br /&gt;- Dual power - Cordless or Cord&lt;br /&gt;- Built to be used in Europe w/o a massive power converter.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with blade cap to protect the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t come with a plug adapter for other countries - Europe, UK , Asia.&lt;br /&gt;- Small bottle of oil that is critical to keeping it running smooth and reducing blade damage and wear.</li>
            <li> Another quality Andis quality product. Works with the cord if battery is dead which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming my beard and touch up work when my fiance cuts my hair. I especially love the guides curved edges as they smoothly go over my jaw/chin and don&#x27;t poke my nose when trimming my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature is you can plug it in when the charge starts to die and use it as a plug in trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it if your looking for one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only comment I would really have is if you plan on using it for a close shave (I didn&#x27;t) it doesn&#x27;t cut real close.</li>
            <li> Quality machine. Does a good job maintaining a tight stubble look. Slower than expected run speed, but works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> They did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard and mustache.  I love the features of this Andis.  The blades are sharp and yet cut softly, and the wireless usage is a plus.  However, I do wish that the blades were as sharp as my Outliner II, as I can&#x27;t cut as cleanly as I do with those.</li>
            <li> Coming from a decade-old Phillips Norelco flip-out razor attachment, this thing blows me away. The guards are perfect for keeping a well-groomed goatee and the bare teeth are close-cutting but gentle. The battery lasts me two shaves and a bit more, but that includes armpits and some quality time south of the border. That last thing it does very well. Coming from the Norelco, which always snapped out and cut me, the fine teeth on this device rarely grab any skin, and when they do there&#x27;s no bleeding and only momentary pain.</li>
            <li> My husband hated this. It didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as close as I thought, don&#x27;t buy if you are looking for a mini outliner.</li>
            <li> Horrible Customer Service through Andis!  I was hung up on and when I called back, they wouldn&#x27;t stand by there product after only 2 months of use. I used these for trimming my beard, not like it was used for commercial use. This is the second Andis product I bought and broke within a short time. I bought the Slimline 2 first and it stopped trimming. The motor will run and the blades move but it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything. By the way I regularly oiled them and maintained them-they were not used and abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say they have a 12 month Warranty but would not replace them. Because on the transformer the date code was from 2013, even though I bought them June of 2014 and the other pair August of 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy an Andis Product Ever Again.</li>
            <li> Very Handy Trimmer at a very Good Price</li>
            <li> Hey, iv been using this product for over 2 years 2-3 times a month. Still works great.the other day baby got in the bathroom drawer and now im missing 1 of the attachments. My favorite attachment, and i was wondering if i can buy replacements? Please help. Thanku</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in the past and I liked it so much I bought my son the same trimmer so he can have his own.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, Lots of power. Built to last.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how powerful this trimmer is even on battery power. The blade is professional and make very smooth cuts.  While the casing is plastic the feel of this trimmer is very sturdy. The blade covers are very easy to snap on and off and cover a wide range of beard depths.  I highly recommend this brand and this particular model if you are looking for a step up from the typical consumer trimmers.</li>
            <li> Excellent feel, power, smooth cut.  Far superior to the many battery operated &amp;#34;cheapos&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had over the years.  Excellent hold on the charge.</li>
            <li> Love it this my third one of these, they are all great</li>
            <li> I have had an Andis brand trimmer before and I think they are generally the best trimmers in the market. I had my previously trimmer for about 8 years until just the other day when I bought this one. The reason was I thought my trimmer had broke only to find out later that it was not the trimmer that was broke.... it was the charger!! Unfortunately for me a new charger would have cost only about $5 less with shipping than just buying a whole new trimmer, so that is why I got the new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is reliable and trims beards, mustaches, and neckline well. The only thing I will say is that it seems that the plastic attachments have gotten slightly thinner and harder to put on and remove since the last one I bought. But still seem to be high quality and reliable. The stand is a bit bulky so I don&#x27;t really use it I just place my trimmer in a draw and pull it out when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are amazing trimmers.  We just bought 3 for our children&#x27;s salon.  We have gone through about 10 different styles of cordless trying to find the right ones and these are it.  Cheaper than 90% of the trimmers you will find that say for professional use yet work 100% better.  These do not yank on the kids hair and leave a nice clean cut.  We will definitely be continuing to use these for a long time.</li>
            <li> Normally, I feel that people always complain about a product so I ignore the bad reviews.  DO NOT IGNORE THIS REVIEW!!  I don&#x27;t know if these people like don&#x27;t have facial hair or what, but this thing sucks.  It is no better than a $10 Wal-Mart piece of junk.  I was so excited to trim my beard without having any catch, and wow was I disappointed.  It took like 20 minutes to trim my beard and it ripped out probably 30 hairs.  Stay away this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Bought for boyfriend and he has been using it - working great.  We also took it on a 10day trip to France.. minus charger.. kept it&#x27;s charge whole trip!!  :)  Great little trimmer...</li>
            <li> Bought item to trim beard and back of neck. Does fine job on back of neck, but bites when used to trim a beard.  Don&#x27;t recommend using for a beard without utilizing the plastic attachments; you might get nicked enough to need a styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> This only got a four from me because the cord sticks out awkwardly and makes it rock in its holder.  Otherwise a good buy!  Better than you could get for the same amount of money at like a Walmart or something!  Free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime too!  &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> looked like a good buy but when i tried it on my beard it just jammed up and wouldn&#x27;t trim. my beard isn&#x27;t that course and i can&#x27;t imagine that anything sold as a trimmer wouldn&#x27;t be able to trim a beard. it seemed to do fine without a guard on it but once i added a guard to just trim my beard the hairs just jammed in the teeth and pulled on them.</li>
            <li> The Blades on this trimmer are pathetic! The only thing you could shave with these trimmers is peach fuzz...If you change the blades out to better ones it trims your mustache and beard up very nicely. Makes a nice traveling trimmer with better blades installed.</li>
            <li> I finally wore out my old beard trimmer so after a good recommendation from a friend I bought the Andis. I could see the quality and workmanship the first time I used it. And of course a selling point for me was that it was made in the US by Union labor.</li>
            <li> These trimmers do not cut lower than edging trimmer but are okay for traveling. They will keep your hair looking clean. I bald my head with this and trim my bread but these wont give you that fresh look from the barber. I use them everyday or every other day while traveling. If you want a fresh looking trim get the Andis edging trimmers, I have these also for use at home. I just brought this for traveling abroad.</li>
            <li> I have purchased my husband 3 tirmmers before getting this one.  The others were just not satisfactory to him.  this one fits the bill.  Has a handy zipper bag to hold the attachments when not in use so they don&#x27;t get lost.</li>
            <li> Great product works great</li>
            <li> I bought this to be a beard/goatee trimmer, not for cutting my hair. I immediately liked it, and now after using for some time I have to say this is the best trimmer I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t sound like it has a lot of power, but it cuts perfectly. I charged it initially before using, and a few weeks later charged it again. It holds a charge well, and can be used as it is plugged in being charged. The wide range of attachments makes it easy to find just the right one.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> This product has met all of my expectations. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an everlasting product, have been using almost every other day and keep loving it more and more. Wireless features is the PLUS</li>
            <li> I purchase this trimmer for my mustache and goatee.  This trimmer did not provide a clean cut look, even after multiple attempts.  Save your money and do not purchase this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I have owned!</li>
            <li> I bought the product specifically because I travelled a lot overseas and I needed a dual voltage trimmer to work with.  I received the item and kept it away for my next travel.  I was lucky I thought I should test it out first to know what to expect when I used it later. So I charge it up the night before and when I used it the next day, it started off cutting beautifully and all of a sudden in less than 10 mins it didn&#x27;t cut anymore.  It turns on and it vibrates but it does not cut anything. I was highly upset and had to return it.</li>
