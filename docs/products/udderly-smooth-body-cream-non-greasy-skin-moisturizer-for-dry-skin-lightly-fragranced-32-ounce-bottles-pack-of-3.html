            <li>THIS IS VERY VERY GOOD FOR ALL OVER YOUR BODY.</li>
            <li>Very good lotion, it helped heal my cracked hands from thyroid disease.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great...</li>
            <li>The product is great.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I made sure to stock up when I saw this awesome deal.</li>
            <li>and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS A PERFECT FIT FOR DIABETICS.</li>
            <li>They fit on these bottles perfectly</li>
            <li>Is good to use on body and feet.</li>
            <li>This cream is outstanding!</li>
            <li>perfect product, love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>(neck size 38-400) and cost about $2.50 - a much better deal than the ones sold online!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I bought a case!</li>
            <li>After buying my first bottle, I decided this was the best lotion I had ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal!</li>
            <li>So now my wife can have her own instead of me using hers.</li>
            <li>the product is very good, but you really can&#x27;t use the pump on the container.</li>
            <li>Its nice to be able to order it in 3 pack too.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cream ever!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good buy, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Thanks everybody for the great advice - this configuration is everything I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I think it depends mostly on your skin type on how the product works.</li>
            <li>I did not find this cream lubricating but sits on top of my skin like a layer.</li>
            <li>You can almost see them smile, it feels so good.  </li>
            <li>A pump dispenser would really be better for a bottle of this size (though I understand that it&#x27;s supposed to look like a milk jug, so the cap is partly for aesthetics).</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>With such a great price and reliable website, there is NOTHING you can bet it with!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Just take the lid off and enjoy a nice moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>l will keep using it forever, thank you so much for sharing this great product</li>
            <li>She used up those two bottles in about a year, and asked me to order more for her.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is still my favorite lotion, but I hope to find a formulation that is unscented like I found before.</li>
            <li>No seriously, this is great for moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>Rub this in, and they give me nice sweet milk in return.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>I liked it because it soaked in quickly and was not greasy.</li>
            <li>l really love this stuff, it makes my whole body feel so good ,l would recommend it to all my friends</li>
            <li>the free shipping makes it a better value.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my cows going around with rough chapped udders, so I buy them the best.  </li>
            <li>Fine as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>is rich, creamy, doesn&#x27;t drip or run and absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is such a great lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shortly afterwards, she raved about how much she liked this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find lotion with no fragrance, and something that absorbed well &amp; quickly without an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eventually, the bottle gets so creased from being squeezed and never returning to its original shape that it begins to crack.</li>
            <li>Ironically, the holes allow the bottle to intake air and return to its original shape but it also leaks product from the holes as you can imagine.  </li>
            <li>The 3 quarts is the most reasonable way to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no smell so that it makes it very nice to have on your hands.  </li>
            <li>Once absorbed, no residue either...</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses Udderly Smooth Body Cream Daily and finds it superior to other creams costing many times the purchase price of this product.</li>
            <li>I would say it is great for male and female use...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion because it&#x27;s very hydrating without being greasy, and the smell is light and doesn&#x27;t linger for long.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, cracked skin, if you have eczema, if you just love to be moisturized and have soft, sweet smelling skin, use udderly smooth.</li>
            <li>Only criticism: I do wish it had a pump top</li>
            <li>I first heard about Udder Cream through the People&#x27;s Pharmacy show (or book?)</li>
            <li>Love the cream but the size of the bottle is unwieldy and cream needs to be put in smaller dispensers.</li>
            <li>it is fast absorbing and non greasy with a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very smooth cream that lasts a long time and helps me fix the cracked skin that happens with my chronic condition.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this product for anyone who wants smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the fact that the product was used on cows, so looked it up and found a lot of positive reviews and comments</li>
            <li>really soothing, smells pretty neutral, really moisturizing, does what lotion should.  </li>
            <li>Easy to soak in and helps protect my hands from further damage.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>The pump bottle is probably easier, however, at this price for this much cream, I suffer.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to seep into those areas, no matter how much I apply or rub it in.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very neutral.  </li>
            <li>It is mild &amp; pleasant, not nearly as strong as some other lotions, but I prefer the ones with no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But on the plus side, as I mentioned above, it does soak it quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the cream for my dry skin but the bottles are so large that you are squeezing them alot and one cracked open.</li>
            <li>so I thought, wow, maybe I should really give this product a chance.</li>
            <li>With normal squeeze bottles, once you squeeze it, the bottle then intakes air and returns to its normal shape.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Udderly Smooth over any other lotion.</li>
            <li>It helps with my super dry skin and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this first in a smaller, hand lotion size at work.</li>
            <li>She would highly reccommend this  product to others, and will certainly purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li>This is a WONDERFUL product and a must have for the cold and dry winter weather where I live.  </li>
            <li>Second time that we purchase large supply of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little runny compared to most lotions, but you can thicken it up to whatever consistency you prefer by leaving the container open.</li>
            <li>IT KEEPS THE SKIN MOIST AND SMOOTH YEAR ROUND.</li>
            <li>The product is not heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li>Leave my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not at all sticky or oily, It just feels so natural.</li>
            <li>There is a sewers/crafters lotion that works a little better, but it is much more expensive so this is my everday hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It is very economical to purchase in bulk on Amazon and squeeze into those small containers that you can purchase at Walmart or any drugstore.</li>
            <li>Yes, that probably means you&#x27;re paying for water, but even so, three quarts for $18.60 (+ Amazon free shipping) makes this deal hard to beat.</li>
            <li>could not give it a higher score though because these milk bottle packages, while cute, are very poorly designed and it makes enjoying the product extremely difficult.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, skin allergies, and live in the desert, so this lotion is a life saver!</li>
            <li>MAKES YOUR SKIN NOT DRY.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked very long, and most were extremely greasy and messy to work with.</li>
            <li>My hands tend to dry and crack especially around the fingers, seeing I live in a desert area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always suffer from dry, allergic and sensitive skin condition.</li>
            <li>She was skeptical that the lotion would be effective in helping her dry skin while at the same time leaving no residue on her skin because she had tried so many, even really expensive lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> MAKES YOUR SKIN NOT DRY.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked very long, and most were extremely greasy and messy to work with.</li>

            <li> For years I have been plagued with dry skin and eczema on my hands and fingers that cracks and bleeds, especially along the knuckles and finger nails.</li>
            <li> Ill be checking out the beauty supply to see if I can find one to fit.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands soft and keeps them from getting dried out.  </li>
            <li> We love this lotion and use it a lot, not just for dry hands, but also before doing dirty work like gardening and car repair.</li>
            <li> I notice that is different about this lotion, unlike the other Udder Cream lotions I&#x27;ve used, is it does have a bit of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My wife has cancer and is on drugs that dry out your skin on your feet etc.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this relieves it without stinking up my life or leaving residue to rub off on everything I touch.  </li>
            <li> It is not highly fragranced either so, you can slather it on and not worry about smelling like you bathed in something</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fine as a moisturizer but I did not realize when I bought it that it contains lanolin (lanolin being the grease found in the wool of unwashed sheep) and every time I use this product I smell like a barn for a few hours.</li>
            <li> It works great! Cow is the mane I gave it. My hands tend to dry and crack especially around the fingers, seeing I live in a desert area. I found out a quart goes along way. So now my wife can have her own instead of me using hers. The 3 quarts is the most reasonable way to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> My wife has cancer and is on drugs that dry out your skin on your feet etc.  A sample of this product was included with drug from the insurance company&#x27;s mail order drug company.  We promptly ordered this giant supply from Amazon.  As a man I&#x27;m not into cream.  However, I started using this stuff.  It really works.  This particular bottle can be tough to squeeze the product out.  The pump bottle is probably easier, however, at this price for this much cream, I suffer.</li>
            <li> For my next order I will probably order a smaller sized bottle even though this is the cheapest way to buy the cream. I love the cream for my dry skin but the bottles are so large that you are squeezing them alot and one cracked open.</li>
            <li> I like the amount of  product you receive for the price and it smells really good.  The product has worked well on my hands, but other areas like my feet and legs still seem dry.  It does not seem to seep into those areas, no matter how much I apply or rub it in.  There was nothing wrong with the consistency of the lotion, it was not watery and the bottles were intact and it seems to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fantastic. For years I have been plagued with dry skin and eczema on my hands and fingers that cracks and bleeds, especially along the knuckles and finger nails. I have been to many dermatologists and have been prescribed various expensive prescriptions involving all sorts of creams and salves. Nothing worked very long, and most were extremely greasy and messy to work with. I have been using this product for over a year. Within a couple of days, it cleared up my decades long problem which made it very painful to even type. The bonus is, once you rub it in, it isn&#x27;t greasy so it doesn&#x27;t get on your keyboard, mouse, or the steering wheel of your vehicle! This cream is outstanding! It is very economical to purchase in bulk on Amazon and squeeze into those small containers that you can purchase at Walmart or any drugstore. This is my second order. My wife uses it as well!</li>
            <li> this is the best lotion i have ever found no water added and the free shipping makes it a better value.  can not be found in stores in this size and value!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A PERFECT FIT FOR DIABETICS. IT KEEPS THE SKIN MOIST AND SMOOTH YEAR ROUND. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IN THE 32 OZ BOTTLES FOR EVERY ONE.</li>
            <li> I usually squeeze a bunch of this into smaller jars and keep it around the house.... it&#x27;s great... really soothing, smells pretty neutral, really moisturizing, does what lotion should.  It feels \\&quot;simpler\\&quot; somehow... anyway, I like buying these in multi-packs, storing and doling them out as needed. This is a very good buy, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> THIS IS VERY VERY GOOD FOR ALL OVER YOUR BODY. MAKES YOUR SKIN NOT DRY.</li>
            <li> Thanks everybody for the great advice - this configuration is everything I hoped for.  I only received it yesterday and after only 1 day of use, I already see a difference.  It smells wonderful, is rich, creamy, doesn&#x27;t drip or run and absorbs very quickly.  Once absorbed, no residue either...perfect product, love it, love it, love it.  Only criticism: I do wish it had a pump top, it&#x27;s a big bottle to manage. Ill be checking out the beauty supply to see if I can find one to fit.</li>
            <li> I bought this first in a smaller, hand lotion size at work. I liked it because it soaked in quickly and was not greasy. I was intrigued by the fact that the product was used on cows, so looked it up and found a lot of positive reviews and comments so I thought, wow, maybe I should really give this product a chance. I think it depends mostly on your skin type on how the product works. My hands are really dry as I wash them constantly due to work, so this type of lotion is just not quite the ticket for dry skin I think, I.E elbows, etc. The lotion is thin and runny, so I think not really meant for elbows or feet. But on the plus side, as I mentioned above, it does soak it quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I did not find this cream lubricating but sits on top of my skin like a layer. The reviews were in favor and this swayed my decision to buy.Buy some other moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> Lots and lots for your money. We love this lotion and use it a lot, not just for dry hands, but also before doing dirty work like gardening and car repair. Two minor troubles: (1) It&#x27;s hard to dispense from the big bottle. You can pour some into those little tubs in which potato salad comes, and just dip in the tips of your fingers. (2) It&#x27;s a little runny compared to most lotions, but you can thicken it up to whatever consistency you prefer by leaving the container open. Yes, that probably means you&#x27;re paying for water, but even so, three quarts for $18.60 (+ Amazon free shipping) makes this deal hard to beat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best and Amazon has the best deal my wife and I have ever found. It works miracles for muscle pain from foot rubs to neck massages. I would suggest this product for anyone who wants smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my cows going around with rough chapped udders, so I buy them the best.  Rub this in, and they give me nice sweet milk in return.  You can almost see them smile, it feels so good.  No seriously, this is great for moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion because it&#x27;s very hydrating without being greasy, and the smell is light and doesn&#x27;t linger for long. I have very dry skin, skin allergies, and live in the desert, so this lotion is a life saver! That&#x27;s why I made sure to stock up when I saw this awesome deal. The only small gripe I have is the bottle design. A pump dispenser would really be better for a bottle of this size (though I understand that it&#x27;s supposed to look like a milk jug, so the cap is partly for aesthetics). If you want a pump for yours, go to the nearest Sally Beauty Supply and buy a gallon dispenser pump. They fit on these bottles perfectly (neck size 38-400) and cost about $2.50 - a much better deal than the ones sold online! I believe they go for about $4-6+shipping here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. This is my favorite lotion. Absolutely no smell so that it makes it very nice to have on your hands.  This is the best lotion I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used.  it is fast absorbing and non greasy with a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I use it especially on my hands every time I wash them.  It keeps my hands soft and keeps them from getting dried out.  Is good to use on body and feet.</li>
            <li> This brand of lotion is the best I have used.  It is not greasy and is easily absorbed.  It also doesn&#x27;t have any scent added.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion, it helped heal my cracked hands from thyroid disease. Initially it feels like its going to be a little greasy but it absorbs well after a few minutes. Its nice to be able to order it in 3 pack too.</li>
            <li> This is a WONDERFUL product and a must have for the cold and dry winter weather where I live.  I like the 32 oz bottles because they allow us to squeeze out just enough, and there&#x27;s no cross contamination happening.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is very solid. It helps with my super dry skin and is not greasy at all. It is not highly fragranced either so, you can slather it on and not worry about smelling like you bathed in something perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not give it a higher score though because these milk bottle packages, while cute, are very poorly designed and it makes enjoying the product extremely difficult. With normal squeeze bottles, once you squeeze it, the bottle then intakes air and returns to its normal shape.  This bottle does not do that.  You squeeze it and it remains in the squeezed position. Eventually, the bottle gets so creased from being squeezed and never returning to its original shape that it begins to crack. Every bottle I have owned (six in all I believe) has multiple holes in it now. Ironically, the holes allow the bottle to intake air and return to its original shape but it also leaks product from the holes as you can imagine.  Whoever designed these bottles needs to go back to the drawing board immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid this problem, buy the product in jars or smaller squeeze bottles.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!  I&#x27;ve always suffer from dry, allergic and sensitive skin condition. It took me a while to see it in the store with the little tube of a 2 oz. for $5.99+ tax! With such a great price and reliable website, there is NOTHING you can bet it with!!!!!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with similar condition of mine!!!! By the way, everyone at my workplace are using this lotion!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is great.  This bottle design is awful for multiple use.  The  bottle cracks in the center after squeezing it 2 or 3 times</li>
            <li> Second time that we purchase large supply of the lotion.  The product is not heavily perfumed.  The scent is very neutral.  When applied it is not sticky or greasy.  I would say it is great for male and female use...</li>
            <li> the product is very good, but you really can&#x27;t use the pump on the container. The cream is so thick that it is futile to try to pump it. Just take the lid off and enjoy a nice moisturizing cream.  Maybe thin it down a bit?</li>
            <li> best for hands or body</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked skin, if you have eczema, if you just love to be moisturized and have soft, sweet smelling skin, use udderly smooth. This stuff rocks.</li>
            <li> Very smooth cream that lasts a long time and helps me fix the cracked skin that happens with my chronic condition.</li>
            <li> I prefer a hand cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and has little scent.  I have dry skin, and this relieves it without stinking up my life or leaving residue to rub off on everything I touch.  There is a sewers/crafters lotion that works a little better, but it is much more expensive so this is my everday hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  this company also sells their cream in a tube, and that is a little thicker.  I prefer the thicker cream, but I don&#x27;t think you could get it out of a bottle.  I have both in my home.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I bought a case!</li>
            <li> l really love this stuff, it makes my whole body feel so good ,l would recommend it to all my friends&lt;br /&gt;and l will keep using it forever, thank you so much for sharing this great product</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but hate the bottle.  The plastic is so flimsy.  I recommend this lotion - but get it in the tub, not the bottle</li>
            <li> My wife uses Udderly Smooth Body Cream Daily and finds it superior to other creams costing many times the purchase price of this product. She would highly reccommend this  product to others, and will certainly purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> If you already like this lotion, this is the way to go - it was half the price that I could find it locally.  I use this all throughout the day after washing my hands numerous times (diaper changes, etc.).  Easy to soak in and helps protect my hands from further damage.</li>
            <li> This is such a great lotion.  The only one that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on my skin.  And it smeels great too!!  The three pack is the best deal.</li>
            <li> I first heard about Udder Cream through the People&#x27;s Pharmacy show (or book?) a few years ago.  After buying my first bottle, I decided this was the best lotion I had ever used.  I was pleased to find lotion with no fragrance, and something that absorbed well &amp; quickly without an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I found this 3-pack here on Amazon. An elderly relative was looking for an absorbent lotion so I gave two bottles to her and kept one for myself (she was in town for a short visit, so I wanted her to have plenty to take back with her).  She was skeptical that the lotion would be effective in helping her dry skin while at the same time leaving no residue on her skin because she had tried so many, even really expensive lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly afterwards, she raved about how much she liked this lotion.  She used up those two bottles in about a year, and asked me to order more for her. I ordered the pump tub for her this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I notice that is different about this lotion, unlike the other Udder Cream lotions I&#x27;ve used, is it does have a bit of fragrance.  It is mild &amp; pleasant, not nearly as strong as some other lotions, but I prefer the ones with no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still my favorite lotion, but I hope to find a formulation that is unscented like I found before.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and moisturized. Not at all sticky or oily, It just feels so natural. This one is definitely staying on my subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Love the cream but the size of the bottle is unwieldy and cream needs to be put in smaller dispensers.</li>
            <li> This was everything it said it would be, I am very happy. I would recommend Udderly Smooth over any other lotion.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream ever!  I Even use it for night moisturizer. It&#x27;s phenomenal!</li>
