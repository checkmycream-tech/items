            <li>These were a perfect replacement on my very old dog clipper.</li>
            <li>Glad I shopped here for the beauty supply clipper parts</li>
            <li>i am glad I didn&#x27;t need these items in a hurry.....</li>
            <li>Seems to work ok, but NOT an Oster GENUINE part as stated.</li>
            <li>The copper looking springs Keeps my clippers from running hot!  </li>
            <li>Being able to put in new points is why you pay so much for an Oster 76 when you buy it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I recieved these brushes in a very timely mannor and they were well packed!  </li>
            <li>Comes out with a dime to unscrew 2 dials left and right.</li>
            <li>Pop in the new point and spring on each side.</li>
            <li>They have made it run like new</li>
            <li>Price is resonable however, it cost almost as much to ship them as the total cost of the brush set!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. And came before the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> great product even better price</li>
            <li> Part worked great. Keep in mind they are sold in pairs, buying one means you will receive 2 brushes.</li>
            <li> Being able to put in new points is why you pay so much for an Oster 76 when you buy it. Comes out with a dime to unscrew 2 dials left and right. you may need a needle nose pliers if your old ones burned way down. Pop in the new point and spring on each side. Putting cap on as you replace. Once both sides are done you are in biz.</li>
            <li> Glad I shopped here for the beauty supply clipper parts I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Very Good deal. thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Will return again and again.&lt;br /&gt;CJS</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy to install and extends life of trimmer.  I have 3 dogs I trim and I hope the trimmer lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> These brushes look to be factory replacements and work perfectly.  Price is resonable however, it cost almost as much to ship them as the total cost of the brush set!</li>
            <li> I put these in an antique Hamilton Beach mixer (after another shop recommended this fix) they fit/worked. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Wrong brushes for the a5 thanks a lot</li>
            <li> i am glad I didn&#x27;t need these items in a hurry.....it took forever to get them. will look for another source to purchase in the future</li>
            <li> The copper looking springs Keeps my clippers from running hot!  I do about 10- 20 clipper cuts per day. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> These were a perfect replacement on my very old dog clipper. They have made it run like new so I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, but NOT an Oster GENUINE part as stated.</li>
            <li> I recieved these brushes in a very timely mannor and they were well packed!  They were just what I needed to get my clipper running again!  Thanks for being great!</li>
