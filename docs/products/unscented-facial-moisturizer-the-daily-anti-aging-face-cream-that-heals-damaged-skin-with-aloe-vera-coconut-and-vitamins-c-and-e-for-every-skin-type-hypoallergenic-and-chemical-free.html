            <li>This was a very good cream.</li>
            <li>Feels great after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I use on my hands, face and even put some on my hair when I ran out of conditioner it worked great.</li>
            <li>Great product so moist</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still an amazing and light face cream!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely into skin.</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable going to work and school without my make-up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>wonderful stuff...will be back for more</li>
            <li>Bought the blueberry lemonade deodorant first, loved it so much got the face cream, wish it smelled as good as the deodorant</li>
            <li>All natural and at a great price</li>
            <li>and I have already felt a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Even though I blended it in lightly, I found that it pulled on the skin of my face.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a year since I switched over to this cream and my face is almost acne free and my acne scars are all gone.</li>
            <li>I no longer use foundation (since my skin tone has evened out so much also with the help of this cream) and I must add that a couple of weeks ago my friend had asked me how I made my face look so dewy and nice</li>
            <li>Smells SO fresh and clean and goes on so smoothly!</li>
            <li>With this, my skin has stayed consistently hydrated, without breaking out too which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>It just feels good for my skin and actually has reduced fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I particularly like that it has healthy ingredients that I can pronounce.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have also developed scalp psoriasis this past year, which I generously apply this cream to prevent or lessen a flare up (which is awesome since I don&#x27;t want to mix creams on my scalp line).</li>
            <li>Very creamy!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - very gentle and not very oily at all. : )</li>
            <li>so my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I really wished that this would&#x27;ve worked for my face,but instead it really broke me out;(</li>
            <li>For the first time in a long time, I can honestly say I can see a difference after several months of using this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>AND, its natural!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really soft!</li>
            <li>My face is almost clear (with the exemption of one or two pimples that show up with my cycle, which is super minimal).</li>
            <li>It just left a layer of grease on the top, no matter how little I used.</li>
            <li>There are many oils used for this one, it did come solid, but know that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and it is VERY dry here, especially during the winters.</li>

            <li> Exactly as described - very gentle and not very oily at all. : )</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer after I did the &amp;#34;vanilla coffee&amp;#34; face scrub offered by the same line and I have already felt a HUGE difference in my skin. I live in Colorado and it is VERY dry here, especially during the winters. Some days my skin is so dry and flaky (no mater what moisturizer I use) that it becomes unbearable. If I use a heavier moisturizer, I break out..so my skin is super sensitive. With this, my skin has stayed consistently hydrated, without breaking out too which is a huge plus! AND, its natural! There are many oils used for this one, it did come solid, but know that a little goes a long way! Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Bought the blueberry lemonade deodorant first, loved it so much got the face cream, wish it smelled as good as the deodorant but it&#x27;s still an amazing and light face cream!! Loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It is not oil despite it&#x27;s oil based ingredients. Very creamy! Will buy again! I use on my hands as well.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this cream. I have very dry skin, but it was not absorbed into my skin. It just left a layer of grease on the top, no matter how little I used. Even though I blended it in lightly, I found that it pulled on the skin of my face. I plan to use it as a hand cream.</li>
            <li> I use this cream everyday, twice a day. I used to have horrible acne on my cheeks along with acne scars. It hasn&#x27;t been a year since I switched over to this cream and my face is almost acne free and my acne scars are all gone. I feel very comfortable going to work and school without my make-up. I highly recommend this cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve have used this cream 3 years now. I tried multiple face washes and makeup that advertised that it would help with acne prevention and help with acne scars. They didn&#x27;t work well with me, but this cream did. I randomly found this cream while searching the internet and I&#x27;m glad I did. My face is almost clear (with the exemption of one or two pimples that show up with my cycle, which is super minimal). I have also developed scalp psoriasis this past year, which I generously apply this cream to prevent or lessen a flare up (which is awesome since I don&#x27;t want to mix creams on my scalp line). I apply this cream every morning and night to my face after I wash my face with water. I no longer use foundation (since my skin tone has evened out so much also with the help of this cream) and I must add that a couple of weeks ago my friend had asked me how I made my face look so dewy and nice, I responded that it was this cream and not makeup. I&#x27;ve added a before and after pictures (I had to get my before picture from a video since I didn&#x27;t take side pictures); I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup on either picture. I&#x27;m going to keep buying this cream for years and years to come &amp;#60;3 ^-^</li>
            <li> Has a smell and I thought I ordered unscented</li>
            <li> It work well around my eyes, I was having a really, really dry parts around my eyes and after two days was gone. Did not work well on my face.</li>
            <li> I really wished that this would&#x27;ve worked for my face,but instead it really broke me out;(</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!  For the first time in a long time, I can honestly say I can see a difference after several months of using this product.  It just feels good for my skin and actually has reduced fine lines.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it does make a difference.  I particularly like that it has healthy ingredients that I can pronounce.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Smells SO fresh and clean and goes on so smoothly! So happy I found this!</li>
            <li> Feels great after shaving.  Only a tiny dab is necessary.  The faint scent is quite acceptable and disappears shortly.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really soft! Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful consistency and helps with any dryness. I use it at night and sometimes a little under make up if my skin seems drier than normal. It&#x27;s not at all greasy and heavy. Love it!</li>
            <li> This was a very good cream. It absorbs nicely into skin. I have rosacea and very sensitive skin and I felt no irritation or increase in redness. It did not clog my pores. I like to put on a a thin layer of rosehip seed oil then put on this cream  to help reduce my redness over the cheeks. I use on my hands, face and even put some on my hair when I ran out of conditioner it worked great. All natural and at a great price</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin you shouldn&#x27;t use this one</li>
            <li> wonderful stuff...will be back for more</li>
            <li> Great product so moist</li>
