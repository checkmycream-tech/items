            <li>A nice massanger for the price.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It makes the massage after applying the anti-cellulite cream more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The nine metal rollers glide smoothly along your back and honestly feels great.</li>
            <li>would be a great product if it wasn&#x27;t made from such cheap material!</li>
            <li>Great and fun toy to help massage without putting too much strain on your hands.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It also still has a strong offensive plastic like odor.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell, and does not relieve my muscle ache</li>
            <li>Roller beads work fine.</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic massager for my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>It is also great for overall massage and helps me relieve knots in my husband&#x27;s shoulders.</li>
            <li>Very good results from such an inexpensive product, pretty darn soothing.  </li>
            <li>Worth it to buy it!</li>
            <li>This has been used on children with special needs.</li>
            <li>I know in Japan there are rolling Stones made of special magnetic stones while this one is made of metal balls.</li>
            <li>it also arrived days earlier than posted which is always good.</li>
            <li>I keep this one in the office as a quick fix me up.  </li>
            <li>It came super quick too.</li>
            <li>Pregnant wife loves it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect massage tool, takes all of the work out of your hands, and you never get tired.</li>
            <li>You could either your fingers or a cloth of some kind and just run it back and forth to heat up the rollers.</li>
            <li>They become warm in short.</li>
            <li>Slow shipping but great product</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and massages your body.</li>
            <li>Has the strong odor (same smell like the one I bought from cvs) which will go away after wash and outdoor drying.</li>
            <li>and my hand was too large for the glove</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy and acts as a great tool to massage some of the kinks along your back.</li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>But, you must be gentle, of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than the store&amp;#34;Relax</li>
            <li>Use gently.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The glove is great for tight muscles, particularly in the neck and back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very awkard piece of equipment which I have decided is not worth the aggravation.</li>

            <li> The metal rollers can get rather cold if you haven&#x27;t use it for a while, so if you don&#x27;t want a sudden cold chill hitting your back, it&#x27;s important to warm it up.</li>

            <li> the average american physique.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my shin muscle which needs TLC and is often hard and sensitive to touch.</li>

            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like us that when you use massage oil, some gunk (mix of dead cells with oil) accumulates between the metal balls and the prongs that hold them.</li>

            <li> Not very good , not worth bying</li>
            <li> It is stiff and hard to bend or use--the areas for your fingers keep your hand in an awkward position that is truly uncomfortable--the glove size is made for a small sized person and certainly not a 5ft 4 inch female to use--not made to  </li>
            <li> Has a plastic like smell and feel to it but works as described if you can get past that.</li>

            <li> Fast service.  The glove is great for tight muscles, particularly in the neck and back.</li>
            <li> I have two of these, and use them on my husbands back every morning when we awake. It&#x27;s the perfect massage tool, takes all of the work out of your hands, and you never get tired.</li>
            <li> The plastic smells really strong!! would be a great product if it wasn&#x27;t made from such cheap material!</li>
            <li> This has been used on children with special needs. The sensory factor calms and relaxes these children. It is WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> Great and fun toy to help massage without putting too much strain on your hands.</li>
            <li> The merchandise has arrived earlier than the expected date. Has the strong odor (same smell like the one I bought from cvs) which will go away after wash and outdoor drying. It works!</li>
            <li> Slow shipping but great product</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. Does not properly fit my hand and it&#x27;s stiff and difficult to manipulate. After a few minutes of trying to manipulate this massager my hands actually hurt. It&#x27;s just a very awkard piece of equipment which I have decided is not worth the aggravation. It also still has a strong offensive plastic like odor. Would not recommend nor purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great! My mom loves it.</li>
            <li> My neck has been killing me.  I have 3 types of  electric massagers at home. I keep this one in the office as a quick fix me up.  I have to sit through  5-6 meetings regularly every day.</li>
            <li> good for the head massage for me. (headache)</li>
            <li> Works great and I even use it on the dogs and they love it too!</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic massager for my arms and legs. I don&#x27;t use it for cellulite, but for fibromyalgia and it works great. Awesome value too. It came super quick too. Love it!</li>
            <li> A nice massanger for the price. It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy and acts as a great tool to massage some of the kinks along your back. The nine metal rollers glide smoothly along your back and honestly feels great. The metal rollers can get rather cold if you haven&#x27;t use it for a while, so if you don&#x27;t want a sudden cold chill hitting your back, it&#x27;s important to warm it up. You could either your fingers or a cloth of some kind and just run it back and forth to heat up the rollers.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my arthritic dog. He loves it. But, you must be gentle, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my horse to stimulate his muscles and help relax him as he can be a handful! He likes it, too.</li>
            <li> I am a therapist and this has been such an adjunct to my profession. It&#x27;s much cheaper than the store&amp;#34;Relax the Back&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I would def recommend this product !</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this</li>
            <li> Great massage tool. I find it to be very effective for anti cellulite massage. The only thing I don&#x27;t like us that when you use massage oil, some gunk (mix of dead cells with oil) accumulates between the metal balls and the prongs that hold them.</li>
            <li> Not very good , not worth bying</li>
            <li> Has a plastic like smell and feel to it but works as described if you can get past that.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase!! Great item- you won&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this!</li>
            <li> Really a good thing. You can feel the effects after 3 to 4 minutes of message.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed. Works miracles!!</li>
            <li> Stiff plastic smells really bad. Roller beads work fine.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, and does not relieve my muscle ache</li>
            <li> does the job and feels great!</li>

It is heavy and sturdy and seems like it will last. It is also great for overall massage and helps me relieve knots in my husband&#x27;s shoulders.</li>
            <li> Use gently. Avoid bony areas!</li>
            <li> Amazing..! very good.. Easy to use. A+</li>
            <li> It is stiff and hard to bend or use--the areas for your fingers keep your hand in an awkward position that is truly uncomfortable--the glove size is made for a small sized person and certainly not a 5ft 4 inch female to use--not made to  the average american physique. I am average height and weight and my hand was too large for the glove so you cannot grip it as you are suppose to.  Useless.</li>
            <li> The best non-mechanical hand massager I have ever bought.  I use it to massage my achy knees and sore ankle I turned years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a valuable massage tool.  Good quality. Good price. Worth it to buy it!</li>
            <li> Loved this massager. the rollers on it feel good it. it fits the hand perfect. it also arrived days earlier than posted which is always good. thanks</li>
            <li> Not perfect cod I know in Japan there are rolling Stones made of special magnetic stones while this one is made of metal balls. I am satisfied with the product. It makes the massage after applying the anti-cellulite cream more enjoyable. I do not mind the coolness of the balls cos I use it @ home, and I always set room temp at 72. Besides, once rolling on the skin, the balls adjust to my body temp. They become warm in short. As to the plastic smell, it&#x27;s acceptable to me, milder than some of the pungent massaging oil in SPA shop. Oh, about the size that I saw some complaint. I usu. wear small size kitchen glove, and this massage glove fits me well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and massages your body. I use it with my daily lotion. The rollers can be cold on occasion!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my children, they didn&#x27;t understand it until they tried it.... on me. LOL LOL&lt;br /&gt;It feels amazing! lol</li>
            <li> Pregnant wife loves it</li>
            <li> Very good results from such an inexpensive product, pretty darn soothing.  Ideally you&#x27;ll need a partner, buy two and if you can&#x27;t use both at once give one away, it will get used.</li>
