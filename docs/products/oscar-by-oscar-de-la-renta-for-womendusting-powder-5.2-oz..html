            <li>It smells gorgeous and the container is nice.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It smells so amazing</li>
            <li>its that nice.  </li>
            <li>Plan on making my own version.</li>
            <li>The aroma is delightful and the softness of the powder baby soft.  </li>
            <li>The container it came in was first class and it will look great on her counter.</li>
            <li>goes on very lightly.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>and she is in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li>It has been her favorite for more than I can remember.</li>
            <li>I love the box, i love the poof and the gauze divider.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely way to end a shower.  </li>
            <li>I love the way she smells when she wears it too.</li>
            <li>I have tried many Oscar de la Renta products, but not the dusting powder.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Great for all women after bath...lite fragrance very silky.</li>
            <li>was especially pretty.  </li>
            <li>chose this product because I love it, it is not overpowering</li>
            <li>After a nice relaxing bath it is wonderful to be able to put on a great smelling dusting powder that seems like a real smell and not come sort of chemically created sharp smell as so many of the star&#x27;s named fragrances seem to be these days.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell and people who I have been around who have perfume allergies tell me that it does not bother them.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely fragrance and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Product was in great shape in a sealed box, no different than the department store!  </li>
            <li>And box seems was opened before, there wasnt original packing tape....</li>
            <li>I always feel special when wearing it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell absolutely TDF, the container is beautiful too.  </li>
            <li>Vendor was out of the 5.3 oz powder and wound up sending two 3.5 oz containers - they sent more than ordered and that&#x27;s appreciated....</li>
            <li>Great Christmas present for the woman who knows exactly what she wants.  </li>
            <li>I do not smell very much but other people have told me that i smell very nice.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The texture of the powder is fine and easy to apply and keeps the body dry in those areas that have a tendency to be too moist.</li>
            <li>and you just want to give something different and elegant.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>AND IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME.</li>
            <li>tHE SCENT IS JUST ENOUGH TO BE ENJOYABLE WITHOUT BEING OVER POWERING.</li>
            <li>The fantastic aroma of the talc lasts longer than less costly powders, which, to me, makes it more affordable than you think.  </li>
            <li>My 89 year old mother feels special when using this product after her shower.  </li>
            <li>NO, it is not old smelling but elegant and fem.  </li>
            <li>I love the Oscar De La Renta dusting powder and have for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is very pricy</li>
            <li>and you do not get much, but she does add some corn starch to it so it lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with the service...</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li>At first, when I learned the cost, it seemed pretty prohibitive, but even though I used it daily, it lasted for five years, which made it worth it.  </li>
            <li>Dusting powder arrive in three business days using standard shipping (shipping was free).  </li>
            <li>It would have 5 stars if it were a little cheaper or came with more powder.</li>
            <li>The scent will be a new one for me</li>
            <li>so not sure if I will love it once it&#x27;s used</li>
            <li>but so far I do like it.  </li>
            <li>I usually mix my dusting powder with a little cosmetic clay and arrow root powder in the summer for better absorbing power.</li>

            <li> Oscar de la Renta perfumed body powder is excellent in quality and perfume. It has a fragrance that is always pleasing and never overpowering. The texture of the powder is fine and easy to apply and keeps the body dry in those areas that have a tendency to be too moist. The product is hard to find, except during the Christmas season, in retail outlets, and supplies are limited, with resulting price increases.An online source is most helpful and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  Oscar by his name alone should tell you this is a superior product.  My Mother used this scented dusting powder for years and I always loved it.  Now I use it and NO, it is not old smelling but elegant and fem.  Not only does it smell absolutely TDF, the container is beautiful too.  You can leave it out on your vanity . . . its that nice.  This is an excellent and thoughtful gift for a girlfriend.  Especially one that is picky and has everything and you just want to give something different and elegant.  So when you order one for them, get one for yourself too!  I PROMISE . . . YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I get this gift for my grandmother almost every year.  It is very pricy and you do not get much, but she does add some corn starch to it so it lasts longer.  It smells so amazing and she is in love with the smell.  It would have 5 stars if it were a little cheaper or came with more powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this powder for years as my mothers christmas, birthday ect. at a&lt;br /&gt;local retail shop in the mall. Boy have I been getting ripped off. I can get TWO 5.3 oz&lt;br /&gt;powders for the price of 1 of theirs. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t check on amazon sooner.&lt;br /&gt;This powder smells wonderful, and my mother has swore by it for years. It comes in the&lt;br /&gt;perfect square box to wrap too! Will be buying again, and again, and again.</li>
            <li> this powder came open with a pink spots all on the powder I sent it back I will never ordered this again</li>
            <li> Found this at the mall, looking for a Christmas gift for my grandma. Didn&#x27;t want to spend the amount that they were charging. Found it here for almost half price.</li>
            <li> My wife has worn Oscar for years.  Smells great and she likes the feel of it on her. The dusting powder keeps her dry even on humid summer days.  I associate the smell with her, always thinking of her wherever I smell it.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with the service... The product case was broken, scratched.... And box seems was opened before, there wasnt original packing tape....</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oscar De La Renta talc for about ten years.  I received it as a gift.
