    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>A manual abrasion board works just as good.</li>
            <li>i thought that when i brought this it would be good</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Deliver by seller was on time and good just wish product was as good</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t like going to the beuty and make line till the person is going to remove your skin is done with someone else, then this is for you, easy to use and very good results.</li>
            <li>I could have done better with just a pumice stick.</li>
            <li>no amount of pressure against the foot can be applied so you basically have to hover it over the foot as it lightly touches it because otherwise it will not rotate.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using it though.</li>
            <li>It came her was excited it was a &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to do any good.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if they developed this item themselves or let someone pitch it to them and did not oversee the quality of the item while in mass production, but I think it would best suit Dr. Scholl&#x27;s if they pull this item and stop production of it until they get it right.</li>
            <li>The motor is no where near strong enough or it needs to allow for more voltage because even the slightest pressure stops the motor.</li>
            <li>I began using it exactly as the instructions directed.  </li>
            <li>Ok i so wish I would have read the reviews prior to ordering.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my feet.  </li>
            <li>Nothing, really.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use pressure with it, and it does not remove dead skin like I would have liked it to.  </li>
            <li>&quot; it would be as good, if not better!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Rough Skin Remover over the others made available on this site because it is a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>its cheaply made and entices 1 to spend money and is not useful.</li>
            <li>how much ot will actually scrape off.</li>
            <li>Tried 4-5 different sets of brand new batteries with no change.</li>
            <li>not what I expected, not enough energy, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li>This product does not perform very well as for removing rough skin.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> no power on motor is a joke .never see a product so bad I fill robed wy sell some thing that no work at all....luis</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it does what it says it does.  It does buff - but over time.  You can&#x27;t use pressure with it, and it does not remove dead skin like I would have liked it to.  For the price, it still fails.  I could have done better with just a pumice stick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Rough Skin Remover over the others made available on this site because it is a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s product. However, I found out upon using it today that the name means nothing when it comes to performance because it has left me annoyed and completely dissatisfied.  It stops and starts, no amount of pressure against the foot can be applied so you basically have to hover it over the foot as it lightly touches it because otherwise it will not rotate. The overall outcome of the condition of my skin is not what it should be. I&#x27;m just unhappy with this product.  ALSO, after about 5 minutes of use, it overheats and has to be turned off. It amazes me how this item is so unworthy of a national brand label. Not sure if they developed this item themselves or let someone pitch it to them and did not oversee the quality of the item while in mass production, but I think it would best suit Dr. Scholl&#x27;s if they pull this item and stop production of it until they get it right.</li>
            <li> Dr Scholl&#x27;s Rough Skin Remover Kit is a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is so weak that as soon as it touches your skin it stops spinning.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li> 2double aa batteries but it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to do any good.  skip this product. its cheaply made and entices 1 to spend money and is not useful.</li>
            <li> I wasinitially looking at the PediSpin I&#x27;d seen on TV, but when I saw Dr. Scholls made a similar product, I \\&quot;assumed\\&quot; it would be as good, if not better!  WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.  I began using it exactly as the instructions directed.  When I got the thing on my feet, it would stall.  I could not move it around, it would stall.  It did absolutely nothing for my feet.  Nothing, really.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this item. It simply did not fullfill expectations. I took for granted that the brand &amp;#34;Dr Scholls&amp;#34; always stands for excellence. Not this one.</li>
            <li> The motor is no where near strong enough or it needs to allow for more voltage because even the slightest pressure stops the motor.</li>
            <li> This product does not perform very well as for removing rough skin.  A manual abrasion board works just as good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and lets just say, it is not for people with calluses or rough feet!!!  I didn&#x27;t like this product so I bought a pedegg and it worked!!</li>
            <li> not what I expected, not enough energy, even with fresh batteries. the one attachment with a smoothing stone, was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of crap, its not worth wasting your money on. i thought that when i brought this it would be good but when i got it and wanted to use it, it did nothing for my feet at all.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t like going to the beuty and make line till the person is going to remove your skin is done with someone else, then this is for you, easy to use and very good results.</li>
            <li> This product died on me two days after I got it. It does not work either. It does not get rid of any dead skin. I regret buying this and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> it does not work at its tell you it does, for me its something i should not have bought. sucks</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Not very fast though and therefore your limited to how much ot will actually scrape off. Enjoy using it though.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, doesn&#x27;t have any power to work well. Would not recommend to any of my friends or anyone. Deliver by seller was on time and good just wish product was as good</li>
            <li> This item broke the week I tried to use it. It was not powerful enough to do the job. I think I will stick to a manual file.</li>
            <li> Ok i so wish I would have read the reviews prior to ordering. This thing does not work at all. Soon as you put it on your foot the rotation stops.... and when I  received my package the stone rotator is broke.  I may as well just throw it in the trash. All it will do is take up space ... What a disapointment for Dr. Scholls.....</li>
            <li> It came her was excited it was a &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; item. tried to turn it on and nothing. Tried 4-5 different sets of brand new batteries with no change. Pumice stone was broken off the wheel.</li>
