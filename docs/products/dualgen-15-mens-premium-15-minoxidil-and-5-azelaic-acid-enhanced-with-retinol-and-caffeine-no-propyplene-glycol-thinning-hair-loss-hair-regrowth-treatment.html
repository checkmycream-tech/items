            <li>Now I have found this wonderful company and product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m one of you all best customers,shame!</li>
            <li>Excellent Product!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>amazing  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Minoxidil 5% foam for more than a year and did not get any good result, to the contrary, my hair loss increased a lot</li>
            <li>, this is like a kind of miracle.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like a donut hole.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Rogaine or Costco or CVS brand minoxidil works better.</li>
            <li>, what more could you ask for from a company,</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The problem is that when it stays on for more than a day it changes your hair color to gray.</li>
            <li>could cause more baldness</li>
            <li>I bought it some time ago and I am so satisfied I have also recemmended it to some friends.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who is thinking about trying it, you have nothing to lose, also customer service at minoxidilmax is top notch.</li>
            <li>Communication, customer services and quick delivery are top standards!</li>
            <li>The Dualgen 15 No PG has worked out great for me so far!  </li>
            <li>The customer service is superb, shipping is quick, and the minoxidil solution has offered personal results that I haven&#x27;t seen with 5% solutions.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling like straw, brittle, smells like alcohol way strong, and doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li>This is a worthy product from a notable seller.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I bought this because the one with PG was giving me excruciating headaches within 2 minutes on the very first day.  </li>
            <li>Exellent price and fabulous costomer service.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>I dipped it in a qtip lightly and coated this 3/4 inch oval on each side.  </li>
            <li>,I have never had a company follow up with their customers so fast, to make sure that you are satisfied with their produts and their produt</li>
            <li>Lee&#x27;s formulae at a high cost but really liked his product.</li>
            <li>I also take lots of clean fish oils.</li>
            <li>i should have been told ,the solution dualgen15 was not the right solution for any woman to use ,for to strong ,15% minoxiodil &amp;5%azelaic acid should have been a lower percentage for a woman to use it should have been 2% minoxidil &amp; 5% azelaic acid</li>
            <li>Quick response.</li>
            <li>actually you won&#x27;t notice the difference until it pass one month from using this product but you will notice that your scalp get more healthy than ever.  </li>
            <li>I started using the Dualgen 15% minoxidil with 5% azelaic acid several months ago &amp; have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts, but now, after four months of uninterrupted use I just have to say this product is really incredible because my hair is growing back again</li>
            <li>and I use the product more frequently.  </li>
            <li>and I do think that its a good product , but it should be used with products like provillus or some other supplement .</li>
            <li>Thanks MinoxidilMax!</li>
            <li>it is good product and it also works in few weeks, i will keep use it.</li>
            <li>The 15% minoxidil and 5% azeliac acid combo is super high power for a needy follicle.</li>
            <li>My hair has already started to thicken, &amp; its pretty exciting to see the new hairs popping up all over the scalp.</li>
            <li>actually my father is a bold man and our boldness is genetic but this product can make miracles believe me !  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The product is high quality and it worked for me!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I just waited to use this product \\&quot;fast shipping\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>So I can say this is absolutely attrituable to this product</li>
            <li>and i must say it really works.</li>
            <li>It definitely works better the lower concentration ones, I have been using minoxidil %5 for years it always works for me until recently it seems to stop working</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I initially had very good results with the regular minox for the first 4-5 years, so hopefully I can get at least another 5 years or so with this product, heh, at least until something better comes out.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very rapidly and professionally packed.  </li>
            <li>,i bought this product and wasted my money,i should have been warned about this product.it&#x27;s really for men only product!you all is dis honest to me</li>
            <li>The dermatologist examined with microscope and said it was normal DHT from aging that caused it.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to apply, has basically no smell, and my hair loss has definitely slowed down and pretty much stopped since i have been using it.</li>
            <li>I began thinning in my early 20&#x27;s and by 25 was shaving my head (which, I didn&#x27;t mind so much but wasn&#x27;t completely doing so by preference).  </li>
            <li>now I got the higher concentration and I back to track</li>
            <li>The Azelaic Acid is a theoretical DHT inhibitor (testosterone conversion to DHT production is the absolute cause of the hair follicle demise....</li>
            <li>Believe or not I am 45 years old and never thought I would recover my hair or part of it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old man,  I\\&quot;ve been off of propecia for over a year and started using DualGen 15 (DualGen 5 in the mornings)  on 3.19.11</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t reached the point where it stops completely</li>
            <li>This product, Dualgen15, is so gentle on my scalp and dries quickly with very little residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this new one 3 times, like a Sunday, Tuesday and Friday morning so far this week once each of those 3 days.    </li>
            <li>so now I kind of have a round patch of hair on one side thats hollow in the middle.</li>
            <li>aka hair loss), and combined with the 15% minoxidil mixture, the solution offers the possibility of solid regrowth .  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve used this product (in combination with additional regrowth methods) and am receiving results that I have not had in the past using other regrowth combinations (I&#x27;ve used this 15% solution for roughly 5-6 months).  </li>
            <li>now a little over 2 months later theres a large crop of smaller hairs coming in,  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> now a little over 2 months later theres a large crop of smaller hairs coming in,  </li>
            <li> but the only thing is price a little bit high.</li>
            <li> , my only complaint about it is it does not work that much faster, and it drys out you hair and scalp</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting close to empty on my current one.  </li>
            <li> It will give u dry scalp too.</li>
            <li> There is no propylene glycol, true, but they replaced it with glycerin and it makes the thing even worse!</li>
            <li> and they seams get less result since they have use it for only three weeks.</li>
            <li> There is a thickening of hair along the hairline and a beginning of increased thickness along the center of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Extremely managable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other 15% solutions, and this is the one I choose by preference.  </li>
            <li> however it needs at least 6 months of continous use to see   obvious results.</li>
            <li> So far the hair loss has decreased and I noticed it being thicker.</li>
            <li> almost like I have a second canopy-if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed alot less shedding as well.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5% minoxidil for years with little or no results.</li>
            <li> and I can say that one part on one side has edges that have caught up to the length of the rest of my hair, despite being bald everyday for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> It seems to help slow down fallout.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> IS VERY DANGEROUS AND CAN LOWER YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE TO SERIOUS AND DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS--CAUSING FAINTING, ORGAN FAILURE, HEART FAILURE, BLURRED VISION SICKNESS AND DEATH.    </li>
            <li> I started with the rip-off stuff in the stores, moved on to Dr.</li>

            <li> THIS SHOULD BE BANNED FROM BEING SOLD ON AMAZON!  THE FDA ONLY ALLOWS MINOXIDIL TO BE SOLD AT 5% STRENGTH IN US STORES FOR A REASON. CHECK FOR YOURSELF!  DUMPING 10 or 15% STRENGTH MINOXIDIL ON YOUR HEAD IS VERY DANGEROUS AND CAN LOWER YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE TO SERIOUS AND DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS--CAUSING FAINTING, ORGAN FAILURE, HEART FAILURE, BLURRED VISION SICKNESS AND DEATH.    used for 6 months. Will never use again.  Leaves your hair feeling like straw, brittle, smells like alcohol way strong, and doesn&#x27;t seem to work. It will give u dry scalp too. Doesn&#x27;t work--Rogaine or Costco or CVS brand minoxidil works better. This is way over priced as well. Do not buy it will last you 2-3 weeks and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been using Minoxidil for 10 years. I started with the rip-off stuff in the stores, moved on to Dr.Lee&#x27;s formulae at a high cost but really liked his product. Now I have found this wonderful company and product. The 15% minoxidil and 5% azeliac acid combo is super high power for a needy follicle. This product, Dualgen15, is so gentle on my scalp and dries quickly with very little residue. Extremely managable. Exellent price and fabulous costomer service. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, highly recommended. FYI, I use this product only once at night, about a 1.5ml dose, along with the laser comb. I also take lots of clean fish oils. This combo I believe has helped me extend my hair life by a mile.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how well minoxidilmax works, I have used rogaine and kirkland&#x27;s and did not notice any change in hair growth. I have been using minoxidilmax for about 4 months and have had a lot of compliments on how my hair looks, I just finished ordering another 3 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;The service and follow up from Minoxidilmax was a surprise,I have never had a company follow up with their customers so fast, to make sure that you are satisfied with their produts and their produt is delivered on time and kept me informed from shipment to delivery, what more could you ask for from a company, well they have a permanent custome now.&lt;br /&gt; Thank You,  Stan Morris</li>
            <li> The Dualgen 15 No PG has worked out great for me so far!  I used 5% Rogaine for years, which irritated and inflamed my scalp to no end.  The No PG has been a savior! My scalp has zero irritation, redness, or inflamation!  It&#x27;s a tad greasy, but since you only need 1 application a day, I do mine at night before bed, so it&#x27;s of no consequence.  I have also noticed a definite re-growth of hair since switching to Dualgen 15 from the 5% Rogaine.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The product arrived very rapidly and professionally packed.  Have used it every day for the last 2 months - seems to be working  however it needs at least 6 months of continous use to see   obvious results.</li>
            <li> it is good product and it also works in few weeks, i will keep use it. but the only thing is price a little bit high.</li>
            <li> It definitely works better the lower concentration ones, I have been using minoxidil %5 for years it always works for me until recently it seems to stop working&gt; now I got the higher concentration and I back to track, my only complaint about it is it does not work that much faster, and it drys out you hair and scalp</li>
            <li> Havent notice a difference but havent used it twice a day either. Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month and I definitely see an improvement to my hair. There is a thickening of hair along the hairline and a beginning of increased thickness along the center of my scalp. I decided to try this product after the effects of regular Minox 5% began to vanish after about 6-7 years. I initially had very good results with the regular minox for the first 4-5 years, so hopefully I can get at least another 5 years or so with this product, heh, at least until something better comes out. I&#x27;ll try to update this review about the 6 month mark.</li>
            <li> This is a worthy product from a notable seller.  The customer service is superb, shipping is quick, and the minoxidil solution has offered personal results that I haven&#x27;t seen with 5% solutions.  I&#x27;ve used other 15% solutions, and this is the one I choose by preference.  The Azelaic Acid is a theoretical DHT inhibitor (testosterone conversion to DHT production is the absolute cause of the hair follicle demise....aka hair loss), and combined with the 15% minoxidil mixture, the solution offers the possibility of solid regrowth .  Honestly, I&#x27;ve used this product (in combination with additional regrowth methods) and am receiving results that I have not had in the past using other regrowth combinations (I&#x27;ve used this 15% solution for roughly 5-6 months).  I began thinning in my early 20&#x27;s and by 25 was shaving my head (which, I didn&#x27;t mind so much but wasn&#x27;t completely doing so by preference).  I&#x27;m currently 29, and my hair is gaining the density as it once was at 18.  I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I have started using it just before a week and I do think that its a good product , but it should be used with products like provillus or some other supplement .</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in described condition.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if it works.</li>
            <li> Like it. But have to consume a couple of bottles to see the results. The problem is that when it stays on for more than a day it changes your hair color to gray.</li>
            <li> There is no propylene glycol, true, but they replaced it with glycerin and it makes the thing even worse! It&#x27;s liquid glue on your hair and hands.</li>
            <li> i should have been told ,the solution dualgen15 was not the right solution for any woman to use ,for to strong ,15% minoxiodil &amp;5%azelaic acid should have been a lower percentage for a woman to use it should have been 2% minoxidil &amp; 5% azelaic acid any stronger solution can be a big mistake could cause more baldness,i bought this product and wasted my money,i should have been warned about this product.it&#x27;s really for men only product!you all is dis honest to me i&#x27;m one of you all best customers,shame!</li>
            <li> I had been using the Minoxidil 5% foam for more than a year and did not get any good result, to the contrary, my hair loss increased a lot so I had to stop using it.     Then when I began to use the Minoxidil 15% I had my doubts, but now, after four months of uninterrupted use I just have to say this product is really incredible because my hair is growing back again, this is like a kind of miracle.  Believe or not I am 45 years old and never thought I would recover my hair or part of it again.</li>
            <li> Will definitely deal with again.  Quick response. Fast shipping. Great product, exactly as described.  A+++, Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> I bought it some time ago and I am so satisfied I have also recemmended it to some friends.  The product is high quality and it worked for me! Communication, customer services and quick delivery are top standards!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old man,  I\\&quot;ve been off of propecia for over a year and started using DualGen 15 (DualGen 5 in the mornings)  on 3.19.11 now a little over 2 months later theres a large crop of smaller hairs coming in,  almost like I have a second canopy-if you know what I mean.  Also have noticeable growth on the front hairline.  Very satisfied customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Posted pictures of my 3 month results,  proofs in the pics.  Excellent Product! Thanks MinoxidilMax!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after using another brand but this one is way Too sticky. I will not be using anymore after this bottle.</li>
            <li> I brought this one 2 months ago, use it every morning. But have not geot any noticeable improvement. I want to keep trying.</li>
            <li> Does this come a 3 pack for this price?  It doesn&#x27;t say.  Thanks. Rojo  p.s. It seems to help slow down fallout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5% minoxidil for years with little or no results. I started using the Dualgen 15% minoxidil with 5% azelaic acid several months ago &amp; have been very satisfied with the results. My hair has already started to thicken, &amp; its pretty exciting to see the new hairs popping up all over the scalp. I&#x27;ve also noticed alot less shedding as well.....I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far the hair loss has decreased and I noticed it being thicker. I haven&#x27;t reached the point where it stops completely, however I&#x27;m looking forward to it.  I have bought today my second bottle since I&#x27;m using this twice a day and it&#x27;s getting close to empty on my current one.  I bought Lipogaine and Dualgen-15 this time to see if there&#x27;s any difference.</li>
            <li> Hey I&#x27;m Badar from Oman I purchase 2 bottles of this product in 21th March and received it in 27th March so it&#x27;s only 6 days I just waited to use this product \\&quot;fast shipping\\&quot;.  I have used this product for the two months and one week until now two times a day and now I have regain 3/4 of my loss hair !! amazing  actually my father is a bold man and our boldness is genetic but this product can make miracles believe me !  I ordered another four bottles I&#x27;m using one of them and I give my brother and my sister&#x27;s husband two bottles and they seams get less result since they have use it for only three weeks. actually you won&#x27;t notice the difference until it pass one month from using this product but you will notice that your scalp get more healthy than ever.  I recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I bought this because the one with PG was giving me excruciating headaches within 2 minutes on the very first day.  So I never used it again.  I&#x27;ve only used this new one 3 times, like a Sunday, Tuesday and Friday morning so far this week once each of those 3 days.    I applied it with a Qtip to the two areaa that&#x27;s been bald for the last 15 years on each side of the front of my hairline closest to the end of my eyebrow.  The dermatologist examined with microscope and said it was normal DHT from aging that caused it.  The area on each side is about 3/4 inches big circular on each side in an oval and barren.  I dipped it in a qtip lightly and coated this 3/4 inch oval on each side.  It&#x27;s been 5 days and I can say that one part on one side has edges that have caught up to the length of the rest of my hair, despite being bald everyday for the past 15 years.  So I can say this is absolutely attrituable to this product so now I kind of have a round patch of hair on one side thats hollow in the middle. Kind of like a donut hole.  However, for only using this product for 3 days out of 7, I will take it as solid progress.  I will update this as time goes on and I use the product more frequently.  And so it does work on the front hairline for those who are wondering.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years now and i must say it really works. Its easy to apply, has basically no smell, and my hair loss has definitely slowed down and pretty much stopped since i have been using it. I would recommend to anyone who is thinking about trying it, you have nothing to lose, also customer service at minoxidilmax is top notch.</li>
