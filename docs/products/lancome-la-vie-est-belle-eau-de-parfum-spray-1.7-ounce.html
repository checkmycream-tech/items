            <li>This was certainly a great gift!!</li>
            <li>Every time I wear it, 2 or 3 people will ask me what is the beautiful scent I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Good product, excellent fragrance, creates the romantic mood in a hurry!</li>
            <li>For the price, you cannot find anything more lovely!  </li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful and artistic, fragrance is really captivating</li>
            <li>, that &amp;#34;Life is Beautiful.&amp;#34;  I think this is the best new fragrance to come along in many years.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than my $130.00 bottle of CoCo Chanel.</li>
            <li>This was more than I expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, you will love it.</li>
            <li>It has the best of both, sexy, romantic, firey and sensuous!!  </li>
            <li>I have had total strangers stop me in the store and tell me how good I smell!!!</li>
            <li>so I was pleased</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying this every day since I got it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the perfume and the quickness in receiving it.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I just love how it smells on me</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Definitely love the fragrance - and my husband does, as well - likes when I wear it, and I have received compliments from others.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, but</li>
            <li>to tell the truth, I like my Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell, to me, is a very chemical rendition of the color red...and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>My wife brought a sample of this home about a month ago and we both loved it so much we purchased a bottle.</li>
            <li>For me this is a beautiful fragrance - very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>To wear on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I put it on at night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about ordering it online, because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be the real thing, but I took one sniff and knew.</li>
            <li>This is Julia Roberts&#x27; Signature scent if you were not aware, and just knowing that lets you know that this will be a great scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle the Parfume is in is very pretty as well.</li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t get enough of this smell.</li>
            <li>but the product arrived on Christmas Eve 3 days earlier than I expected - great service!!!</li>
            <li>it was too strong in a single spritz, too strong after hours/</li>
            <li>We waited a bit because the price was super ridiculous right when it came out, but now that it is within a reasonable pricepoint, we are happy to purchase it.</li>
            <li>It seems to last quite well, and is not overpowering, but notable in an all-good way.  </li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite fragrances are Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs.</li>
            <li>next morning of wear, too strong in the robe I put on this morning for the first time since I sprayed the darn stuff about a week ago (going into the wash today for sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soft but distinct, reminds me of a summer evening.  </li>
            <li>It really does remind me, everytime I put it on</li>
            <li>I really like La Vie Est Belle by Lanc√¥me.</li>
            <li>in any case I really wanted it.</li>
            <li>think it is light enough for summer wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is slightly powerful, with a sweet, fresh and a little earthy, and light notes that last for quite awhile</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for a new Chique perfume</li>
            <li>For about 25 years, I&#x27;ve been a strict &amp;#34;Chanel #5&amp;#34; person, and thought no fragrance could ever displace that classic for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The counter said because it&#x27;s still fairly new, they won&#x27;t for some time.</li>
            <li>I tried something new recently</li>
            <li>For me, the Lancome La Vie Est Belle doesn&#x27;t last as long, but it is still a pretty scent.</li>

            <li> This is the best smelling perfume I have smelled in awhile. I like it better than my $130.00 bottle of CoCo Chanel. Honestly I can&#x27;t get enough of this smell. I had the same experience with CoCo Chanel Allure. The bottle the Parfume is in is very pretty as well. Please try this.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering. My friends ask -- what is that fragrance you are wearing -- it is wonderful!  I bought it because I had received a sample from Lanc√¥me and I loved it.</li>
            <li> To wear on special occasions. Celion Deon,but it does not compare. That they will love this great smell.This was more than I expect.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from another site.  I&#x27;m using the rest of it to scent my outdoor garbage can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the strongest scent I&#x27;ve sampled on myself....it was too strong in a single spritz, too strong after hours/next morning of wear, too strong in the robe I put on this morning for the first time since I sprayed the darn stuff about a week ago (going into the wash today for sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, to me, is a very chemical rendition of the color red...and not in a good way.  Like if you made those red candy apples and somehow melted some saran wrap in with the sugar (at least I think that&#x27;s what that might smell like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway....it&#x27;s obviously not for everyone.  I&#x27;d suggest sampling in a store before buying.</li>
            <li> For about 25 years, I&#x27;ve been a strict &amp;#34;Chanel #5&amp;#34; person, and thought no fragrance could ever displace that classic for me.  But this one has.  I&#x27;m just in love with it.  It is soft but distinct, reminds me of a summer evening.  It really does remind me, everytime I put it on, that &amp;#34;Life is Beautiful.&amp;#34;  I think this is the best new fragrance to come along in many years.  It seems to last quite well, and is not overpowering, but notable in an all-good way.  Every time I wear it, 2 or 3 people will ask me what is the beautiful scent I&#x27;m wearing.  I love it so much that I put it on at night before I go to bed.  Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  For the price, you cannot find anything more lovely!  Don&#x27;t hesitate, you will love it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the best!!  It has the best of both, sexy, romantic, firey and sensuous!!  Go for it!!! You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone always comments on how they like the perfume I wear. I really like La Vie Est Belle by Lanc√¥me.</li>
            <li> I tried something new recently but this is my signature scent! I have had total strangers stop me in the store and tell me how good I smell!!!</li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite fragrances are Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs. I recently smelled this fragrance in a magazine and it was kinda similar- in any case I really wanted it. I went to Nordstrom where they gave me a sample (that I carry in my purse) and I immediately put it on my Christmas list. It&#x27;s not overwhelming and I wear it as an everyday fragrance. The bottle is crafted very nicely and it looks lovely on my dresser. The only bummer- they don&#x27;t have it in a roller ball bottle yet. The counter said because it&#x27;s still fairly new, they won&#x27;t for some time. My sister bought me the Flower Bomb roller ball version which smells a lot like this one. I&#x27;m a fan of the roller ball for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> I like it .  think it is light enough for summer wear.&lt;br /&gt;only objection is:&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time getting fragrances to stay with me.</li>
            <li> Great product which my wife had seen advertised by Julia Roberts her favorite actress so I had to get it for her. I left it late but the product arrived on Christmas Eve 3 days earlier than I expected - great service!!! Reasonably priced for a new Chique perfume so I was pleased and my wife was delighted with her gift.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I was worried about ordering it online, because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be the real thing, but I took one sniff and knew. It arrived in a timely fashion and intact. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful and artistic, fragrance is really captivating and I am enjoying this every day since I got it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the perfume and the quickness in receiving it. I would definitely recommend this to someone else.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Such a delicate scent that lasts throughout the day and night. Definitely worth the money! Got it for Christmas and was ecstatic.</li>
            <li> Once I smelled this in a magazine I  immediately put it on my Christmas list. Now that I have it I am in love. I just love how it smells on me and it is very long lasting. I get so many compliments. This was certainly a great gift!!</li>
            <li> My lady friend got it for her birthday gift from me. She loves it. And used it every day as she opened her gift before her birth day. Good product, excellent fragrance, creates the romantic mood in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Definitely love the fragrance - and my husband does, as well - likes when I wear it, and I have received compliments from others.</li>
            <li> My wife brought a sample of this home about a month ago and we both loved it so much we purchased a bottle. We waited a bit because the price was super ridiculous right when it came out, but now that it is within a reasonable pricepoint, we are happy to purchase it. This is Julia Roberts&#x27; Signature scent if you were not aware, and just knowing that lets you know that this will be a great scent. It is slightly powerful, with a sweet, fresh and a little earthy, and light notes that last for quite awhile (so you dont need to gob it on and reapply every hour like with some others). Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just recently ordered and received this newer fragrance by Lancome.  It&#x27;s nice and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, but to tell the truth, I like my Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan better.  For me, the Lancome La Vie Est Belle doesn&#x27;t last as long, but it is still a pretty scent.</li>
            <li> Of course not all perfumes smell the same on everyone who wears them.  For me this is a beautiful fragrance - very soft and clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
