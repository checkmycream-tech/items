            <li>Makes your skin really smooth, but doesn&#x27;t work really good for my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>You better make sure this product is something you have tried before and your skin can tolerate because the vendor refuses to take returns.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I think if this product is combined with massages it would work even better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this products for almost 3 years and of course my skin looks better.</li>

            <li>This product and have used it several times I really thought was very good, not that great, stay complasidos to prove it.</li>
            <li>From all the other products I tested thri the years this is the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, aroma is fine.  </li>
            <li>You need to be consistent with its application and follow a healthy diet to see the results.</li>
            <li>It never got absorbed into the skin, no!</li>
            <li>This cream is non-greasy, easy to apply, smells fine, and provides results in a fast way.</li>
            <li>As I get more into my 30&#x27;s, I find that I need more help with the cellulite on the back of my legs.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and easy transaction with Amazon.</li>
            <li>I found it to be well worth the money, of course, you need to exercise</li>
            <li>(so it lasts longer)and put it on right after taking a shower or before going to bed.</li>
            <li>It was a real nightmare!</li>

            <li>the cellulite was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Well... one month later, completed a detox and have restarted my intense workout regimen, and the only thing I notice is how the lotion does not soak into skin, but instead rubs off on clothes once it dries out.</li>
            <li>So far this is one of my preferred cream fot cellulite, with exercise you can see results after the second week.</li>

            <li> You need to let it dry before you dress otherwise</li>

            <li> So far this is one of my preferred cream fot cellulite, with exercise you can see results after the second week.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be improving my skin&#x27;s appearance.  Easy to use, aroma is fine.  Arrived fast and easy transaction with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I found it to be well worth the money, of course, you need to exercise and I use a massage brush on those problem spots, before I apply Vichy France.....definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product. So excited that I bought 3 tubes at once!!! Well... one month later, completed a detox and have restarted my intense workout regimen, and the only thing I notice is how the lotion does not soak into skin, but instead rubs off on clothes once it dries out. It has the consistency of a mask rather than body lotion. No improvements in cellulite. I am very disappointed, and it&#x27;s definitely not worth the price given the poor texture.</li>
            <li> You better make sure this product is something you have tried before and your skin can tolerate because the vendor refuses to take returns.</li>
            <li> Once again Vichy product didn&#x27;t disappoint me. I purchased this product for some time now and I cannot stop using it. I use it on  my stomach as well. I can feel the blood circulating in the area of application and no sign of cellulite. The most amazing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other product.</li>
            <li> My legs are fairly thin but my thighs are dimply. I was hoping to reduce the appearance of my cellulite prior to my vacation. Used an entire tube and saw no visible difference... waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hi, I have been using this product for two months now. beware that this will not completely remove all your cellulite if you do not change your eating and exercising habits, but it does reduce it a lot. I do zumba (3) times a week to keep in shape and exercising does contribute to the disappearance of cellullite. I started using it last november (2012) and its now January and have seen results in my thighs and buttocks. I usually only use it once a day (so it lasts longer)and put it on right after taking a shower or before going to bed. You need to let it dry before you dress otherwise it will rub off. I usually put it on after drying and if I am wearing pants will let it dry enough and put on my pants last. You also need to do kneading movements with the cream on your problem areas. Just rubbing the lotion on will not work. I usually do a minute on each leg with my hands with the lotion and this seems to help a lot. I feel bad for those of you who bought the cream and have not seen results. This is a process, the cellullite will not dissappear in 2-3 weeks and not even a month. I think if you use it for 8 weeks you will see results. Moreover, I think if this product is combined with massages it would work even better. I hope this review is helpful. I usually do not write reviews for anything unless they really work or are really bad. I can tell you this Works.</li>
            <li> This cream is non-greasy, easy to apply, smells fine, and provides results in a fast way. You need to be consistent with its application and follow a healthy diet to see the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the great reviews here!!! This product is garbage! And I did throw it away in the end, because I got sick of the product rolling off my thighs over to my clothing, my bedding, furniture and floor! It was a real nightmare! I hated the product, every time I applied it! It never got absorbed into the skin, no! It would roll into these small pesky pieces of product, which would shed off my hands and legs and contaminate the surroundings. There&#x27;s no need to say, there was a 0 result on the cellulite. I regretted a million times, that I spent $40 on this crap at Walgreens! Maybe, I&#x27;m not understanding smth? Smb, please, enlighten me - how do YOU use your Vichy gel??</li>
            <li> This product and have used it several times I really thought was very good, not that great, stay complasidos to prove it.</li>
            <li> I like it so much. I have used it about 4 months and it really works.  My cellulite decreased. I recommend use this stuff after body exercises.</li>
            <li> This does not work. Do not spend your money. I can think of several other things to buy with the money you would be spending on this.</li>
            <li> I think it really works, but you have to use it everyday &amp; when u stop the cellulite comes back, which is what the description of the product said, I think. I&#x27;ve told other people about it. Its good to use if you are going on vacay or have a pool party or something where your legs show.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cellulite cream for 5 days now, and my thighs definitely appear smoother. ..but I still have the stubborn ugly cellulite. Since I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long, I will review again in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. Vast improvement in tone &amp; texture of my thighs. I&#x27;m 56 but very athletic &amp; the cellulite was very noticeable.  The difference after 2 weeks us amazing</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results after using it for over 3 months twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for almost 3 years and of course my skin looks better. From all the other products I tested thri the years this is the best. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricier. It is a challenge for my economy to keep using it at this price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results so I stopped using it. &#x3D;( I also read an article that said this product would only help temporarily and not in the long run.</li>
            <li> After using this for a month a deemed it wasn&#x27;t doing enough to continue to purchase it. However, after about 2 weeks of not using it I could believe the difference I saw on my butt and back of legs. It isn&#x27;t going to remove cellulite but it tightens the skin and makes it appear smoother.</li>
            <li> Big fan of the Vichy.  As I get more into my 30&#x27;s, I find that I need more help with the cellulite on the back of my legs.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t work as well as exercise, but it definitely helps!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin really smooth, but doesn&#x27;t work really good for my cellulite.</li>
