            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Fits most sized bottles and hold a lot</li>

            <li>I love this nail polish rack.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love this &amp; it was just as described.</li>
            <li>really easy to build and love that it holds 60 for a cheap price!</li>
            <li>I have had some issues with them arriving cracked, but was able to return them easily.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps all my oils handy for quick use.  </li>
            <li>Can fit twice as many bottles.</li>
            <li>It does fit 60 bottles and I will be purchasing another one since I&#x27;ve filled this one all up!</li>
            <li>Product is what I expected and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Very useful product for displaying many items.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put together, which is good since the instructions pretty much say put screws in holes with some handy arrows pointing at said holes.</li>
            <li>Works great, love how easy it makes finding the color paint I need in an instant.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this for easy access to your nail polish.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to be a bit cautious when dusting, because the bottle can be knocked over fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to figure out,  however.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>It is easy to assemble and holds 60 bottles.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together.</li>
            <li>made well, looks good, recommend highly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great organizer, its steady and fits perfect on small shelves.</li>
            <li>The first one of these I got was amazing.  </li>
            <li>this product was fine although I was thinking that the ledges along the rack wqould be a bit wider so its sort of easy for the polish bottles to topple over</li>
            <li>other brands all fit on it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Im sure you&#x27;ll love it too as much as i did!</li>
            <li>I filled this up quickly and had to buy another!</li>
            <li>This rack works great for up to 1 ounce bottles, the larger 2-ouce bottles don&#x27;t really fit.</li>
            <li>Came with a huge chunk chipped off.</li>
            <li>They fit China Glaze, Orly, Nubar, OPI, Essie, Zoya, Fingerpaints, and Sinful Colors</li>
            <li>I have it filled to the max and have had no issues in the 3 months I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>Fit makeup in there, fit lipstick in there.</li>
            <li>This product is great and sturdy enough to hold all my nail polish!!</li>
            <li>I filled it immediately.  </li>
            <li>It looks fabulous,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has a lot of nail polish and is looking for a great way to store the various bottles.</li>
            <li>They DO fit OPS polishes if anyone was wondering.</li>
            <li>I have that didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I was happy to only pay 12.99..</li>
            <li>very much needed great product lets me display my polishes professional look!</li>
            <li>Very worth it.</li>
            <li>Very useful</li>
            <li>Perfect exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased for my daughter&#x27;s nail polish collection....</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m finally organized and it looks so nice and neat!</li>
            <li>Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money!</li>
            <li>Product shipped faster than expected and was packaged great as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the full racks at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly sturdy for being held together with only the 4 provided screws.</li>
            <li>so only certain bottles fit in that section, and it doesn&#x27;t line up in perfect straight lines like the first.</li>
            <li>I got it quickly</li>
            <li>I just took it out of the box and was ready to use, as easy as that.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>All of the screws that were needed was available and it was wrapped very well for protection.</li>
            <li>Just writing this review brings a smile to my face.</li>
            <li>I am actually going to be ordering another 1 because I have more samples than I can fit into 1 rack.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d told me a 13 year old would love this on Christmas morning, I&#x27;d have pooh-poohed you.  </li>
            <li>I own two for my essential oils!</li>
            <li>Nice thick plastic that displays nail polish nicely.</li>
            <li>Other than that, good product.</li>
            <li>easy to assemble, but one of the holes near the top was cracked clear to the edge of the acrylic.</li>
            <li>Easily holds 12 full sized nail polish bottles per row, for a total or 60 full sized bottles; more of some are samples or smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>no big deal, didnt affect functionality, and i painted and put washi tape over most of it anyways, so you cant see it unless your looking for it, other wise, would have been 5 star</li>
            <li>It is also very sturdy and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quick,easy to assemble and sturdy!</li>
            <li>assembled, they feel pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Not as big as I had hoped, but it is perfect for a small area.</li>
            <li>I  would definitely recommend to others and buy more for my nail salon when we launch.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Perfect for all the nail polishes I had in random places.</li>
            <li>If you plan on using more than one, buy them at the same time.   </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>But it really does hold a lot of nail polish!</li>
            <li>It was ready to use!</li>
            <li>All complaints aside, it is doing its purpose as smaller polish storage for my vanity top, so it has functionality going for it.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li>This same rack go for more than 20 dollars.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews, so I knew exactly what I was getting.</li>
            <li>nicely organized taking less room and giving better access than my last solution.  </li>
            <li>It can hold different shapes and sizes of bottles quite easily as the rows are nice and wide,.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;ll be ordering another one very soon.</li>
            <li>I use this for my essential oils, and can fit many different sizes on it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I did not think this little thing would hold up so many nail polishes - but it has tons of room!</li>
            <li>I finally have my nail polishes organized with easy access to all of them.  </li>
            <li>As my nail polish collection grows, I will certainly consider getting another one.</li>
            <li>u MUST have a rather large counter..</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and large.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, seems sturdy and I would order it again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I can see everything thanks to the step type organization of the bottles.</li>
            <li>Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the inventors of this nail polish orgenizer.</li>
            <li>so you can really see it and what it holds.</li>
            <li>I ordered from this very listing, but mine came in one assembled piece and has no screws.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a reasonably priced, sturdy, convenient storage unit.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks 👌</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and arrived on the date as promised.</li>
            <li>Also very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Love this item to hold my Young Living essential oil bottles.  </li>
            <li>Mine currently contains full sized OPI 15ml, Salky Hanson .5 fl oz / 14.7 ml, Sinful Colrs .5</li>
            <li>It was a little bit bigger than I was expecting, even with measuring it out beforehand, so keep in mind it will take up a fair amount of space on your counter/dresser.</li>
            <li>So far they have fit all of my indie brands as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple nail polish rack.</li>
            <li>It has more capacity than I expected so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Yes, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>little thing is just what I needed to line up my polishes on my desk, where I don&#x27;t have to worry if the looming California earthquake will topple them off a shelf on the wall (as much as I&#x27;d love to store them in that instead).  </li>
            <li>I was nervous to buy it because I didn&#x27;t see any reviews about the rows being large enough to fit OPI nail polish, but I took a chance and it definitely does, with room to spare.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy acrylic and clear in color.</li>
            <li>The rack is actually a clear smooth plastic, so I covered mine in black duct tape to make it a bit more &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; and prevent the bottles from slipping around.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very sturdy, the assemble was easy, and it was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>I recently bought another on because my first one started overflowing.</li>
            <li>I bought the same exact item, I even went to my order history, but this second one that came in, is shorter than the first one.</li>
            <li>It quite nicely holds my entire Army Builder Mega Paint Set (~50 paints, inks, washes and such), plus about 22 of the more-or-less same products (the short, fat .9ml pots) from Games Workshop.  </li>
            <li>Instead it&#x27;s 1.5&amp;#34; Most of my nail polish did fit on the rack except a few of the bottles that we&#x27;re larger than normal sizes so therefore they did not fit on the rack.</li>
            <li>It is large enough to hold my nail supply.</li>
            <li>The description clearly says &amp;#34;one piece finished product</li>
            <li>I have recieved compliments from how organized and professional it looks.</li>
            <li>This was for my 13 year old niece&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li>My young living, Doterra, and a couple</li>
            <li>it looks classy.</li>
            <li>Offers plenty of space in each row, even though I managed to fill it up</li>
            <li>We loved the product, however after returning two broken shipments, we have given up when the third attempt was met with an &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much wider than I expected, which is really only a problem because my goal with this purchase was to replace a wide wooden rack and make more room on my shelf.</li>
            <li>wish it was less wide and more tall</li>
            <li>No complaints about this product..was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>and it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Holds about 10-12 regular sized bottles (both square or round) comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Assembly was easy -- only needed a small screw driver.  </li>
            <li>I use this to store my Young Living essential oils in.</li>
            <li>simple assembly with a screwdriver and task was complete.</li>
            <li>If you knock one polish down lots more go down w it!</li>
            <li>This thing is so perfect and convenient, I completely forgot the horrific time of my life that did not include it.</li>
            <li>Its totally chick looking, its very neat looking, its bigger than what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>A little tricky to assemble but with a little patience and attention you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that 2 of the rows (the 2nd and the 3rd going up) seem to be slightly smaller in depth, as the containers are super tight there compared to the other rows.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp; it was just as described.</li>
            <li> really easy to build and love that it holds 60 for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> I have had some issues with them arriving cracked, but was able to return them easily.  </li>

            <li> Can fit twice as many bottles.</li>
            <li> It does fit 60 bottles and I will be purchasing another one since I&#x27;ve filled this one all up!</li>
            <li> Product is what I expected and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Very useful product for displaying many items.</li>
            <li> It was easy to put together, which is good since the instructions pretty much say put screws in holes with some handy arrows pointing at said holes.</li>
            <li> Works great, love how easy it makes finding the color paint I need in an instant.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this for easy access to your nail polish.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to be a bit cautious when dusting, because the bottle can be knocked over fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to figure out,  however.</li>

            <li> made well, looks good, recommend highly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great organizer, its steady and fits perfect on small shelves.</li>
            <li> The first one of these I got was amazing.  </li>
            <li> this product was fine although I was thinking that the ledges along the rack wqould be a bit wider so its sort of easy for the polish bottles to topple over</li>
            <li> other brands all fit on it perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Im sure you&#x27;ll love it too as much as i did!</li>
            <li> I filled this up quickly and had to buy another!</li>
            <li> This rack works great for up to 1 ounce bottles, the larger 2-ouce bottles don&#x27;t really fit.</li>
            <li> Came with a huge chunk chipped off.</li>
            <li> They fit China Glaze, Orly, Nubar, OPI, Essie, Zoya, Fingerpaints, and Sinful Colors</li>
            <li> I have it filled to the max and have had no issues in the 3 months I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Fit makeup in there, fit lipstick in there.</li>
            <li> This product is great and sturdy enough to hold all my nail polish!!</li>
            <li> I filled it immediately.  </li>
            <li> It looks fabulous,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has a lot of nail polish and is looking for a great way to store the various bottles.</li>
            <li> They DO fit OPS polishes if anyone was wondering.</li>
            <li> I have that didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I was happy to only pay 12.99..</li>
            <li> very much needed great product lets me display my polishes professional look!</li>
            <li> Very worth it.</li>
            <li> Very useful</li>
            <li> Perfect exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased for my daughter&#x27;s nail polish collection....</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m finally organized and it looks so nice and neat!</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money!</li>
            <li> Product shipped faster than expected and was packaged great as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the full racks at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly sturdy for being held together with only the 4 provided screws.</li>
            <li> so only certain bottles fit in that section, and it doesn&#x27;t line up in perfect straight lines like the first.</li>
            <li> I got it quickly</li>
            <li> I just took it out of the box and was ready to use, as easy as that.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li> All of the screws that were needed was available and it was wrapped very well for protection.</li>
            <li> Just writing this review brings a smile to my face.</li>
            <li> I am actually going to be ordering another 1 because I have more samples than I can fit into 1 rack.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d told me a 13 year old would love this on Christmas morning, I&#x27;d have pooh-poohed you.  </li>
            <li> I own two for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Nice thick plastic that displays nail polish nicely.</li>
            <li> Other than that, good product.</li>
            <li> easy to assemble, but one of the holes near the top was cracked clear to the edge of the acrylic.</li>
            <li> Easily holds 12 full sized nail polish bottles per row, for a total or 60 full sized bottles; more of some are samples or smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> no big deal, didnt affect functionality, and i painted and put washi tape over most of it anyways, so you cant see it unless your looking for it, other wise, would have been 5 star</li>
            <li> It is also very sturdy and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quick,easy to assemble and sturdy!</li>
            <li> assembled, they feel pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Not as big as I had hoped, but it is perfect for a small area.</li>
            <li> I  would definitely recommend to others and buy more for my nail salon when we launch.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all the nail polishes I had in random places.</li>
            <li> If you plan on using more than one, buy them at the same time.   </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> But it really does hold a lot of nail polish!</li>
            <li> It was ready to use!</li>
            <li> All complaints aside, it is doing its purpose as smaller polish storage for my vanity top, so it has functionality going for it.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li> This same rack go for more than 20 dollars.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews, so I knew exactly what I was getting.</li>
            <li> nicely organized taking less room and giving better access than my last solution.  </li>
            <li> It can hold different shapes and sizes of bottles quite easily as the rows are nice and wide,.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;ll be ordering another one very soon.</li>
            <li> I use this for my essential oils, and can fit many different sizes on it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I did not think this little thing would hold up so many nail polishes - but it has tons of room!</li>
            <li> I finally have my nail polishes organized with easy access to all of them.  </li>
            <li> As my nail polish collection grows, I will certainly consider getting another one.</li>
            <li> u MUST have a rather large counter..</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and large.</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, seems sturdy and I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can see everything thanks to the step type organization of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the inventors of this nail polish orgenizer.</li>
            <li> so you can really see it and what it holds.</li>
            <li> I ordered from this very listing, but mine came in one assembled piece and has no screws.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a reasonably priced, sturdy, convenient storage unit.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thanks 👌</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and arrived on the date as promised.</li>
            <li> Also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Love this item to hold my Young Living essential oil bottles.  </li>
            <li> Mine currently contains full sized OPI 15ml, Salky Hanson .5 fl oz / 14.7 ml, Sinful Colrs .5</li>
            <li> It was a little bit bigger than I was expecting, even with measuring it out beforehand, so keep in mind it will take up a fair amount of space on your counter/dresser.</li>
            <li> So far they have fit all of my indie brands as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> It has more capacity than I expected so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Yes, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> little thing is just what I needed to line up my polishes on my desk, where I don&#x27;t have to worry if the looming California earthquake will topple them off a shelf on the wall (as much as I&#x27;d love to store them in that instead).  </li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy it because I didn&#x27;t see any reviews about the rows being large enough to fit OPI nail polish, but I took a chance and it definitely does, with room to spare.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy acrylic and clear in color.</li>
            <li> The rack is actually a clear smooth plastic, so I covered mine in black duct tape to make it a bit more &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; and prevent the bottles from slipping around.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very sturdy, the assemble was easy, and it was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I recently bought another on because my first one started overflowing.</li>
            <li> I bought the same exact item, I even went to my order history, but this second one that came in, is shorter than the first one.</li>
            <li> It quite nicely holds my entire Army Builder Mega Paint Set (~50 paints, inks, washes and such), plus about 22 of the more-or-less same products (the short, fat .9ml pots) from Games Workshop.  </li>
            <li> Instead it&#x27;s 1.5&amp;#34; Most of my nail polish did fit on the rack except a few of the bottles that we&#x27;re larger than normal sizes so therefore they did not fit on the rack.</li>
            <li> It is large enough to hold my nail supply.</li>
            <li> The description clearly says &amp;#34;one piece finished product</li>
            <li> I have recieved compliments from how organized and professional it looks.</li>
            <li> This was for my 13 year old niece&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> My young living, Doterra, and a couple</li>
            <li> it looks classy.</li>
            <li> Offers plenty of space in each row, even though I managed to fill it up</li>
            <li> We loved the product, however after returning two broken shipments, we have given up when the third attempt was met with an &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much wider than I expected, which is really only a problem because my goal with this purchase was to replace a wide wooden rack and make more room on my shelf.</li>
            <li> wish it was less wide and more tall</li>
            <li> No complaints about this product..was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> and it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Holds about 10-12 regular sized bottles (both square or round) comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Assembly was easy -- only needed a small screw driver.  </li>
            <li> I use this to store my Young Living essential oils in.</li>
            <li> simple assembly with a screwdriver and task was complete.</li>
            <li> If you knock one polish down lots more go down w it!</li>
            <li> This thing is so perfect and convenient, I completely forgot the horrific time of my life that did not include it.</li>
            <li> Its totally chick looking, its very neat looking, its bigger than what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to assemble but with a little patience and attention you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that 2 of the rows (the 2nd and the 3rd going up) seem to be slightly smaller in depth, as the containers are super tight there compared to the other rows.</li>
            <li> One was sealed up and complete, the other was incomplete.  </li>
            <li> but it was a significant sized piece that was broken off.</li>
            <li> do not fit as well, so those I have angled for now till they make it into their permanent storage (this shelf acts as a holding ground for new orders or polishes).</li>
            <li> Hard to believe I had so much nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd one I recently bought, some of the rows are a little crooked</li>
            <li> my collection had grown (kinda out of control) and it was getting harder to find any specific bottle I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> No more rooting through a messy box or moving half of the bottles around on a shelf to find the right color.</li>
            <li> I have my dōTerra essential oil bottles on it, which are just slightly wider than 1 inch.</li>
            <li> when it shipped it came in a big box with a smaller box inside and fully warp in bubble wrap, nothing wrong with it at all and came already put together nothing you have to do but put the polishes on it, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a little big for my little collection of essential oils</li>
            <li> Note that the storage rack does not have a back wall support to it, only the triangles on the sides, so the storage unit needs to be placed on a table at least as wide as the rack.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality, it was well made but unless the bottle was narrow, I could not fit it in the stand.</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the mail before the due date of receiving it.</li>
            <li> The side of mine arrived with a small crack that went unnoticed by me until I already had the opposite side screwed on with teeny tiny screws that required me to hunt through every tool box my husband owns in the garage before finding the typically useless and unicorn of screw drivers small enough for these screws, so I gave that little crack a big ef u, and continued on because the $14.99 I spent on it was not worth the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li> Sharp edges but nothing to be scared about!</li>
            <li> This would be a 5 star review if the front edge were a little taller I have bummed the table</li>
            <li> and my wife uses some to hold her little crafting jars and bottles.</li>
            <li> hold quite a few.</li>
            <li> a few of the tall skinny bottles tip over.</li>
            <li> so , it was a TOTAL waste of $$$$$$!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not sure why acrylic makeup organizers are pricey, though...</li>
            <li> Not sure how to upload images on amazon</li>
            <li> Hardly any assembly and the materials are sturdy.</li>
            <li> It was a bday gift and was forced to order another product</li>
            <li> they should specify that in BIG letters, so u dont get confused!!  </li>
            <li> Ladies, DON&#x27;T even waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has approximately one million nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> Assembly not too complicated</li>
            <li> I had no issues with the wrong product being sent or flaws.  </li>
            <li> and she was disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the correct product and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This will work for organizing any bottles or jars (including spices) that are up to 1.25-inch diameter at the base.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this to display and organize my essential oils and extracts ... my collection had grown (kinda out of control) and it was getting harder to find any specific bottle I was looking for. This rack works great for up to 1 ounce bottles, the larger 2-ouce bottles don&#x27;t really fit. The rack is VERY sturdy and attractive ... I can see why people like them for nail-polish collections. This will work for organizing any bottles or jars (including spices) that are up to 1.25-inch diameter at the base.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together and holds all of my polish very nicely... polish bottles are all there easy to reach now!</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quick,easy to assemble and sturdy! All of the screws that were needed was available and it was wrapped very well for protection. Exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;ll be ordering another one very soon.</li>
            <li> u have to put it together</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of these racks to store my polish collection.  I have had some issues with them arriving cracked, but was able to return them easily.  They fit China Glaze, Orly, Nubar, OPI, Essie, Zoya, Fingerpaints, and Sinful Colors but not Nicole by OPI.  So far they have fit all of my indie brands as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When assembled, they feel pretty sturdy.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the full racks at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my essential oils and it works GREAT!  Holds all but my largest bottles and looks great too.</li>
            <li> This item is great, it held all shapes of nail polishes including OPI, when it shipped it came in a big box with a smaller box inside and fully warp in bubble wrap, nothing wrong with it at all and came already put together nothing you have to do but put the polishes on it, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am using it to hold my Essential Oils.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The holder seems to be well made and sturdy. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I am using this for my essential oils collection and I love it!</li>
            <li> Not as big as I had hoped, but it is perfect for a small area.</li>
            <li> This thing is so perfect and convenient, I completely forgot the horrific time of my life that did not include it. This is a LIFESAVER for me. It fits perfectly in my room. I am probably going to get another because it is so great I felt compelled to buy more nail polish. It fits .5oz bottles!! It is perfect, easy storage. Just writing this review brings a smile to my face. It is very strong. I have it filled to the max and have had no issues in the 3 months I&#x27;ve had it. If you need storage, just get it. Just do it. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all my nail polish freaks. Fit makeup in there, fit lipstick in there. Do all the things because this thing is great.</li>
            <li> Packaged great!  Hold all my nail polish great.  I even ordered another one to hold all of my essential oils. Will most def hold 15ml bottles with no problem</li>
            <li> Awesome item!  Originally purchased for my daughter&#x27;s nail polish collection.... she ended up displaying her shopkins on it!  Then ended up displaying her mini hand sanitizers!  The possibilities are endless.  Just a nice storage shelf.</li>
            <li> perfect just what I was looking for ... displaying my Essential Oils .. bonus is the open backside .. i keep all my cream bases there now!</li>
            <li> This product is great and sturdy enough to hold all my nail polish!!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe I had so much nail polish.  I filled it immediately.  It&#x27;s a great organizer, its steady and fits perfect on small shelves.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together, and works great! I didn&#x27;t get it for nail polish, but for my scent testers for my candle business. They are in lip gloss containers. My only issue is that 2 of the rows (the 2nd and the 3rd going up) seem to be slightly smaller in depth, as the containers are super tight there compared to the other rows. But, it works, and thats what is most important! I am actually going to be ordering another 1 because I have more samples than I can fit into 1 rack.</li>
            <li> It is large enough to hold my nail supply. OPI fits well. I have recieved compliments from how organized and professional it looks.</li>
            <li> We loved the product, however after returning two broken shipments, we have given up when the third attempt was met with an &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34; page.  This was for my 13 year old niece&#x27;s birthday and she was disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> The home it nail polish holder is honestly amazing.  I use this for my essential oils, and can fit many different sizes on it.  My young living, Doterra, and a couple other brands all fit on it perfectly.  And it holds A LOT!  It&#x27;s very sturdy, looks great, and is overall just awesome!  I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase, and very highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and they came without the side &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; included in the instructions. The box was also ripped and damaged when I got it.</li>
            <li> I used to organize my paints for crafting. Worked very well.</li>
            <li> I use for model car paint.  Works great, love how easy it makes finding the color paint I need in an instant.</li>
            <li> Looks great exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> Just as described. Packaged nice.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 of these.  One was sealed up and complete, the other was incomplete.  No directions.  No screws to assemble it.  What are we supposed to do with it??  I&#x27;d like my money back or a replacement!!</li>
            <li> The holder had a chip on the back. Had to glue it on. Still works without the chip but it was a significant sized piece that was broken off. Other than that, good product.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased. The first one was great. However, this particular item showed up damaged and in previously opened packaging.</li>
            <li> love this!!!! It says holds 60, but I have all different sized bottles so for me it holds 64. Reasonably priced, seems sturdy and I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> This organizer is great! It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected but it does the job. The assembly instructions could be better though.</li>
            <li> i use it on my art table to hold my alcohol ink bottles. hold quite a few. i like being able to see each one.</li>
            <li> Love this item to hold my Young Living essential oil bottles.  I have it in my kitchen and it keeps all my oils handy for quick use.  Fits my 5 and 15 ml bottles as well as my roll ons.</li>
            <li> Gotta quite a bit, of all sizes. I have another version with a side pocket, but this one is my preferred. Can fit twice as many bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has approximately one million nail polishes.  Ok, I&#x27;m kidding, but it sure seems that way!  She LOVES this organizer!  It makes her feel like she owns her own salon.  If you&#x27;d told me a 13 year old would love this on Christmas morning, I&#x27;d have pooh-poohed you.  But this and a dresser organizer were her two favorite gifts!</li>
            <li> My product arrived un assembled and without screws or anything to assemble it...disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it. She got her many fingernail polishes where she could see and use them.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and fits all size nail polish bottles</li>
            <li> made well, looks good, recommend highly</li>
            <li> Perfect and neat display for my nail polishes sales at a street festival! I bought three and each held about 75 0.5 fl oz square polish bottles. I  would definitely recommend to others and buy more for my nail salon when we launch. Great pricing for a great polish stand.</li>
            <li> I did not think this little thing would hold up so many nail polishes - but it has tons of room! It looks fabulous, it&#x27;s sturdy, and it&#x27;s perfect. I highly recommend it! Great price, too.</li>
            <li> easy to assemble, but one of the holes near the top was cracked clear to the edge of the acrylic. no big deal, didnt affect functionality, and i painted and put washi tape over most of it anyways, so you cant see it unless your looking for it, other wise, would have been 5 star</li>
            <li> My daughter had an overwhelming amount of nail polish given to her for Christmas.  This was perfect for her own personal &amp;#34;nail salon&amp;#34; in her room.  :)</li>
            <li> Assembly was easy -- only needed a small screw driver.  My daughter was actually able to squeeze in about 70 bottles of nail polish.  Note that the storage rack does not have a back wall support to it, only the triangles on the sides, so the storage unit needs to be placed on a table at least as wide as the rack.</li>
            <li> I do like this nail polish stand a lot, however I do not like that the bottles collect dust on this stand. I will be looking for something enclosed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has a lot of nail polish and is looking for a great way to store the various bottles. All the parts I needed were included, except the tool. You&#x27;ll need a Phillips screwdriver to tighten the nuts and bolts. I chose to give this product 5 stars because it is looks wonderful. The box that the Nail Polish Organizer arrived in was damaged, which wasn&#x27;t good, but the contents were unharmed. I have had this Nail Polish Organizer up for about 3 weeks, but I am just starting to fill it up.</li>
            <li> Great product for holding all my nail polish. Easy to assemble. Would recommend this for easy access to your nail polish.</li>
            <li> It does it a job. Exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> The first one of these I got was amazing.  The 2nd one I recently bought, some of the rows are a little crooked so only certain bottles fit in that section, and it doesn&#x27;t line up in perfect straight lines like the first.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this as a gift and I adore it! It holds most of my nail polish bottles wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Hardly any assembly and the materials are sturdy.</li>
            <li> I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT TO USE FOR MY ESSENTIAL OILS. IT WORKS PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail before the due date of receiving it. I love it! Its totally chick looking, its very neat looking, its bigger than what i expected it to be. Yes, I highly recommend it. Im sure you&#x27;ll love it too as much as i did!</li>
            <li> Perfect for all the nail polishes I had in random places. now they All are in the same place and I can view all the colors as well, Great Product for organizing your nail art supplies :)</li>
            <li> Such s great piece! Very worth it. Now I&#x27;m finally organized and it looks so nice and neat! (:</li>
            <li> Perfect rack for nail polishes! Great fit OPI polishes! Assembly not too complicated just make sure that all the screws are there! I almost thought they didn&#x27;t come with it!  Sharp edges but nothing to be scared about! Definitely needing to order another one!  UPDATE: I recently bought another on because my first one started overflowing. I bought the same exact item, I even went to my order history, but this second one that came in, is shorter than the first one. I wanted the same thing so that they would match. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. If you plan on using more than one, buy them at the same time.   Went from 5 stars to 3.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful! The quality is great. I bought it hoping it would work to organize my acrylic paint bottles...and it did! It&#x27;s the perfect size for them. No more rooting through a messy box or moving half of the bottles around on a shelf to find the right color.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for what I needed. I bought this to hold my alcohol ink, this one holds about 75 bottles. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love it... It has a lot of space for ma nail polish</li>
            <li> Love it! It was perfect for all my polishes.</li>
            <li> I use this to store my Young Living essential oils in. It holds 14 of the larger oils per tier, and 17 of the smaller (5 ml) per tier. This is a perfect solution for me. It is very easy to see each oil without having to pick up or turn around.</li>
            <li> I really love it! I just took it out of the box and was ready to use, as easy as that. Did not required any tools to assemble.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s nail polish collection that she keeps on a shelf in her bathroom.  It works nicely, and it&#x27;s looks good.  Be prepared to be a bit cautious when dusting, because the bottle can be knocked over fairly easily.</li>
            <li> reordered a 2nd shelf</li>
            <li> I bought my organizer to store hobby paints and am very pleased with how well it worked out.  It quite nicely holds my entire Army Builder Mega Paint Set (~50 paints, inks, washes and such), plus about 22 of the more-or-less same products (the short, fat .9ml pots) from Games Workshop.  I love it!</li>
            <li> No complaints about this product..was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Perfect exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much wider than I expected, which is really only a problem because my goal with this purchase was to replace a wide wooden rack and make more room on my shelf. This turned out to be even wider, so it defeated the purpose, but it still does the job. It&#x27;s surprisingly sturdy for being held together with only the 4 provided screws. I have my dōTerra essential oil bottles on it, which are just slightly wider than 1 inch. The rack is actually a clear smooth plastic, so I covered mine in black duct tape to make it a bit more &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; and prevent the bottles from slipping around. Honestly, it was a pain and looked a bit nicer before I did that :-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the correct product and was disappointed. It was a bday gift and was forced to order another product</li>
            <li> Perfect for my tons of bottles of nail varnish. I can see everything thanks to the step type organization of the bottles. It can hold different shapes and sizes of bottles quite easily as the rows are nice and wide,. Easy to assemble but there are no instructions. It&#x27;s easy to figure out,  however.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It does take up a lot of space on your counter/dresser/vanity, but it makes your polishes look so nicely organized. I filled this up quickly and had to buy another! Easy to assemble. Not sure why acrylic makeup organizers are pricey, though...</li>
            <li> Love these! I own two for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Everything is as described EXCEPT the dimensions they said 2&amp;#34; is not 2&amp;#34;. Instead it&#x27;s 1.5&amp;#34; Most of my nail polish did fit on the rack except a few of the bottles that we&#x27;re larger than normal sizes so therefore they did not fit on the rack.</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife loves to do her nails so I decided to get this organizer for her...and for me so I won&#x27;t see bottles everywhere lol. Product shipped faster than expected and was packaged great as well. Assembled in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Fits all my polishes neatly.  I get lots of oohs and ahhs over how organized my polishes look on this cute organizer</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of this nail polish organizer. I actually ordered 2 and they arrived undamaged and on time. They DO fit OPS polishes if anyone was wondering. There actually aren&#x27;t any I have that didn&#x27;t fit. This would be a 5 star review if the front edge were a little taller I have bummed the table I have the racks on and a few of the tall skinny bottles tip over.</li>
            <li> very nice piece for all of my nail polish display. Thanks for the inventors of this nail polish orgenizer. 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed for all of my nail polish. It&#x27;s sleek, sturdy, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It was a little bit bigger than I was expecting, even with measuring it out beforehand, so keep in mind it will take up a fair amount of space on your counter/dresser. But it really does hold a lot of nail polish!</li>
            <li> Perfect to store my alcohol inks on.  Keeps them accessible and easy to find the perfect color..</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to nail polish enthusiasts!</li>
            <li> So cute for storing your polishes.  I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I got it quickly and it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I got this to hold all my DoTerra oils and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect to hold essential oil bottles!</li>
            <li> My niece loved it. Just as it&#x27;s pictured  She put it in her bathroom it looks classy. This is a great way to keep nail polish neat</li>
            <li> Easily holds 12 full sized nail polish bottles per row, for a total or 60 full sized bottles; more of some are samples or smaller bottles. Mine currently contains full sized OPI 15ml, Salky Hanson .5 fl oz / 14.7 ml, Sinful Colrs .5 fl oz / 15 ml, Revlon .5 fl oz, Out the Door .5 fl oz, Essie 13.5 ml, N.Y.C. .45 fl oz., Sally Hanson Diamond .45 fl oz., L&#x27;Oreal .5 fl oz., and more! It is tricky to stand, slanted back, the talk nail art pens, but it can be done. Im attaching s couple of pics of mine so you can really see it and what it holds. Note: the Amazon photo shows the unit with screws, and appears that you have to assemble it. I ordered from this very listing, but mine came in one assembled piece and has no screws. It was ready to use!</li>
            <li> My nail polish always falls!!! The plastic part is all shattered. Still holds them but plastic looks shattered. If you knock one polish down lots more go down w it! Like dominos!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured! Very useful product for displaying many items. My wife loves that she can find colors easier now</li>
            <li> My product arrived undamaged, perfect condition. It does come in 3 pieces but assembly took only moments. Works perfectly for my essential oil collection and fits my 5ml, 10ml, 15ml, and roller bottles perfectly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought this to set my miniature paints on. It holds up to 60 Citadel paints nicely organized taking less room and giving better access than my last solution.  Came with the sides off but simple assembly with a screwdriver and task was complete.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put in my cabinet to store essential oils. Works perfect!</li>
            <li> Anazing rag ! Very useful I love it</li>
            <li> Great quality and price. Durable material.</li>
            <li> I use these for all my Vaping juice.  This holds sixty 30ml bottles no problem.  I have several for juice and my wife uses some to hold her little crafting jars and bottles.</li>
            <li> really easy to build and love that it holds 60 for a cheap price! wish it was less wide and more tall but thats okay.</li>
            <li> I use the Home it nail polish storage 5 tier unit to store my Alcohol inks color bottles for ease of use and color selections. I have recommended this product to my artist friends. It is easy to assemble and holds 60 bottles. Thank you for a reasonably priced, sturdy, convenient storage unit. Packaging is perfect and arrived when promised. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> As expected. Perfect for what we needed.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy acrylic and clear in color. Fits all sizes of nail polish bottles that my daughter owns.  Received as one piece.  Received timely and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I use this to store my E-JUICE Flavors in,  works great.  i would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> worked great for my needs</li>
            <li> love it...100% happy...</li>
            <li> Purchased to hold paints...perfect !</li>
            <li> Used it for my lipstick! Much larger than it looks in Tue photo. Its perfect! Might get another! Not sure how to upload images on amazon but this is a picture of it displaying my lipstick: http://i59.tinypic.com/6hugqe.jpg</li>
            <li> The description clearly says &amp;#34;one piece finished product no screws needed.&amp;#34; Actually that&#x27;s all it says, and it&#x27;s a lie. Total BS. It came in three pieces and with screws and bolts for me to assemble. It was easy to put together, which is good since the instructions pretty much say put screws in holes with some handy arrows pointing at said holes. The side of mine arrived with a small crack that went unnoticed by me until I already had the opposite side screwed on with teeny tiny screws that required me to hunt through every tool box my husband owns in the garage before finding the typically useless and unicorn of screw drivers small enough for these screws, so I gave that little crack a big ef u, and continued on because the $14.99 I spent on it was not worth the hassle of returning. All complaints aside, it is doing its purpose as smaller polish storage for my vanity top, so it has functionality going for it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and large. Nicely made also. It is a little big for my little collection of essential oils but I will be able to fill it up soon I hope.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up. Loving it.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what it said it was. Arrived on time and was very easy to put together!! I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> Works well, no complaints, would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little thing is just what I needed to line up my polishes on my desk, where I don&#x27;t have to worry if the looming California earthquake will topple them off a shelf on the wall (as much as I&#x27;d love to store them in that instead).  Holds about 10-12 regular sized bottles (both square or round) comfortably.  Rectangle bottles (as seen with some indies though) do not fit as well, so those I have angled for now till they make it into their permanent storage (this shelf acts as a holding ground for new orders or polishes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to collect rocks and minerals and this display shelf is just perfect display them.  It&#x27;s simple yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together. Holds many brands of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Holds bottles of all sizes.  A little tricky to assemble but with a little patience and attention you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a display for my essential oils at my show. It showed up and had a pieces cracked off. It didn&#x27;t effect the appearance as it was in the side and my show was quickly approaching, so I just used it.</li>
            <li> this product was fine although I was thinking that the ledges along the rack wqould be a bit wider so its sort of easy for the polish bottles to topple over</li>
            <li> This was easy to assemble and looks great. It has more capacity than I expected so I was pleasantly surprised. Everything is neatly organized and both the label and the polish itself is visible. As my nail polish collection grows, I will certainly consider getting another one.</li>
            <li> I love the rack. I have two of them. The rack can hold 55 to 60 polishes. It all depends on the size of the bottles. Most of the rows hold 11 not 12.. but idc. I love it. The price was great. This same rack go for more than 20 dollars.  I was happy to only pay 12.99.. im a really happy customer.</li>
            <li> Nice thick plastic that displays nail polish nicely. Fits most sized bottles and hold a lot</li>
            <li> I just received this item and I love it. Fast shipping,  well packaged and it holds most of my nail polish.  Love how it looks , what else can I say..buy it. Im going to order another one.</li>
            <li> I love love love this organizer! I was nervous to buy it because I didn&#x27;t see any reviews about the rows being large enough to fit OPI nail polish, but I took a chance and it definitely does, with room to spare. It is also very sturdy and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This holder is great!  The polish bottles are so organized and look so nice. It&#x27;s nice to be able to see what colors we have at a glance. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish rack. It displays all my colors in neat rows so that I can see all of the colors at once.</li>
            <li> perfect for what I needed</li>
            <li> LOVE it. It does fit 60 bottles and I will be purchasing another one since I&#x27;ve filled this one all up!</li>
            <li> I finally have my nail polishes organized with easy access to all of them.  The organizer is sturdy, spacious, can accommodate various shapes of the bottles.  Offers plenty of space in each row, even though I managed to fill it up (guess I have enough nail polish to last me a life time!).  The price was great as well, I think this is a wonderful deal for a quality item.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition, in stated size as description.  I had no issues with the wrong product being sent or flaws.  Works great to hold my perfumes and nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Came with a huge chunk chipped off.</li>
            <li> 1st of all.. u have to assemble it YOURSELF.. they should specify that in BIG letters, so u dont get confused!!  it takes up ALOT of counter space, so u MUST have a rather large counter.. thats why i sent it back.. bc it was sooo huge!  &amp; i lost $8 bucks on it, sending it back!!!  so , it was a TOTAL waste of $$$$$$!!!!  i say Booooooo!!!!  i was soooo dissappointed with this product!  Ladies, DON&#x27;T even waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
            <li> The measurements were WAY off on this.  As far as the quality, it was well made but unless the bottle was narrow, I could not fit it in the stand.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, so I knew exactly what I was getting. Product is what I expected and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> very much needed great product lets me display my polishes professional look!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!! Exceeds all my expectations! The delivery was fast and arrived on the date as promised. The product itself is very sturdy, the assemble was easy, and it was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Fits almost all the of the nail polish my mom has.  Makes it easier to see the colors compared to having everything dumped in a cardboard box.  Also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp; it was just as described.</li>
