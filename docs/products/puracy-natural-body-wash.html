            <li>Everything is good, except for the smell.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>

            <li>body wash smells amazing</li>

            <li>The nice scent lingers lovingly.</li>
            <li>solution is a nice consistency, too.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice on my skin and generates nice suds.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:5415b07f415b0394d7a555a34c00343d]]Our body was nicely soaped and  scented after this body wash the pump included</li>
            <li>I have been using it in my own bath, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The absolute best body wash I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is too strong and isn&#x27;t pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottle has a good quality pump top that doesn&#x27;t drip and it dispenses an appropriate amount without dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy provided a bottle of body wash for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li>A good thing as I am not one who likes strong perfume-y smelling soaps or shampoos.</li>
            <li>Love the refreshing scent!</li>
            <li>First and foremost: This smells so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s PERFECT for cleaning inside your microwave and refrigerator since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was not expecting to be so pleased.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing grapefruit scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>it is effective and works well and smells nice on top of it and has a 100 percent guarantee you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a great fresh smelling body wash that is very light and reminds me of the smell after a thunderstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the eco-friendly production and the general sensitivity of this company out of Austin is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It smells so light and fresh and has a smooth feel and lathers great!</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product for the whole family!</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, does not dry out my skin, and rinses thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this pump body wash.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I like it more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell...</li>
            <li>Love the feel of the soap as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>As someone who was diagnosed with severe allergies to many chemicals found in most of today&#x27;s body and household products, I am so grateful to find this product.  </li>
            <li>Awesome and personal customer service.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I have this product and would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here are the many things that I like about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I should be able to pump until it is just about gone.</li>
            <li>a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am all for that for sure, but the question is, how well do their products work?</li>
            <li>This body wash has a nice light citrus scent which unlike a lot of shower gels doesnâ€™t overpower you with its smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; products over the years.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;love love love.</li>
            <li>The product is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the body wash.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing, clean, good smell, and environmentally friendly...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t create a lot of lather, but leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It lathers nice and clean smell</li>
            <li>It washes away very cleanly</li>
            <li>but I always feel very clean after using.</li>
            <li>I know a shower gel is good when my husband willingly uses it and adds it to the shopping list when we run out.</li>
            <li>It takes about five pumps to give me a good lather on my mesh sponge, but I wash up quickly and feel so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It extends well in a foaming pump, has a great citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t linger or clash with my perfumed lotions, and by using a foaming pump it is gentler on the skin (most straight shower gels dry my skin but are great when diluted) and also more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I tried it today for the first time and I am very pleased that I purchased your product.</li>
            <li>so I may try a different scent, but I love it and so nice to find a product so good for the environment  </li>
            <li>much softer, good consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sunshiney smell and makes for a cheery morning shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a beautiful scent, washes well and leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s lemon-y, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I was asked to sample this in exchange for a review, I will be purchasing this and other products from this amazing line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great either on its own or layered with other scents.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and has a wonderful, subtle grapefruit scent while being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love its light, clean citrus</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t say no to trusting it, and no  triclosan, formaldehyde, parabens, phosphates, SLS, ,MEA, DEA, tea, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, chlorine, dyes or caustics , which means very healthy other wise again for us and again  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely certain how others are able to smell a pleasant grapefruit scent, as many had discussed in their reviews.</li>
            <li>I am well aware of what buying high quality products cost, and I do think this is a great product</li>
            <li>I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
            <li>I have filled my house with puracy products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a free sample product from Puracy.</li>
            <li>It leaves me clean and the pump is easy to use into a washcloth or scrubby.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>This body was is easy to rinse and rinses clean from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was provided a free sample of the product for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a reviewer, I was given a coupon for a free sample in order to test this product and consider it for a review.</li>
            <li>The product seems good for sensitive skin â€“ it didnâ€™t give me any problems.  </li>
            <li>Natural Body Wash is like the other great products Puracy sells, great.  </li>
            <li>made it perfect for just about the right amount of natural wash to dispense on my sponge  , the natural ingredients of coconut cleansers, clinical grade moisturizers, and natural sea salt beautifully balance the refreshing aroma of sliced citrus sun-ripened citrus groves with a gentle breeze of ocean air</li>
            <li>very fresh and foamy without being drying.</li>
            <li>Very clean and fresh product.  </li>
            <li>Love this because it&#x27;s natural and rinsed off very easily.</li>
            <li>clean and light.</li>
            <li>and I like the natural smell of the Citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Was recommended to use this prodcut by an  &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; type of friend&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad I did,, Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, and has a familiar citrus  fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase of this body wash, and think overall the ingredients are pretty good, and probably the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the ingredients could be better, and that it&#x27;s costly.  </li>
            <li>Being one who has always been concerned about protecting the environment and my exposure to chemicals, I was excited when Puracy offered me samples of their products for review (each will be reviewed separately).</li>
            <li>Product as described, love the smell, fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>I feel clean and rejuvenated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>One pump is more than enough to suffice for a shower, and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>There was no such pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t smell citrus in the second bottle, but this time around I&#x27;m not purchasing the body wash for a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Wow, what can I say except that I LOVE THIS body wash!</li>
            <li>Delightful scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>far as ingredients, let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
            <li>Really like this very much, better than what I was using.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle body wash that is safe to use on your kids and even your pets.</li>
            <li>Not enough soap lather, but feels good on your skin.  </li>
            <li>have really been enjoying the Puracy line of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fresh, light, and reminds me of a grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying the Puracy products because of their gentle formulas.</li>
            <li>Nice and sudsy and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>But not a bad product at all.     </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing the major eye makeup that I like to wear and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>Weight: 1.2 pounds and came Super super fast and is Courtesy of Puracy !!</li>
            <li>My one tiny complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lather super easily, but overall this is a great product &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I love this product, its a very fresh and gentle scent and cleans really well.</li>
            <li>The product seems a bit thin but it smells wonderful, feels clean and</li>
            <li>(even better in real life ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this and the baby wash as a sample in exchange for my honest review, but I have also purchased other things from the line with my own money and been very satisfied, especially the laundry stain remover which doesn&#x27;t roughen the fabric and really works, unlike many natural brands of laundry stain remover.</li>
            <li>Such a lovely fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I was also excited at first to have found a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; body wash for my son ...</li>
            <li>The smell is so clean and crisp, but not soapy or floral.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now ordered this several times, love it love it love it, but half the time the top that they send to you doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Like the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful delicate sent and is really gentle.</li>
            <li>Puracy body wash had me with its fresh, citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>I love to know everything we put in or on our bodies is safe and free of harmful ingredients like triclosan, SLS, parabens, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love that this body wash is ALL NATURAL with no detergents or chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the all natural, non-toxic, vegan, and biodegradable, never tested on animals products</li>
            <li>makes it worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such good products.</li>
            <li>My new year&#x27;s resolution was to be more aware of the products I put on and in my body.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell which is important because usually &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; means it smells like cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>I like this body wash knowing I am getting a clean and pure product.</li>
            <li>The shower is so much easier to keep clean since using it.  </li>
            <li>This body wash rinses cleanly and makes my skin feel clean, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Puracy is quickly becoming one of my go-to brands for natural products</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but this is really a great product and deserves to be recognized.</li>
            <li>Where is all that pure stuff they claim?!?</li>
            <li>The original bottle arrived with a defective pump, but I contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a new pump immediately.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely going to buy more of their products.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more and</li>
            <li>My family&#x27;s health is important to me thats why I use Organic Non-GMO foods and beverages in my house, so why not replace all the household products we use with all natural products as well.</li>
            <li>Puracy is free of all those harmful ingredients, it is all natural, non-toxic, hypoallergenic, biodegradable, Never tested on animals and made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The formula for this soap contains mostly botanical ingredients that generates a moderate lather and cleans thoroughly without leaving the skin feeling stripped.  </li>
            <li>And I have tried so many different soaps, body washes.</li>
            <li>The pump has smooth action and the tube reaches all the way to the bottom</li>
            <li>Many have been smelly, sticky, overpriced or simply ineffective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a delicious zesty grapefruit scent from the natural essential oil with a slight sweetness.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, smells clean.</li>
            <li>I like the clean scent and the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>For Cancer survivors:  I take a hormone inhibitor Arimidex for hormone positive breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>It cleans gently and has a lovely, fresh scent - not too overpowering or conflicting with other perfumes.</li>
            <li>The combination of ingredients isnâ€™t harsh at all and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I will certainly re-order.</li>
            <li>We all have different body chemistries, so I can&#x27;t fault the manufacturer which evidently strives to produce an Eco friendly product which I applaud.  </li>
            <li>This body wash however has a scent of real lemons.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much scent</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lather very well either.  </li>
            <li>I really like your product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance also.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:273830f885af3b962a266f7e439aec52]]I really like the scent of this body wash.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li>This has really made a difference for me</li>
            <li>For me, I still like my Dove but with this working as well as it does and being natural, I am satisfied enough to make the switch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this did not change their condition, I was able to safely bathe them and at least make sure they were clean of some of what ailed them without worrying that it would be irritating.</li>
            <li>It is unique, natural sweet clean scent that I don&#x27;t usually expect from a soap.  </li>
            <li>It has a decent amount of sudsy-ness although doesnâ€™t quite suds up as much as the Dove that I have always liked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some people&#x27;s skin are super sensitive to these ingredients and have to use completely all-natural gels, which are super-gentle on the skin but also don&#x27;t get skin as &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; or foam as well.</li>
            <li>have used various body washes over the years but have always fallen back to my favorite, which are the Dove Body washes.</li>
            <li>but besides that it works decently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>you know me, my pets are close to my heart, so trusting this is a high compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like this product &amp; have been fortunate to test other Puracy products.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t take my word for it though, just look at what fda (who is normally lax) says about it.</li>
            <li>Puracy Free and Clear Natural Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover, 25 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li>It has a really refreshing smell, very natural, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I hope that they come out with new scents in the body wash.</li>
            <li>in all, this is my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Moreover, I have tried many types of so called hypo-allergenic types for my sensitive skin but they dried out my skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle but nice.  </li>
            <li>do have very sensitive skin and have not had any issues with it at all.  </li>
            <li>I suggest it for anyone who is conscious about the products they invest in and want a high quality body wash.</li>
            <li>too shabby for a local Texas company ;)</li>
            <li>With natural hints of tangy citrus smells, this body soap refreshes!</li>
            <li>It is made with Coconut Oil ,Himalayan Pink Sea Salt and Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil, which left my skin looking and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I love the foaming action--not too sudsy, but you will have some suds through your entire bathing process, all the way down to your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, this is yet another Amazon reseller that WILL send you unsolicited emails after your purchase requesting positive reviews am Amazon.  </li>
            <li>We live in an unusual environment above 8,000 feet where fungus can be a problem.  </li>
            <li>In the last year or two I&#x27;ve been realizing that a lot of natural products are just as good as their \\&quot;full of chemicals, dyes and artificial fragrance\\&quot; counterparts.</li>
            <li>I like the clean fresh scent, however, it has a tendency to leave my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li>I am almost five years clear.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin and a lot of body washes</li>
            <li>Puracy Natural Body Wash does not.  </li>
            <li>The body wash is non drying but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I think the key to this ingredient is how much SLES a company puts into</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised with this.</li>
            <li>However I found the smell is intolerable, and I donâ€™t consider myself chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have been replacing all my skin and hair care products in my house with all natural products.</li>
            <li>My skin incredibly soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a review of Puracy Natural Body Wash, Citrus and Sea Salt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that were apart of perfecting the natural formula of this body</li>
            <li>Puracy is a company that prides itself on making all their products on making all its products hypoallergenic with natural ingredients that are non-toxic for both humans and the environment.</li>
            <li>but I give Puracy credit for putting together a natural safer product and for that alone</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li>A complete list of ingredients is listed in Amazon&#x27;s product description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a wash that was not so drying yet natural.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more and recommend it to anyone who is looking for body wash without harsh chemical and with care about the environment and people.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It took most odors away but even after multiple washes and rinses in the shower there are still a few odors left.</li>
            <li>He encouraged me to give this modified body wash a few more tries.  </li>
            <li>It is not too thick and it comes out of the pump easily.  </li>
            <li>My skin still remains irritated after the shower, but I have noticed an improvement in general body odor (hairy celtic jew here)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in general body acne.  </li>
            <li>This especially leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>my husband loves it as well, and he really can&#x27;t stand anything cloying or remotely &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;-y or floral or fragrant.</li>
            <li>The Puracy brand seems to have a smaller amount of this ingredient in the body wash- enough to foam and really cleanse, but not enough to strip skin or cause a reaction or leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I feel you can make this body wash a forever use especially if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Will certainly try other Puracy products.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use on the face and other sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it is a small price to pay for being able to control the amount you use, and the nozzle tube does extend all the way down to the bottom of the bottle, so you can get every last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Puracy Natural Body Wash  didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s good for my skin, and that&#x27;s high quality but not so expensive that I don&#x27;t feel guilty buying it and using as much as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, I have very, very dry, itchy and sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> solution is a nice consistency, too.  </li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:5415b07f415b0394d7a555a34c00343d]]Our body was nicely soaped and  scented after this body wash the pump included</li>
            <li> I have been using it in my own bath, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The absolute best body wash I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is too strong and isn&#x27;t pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottle has a good quality pump top that doesn&#x27;t drip and it dispenses an appropriate amount without dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy provided a bottle of body wash for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> A good thing as I am not one who likes strong perfume-y smelling soaps or shampoos.</li>
            <li> Love the refreshing scent!</li>
            <li> First and foremost: This smells so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s PERFECT for cleaning inside your microwave and refrigerator since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was not expecting to be so pleased.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing grapefruit scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> it is effective and works well and smells nice on top of it and has a 100 percent guarantee you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great fresh smelling body wash that is very light and reminds me of the smell after a thunderstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the eco-friendly production and the general sensitivity of this company out of Austin is excellent.  </li>
            <li> It smells so light and fresh and has a smooth feel and lathers great!</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product for the whole family!</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, does not dry out my skin, and rinses thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this pump body wash.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I like it more.</li>
            <li> Love the smell...</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the soap as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> As someone who was diagnosed with severe allergies to many chemicals found in most of today&#x27;s body and household products, I am so grateful to find this product.  </li>
            <li> Awesome and personal customer service.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I have this product and would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here are the many things that I like about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I should be able to pump until it is just about gone.</li>
            <li> a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am all for that for sure, but the question is, how well do their products work?</li>
            <li> This body wash has a nice light citrus scent which unlike a lot of shower gels doesnâ€™t overpower you with its smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; products over the years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;love love love.</li>
            <li> The product is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the body wash.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing, clean, good smell, and environmentally friendly...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create a lot of lather, but leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It lathers nice and clean smell</li>
            <li> It washes away very cleanly</li>
            <li> but I always feel very clean after using.</li>
            <li> I know a shower gel is good when my husband willingly uses it and adds it to the shopping list when we run out.</li>
            <li> It takes about five pumps to give me a good lather on my mesh sponge, but I wash up quickly and feel so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It extends well in a foaming pump, has a great citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t linger or clash with my perfumed lotions, and by using a foaming pump it is gentler on the skin (most straight shower gels dry my skin but are great when diluted) and also more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I tried it today for the first time and I am very pleased that I purchased your product.</li>
            <li> so I may try a different scent, but I love it and so nice to find a product so good for the environment  </li>
            <li> much softer, good consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sunshiney smell and makes for a cheery morning shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a beautiful scent, washes well and leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s lemon-y, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I was asked to sample this in exchange for a review, I will be purchasing this and other products from this amazing line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great either on its own or layered with other scents.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and has a wonderful, subtle grapefruit scent while being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love its light, clean citrus</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t say no to trusting it, and no  triclosan, formaldehyde, parabens, phosphates, SLS, ,MEA, DEA, tea, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, chlorine, dyes or caustics , which means very healthy other wise again for us and again  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely certain how others are able to smell a pleasant grapefruit scent, as many had discussed in their reviews.</li>
            <li> I am well aware of what buying high quality products cost, and I do think this is a great product</li>
            <li> I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
            <li> I have filled my house with puracy products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a free sample product from Puracy.</li>
            <li> It leaves me clean and the pump is easy to use into a washcloth or scrubby.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li> This body was is easy to rinse and rinses clean from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was provided a free sample of the product for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a reviewer, I was given a coupon for a free sample in order to test this product and consider it for a review.</li>
            <li> The product seems good for sensitive skin â€“ it didnâ€™t give me any problems.  </li>
            <li> Natural Body Wash is like the other great products Puracy sells, great.  </li>
            <li> made it perfect for just about the right amount of natural wash to dispense on my sponge  , the natural ingredients of coconut cleansers, clinical grade moisturizers, and natural sea salt beautifully balance the refreshing aroma of sliced citrus sun-ripened citrus groves with a gentle breeze of ocean air</li>
            <li> very fresh and foamy without being drying.</li>
            <li> Very clean and fresh product.  </li>
            <li> Love this because it&#x27;s natural and rinsed off very easily.</li>
            <li> clean and light.</li>
            <li> and I like the natural smell of the Citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Was recommended to use this prodcut by an  &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; type of friend&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad I did,, Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, and has a familiar citrus  fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase of this body wash, and think overall the ingredients are pretty good, and probably the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the ingredients could be better, and that it&#x27;s costly.  </li>
            <li> Being one who has always been concerned about protecting the environment and my exposure to chemicals, I was excited when Puracy offered me samples of their products for review (each will be reviewed separately).</li>
            <li> Product as described, love the smell, fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> I feel clean and rejuvenated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> One pump is more than enough to suffice for a shower, and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> There was no such pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t smell citrus in the second bottle, but this time around I&#x27;m not purchasing the body wash for a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Wow, what can I say except that I LOVE THIS body wash!</li>
            <li> Delightful scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> far as ingredients, let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
            <li> Really like this very much, better than what I was using.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle body wash that is safe to use on your kids and even your pets.</li>
            <li> Not enough soap lather, but feels good on your skin.  </li>
            <li> have really been enjoying the Puracy line of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fresh, light, and reminds me of a grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying the Puracy products because of their gentle formulas.</li>
            <li> Nice and sudsy and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> But not a bad product at all.     </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of removing the major eye makeup that I like to wear and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Weight: 1.2 pounds and came Super super fast and is Courtesy of Puracy !!</li>
            <li> My one tiny complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lather super easily, but overall this is a great product &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its a very fresh and gentle scent and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> The product seems a bit thin but it smells wonderful, feels clean and</li>
            <li> (even better in real life ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this and the baby wash as a sample in exchange for my honest review, but I have also purchased other things from the line with my own money and been very satisfied, especially the laundry stain remover which doesn&#x27;t roughen the fabric and really works, unlike many natural brands of laundry stain remover.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely fragrance!  </li>
            <li> I was also excited at first to have found a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; body wash for my son ...</li>
            <li> The smell is so clean and crisp, but not soapy or floral.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now ordered this several times, love it love it love it, but half the time the top that they send to you doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Like the fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful delicate sent and is really gentle.</li>
            <li> Puracy body wash had me with its fresh, citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> I love to know everything we put in or on our bodies is safe and free of harmful ingredients like triclosan, SLS, parabens, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love that this body wash is ALL NATURAL with no detergents or chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the all natural, non-toxic, vegan, and biodegradable, never tested on animals products</li>
            <li> makes it worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such good products.</li>
            <li> My new year&#x27;s resolution was to be more aware of the products I put on and in my body.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell which is important because usually &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; means it smells like cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash knowing I am getting a clean and pure product.</li>
            <li> The shower is so much easier to keep clean since using it.  </li>
            <li> This body wash rinses cleanly and makes my skin feel clean, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Puracy is quickly becoming one of my go-to brands for natural products</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but this is really a great product and deserves to be recognized.</li>
            <li> Where is all that pure stuff they claim?!?</li>
            <li> The original bottle arrived with a defective pump, but I contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a new pump immediately.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely going to buy more of their products.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more and</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s health is important to me thats why I use Organic Non-GMO foods and beverages in my house, so why not replace all the household products we use with all natural products as well.</li>
            <li> Puracy is free of all those harmful ingredients, it is all natural, non-toxic, hypoallergenic, biodegradable, Never tested on animals and made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The formula for this soap contains mostly botanical ingredients that generates a moderate lather and cleans thoroughly without leaving the skin feeling stripped.  </li>
            <li> And I have tried so many different soaps, body washes.</li>
            <li> The pump has smooth action and the tube reaches all the way to the bottom</li>
            <li> Many have been smelly, sticky, overpriced or simply ineffective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a delicious zesty grapefruit scent from the natural essential oil with a slight sweetness.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy, smells clean.</li>
            <li> I like the clean scent and the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> For Cancer survivors:  I take a hormone inhibitor Arimidex for hormone positive breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> It cleans gently and has a lovely, fresh scent - not too overpowering or conflicting with other perfumes.</li>
            <li> The combination of ingredients isnâ€™t harsh at all and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I will certainly re-order.</li>
            <li> We all have different body chemistries, so I can&#x27;t fault the manufacturer which evidently strives to produce an Eco friendly product which I applaud.  </li>
            <li> This body wash however has a scent of real lemons.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much scent</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lather very well either.  </li>
            <li> I really like your product.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance also.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:273830f885af3b962a266f7e439aec52]]I really like the scent of this body wash.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li> This has really made a difference for me</li>
            <li> For me, I still like my Dove but with this working as well as it does and being natural, I am satisfied enough to make the switch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this did not change their condition, I was able to safely bathe them and at least make sure they were clean of some of what ailed them without worrying that it would be irritating.</li>
            <li> It is unique, natural sweet clean scent that I don&#x27;t usually expect from a soap.  </li>
            <li> It has a decent amount of sudsy-ness although doesnâ€™t quite suds up as much as the Dove that I have always liked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people&#x27;s skin are super sensitive to these ingredients and have to use completely all-natural gels, which are super-gentle on the skin but also don&#x27;t get skin as &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; or foam as well.</li>
            <li> have used various body washes over the years but have always fallen back to my favorite, which are the Dove Body washes.</li>
            <li> but besides that it works decently.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> you know me, my pets are close to my heart, so trusting this is a high compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like this product &amp; have been fortunate to test other Puracy products.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t take my word for it though, just look at what fda (who is normally lax) says about it.</li>
            <li> Puracy Free and Clear Natural Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover, 25 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li> It has a really refreshing smell, very natural, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I hope that they come out with new scents in the body wash.</li>
            <li> in all, this is my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Moreover, I have tried many types of so called hypo-allergenic types for my sensitive skin but they dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle but nice.  </li>
            <li> do have very sensitive skin and have not had any issues with it at all.  </li>
            <li> I suggest it for anyone who is conscious about the products they invest in and want a high quality body wash.</li>
            <li> too shabby for a local Texas company ;)</li>
            <li> With natural hints of tangy citrus smells, this body soap refreshes!</li>
            <li> It is made with Coconut Oil ,Himalayan Pink Sea Salt and Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil, which left my skin looking and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I love the foaming action--not too sudsy, but you will have some suds through your entire bathing process, all the way down to your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, this is yet another Amazon reseller that WILL send you unsolicited emails after your purchase requesting positive reviews am Amazon.  </li>
            <li> We live in an unusual environment above 8,000 feet where fungus can be a problem.  </li>
            <li> In the last year or two I&#x27;ve been realizing that a lot of natural products are just as good as their \\&quot;full of chemicals, dyes and artificial fragrance\\&quot; counterparts.</li>
            <li> I like the clean fresh scent, however, it has a tendency to leave my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> I am almost five years clear.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and a lot of body washes</li>
            <li> Puracy Natural Body Wash does not.  </li>
            <li> The body wash is non drying but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I think the key to this ingredient is how much SLES a company puts into</li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised with this.</li>
            <li> However I found the smell is intolerable, and I donâ€™t consider myself chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been replacing all my skin and hair care products in my house with all natural products.</li>
            <li> My skin incredibly soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Puracy Natural Body Wash, Citrus and Sea Salt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that were apart of perfecting the natural formula of this body</li>
            <li> Puracy is a company that prides itself on making all their products on making all its products hypoallergenic with natural ingredients that are non-toxic for both humans and the environment.</li>
            <li> but I give Puracy credit for putting together a natural safer product and for that alone</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li> A complete list of ingredients is listed in Amazon&#x27;s product description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wash that was not so drying yet natural.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more and recommend it to anyone who is looking for body wash without harsh chemical and with care about the environment and people.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It took most odors away but even after multiple washes and rinses in the shower there are still a few odors left.</li>
            <li> He encouraged me to give this modified body wash a few more tries.  </li>
            <li> It is not too thick and it comes out of the pump easily.  </li>
            <li> My skin still remains irritated after the shower, but I have noticed an improvement in general body odor (hairy celtic jew here)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in general body acne.  </li>
            <li> This especially leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> my husband loves it as well, and he really can&#x27;t stand anything cloying or remotely &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;-y or floral or fragrant.</li>
            <li> The Puracy brand seems to have a smaller amount of this ingredient in the body wash- enough to foam and really cleanse, but not enough to strip skin or cause a reaction or leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I feel you can make this body wash a forever use especially if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Will certainly try other Puracy products.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use on the face and other sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it is a small price to pay for being able to control the amount you use, and the nozzle tube does extend all the way down to the bottom of the bottle, so you can get every last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Puracy Natural Body Wash  didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s good for my skin, and that&#x27;s high quality but not so expensive that I don&#x27;t feel guilty buying it and using as much as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, I have very, very dry, itchy and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually use Philosophy and Bath and Body Works (the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scents, not the heavy perfume-y ones) and this scent is easily comparable with anything from either brand.  </li>
            <li> Yes this wash doesn&#x27;t have all of the harsh, questionable additives of other body washes which is great</li>
            <li> It is a thinner liquid than some other body washes, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to be natural-</li>
            <li> every purchase, Puracy makes a donation of all natural products to local kids and families that are less fortunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering this again and will try their other products.</li>
            <li> first you&#x27;ll have to get past all the cosmetic company blogs/posts that have recently popped up trying to mask the fda report, but with a small measure of diligence you&#x27;ll find out the truth about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back on Amazon to see what other products Puracy makes.</li>
            <li> leave my skin dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients include coconut cleansers, vegetable moisturizers, Himalayan Pink Sea Salt &amp; Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> I like to have a base shower gel that I always buy that smells good (but can be layered with other scented shower gels and perfumes and lotions and stuff)</li>
            <li> The slight grapefruit scent is just enough to lend a soothing and lifting essence to this body wash.  </li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was the dry and irritated skin I&#x27;ve had immediately after showering with this gel these last few days.</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased a body wash with heavy oils</li>
            <li> My hippie husband hates waste and added a few drops of a natural anti-fungal tea tree oil to this body wash.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin less dry</li>
            <li> know it isn&#x27;t officially approved for this, but our small dogs were experiencing itchy skin from late season allergies, and I wanted to bathe them in something gentle.</li>
            <li> a little bit of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will also be checking out their other products!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on them as other soaps can, so points for that.  </li>
            <li> ingredients which are sodium laureth sulfate and all the other stuff that starts with &amp;#34;sodium...</li>
            <li> Therefore, please take some of the other reviews with a grain of salt.    </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It works just as well as any other body wash I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This body wash is lighter in texture than the typical Bath and Body Works washes I use.</li>
            <li> Philosophy a lot less, etc.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but be warned half of ours haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel  tight and drawn skin after toweling off.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have noticed that my son has a lot of dry skin lately.</li>
            <li> Wish is smelled a little stronger though...</li>
            <li> bottle is round and a bit slippery in the shower, and the nozzle tends to move around as you pump it.  </li>
            <li> do not feel that this dried my skin at all and the grapefruit scent does not linger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like how well it cleans without being thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> The scent is fragrant but not overwhelming  </li>
            <li> After using this on my delicate skin, I noticed that I have no more dryness, itchiness etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can take some serious scrubbing to get it to remove any odors</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe this is an all-natural body wash!</li>
            <li> It does have a very, very faint grapefruit scent, but this is overpowered by a heavy flowery/perfume scent, which I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> If you have a cold house in the wintertime, this will still pour nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bad reactions to sulphates, phosphates, bleaches, perfumes and chemicals.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell of this pump body wash.  It is unique, natural sweet clean scent that I don&#x27;t usually expect from a soap.  One pump on a wash cloth can produce enough suds to cover a big area.  I feel clean and rejuvenated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided for this review.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to use this prodcut by an  &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; type of friend&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad I did,, Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have filled my house with puracy products. This especially leaves my skin feeling soft. Great product!</li>
            <li> This body wash is lighter in texture than the typical Bath and Body Works washes I use. It lathers well, and has a familiar citrus  fragrance. It washes away very cleanly and I like how well it cleans without being thick and heavy. Every day I use it I like it more. Puracy makes all kinds of great products and one of my all time favorites is their [[ASIN:B00NIYV78O All Purpose Cleaner ]]. It&#x27;s PERFECT for cleaning inside your microwave and refrigerator since it&#x27;s all natural. You&#x27;re not cleaning around your food with chemical based products. Puracy is quickly becoming one of my go-to brands for natural products that actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> Great product, all natural ingredients. Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh. I am definitely going to buy more of their products.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe this is an all-natural body wash! Honestly, I was not expecting to be so pleased. It has a pleasant smell which is important because usually &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; means it smells like cleaning solution. This body wash however has a scent of real lemons. The LATHER is what really makes this product awesome because it laters fully and rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;A really awesome product for being all-natural. I hope that they come out with new scents in the body wash. I will also be checking out their other products!&lt;br /&gt;Not too shabby for a local Texas company ;)</li>
            <li> It has a really refreshing smell, very natural, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Nice lather and a wonderful citrusy scent!!!!</li>
            <li> This has a beautiful scent, washes well and leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  The nice scent lingers lovingly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell... look forward to using it every day.  Love the feel of the soap as well.  And the eco-friendly production and the general sensitivity of this company out of Austin is excellent.  Thank you, Puracy!</li>
            <li> Love the refreshing scent! Not heavy, smells clean. Works great. Looking forward to trying more Puracy products!!</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve come across. I have tried almost every brand but I will continue to only buy Puracy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase of this body wash, and think overall the ingredients are pretty good, and probably the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the ingredients could be better, and that it&#x27;s costly.  I am well aware of what buying high quality products cost, and I do think this is a great product, I think if those 2 things were improved, it would be 5 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have very sensitive skin and have not had any issues with it at all.  The smell is wonderful.  And I do love the pump bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its a very fresh and gentle scent and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will definitely buy more and recommend it to anyone who is looking for body wash without harsh chemical and with care about the environment and people.</li>
            <li> I tried it today for the first time and I am very pleased that I purchased your product. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a very nice body wash.  It doesn&#x27;t have much scent but I always feel very clean after using.</li>
            <li> good stuff. clean and light.</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive, but it is worth it. Smells wonderful, does not dry out my skin, and rinses thoroughly. I love it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Like the fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Great product smells good too</li>
            <li> My new year&#x27;s resolution was to be more aware of the products I put on and in my body.  Yes this wash doesn&#x27;t have all of the harsh, questionable additives of other body washes which is great but what&#x27;s additionally wonderful about this wash is that it has an amazing feel and smell. The smell is light, not overpowering -- perfect for both men and women. Plus it soaps up beautifully.  I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but this is really a great product and deserves to be recognized.</li>
            <li> This body wash is the best! One pump is more than enough to suffice for a shower, and the smell is amazing. With natural hints of tangy citrus smells, this body soap refreshes! I suggest it for anyone who is conscious about the products they invest in and want a high quality body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a body wash which doesn&#x27;t smell too flowery or perfume like.  Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t it.  It does have a very, very faint grapefruit scent, but this is overpowered by a heavy flowery/perfume scent, which I didn&#x27;t like.  It didn&#x27;t lather very well either.  It does however, work great for cleaning my eyeglasses.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on them as other soaps can, so points for that.  I&#x27;ll use this up on my glasses and keep looking for another body wash.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift to my boyfriend - he likes it.</li>
            <li> I like the clean fresh scent, however, it has a tendency to leave my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> I really like your product.  I have a sensitive skin and a lot of body washes leave my skin dry and itchy.  Puracy Natural Body Wash does not.  I don&#x27;t feel  tight and drawn skin after toweling off.  I really like the fragrance also.  The body wash is non drying but not heavy.  Recently I purchased a body wash with heavy oils and I feel like I need to wash off the body wash after showering.  I don&#x27;t feel that way using Puracy.  I will definitely purchase more and also I will give one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> First and foremost: This smells so good! I don&#x27;t know what the heck the Puracy people do to get the incredible scents they do in all their products, but it&#x27;s magic. This is truly one of the best smelling shower gels I have ever used. The smell is so clean and crisp, but not soapy or floral. It&#x27;s great either on its own or layered with other scents. I usually use Philosophy and Bath and Body Works (the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scents, not the heavy perfume-y ones) and this scent is easily comparable with anything from either brand.  It&#x27;s also a totally gender-neutral scent- my husband loves it as well, and he really can&#x27;t stand anything cloying or remotely &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;-y or floral or fragrant. I know a shower gel is good when my husband willingly uses it and adds it to the shopping list when we run out. The Puracy is on our list, so take that into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as ingredients, let&#x27;s be honest... the Puracy has the basic &amp;#34;shower gel&amp;#34; ingredients which are sodium laureth sulfate and all the other stuff that starts with &amp;#34;sodium...&amp;#34;. Some people&#x27;s skin are super sensitive to these ingredients and have to use completely all-natural gels, which are super-gentle on the skin but also don&#x27;t get skin as &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; or foam as well. I think the key to this ingredient is how much SLES a company puts into a product- B&amp;BW tend to use a lot, Philosophy a lot less, etc. The Puracy brand seems to have a smaller amount of this ingredient in the body wash- enough to foam and really cleanse, but not enough to strip skin or cause a reaction or leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; cleanser. I like to have a base shower gel that I always buy that smells good (but can be layered with other scented shower gels and perfumes and lotions and stuff), that&#x27;s good for my skin, and that&#x27;s high quality but not so expensive that I don&#x27;t feel guilty buying it and using as much as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely certain how others are able to smell a pleasant grapefruit scent, as many had discussed in their reviews. There was no such pleasant smell. What I didn&#x27;t like was the dry and irritated skin I&#x27;ve had immediately after showering with this gel these last few days. We all have different body chemistries, so I can&#x27;t fault the manufacturer which evidently strives to produce an Eco friendly product which I applaud.  This product just isn&#x27;t for me. I gave it two stars because I did feel mislead by that grapefruit/citrus scent.    Lastly, this is yet another Amazon reseller that WILL send you unsolicited emails after your purchase requesting positive reviews am Amazon.  A practice Amazon needs to begin regulating.  Therefore, please take some of the other reviews with a grain of salt.    Updated on November 4, 2014    I have changed my review from two to five stars.  My hippie husband hates waste and added a few drops of a natural anti-fungal tea tree oil to this body wash.  We live in an unusual environment above 8,000 feet where fungus can be a problem.  He encouraged me to give this modified body wash a few more tries.  My skin still remains irritated after the shower, but I have noticed an improvement in general body odor (hairy celtic jew here) and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in general body acne.  Thus, I&#x27;ve ordered a second bottle and have revised my initial review. BTW.  I still can&#x27;t smell citrus in the second bottle, but this time around I&#x27;m not purchasing the body wash for a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teen age niece.  She loved it!</li>
            <li> Delightful scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin!  Can&#x27;t wait to try more products!</li>
            <li> very fresh and foamy without being drying.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely fragrance!  The slight grapefruit scent is just enough to lend a soothing and lifting essence to this body wash.  The fragrance does not linger, but gives a very nice bath experience.  I love the foaming action--not too sudsy, but you will have some suds through your entire bathing process, all the way down to your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is a nice consistency, too.  It is not too thick and it comes out of the pump easily.  If you have a cold house in the wintertime, this will still pour nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is round and a bit slippery in the shower, and the nozzle tends to move around as you pump it.  But, it is a small price to pay for being able to control the amount you use, and the nozzle tube does extend all the way down to the bottom of the bottle, so you can get every last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free sample product from Puracy.</li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised with this. Great foaming, awesome smell. It may be a bit summery for the coming winter months so I may try a different scent, but I love it and so nice to find a product so good for the environment  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now ordered this several times, love it love it love it, but half the time the top that they send to you doesn&#x27;t work. it isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but be warned half of ours haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash and a great value, too! I am a guy and the scent is a great, neutral grapefruit and it leaves my skin cleansed and hydrated. I no longer need to use lotion! I also use this on my face and it does not sting my eyes and does a great job cleaning my oily skin without stripping it.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful delicate sent and is really gentle. It does a great job of removing the major eye makeup that I like to wear and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Everything is good, except for the smell. It is too strong and isn&#x27;t pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> very nice quality product</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, leave my skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Really like this very much, better than what I was using. Left my skin feeling much softer, good consistency.</li>
            <li> The product seems good for sensitive skin â€“ it didnâ€™t give me any problems.  However I found the smell is intolerable, and I donâ€™t consider myself chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li> I like the clean scent and the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Wonderful invigorating fragrance!  Washes off well.</li>
            <li> Puracy body wash had me with its fresh, citrus scent.  It takes about five pumps to give me a good lather on my mesh sponge, but I wash up quickly and feel so clean afterwards.  I only wish it was thicker and lathered up with fewer pumps.  Other than that, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Puracy.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  As someone who was diagnosed with severe allergies to many chemicals found in most of today&#x27;s body and household products, I am so grateful to find this product.  The original bottle arrived with a defective pump, but I contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a new pump immediately.  Awesome and personal customer service.  Will definitely be ordering this again and will try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been replacing all my skin and hair care products in my house with all natural products. My family&#x27;s health is important to me thats why I use Organic Non-GMO foods and beverages in my house, so why not replace all the household products we use with all natural products as well. I love to know everything we put in or on our bodies is safe and free of harmful ingredients like triclosan, SLS, parabens, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, or harsh chemicals. Puracy is free of all those harmful ingredients, it is all natural, non-toxic, hypoallergenic, biodegradable, Never tested on animals and made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;This body wash smells amazing the citrus scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. This is a gentle body wash that is safe to use on your kids and even your pets. It is made with Coconut Oil ,Himalayan Pink Sea Salt and Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil, which left my skin looking and smelling great. My skin incredibly soft and hydrated. I&#x27;m so happy I was asked to sample this in exchange for a review, I will be purchasing this and other products from this amazing line. The entire line of products has a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, so you have nothing to lose I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> The formula for this soap contains mostly botanical ingredients that generates a moderate lather and cleans thoroughly without leaving the skin feeling stripped.  It is gentle enough to use on the face and other sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a delicious zesty grapefruit scent from the natural essential oil with a slight sweetness.  It&#x27;s a very sunshiney smell and makes for a cheery morning shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a good quality pump top that doesn&#x27;t drip and it dispenses an appropriate amount without dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy provided a bottle of body wash for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Love the scent.  Doesn&#x27;t create a lot of lather, but leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Puracy products in a variety of areas for quite awhile. I like a number of things about them: they are made in the USA, they have quality ingredients and they smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash is no exception. It cleans gently and has a lovely, fresh scent - not too overpowering or conflicting with other perfumes. It leaves me clean and the pump is easy to use into a washcloth or scrubby. From there, it lathers up a bit and rinses off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash knowing I am getting a clean and pure product. Not enough soap lather, but feels good on your skin.  I would need a bigger bottle because I use it daily and a discount at that.  Nice smell too!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this soap. It has a refreshing grapefruit scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Scent Name: Citrus &amp; Sea Salt | Size: 16 Ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy Natural Body Wash is like the other great products Puracy sells, great.  The fact that this product contains no SLS, phosphates, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, chlorine, bleach, petrochemicals, caustics, perfumes, dyes, or optical brighteners is a big plus.  I am a big fan of Puracy&#x27;s line of products.  I am glad I have this product and would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.</li>
            <li> phenoxyethanol is a synthetic chemical that is a known carcinogen and registered skin toxin that has a host of side effects including the potential to shut down/damage central nervous system. don&#x27;t take my word for it though, just look at what fda (who is normally lax) says about it. first you&#x27;ll have to get past all the cosmetic company blogs/posts that have recently popped up trying to mask the fda report, but with a small measure of diligence you&#x27;ll find out the truth about this stuff.</li>
            <li> For me, I have very, very dry, itchy and sensitive skin. And I have tried so many different soaps, body washes. Moreover, I have tried many types of so called hypo-allergenic types for my sensitive skin but they dried out my skin. Then I was asked to test and review this product and I am so glad that I have done so! Here are the many things that I like about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) After using this on my delicate skin, I noticed that I have no more dryness, itchiness etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) My skin is softer, smoother and no longer flakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This body was is easy to rinse and rinses clean from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Love that this body wash is ALL NATURAL with no detergents or chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> The product seems a bit thin but it smells wonderful, feels clean and a little bit of it goes a long way. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and good lather. I like the natural ingredients. Will certainly try other Puracy products.</li>
            <li> I put this fresh-smelling citrus body wash in a foaming soap dispenser from Umbra and I love it! It extends well in a foaming pump, has a great citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t linger or clash with my perfumed lotions, and by using a foaming pump it is gentler on the skin (most straight shower gels dry my skin but are great when diluted) and also more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really been enjoying the Puracy line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this and the baby wash as a sample in exchange for my honest review, but I have also purchased other things from the line with my own money and been very satisfied, especially the laundry stain remover which doesn&#x27;t roughen the fabric and really works, unlike many natural brands of laundry stain remover.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Puracy Natural Body Wash, Citrus and Sea Salt. I was provided a free sample of the product for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this body wash. It lathers nicely and has a wonderful, subtle grapefruit scent while being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel that this dried my skin at all and the grapefruit scent does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of using this and even the bottle is simple with no frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:273830f885af3b962a266f7e439aec52]]I really like the scent of this body wash. It is fresh, light, and reminds me of a grapefruit scent. It feels nice on my skin and generates nice suds. The pump has smooth action and the tube reaches all the way to the bottom so I should be able to pump until it is just about gone. And when it is gone, I will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash is provided by Puracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> In the last year or two I&#x27;ve been realizing that a lot of natural products are just as good as their \\&quot;full of chemicals, dyes and artificial fragrance\\&quot; counterparts. This is a great fresh smelling body wash that is very light and reminds me of the smell after a thunderstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well, washes well and best of all isn&#x27;t full of chemicals. It works just as well as any other body wash I&#x27;ve ever purchased. There is no reason not to prefer this, as not wiping chemicals on your body on a daily basis as opposed to doing it is a no brainer. Fully satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon. This wasn&#x27;t a goal or result of self promotion, but by focused reviewing. I sometimes get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who ask that I provide an unbiased review. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5415b07f415b0394d7a555a34c00343d]]Our body was nicely soaped and  scented after this body wash the pump included made it perfect for just about the right amount of natural wash to dispense on my sponge  , the natural ingredients of coconut cleansers, clinical grade moisturizers, and natural sea salt beautifully balance the refreshing aroma of sliced citrus sun-ripened citrus groves with a gentle breeze of ocean air yes I smelled  and feel the works of those effects. And you got some doctor chemists&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that were apart of perfecting the natural formula of this body wash you can&#x27;t say no to trusting it, and no  triclosan, formaldehyde, parabens, phosphates, SLS, ,MEA, DEA, tea, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, chlorine, dyes or caustics , which means very healthy other wise again for us and again  I love the all natural, non-toxic, vegan, and biodegradable, never tested on animals products , I feel you can make this body wash a forever use especially if you have sensitive skin plus it&#x27;s  made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very good to use and make your body soapy and smell refreshed.ðŸ˜…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Dimensions: 2.4 x 2.4 x 8.6 inches ; 1 pounds&lt;br /&gt;Shipping Weight: 1.2 pounds and came Super super fast and is Courtesy of Puracy !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying the Puracy products because of their gentle formulas. And this is no exception. I have been using it in my own bath, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it isn&#x27;t officially approved for this, but our small dogs were experiencing itchy skin from late season allergies, and I wanted to bathe them in something gentle. Knowing that this didn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals, I chose it over the puppy shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this did not change their condition, I was able to safely bathe them and at least make sure they were clean of some of what ailed them without worrying that it would be irritating. As a supplement to the medication our vet recommended, it was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know me, my pets are close to my heart, so trusting this is a high compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reviewer, I was given a coupon for a free sample in order to test this product and consider it for a review.</li>
            <li> Being one who has always been concerned about protecting the environment and my exposure to chemicals, I was excited when Puracy offered me samples of their products for review (each will be reviewed separately). Puracy is a company that prides itself on making all their products on making all its products hypoallergenic with natural ingredients that are non-toxic for both humans and the environment. And best of all made in America. I am all for that for sure, but the question is, how well do their products work? I decided to try the Puracy body wash first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used various body washes over the years but have always fallen back to my favorite, which are the Dove Body washes. So how does this compare? This body wash has a nice light citrus scent which unlike a lot of shower gels doesnâ€™t overpower you with its smell. A good thing as I am not one who likes strong perfume-y smelling soaps or shampoos. The combination of ingredients isnâ€™t harsh at all and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and clean. It has a decent amount of sudsy-ness although doesnâ€™t quite suds up as much as the Dove that I have always liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the ingredients list are some things I am not sure exactly what they are but I give Puracy credit for putting together a natural safer product and for that alone makes it worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is effective and works well and smells nice on top of it and has a 100 percent guarantee you will be satisfied. For me, I still like my Dove but with this working as well as it does and being natural, I am satisfied enough to make the switch. This is good stuff. 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very clean and fresh product.  I will certainly re-order.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product with a great smell.  Smells lilke mandarin to me.  It feels good on the skin.  Not quite the best for lather and it is a bit pricey.  But not a bad product at all.     Update:  I could not use it for a whole shower as it dried out and irritated the girly parts.  I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> I have bad reactions to sulphates, phosphates, bleaches, perfumes and chemicals. I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; products over the years. Many have been smelly, sticky, overpriced or simply ineffective. I am thrilled to have found this Puracy body wash! It&#x27;s everything it should be - nothing it shouldn&#x27;t. This body wash rinses cleanly and makes my skin feel clean, soft and moisturized. No irritation, no lingering smell. The absolute best body wash I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll be back on Amazon to see what other products Puracy makes. And... It&#x27;s made in the USA.! I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It lathers nice and clean smell</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and the lady in question is very pleased with the wash.</li>
            <li> It smells great in the bottle. It can take some serious scrubbing to get it to remove any odors but besides that it works decently. Wish is smelled a little stronger though... It took most odors away but even after multiple washes and rinses in the shower there are still a few odors left.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this! Nice and sudsy and leaves my skin soft. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Very good soap, and even better that it&#x27;s vegan! I like the smell - it&#x27;s lemon-y, but not too strong. My skin feels soft after using it. My one tiny complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lather super easily, but overall this is a great product &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> smells amazing, good lather, and a beautiful bottle! (even better in real life ;)&lt;br /&gt;love love love.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  Just reorder it again.  The shower is so much easier to keep clean since using it.  Also like the laundry soap.  Thanks for making such good products.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash. It lathers nicely, smells good and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Puracy Natural Body Wash  didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I love its light, clean citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include coconut cleansers, vegetable moisturizers, Himalayan Pink Sea Salt &amp; Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil. A complete list of ingredients is listed in Amazon&#x27;s product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product &amp; have been fortunate to test other Puracy products. They&#x27;ve all been excellent. I especially like  their [[ASIN:B00ISDMQ8U Puracy Free and Clear Natural Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover, 25 Fluid Ounce]]. It removed grape juice stains from a white carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Satisfaction Guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every purchase, Puracy makes a donation of all natural products to local kids and families that are less fortunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
            <li> Refreshing, clean, good smell, and environmentally friendly...Yes please!</li>
            <li> Wow, what can I say except that I LOVE THIS body wash! It smells so light and fresh and has a smooth feel and lathers great! I also like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this because it&#x27;s natural and rinsed off very easily. The scent is subtle but nice.  It is a thinner liquid than some other body washes, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to be natural- then it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product for the whole family!</li>
            <li> The product is lovely. The scent is fragrant but not overwhelming  It does not leave any residue.  I like it</li>
            <li> Product as described, love the smell, fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> I was also excited at first to have found a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; body wash for my son ... Till today when I discovered that it contains SLS and phenoxyethanol? Where is all that pure stuff they claim?!? Also, I have noticed that my son has a lot of dry skin lately. Well... Now I know why! Like another reveiw said &amp;#34; wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&amp;#34; Totally agree! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love the body wash.  I was looking for a wash that was not so drying yet natural.  This has really made a difference for me and I use this exclusively now.  For Cancer survivors:  I take a hormone inhibitor Arimidex for hormone positive breast cancer.  I am almost five years clear.  The Arimidex has dried out my skin so much that I was using Baby Oil in the shower.  Puracy has helped this and I am not having to use the baby oil since the Puracy has oils in it.  It leaves my skin less dry and I like the natural smell of the Citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Great lather. Would buy it again.</li>
