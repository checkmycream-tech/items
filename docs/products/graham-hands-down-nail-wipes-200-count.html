            <li>I have no idea why I decided to buy this many wipes, but I did.</li>
            <li>Work ok.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better than using cotton balls.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m using a lighter color polish, I can use one for cleaning my nails before polish, and then again after the top coat is cured.</li>
            <li>I even can use one wipe more than once.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, for acrylics and shellac, there is no lint, wort spending a little Moore to make the client happy.</li>
            <li>Totally lint free and perfect for using with my SensatioNail products.  </li>
            <li>They are best for removing the tacky layer from a gel manicure, and also for a quick wipe with acetone or alcohol to prep the nail for painting with regular polish.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for the final wiping of your nails right before putting on the polish.</li>
            <li>This handy little item will be great for when I do gel nails and be lint free!</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase, but wish they were a little bit cheaper in price.</li>
            <li>these nail wipes are great and definitely recommend buying them if you need lint free wipes.</li>
            <li>It looks a lot bigger online, but doesn&#x27;t everything lol, it is sealed, so</li>
            <li>I use these for at home gel manicures and they work well for that purpose..they are lint free.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic deal if you use gel nail polish or for any use.  </li>
            <li>They work to  get the nails clean and oil free.</li>
            <li>Overall I honestly had a better result with a dishcloth from my pantry before this.</li>
            <li>using these nail wipes have helped me out a lot in clean up.</li>
            <li>Not as lint free as described but are decent.</li>
            <li>It is quite strong, you only need one pad to clean your all you nails before applying polish.</li>
            <li>These are nice little lint-free wipes that work</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t mind them being a little bigger, but they really are great.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly thin, you could never remove nail polish with these (unless you wanted to go through a dozen or two), but for my purpose, they work great.</li>
            <li>For the price was reasonable and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>Verry fast  </li>
            <li>Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see them holding up to much else, though.</li>
            <li>I also use the same pad to remove sticky top coat (gel polish) after completely cured with LED/UV lamp.</li>
            <li>As long as you use rubbing alcohol on the swab before you press your nail you are fine (to remove the sticky layer on gel nails)</li>
            <li>I used less wipes cleaning polish from more nails than if I used cotton balls.</li>
            <li>This product offers clean removal of publish without the burden of stcky cotton residues left in your nails.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;d say it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Overall, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The convenience is well worth the extra bucks</li>
            <li>7 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Please note that these wipes are not made to remove old polish, you still want to use cotton balls to remove old polish.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of these wipes, and I really like them.</li>
            <li>The only worth for step when you have to wipe your nail with alcohol before you start your Gelish routine, but you can do the same thing with just regular sponge as those don&#x27;t leave much lint on a bare nail too.</li>
            <li>They are a little thin, but for my purposes (wiping the top coat with alcohol), they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>These are very thin but lint-free which is necessary for good results without leaving messy fibers that can destroy a good manicure.</li>
            <li>So this pack of 200 wipes will last me 200 manicures - each gel nail manicure lasts 2 weeks, so I think I need a new pack in ~</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because they are so thin and have so many holes in them?</li>

            <li> Maybe it is because they are so thin and have so many holes in them?</li>
            <li> Wipes are super thin, so they do not absorb enough fluid to actually do something</li>
            <li> , they just dry faster</li>
            <li> Its a  bag of nail wipes, not much one can say about that,lol</li>
            <li> I made a mistake I wantes Graham Ultra hand pads with plastic back, so I was a little disappointed but they are OK</li>
            <li> I did not give them 5 stars because on a few occasions, I did notice a little lint threads left on my nails.  </li>
            <li> it is gonna last me for a couple of years at least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these, soaked in alcohol, to wipe down my nails before applying polish, to get rid of oil, dust, and fuzzies.  </li>
            <li> so nothing so maddening as having a little piece of lint attach itself and showing up as soon as you spread on some polish.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste.</li>
            <li> And I guess I won&#x27;t need to buy any for a few years.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Darker colors, I usually need two.</li>
            <li> They do work as promised but they are paper thin</li>
            <li> Absorbent and doesn&#x27;t leave any lint behind.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are thin, but I don&#x27;t use them for removing polish...</li>
            <li> I use them with my gel nails/gel nail polish and they do not leave any lint behind.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So disappointed at how thin they were.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was traveling a lot and these individual nail wipes worked well instead of packing a bottle of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> It looks a lot bigger online, but doesn&#x27;t everything lol, it is sealed, so I know that no wipes were taken out the bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these, soaked in alcohol, to wipe down my nails before applying polish, to get rid of oil, dust, and fuzzies.  So far, I&#x27;d say it works very well.

            <li> As long as you use rubbing alcohol on the swab before you press your nail you are fine (to remove the sticky layer on gel nails) HOWEVER... never use it without product. It will lint all over then you will have to fight to remove it. Overall I honestly had a better result with a dishcloth from my pantry before this. I will use them till they are gone but I don&#x27;t think that I would buy them again. Maybe it is because they are so thin and have so many holes in them? Not sure.</li>
            <li> This handy little item will be great for when I do gel nails and be lint free! For the price was reasonable and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out. The reason for my rating was based on because I have not tried it out yet to see how it works or if it was a five star or not.</li>
            <li> These are nice little lint-free wipes that work really well when doing your nails.  Very happy with purchase, but wish they were a little bit cheaper in price.</li>
            <li> Superfast delivery an item as advertised.</li>
            <li> These work as described.  I use them before ceramic nail polish.  They work to  get the nails clean and oil free.</li>
            <li> They do work as promised but they are paper thin and I would say you could use one sheet for every 2 nails.</li>
            <li> Great shipping. Its a  bag of nail wipes, not much one can say about that,lol</li>
            <li> These are nowhere near the quality I expected. So disappointed at how thin they were. It was a waste.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time for prep and cleaning when doing my gel nails. Absorbent and doesn&#x27;t leave any lint behind.</li>
            <li> these nail wipes are great and definitely recommend buying them if you need lint free wipes. I use one wipe for all 10 nails. I do gel nails and use one side for one hand and later another side for another hand. so you get 200 times of nails done with just one if this package. it is gonna last me for a couple of years at least.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I decided to buy this many wipes, but I did. And I guess I won&#x27;t need to buy any for a few years. haha.  They serve their purpose. I did not give them 5 stars because on a few occasions, I did notice a little lint threads left on my nails.  Overall, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wipes are super thin, so they do not absorb enough fluid to actually do something, they just dry faster then you can get them to work. I bought them to do my Gelish manicure. Imagine how happy was I when I tried to wipe tacky layer of the base coat and the wipe just stuck to it, torn and left bunch of lint on my nail :\ The only worth for step when you have to wipe your nail with alcohol before you start your Gelish routine, but you can do the same thing with just regular sponge as those don&#x27;t leave much lint on a bare nail too.</li>
            <li> Works well totally LUV dem no lint</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of these wipes, and I really like them. Yes, they are thin, but I don&#x27;t use them for removing polish...they just don&#x27;t absorb enough liquid for that. They are best for removing the tacky layer from a gel manicure, and also for a quick wipe with acetone or alcohol to prep the nail for painting with regular polish. If you have a need for a lint-free wipe, I&#x27;d recommend these,</li>
            <li> Great price. Great products</li>
            <li> Work ok. Not as lint free as described but are decent.</li>
            <li> This products is great and it just as described. I use them with my gel nails/gel nail polish and they do not leave any lint behind.</li>

            <li> Great Product.. Verry fast  Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li> Great nail wipes to use if you don&#x27;t want to ruin your own manicure!</li>
            <li> Way over-priced for what you receive. I am going back to lint-free, washable, cloth (just don&#x27;t use fabric softener). Will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Must have for shellac. No lint makes for a perfect prep and finish.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better than using cotton balls. I was wrong. There is no absorbtion at all. Back to cotton balls.</li>
            <li> These are great for gel polish manicures. If I&#x27;m using a lighter color polish, I can use one for cleaning my nails before polish, and then again after the top coat is cured. Darker colors, I usually need two. Wouldn&#x27;t mind them being a little bigger, but they really are great.</li>
            <li> I use these for at home gel manicures and they work well for that purpose..they are lint free.  They are a little thin, but for my purposes (wiping the top coat with alcohol), they work just fine.  I can&#x27;t see them holding up to much else, though.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake I wantes Graham Ultra hand pads with plastic back, so I was a little disappointed but they are OK</li>
            <li> I having been giving myself and friends and family shellac manicures and recently have started to get into nail enhancements, using these nail wipes have helped me out a lot in clean up.</li>
            <li> These are very great wipes. I used less wipes cleaning polish from more nails than if I used cotton balls.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, for acrylics and shellac, there is no lint, wort spending a little Moore to make the client happy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal if you use gel nail polish or for any use.  Can not beat the value!</li>
            <li> Totally lint free and perfect for using with my SensatioNail products.  I even can use one wipe more than once.</li>
