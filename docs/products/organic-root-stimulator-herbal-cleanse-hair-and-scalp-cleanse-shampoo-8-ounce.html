            <li>This product is effective in helping to dissolve buildup.</li>
            <li>It is alcohol based, but that is also what makes it effective for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; cleansing.</li>
            <li>My thoughts an confessions about this herbal cleanse product it can be used without water and great for dreadlocs,braids,and normal hair styles!!!</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoo really worked great with my starter dreds.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the cooling feel of this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats a good nourishing wash but under the circumstances it helps to remove residue and leaves a fresh lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I love the lavendar smell of the product and the soothing of the aloe on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I can extend my style longer by being able to target my scalp for cleansing rather than disrupting my braids or twists with washing.</li>
            <li>I love the product I had braids</li>
            <li>It smelled okay</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the color to, because my fav color is purple/lavender.</li>
            <li>Although the scent is a bit strong, it mostly smells of lavender to me, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li>It feels so great when you put it on your hair to, you can use it for braids, with your natural hair or weave.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It did make my scalp feel clean and fresh, and the smell is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Then (if desired) you can place the shampoo on the hair using a damp towel to clean the hair.</li>
            <li>I use cotton balls throughout so that I can see for myself how clean its getting.</li>
            <li>This product works well for me when I have twists in my hair to keep my scalp clean.</li>
            <li>and it freshen my braids and clean my scalp.</li>
            <li>so this product allowed me to clean my hair without the use of water unless I wanted to use it.</li>
            <li>However my daughter said her scalp felt clean</li>
            <li>This product was delivered to me on time in a neat clean package.</li>
            <li>not sure it prevents flakes so much, I use Perfect Performance and a sulfur gel for that.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be an easier way to clean my hair instead of just shampooing my whole head while wearing braids.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair and scalp feeling fresh, particularly on hot days or after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I have been paranoid about getting them wet too much and was searching for a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Cheap pricing better than main stores regular price.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s so easy to use, plus it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>You need to be able to balance it out with an essential oil or moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this product to anybody who has braids, tracks, weave, twist, dread locks. :)</li>
            <li>Product was a lifesaver in an overseas enviroment where healthy water is limited.</li>
            <li>Too much alcohol for women of color.  </li>
            <li>It burned my scalp so much.</li>
            <li>Again, I understand it&#x27;s intention, but that made it make me want to use it VERY</li>
            <li>I had very itchy scalp and combined with Cantu leave-in-conditioner afterwards and</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>you have super long hair, but an oily scalp, works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;BTW,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly I wasn&#x27;t comfortable w/ the use of the antibiotic agent Triclosan simply because w/ antibiotics of any sort, you run the risk of creating antibiotic-resistent bacteria with overuse (which is why it was banned in soaps recently.)</li>
            <li>simply apply it to my bangs, let it sit for a minute or 2, then I use a sprayer to rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Since the first ingredient is SD alcohol, I would NEVER leave this product in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Way to much alcohol in this product, it was to the point where we had to open a window.  </li>
            <li>My hair definitely felt cleaner, smelled better, itched less and actually felt softer.</li>
            <li>using this product is very convinent because i dont have to get my hair wet</li>
            <li>It was okay but not great to me.</li>

            <li> tingly feel and pat to dry.</li>
            <li> ORS Dry Shampoo is truly a god send for me.</li>
            <li> Then I read the ingredient list which contains alcohol, which can dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> fact, if you have dry hair, I would not recommend leaving this product on your hair as the directions state because I suppose over time the product might dry out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> One last thing, I purchase mine from a beauty supply store for less than $6 plus tax.</li>
            <li> Just apply to scalp, massage, leave for 1 minute or 2, then take a wet cotton ball and wipe off thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overuse this product.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little in all areas of your scalp.</li>
            <li> Helps with evaporating some of the build up due to inability to wash hair</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any burning when applying this product, but I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the nozzle design allowed me to get to my scalp and I like the slight tingling sensation that it provided.  </li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t allow half stars!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I can wash &amp; style my bangs in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am unable to wash my hair frequently due to braids and this has worked well this far.</li>
            <li> but it has a little alcohol smell.  </li>
            <li> a little goes</li>
            <li> other thing was I found it hard to get rid of flakes, even when I slid the product down my hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have few complaints.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Bottled water sometimes is not much better than the tap.</li>
            <li> (I mean 3.5</li>
            <li> SD Alcohol is THE WORST thing for your hair and skin because it&#x27;s very drying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> for me so glad that this shampoo was made for me to start to dread my hair and get my hair together lol...</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoo really worked great with my starter dreds. I have been paranoid about getting them wet too much and was searching for a good alternative. To use this shampoo you put a liberal amount on your scalp, massage it in, then wipe it away with a damp towel. Then (if desired) you can place the shampoo on the hair using a damp towel to clean the hair. It has a nice tingle after you&#x27;ve massaged it in that I guess means it&#x27;s working! My hair definitely felt cleaner, smelled better, itched less and actually felt softer. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have few complaints. I love the smell and the cooling feel of this cleanser. It does leave my hair and scalp feeling fresh, particularly on hot days or after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it prevents flakes so much, I use Perfect Performance and a sulfur gel for that. But in between washes, this is my go to hair product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT ORGANIC AT ALL. LOOK AT THE CHEMICAL COMPOUND INGREDIENTS. COMPLETELY FALSE &amp;#34;ORGANIC&amp;#34; STATEMENT. TRICLOSAN?????? I THINK NOT...</li>
            <li> Good stuff, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol for women of color.  It will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> Great for my locs, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This was the answer to my itchy hair!  I had kinky twist put in my hair and kept them in for 2 months.  Because you can not wash these types of braids (with the hair I had) I desperately needed something to cleanse my scalp and help with itching.  This did the trick!  the nozzle design allowed me to get to my scalp and I like the slight tingling sensation that it provided.  I have plenty left so when I get braids again, I will definitely be using this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible. It burned my scalp so much. I thought this would be an easier way to clean my hair instead of just shampooing my whole head while wearing braids. I rather just use seabreeze to touch up my hair.</li>
            <li> I am unable to wash my hair frequently due to braids and this has worked well this far. Nothing beats a good nourishing wash but under the circumstances it helps to remove residue and leaves a fresh lavender scent.</li>
            <li> (I mean 3.5 but it won&#x27;t allow half stars!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I like it as a cleanser. It did make my scalp feel clean and fresh, and the smell is AMAZING. I&#x27;m not a big lavender fan but I am now after this product because it just smells that heavenly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s almost all alcohol which as a lot of us know, can be drying to the hair, but I understand that the idea is that it&#x27;s waterless cleansing, so I get that. I just used it interchangeably with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing was I found it hard to get rid of flakes, even when I slid the product down my hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I wasn&#x27;t comfortable w/ the use of the antibiotic agent Triclosan simply because w/ antibiotics of any sort, you run the risk of creating antibiotic-resistent bacteria with overuse (which is why it was banned in soaps recently.) Again, I understand it&#x27;s intention, but that made it make me want to use it VERY sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of those things however, it does cleanse the scalp and help get rid of any itch or buildup from oil or products. So I would recommend it to naturalistas, especially those who workout a lot or someone starting to loc.</li>
            <li> Wanted to get for my hair I have extensions and purple hair, I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair too often. This stuff made my hair more greasy and smell weird.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser... tingly feel and pat to dry. Great for summertime braided hairstyles. I had very itchy scalp and combined with Cantu leave-in-conditioner afterwards and relief was acheived!</li>
            <li> ORS Dry Shampoo is truly a god send for me. This product is great to use after a workout. I wear a lot of braided styles. I use cotton balls throughout so that I can see for myself how clean its getting. I love the lavendar smell of the product and the soothing of the aloe on my scalp. I don&#x27;t know about everyone else but a sweaty scalp is a itchy scalp. After I done with the shampoo, I apply oil to my scalp because of the drying of the alcohol. One last thing, I purchase mine from a beauty supply store for less than $6 plus tax.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 weeks after locs were started to control itching of scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Stops itching during initial dread phase. Helps with evaporating some of the build up due to inability to wash hair frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Dries your scalp out. You need to be able to balance it out with an essential oil or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My thoughts an confessions about this herbal cleanse product it can be used without water and great for dreadlocs,braids,and normal hair styles!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I used it on my box braids.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me when I have twists in my hair to keep my scalp clean. I can extend my style longer by being able to target my scalp for cleansing rather than disrupting my braids or twists with washing. I have not experienced any burning when applying this product, but I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin. This product is effective in helping to dissolve buildup. Although the scent is a bit strong, it mostly smells of lavender to me, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering. I just follow up by applying coconut oil + lavender essential oil to carry on the theme. It is alcohol based, but that is also what makes it effective for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; cleansing. Moisturizing after use is key--I have had no problems when following this routine. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product I had braids and it freshen my braids and clean my scalp.The scent is good but I wish it had a stronger scent</li>
            <li> Product was a lifesaver in an overseas enviroment where healthy water is limited. Bottled water sometimes is not much better than the tap. so this product allowed me to clean my hair without the use of water unless I wanted to use it.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair extremely greasy and it just looked gross!  Waste of money</li>
            <li> I used this product while having braids, so I needed something to keep my scalp cleansed.  I did notice build up and that my scalp felt \\&quot;heated\\&quot; while applying. Then I read the ingredient list which contains alcohol, which can dry the skin.  It smelled okay but it has a little alcohol smell.  I haven&#x27;t purchased this item again and I won&#x27;t change my mind. It was okay but not great to me.</li>
            <li> Way to much alcohol in this product, it was to the point where we had to open a window.  However my daughter said her scalp felt clean but I was just concerned about the product drying her hair out.</li>
            <li> after i got my braids done it started itching and i had dandruff. using this product is very convinent because i dont have to get my hair wet and it helped with my itching. will definately recommend this product</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local grocery store specifically for my bangs, which tend to get oily the day after washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect because now I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;I simply apply it to my bangs, let it sit for a minute or 2, then I use a sprayer to rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Since the first ingredient is SD alcohol, I would NEVER leave this product in my hair.  SD Alcohol is THE WORST thing for your hair and skin because it&#x27;s very drying. (Thus, I removed one star.)&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if you have dry hair, I would not recommend leaving this product on your hair as the directions state because I suppose over time the product might dry out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;But for my purpose, as a rinse out product, it&#x27;s great.  I can wash &amp; style my bangs in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrance too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;4-28-13&lt;br /&gt;Also works great on oily scalp.  Just apply to scalp, massage, leave for 1 minute or 2, then take a wet cotton ball and wipe off thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;If you have super long hair, but an oily scalp, works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;EZ does it!</li>
            <li> I use Organic Root Stimulator to freshen my scalp after a workout. Good stuff. Be careful not to overuse this product. It will cause buildup on your scalp if you use it too often. Nothing fully replaces a vigorous scalp-scrub in the shower!</li>
            <li> I use this product to refreshen my scalp while in braids, but use it only if I have to because there is a buildup. It does stop itching, but nothing replaces proper washing with water and suds</li>
