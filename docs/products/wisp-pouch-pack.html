    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Colgate Wisp Peppermint toothbrushes are a perfect solution.</li>
            <li>This product is the best!</li>
            <li>guys, this is perfect, on a date and just finished dinner?</li>
            <li>The Gel is perfect IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>that would be perfect, with maybe one Swiss-army style  removable toothpick for those that want to use it.    </li>
            <li>The Wisp is the perfect portable solution without having to lug a toothbrush and toothpaste to the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>and don&#x27;t seem to do an especially good job of cleaning or getting around / between teeth.</li>
            <li>perfect for our wedding needs</li>
            <li>Awesome, can&#x27;t find these at any drug stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>got for bride and groom emergency room kits - perfect!!</li>
            <li>Great way to brush your teeth while on the go or at the office.  </li>
            <li>Wisp sounded like a great idea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are great in a pinch</li>
            <li>Great for keeping in your car.</li>
            <li>One could be in a pocket or purse and is great for those &amp;#34;breath emergencies&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>great for travels and taking along when going out</li>
            <li>This is a great product for just that need.  </li>
            <li>great idea, a mini toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>And the rubber pick is great.</li>
            <li>These things are a great idea.</li>
            <li>(Soup &amp; Frito breath isn&#x27;t exactly a great aroma to have on your breath.)</li>
            <li>The peppermint taste is great.</li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>Was on time which was great...</li>
            <li>Great idea.  </li>
            <li>the tooth pick works great thru the cracks of your teeth</li>
            <li>they have a great flavor assortment and there all good</li>
            <li>Great idea and handy to take along.  </li>
            <li>So as in all things, this mini toothbrush from Colgate is a good idea with some pros and cons.    </li>
            <li>so it takes a while to get good coverage -</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm and she loved the portability.</li>
            <li>it a good value?</li>
            <li>Good for travel too.</li>
            <li>I received a sample and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>Colgate Wisp doesn&#x27;t replace your toothbrush and its not meant to, but as a disposable and functional brush, it is a good product to have.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a good thing if you don&#x27;t like bringing your toothbrush to work with you or if you are stuck in a situation where you can&#x27;t, like at a work meeting or something.</li>
            <li>I had thought that perhaps these would be good for something.</li>
            <li>These are also good for little&lt;br /&gt;kids.</li>
            <li>peppermint taste is so good.</li>
            <li>so these are the perfect tool to keep my teeth clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, the Wisp leaves the mouth with a nice mint flavor</li>
            <li>There are more brushes than I need but they are great at the end of a red-eye flight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are great for your gums and keep mine quite healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the minty freshness!</li>
            <li>These are amazing for work.  </li>
            <li>- this might be a nice gift idea for musician friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, now it&#x27;s covered with your spit, so kind of slippery too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the flavor, and didn&#x27;t feel like I had to rinse after -</li>
            <li>Probably a nice thing to offer guests, if they inquire about a toothpick or something, too.</li>
            <li>I liked the pepermint gel flavor -</li>
            <li>I think it is a great idea, but I am  not so sure it does not need some more work.    </li>
            <li>This is just my honest feedback after using one pack.</li>
            <li>They are so handy when traveling.</li>
            <li>But it seems like it&#x27;s a capsule and not any kind of slow-release ball.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great deal!  </li>
            <li>and I was suitable to work around others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in your briefcase, pocket, or backpack, these are ideal for those who want to maintain a fresh mouth after meals when you don&#x27;t have time or are not in a location where you can fully brush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazingly clean after and my breath is so good.</li>
            <li>it was a pleasant  sensation, a nice gum massage and my teeth felt smooth and clean after I used  it.  </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering, and is pleasant and makes your  mouth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>These wisp tooth brushes are so handy to keep in your car, or bottom of your purse when you need a quick brush-up!  </li>
            <li>They certainly don&#x27;t replace brushing but are great in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Okay, so let&#x27;s just stick with the teeth up front.  </li>
            <li>I tried some spearmint Wisps and found that flavor much more to my liking.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with these.</li>
            <li>I tried [[ASIN:B000296Z0I Oral B Brush-ups, Textured Teeth Wipes]] and they just didn&#x27;t work any better then rubbing my teeth with a napkin or paper towel.  </li>
            <li>My son loved the tiny size and declared them a great invention, but I still craved my full-sized brush to do a thorough job.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;ll purchase more to keep in my purse for emergencies.</li>
            <li>I am unclear whether this represents an elaborate toothpick  or an infant&#x27;s size toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They are a comfortable size, and I liked the toothpick on one end.</li>
            <li>Within the plastic carry-case (which is perfect for a purse or glove box), the brushes are individually foil sealed, eliminating worries about leaving them in the car or in the bottom of my bag.</li>
            <li>These are OK toothbrushes for on the go or for school if you have braces.</li>
            <li>&quot; brand has the most Xylitol.  </li>
            <li>Ok I will review it for amazon.  </li>
            <li>I suspect for many people.  </li>
            <li>I have used these before many a time knowing they came in a pack of 4</li>
            <li>Because I have braces I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m depending on these more and more.</li>
            <li>These are just ok.</li>
            <li>I was really glad to see this product.  </li>
            <li>but they are cute</li>
            <li>Love these brushes, so glad that someone suggestion</li>
            <li>I love the concept of the Colgate Wisp waterless toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I had something better to say.feel</li>
            <li>Wish I had something better to say.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is built in, and it says it is Ok to swallow.</li>
            <li>this brushes is so cute</li>
            <li>I can see many uses for these with children, people with braces or mouth surgeries.  </li>
            <li>I would not avoid buying this product, but make sure that you&#x27;re not buying it from weasels.</li>
            <li>Much better than gum.</li>
            <li>Great to keep in my purse when out for the whole day or when traveling and stop for lunch.  </li>
            <li>It is a very nice mough freshener and the quick brusl for the teeth keeps them feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I love the nice, clean feeling I get after using a Wisp.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice &amp; clean, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However these would come in handy for special circumstances, like camping at festivals, red-eye flights, etc.</li>
            <li>These are a good idea, and they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>bristles do a fine job of removing most debris and some plaque.  </li>
            <li>This is good for after meals where you can&#x27;t get a toothbrush, but if you are traveling then I recommend popping out &amp; getting a real toothbrush &amp; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Wisps fit easily in a purse, the glove compartment of your car, your desk drawer, and more.  </li>
            <li>They have a funky taste but they can clean the teeth pretty good.</li>
            <li>Since you don&#x27;t need to rinse with water, you can easily use Wisps even in the</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to to hold, and extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Love these for during the day when at work and need to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>It fits in my purse easily &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: the Wisp isn&#x27;t going to replace my regular toothbrush, but it looks like having a pack handy for those occasions when nothing else but brushing will do would be a good thing.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if you have garlic, onions or another strong food for lunch, you cannot get the taste out of your mouth all day - gum, mints, nothing will work.  </li>
            <li>Everyone likes to have clean, fresh teeth and mouth, and \\&quot;Colgate Wisp\\&quot; is quite handy for that.</li>
            <li>The mint freshener works fine, and the end of the handle is a flexible toothpick.  </li>
            <li>For the places that we will &#x27;stash&#x27; them, it will be fine because we have water at work and at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything came in fine.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy peppermint mints and gum, even the curiously strong Altoids, but</li>
            <li>Wisps are a wonderful invention, a little disposable toothbrush for on-the-go breath freshening and a toothpick.  </li>
            <li>these pre flavored little brush piks are the perfect on the go tooth care</li>
            <li>are not of course the best toothbrushes in the world, but if you&#x27;re not prone to carrying a full size toothbrush and toothpaste, this is a great way to freshen up your mouth for that important meeting or other encounter such as a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think these are great as a back up brush for in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Pricing is important, as well since the item is used once.     </li>
            <li>I can easily fit the pack into my bag tiniest of bags, even in the pocket of my jeans if I need to.    </li>
            <li>B000296Z0I Oral B Brush-ups, Textured Teeth Wipes, 12 wipes]]&lt;br /&gt;These are textured sleeves which fit over your finger, impregnated with minty freshness.  </li>
            <li>These are textured sleeves which fit over your finger, impregnated with minty freshness.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great idea that I went out and bought some.  </li>
            <li>and i love it sooo much , so useful and can take it with you to any where , i will by it again</li>
            <li>They fit into my bag and you can carry them anywhere you go.</li>
            <li>Otherwise good old fashioned teeth brushing still can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t replace a good old toothbrush, but then I guess it&#x27;s not supposed to.</li>
            <li>We thought since they were small, fairly easy to use, and supposedly no water needed they would be perfect for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally got these when I was out camping and didn&#x27;t trust the water I had available.</li>
            <li>I found the packaging to be very easy to open, and the brushes come out very easily.  </li>
            <li>Travel friendly</li>
            <li>The Colgate Wisp is a unique product in that you do not need water and the toothpaste is already on the brush.</li>
            <li>I love these little wisp, great to have in your purse and specially when I travel.</li>
            <li>I use them whenever we have salad or something else that gets stuff in my braces to clean my teeth and braces after lunch unless I don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel clean and l recommend brushing your toungue too.</li>
            <li>I feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>but it gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li>Though Colgate&#x27;s \\&quot;Wisp\\&quot; is a good concept -- a travel-friendly method of refreshing your breath -- I still think you&#x27;re better off bringing a bit of mouthwash in a small container</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love that it is one more thing to throw away -- just not very green.</li>
            <li>think Colgate got this one just right!</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m aware that these nifty little brushes are no substitute for a \\&quot;real\\&quot; brushing, they&#x27;re perfect for when I&#x27;m in a rush or on the go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wisps are also good for outdoor sports, particularly camping, where you have a lack of facilities and though you could live without brushing your teeth would really feel more comfortable if you did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>what a cool concept.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is not as intense as mouthwash but (to me) stronger than most mint gum flavors.</li>
            <li>I also liked how soft the bristles were on mine.</li>
            <li>I loved those tiny brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle on my very sensitive gums, but did a good job of getting food out of my teeth after meals.</li>
            <li>(if you buy a value jumbo bottle of mouth wash and funnel it yourself, it ends up being much more cost effective) or, better yet, a small toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A single-use mini toothbrush with a breath freshening bead that allows you to have a clean, fresh mouth anywhere, anytime no water or rinsing</li>
            <li>For the final interview though, I had a Wisp in my pocket, so I had a snack (Yodells), then brushed my teeth in the train station men&#x27;s room, and was flawless for my meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>When you are on the go and need a quick way to freshen your breath and remove food particles from your teeth, Colgate Wisps will do to the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate</li>
            <li>Still, I felt like it was plenty adequate as a toothbrush</li>
            <li>Luckily I tried one just for the heck of it.</li>
            <li>having some handy for occasions when there&#x27;d be no other alternative makes a lot of sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a little dab of breathminty stuff in the middle that serves as a toothpaste and is delicious and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is not only double charging, but incredibly unethical to sell supposedly free samples in any retail capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is so \\&quot;not green\\&quot;, and it is easy to come up with a quick solution that is much cheaper and \\&quot;greener\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>The bristles do seem hard at first, but one you get the gel and some saliva on them, they work great!     </li>
            <li>Love that it is so handy - takes up so much less space than a travel toothbrush and mini  toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is pleasant enough, but you will still want to head to a sink to spit and rinse (I suppose if you&#x27;re really on-the-go, you could swallow, but</li>
            <li>Use one stay fresh all day</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a real hurry, aren&#x27;t near a sink, and your breath is really foul, then these would be a good option.</li>
            <li>Now you show up to your meeting with fresh breath....and sticky hands...</li>
            <li>covered things you might need if your breath is fresh enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The juice is a good idea, you break open the back and start scrubbing your mouth and it  does refresh and seem to work OK.  </li>
            <li>Just to have a fresh mouth.</li>
            <li>cool thing is one brush actually fits in my wallet, which is nice to have during a long day of eating and drinking.. and the girls can very easily stash them in their purses or wallets as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As of right now my review of the product is it was made to just freshen breath</li>
            <li>do you really want to with a mouth full of minty saliva and debris from your teeth?).</li>
            <li>It is small, portable and works great.  </li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s a fine point, it is really flimsy and cannot really get anything that is stuck in between teeth.    </li>
            <li>When I first saw Colgate Wisp</li>
            <li>After the first time I got used to the idea of not rinsing.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m aware that method seems archaic and troublesome.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try these for awhile, and was glad that I finally had a chance to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>On some of my gigs we get meals as a courtesy and being able to brush afterwards is a big help.</li>
            <li>They offered to ship more overnight and waive the shipping charge if I wanted to place another order for the same thing.  </li>
            <li>First, swish and rinse with the water.</li>
            <li>While it is better than nothing I will not be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is ok everything about the description is skewed such as 16 count pack of 2.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes can&#x27;t find them anywhere locally</li>
            <li>There are many times I have been in my vehicle going somewhere and wished I had brushed my teeth.  </li>
            <li>SUGGESTION:  Making it bigger would make it cost more and become bulky too, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested to try a spearmint version as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth, gentle, leaves mouth and breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>That is way too much!</li>
            <li>They are good to keep in the desk for a messy lunch or some thing like that.</li>
            <li>They work great with a small amount of tooth paste already in the brush!</li>
            <li>would take a star away in comparison to a regular toothbrush, but for the unique functionality, portability, and handiness of this item it gets the full five.</li>
            <li>These, of course, aren&#x27;t meant to replace tooth brushing, but in my opinion, if you&#x27;re already at the sink anyway, you might as well just use mouthwash or quickly use a travel brush and paste to do the job; the bristles would be soft, and the paste would help get any garlic or any other offensive odor out of your mouth much more effectively, even if you&#x27;re rushing to get back to your date.</li>
            <li>Finally, the pick is only good at getting something out of your teeth that isn&#x27;t stuck--</li>
            <li>They should really make this more obvious.  </li>
            <li>While the flavor is good and keeps breath fresh as well as a lozenge does, the brush is not easy to handle (it is so small) and there is no bristle height to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Price is higher than is reasonable, however.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t do a good job cleaning and it is so small, using it gave my thumb a cramp.  </li>
            <li>They left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>then, Colgate doesn&#x27;t intend for Wisps to take the place of brushing your teeth, only to supplement during those times when you can&#x27;t easily brush.  </li>
            <li>They are good toothbrushes for on the go, but not for everyday use as replacement for your normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>breath bead certainly gives a nice momentary fresh feeling in your mouth, although it won&#x27;t last as long as brushing will, of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits in my briefcase and does a fine job \\&quot;brushing up\\&quot; on my teeth while traveling, especially after eating a meal at the airport.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had something really pungent then you&#x27;ll still need a breath mint to really finish the job, but it really helps your teeth feel cleaner.   </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li>l highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing compared to a brush though.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product beyond a real emergency.</li>
            <li>and it really is a must have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it does freshen you up, it wouldn&#x27;t do for a whole weekend.  </li>
            <li>like my whole mouth was freshened.</li>
            <li>Though they did not come in the package shown, that really doesn&#x27;t matter, does it?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure would be handy for a multitude of other purposes like cleaning dirt out of tight spaces or polishing up a silver ring (or ornate silver surface) in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Your date will be pleasantly surprised later when she realizes how fresh and clean your breath is.  </li>
            <li>They will not replace my toothbrush, of course, partially due to cost and environmental concerns, but there is nothing better for travel or to throw in my purse.</li>
            <li>Strange as it seems, these brushes work great on my little 5 pound dog.  </li>
            <li>They actually make your teeth feel CLEAN.    </li>
            <li>I am fairly diligent about brushing while away from home, and, I sanitize my assortment of ordinary soft toothbrushes myself.  </li>
            <li>I really use these on a daily basis and not just for a quick travel use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be about the same price and last much longer as well as have much better results.</li>
            <li>They have a slight refreshing flavor that isn&#x27;t over powering but reminescent of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>all I can&#x27;t really see my way clear to recommending these things to anyone for much of anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a nice size, the small pick on the opposite side as the brush easily dislodges big leftover bits...  and the brush is a reasonable size to use while still being pocket sized.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that the mint drop in the middle didn&#x27;t really taste all that great &amp; I wanted to rinse my mouth out afterwards because it was such a strong taste.</li>
            <li>The price at which they sell is a little steep, however, if it is something you are willing to invest in and keep discrete, this is a fine tool to use.</li>
            <li>Even the little pearl of gel provided nothing in the way of a refreshing feeling.     </li>
            <li>I love these little brushes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use the toothpick end of the Wisp, and I thought it was too soft.  </li>
            <li>I suspect I&#x27;m not the only musician who&#x27;d find this useful</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to go to that trouble, you can put together a kit with one or more of these items and keep them in your desk or car:</li>
            <li>If anyone remembers those Crest brush-on-the-go things from a few years ago (rip, slip, brush, aahh), these portable brushes are worlds better.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I love using Colgate Wisps.</li>
            <li>covered things you might need if your breath is fresh enough.      </li>
            <li>Yes, anyone paying close attention would not have       to worry about this, but imagine the kind of people who are going to be using      this, or at least some of them.  </li>
            <li>Get a quick, refreshing dose of oral hygiene from a package small enough to hide in a pocket.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are individually sealed yet open easily from a foil backing.</li>
            <li>Same can be said of the bristles- just the right firmness.</li>
            <li>Most come with a lot in a large bag and it makes it hard to carry in the purse.  </li>
            <li>Left my teeth feeling clean and breath fresh and the tooth pick on the other end</li>
            <li>In the middle of the brush is a center of mint (or whatever flavor) that bursts with use and provides a refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>Green and clean!</li>
            <li>Just like any other \\&quot;mini\\&quot; item, they&#x27;re harder for adults to use effectively.</li>
            <li>These little \\&quot;wisps\\&quot; are perfect for the office, you don&#x27;t look silly bringing a whole bottle of toothpaste and a toothbrush into a public office restroom, if you happen to work in a large office like myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tip is a good combination of being firm enough to use as a toothpick yet soft enough to not hurt gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the cost on these is high, I won&#x27;t be using them everyday, but will most likely keep them in my desk and work and use them when I&#x27;ve had a pungent lunch.  </li>
            <li>Of course this might be a positive if you are an environazi hatin&#x27; SUV driver and want to freshen up after eating your BK double cheeseburger with beef from clear cut rainforest...</li>
            <li>product itself is just fine, but Dealway (who I bought it from) is not fine.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re packaged two in one blister so with this much space I could actually store a travel toothbrush and a travel</li>
            <li>They say that you don&#x27;t need a sink or water, but my experience was that after I was done using it, you have enough saliva from the minty capsule that you really want some place to spit and rinse.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are much easier to open (one handed, while driving, speaking from experience) and easier to use (slip it over your finger and then rub your teeth, gums, etc)  </li>
            <li>They are much easier to open (</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter is a competition dancer who has braces.</li>
            <li>You have to really try to get back to brush your       tongue and rear teeth.    </li>
            <li>Finally, I bet very soon some intoxicated person is going to be using this and lose       it</li>
            <li>maybe  we will eventually see a big handle that you store the wisps inside and replace them  after each use that allows you to brush your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>Everything about this is a complete waste.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Could the packaging be bigger and waste more plastic</li>
            <li>The bristles are teeny tiny and seem to fray rather quickly (after trying to clean only one side of a few teeth?)</li>
            <li>Next is the size of the toothbrush--if you have small hands, it probably works fine, but I&#x27;ve got large hands and just brushing for a couple minutes gave my thumb cramps.  </li>
            <li>There is a small \\&quot;pick\\&quot; that slides easily under brackets to help out too.</li>
            <li>My breath felt a little fresher, but still wasn&#x27;t that \\&quot;just brushed\\&quot; clean feeling.</li>
            <li>First of all, you get four in a package, they&#x27;re individually sealed, and they&#x27;re small enough to easily tuck in a purse.  </li>
            <li>it were a touch longer it would be easier to use, particularly when using on the back</li>
            <li>However, I can NOT recommend this product for use on a daily basis, mainly because it is SO wasteful to use a toothbrush and then throw it away every day, not to mention all the packaging that must be disposed of, too.</li>
            <li>I was just using as a quick freshen up before a dental appointment...while I did feel slightly fresher in the mouth</li>
            <li>total shipping was high</li>
            <li>Once I understood that I was expected to pay for another order in order to receive what I thought I ordered in the first place, I suggested they correct the item description and send me a return label.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a big plus, from me, because I feel like I need to rinse meticulously after normal toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li>The ball didn&#x27;t last long enough to really feel like my whole mouth was freshened.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not up to the level of scrubbing one would get from a conventional full size tooth brush, but they work well enough for this.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle, antibacterial wash that doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this four times I decided the only advantage this has is that it&#x27;s smaller (not by much) than the smallest travel toothbrushes and you don&#x27;t have to carry around any toothpaste - you can also use those without a sink if you have a kleenex to spit into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next floss carefully (learn to do it right, curving it around each tooth and under the gum).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations when I tries these little disposable toothbrushes for the first time, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Reality, however, was far different from my expectations.      </li>
            <li>My first thought about this product was what a odd idea.  </li>
            <li>I also think back packers might like these because they are so light, small, compact and technically do not need water to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically a mini toothbrush with a blue alien fish egg in the middle filled with minty freshness.</li>
            <li>(I assume where the capsule leaked / ruptured), but the other side didn&#x27;t get much.</li>
            <li>We were lucky to have these along (in my purse) when we we took a trip and found we&#x27;d left certain essential toiletries behind.</li>
            <li>I cannot see myself using the product more than occasionally for the \\&quot;breath emergency\\&quot; - which is disappointing because I did have very high hopes for the product.  </li>
            <li>Gently brush, opposite end is a sharp point (toothpick), and throw away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A small dab of a peppermint flavored cleaning gel embedded in the brush end provides extra cleaning action and freshening of breath; it&#x27;s small but potent.</li>
            <li>Reading the ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t appear to have fluoride, which could possibly have been a redeeming value for keeping teeth strong / healthy (though I doubt it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up just using my regular toothbrush after the miserable failure with these things.&lt;br</li>
            <li>*is* a toothbrush, it really isn&#x27;t in my opinion) about the size of your finger or perhaps a little larger with a head about the size of your pinky fingernail.</li>

            <li> is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> that would be perfect, with maybe one Swiss-army style  removable toothpick for those that want to use it.    </li>
            <li> The Wisp is the perfect portable solution without having to lug a toothbrush and toothpaste to the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> and don&#x27;t seem to do an especially good job of cleaning or getting around / between teeth.</li>

            <li> Great for keeping in your car.</li>

            <li> This is a great product for just that need.  </li>
            <li> great idea, a mini toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> And the rubber pick is great.</li>
            <li> These things are a great idea.</li>
            <li> (Soup &amp; Frito breath isn&#x27;t exactly a great aroma to have on your breath.)</li>
            <li> The peppermint taste is great.</li>
            <li> Great idea</li>
            <li> Was on time which was great...</li>
            <li> Great idea.  </li>

            <li> Great idea and handy to take along.  </li>
            <li> So as in all things, this mini toothbrush from Colgate is a good idea with some pros and cons.    </li>
            <li> so it takes a while to get good coverage -</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm and she loved the portability.</li>
            <li> it a good value?</li>
            <li> Good for travel too.</li>
            <li> I received a sample and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> Colgate Wisp doesn&#x27;t replace your toothbrush and its not meant to, but as a disposable and functional brush, it is a good product to have.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a good thing if you don&#x27;t like bringing your toothbrush to work with you or if you are stuck in a situation where you can&#x27;t, like at a work meeting or something.</li>
            <li> I had thought that perhaps these would be good for something.</li>
            <li> These are also good for little&lt;br /&gt;kids.</li>
            <li> peppermint taste is so good.</li>
            <li> so these are the perfect tool to keep my teeth clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, the Wisp leaves the mouth with a nice mint flavor</li>
            <li> There are more brushes than I need but they are great at the end of a red-eye flight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are great for your gums and keep mine quite healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the minty freshness!</li>
            <li> These are amazing for work.  </li>
            <li> - this might be a nice gift idea for musician friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, now it&#x27;s covered with your spit, so kind of slippery too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the flavor, and didn&#x27;t feel like I had to rinse after -</li>
            <li> Probably a nice thing to offer guests, if they inquire about a toothpick or something, too.</li>
            <li> I liked the pepermint gel flavor -</li>
            <li> I think it is a great idea, but I am  not so sure it does not need some more work.    </li>
            <li> This is just my honest feedback after using one pack.</li>
            <li> They are so handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> But it seems like it&#x27;s a capsule and not any kind of slow-release ball.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal!  </li>
            <li> and I was suitable to work around others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in your briefcase, pocket, or backpack, these are ideal for those who want to maintain a fresh mouth after meals when you don&#x27;t have time or are not in a location where you can fully brush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazingly clean after and my breath is so good.</li>
            <li> it was a pleasant  sensation, a nice gum massage and my teeth felt smooth and clean after I used  it.  </li>
            <li> It is not overpowering, and is pleasant and makes your  mouth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> These wisp tooth brushes are so handy to keep in your car, or bottom of your purse when you need a quick brush-up!  </li>
            <li> They certainly don&#x27;t replace brushing but are great in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Okay, so let&#x27;s just stick with the teeth up front.  </li>
            <li> I tried some spearmint Wisps and found that flavor much more to my liking.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with these.</li>
            <li> I tried [[ASIN:B000296Z0I Oral B Brush-ups, Textured Teeth Wipes]] and they just didn&#x27;t work any better then rubbing my teeth with a napkin or paper towel.  </li>
            <li> My son loved the tiny size and declared them a great invention, but I still craved my full-sized brush to do a thorough job.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;ll purchase more to keep in my purse for emergencies.</li>
            <li> I am unclear whether this represents an elaborate toothpick  or an infant&#x27;s size toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They are a comfortable size, and I liked the toothpick on one end.</li>
            <li> Within the plastic carry-case (which is perfect for a purse or glove box), the brushes are individually foil sealed, eliminating worries about leaving them in the car or in the bottom of my bag.</li>
            <li> These are OK toothbrushes for on the go or for school if you have braces.</li>
            <li> &quot; brand has the most Xylitol.  </li>
            <li> Ok I will review it for amazon.  </li>
            <li> I suspect for many people.  </li>
            <li> I have used these before many a time knowing they came in a pack of 4</li>
            <li> Because I have braces I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m depending on these more and more.</li>
            <li> These are just ok.</li>
            <li> I was really glad to see this product.  </li>
            <li> but they are cute</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, so glad that someone suggestion</li>
            <li> I love the concept of the Colgate Wisp waterless toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I had something better to say.feel</li>
            <li> Wish I had something better to say.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is built in, and it says it is Ok to swallow.</li>
            <li> this brushes is so cute</li>
            <li> I can see many uses for these with children, people with braces or mouth surgeries.  </li>
            <li> I would not avoid buying this product, but make sure that you&#x27;re not buying it from weasels.</li>
            <li> Much better than gum.</li>
            <li> Great to keep in my purse when out for the whole day or when traveling and stop for lunch.  </li>
            <li> It is a very nice mough freshener and the quick brusl for the teeth keeps them feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I love the nice, clean feeling I get after using a Wisp.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice &amp; clean, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However these would come in handy for special circumstances, like camping at festivals, red-eye flights, etc.</li>
            <li> These are a good idea, and they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> bristles do a fine job of removing most debris and some plaque.  </li>
            <li> This is good for after meals where you can&#x27;t get a toothbrush, but if you are traveling then I recommend popping out &amp; getting a real toothbrush &amp; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Wisps fit easily in a purse, the glove compartment of your car, your desk drawer, and more.  </li>
            <li> They have a funky taste but they can clean the teeth pretty good.</li>
            <li> Since you don&#x27;t need to rinse with water, you can easily use Wisps even in the</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to to hold, and extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Love these for during the day when at work and need to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> It fits in my purse easily &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: the Wisp isn&#x27;t going to replace my regular toothbrush, but it looks like having a pack handy for those occasions when nothing else but brushing will do would be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if you have garlic, onions or another strong food for lunch, you cannot get the taste out of your mouth all day - gum, mints, nothing will work.  </li>
            <li> Everyone likes to have clean, fresh teeth and mouth, and \\&quot;Colgate Wisp\\&quot; is quite handy for that.</li>
            <li> The mint freshener works fine, and the end of the handle is a flexible toothpick.  </li>
            <li> For the places that we will &#x27;stash&#x27; them, it will be fine because we have water at work and at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything came in fine.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy peppermint mints and gum, even the curiously strong Altoids, but</li>
            <li> Wisps are a wonderful invention, a little disposable toothbrush for on-the-go breath freshening and a toothpick.  </li>
            <li> these pre flavored little brush piks are the perfect on the go tooth care</li>
            <li> are not of course the best toothbrushes in the world, but if you&#x27;re not prone to carrying a full size toothbrush and toothpaste, this is a great way to freshen up your mouth for that important meeting or other encounter such as a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think these are great as a back up brush for in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Pricing is important, as well since the item is used once.     </li>
            <li> I can easily fit the pack into my bag tiniest of bags, even in the pocket of my jeans if I need to.    </li>
            <li> B000296Z0I Oral B Brush-ups, Textured Teeth Wipes, 12 wipes]]&lt;br /&gt;These are textured sleeves which fit over your finger, impregnated with minty freshness.  </li>
            <li> These are textured sleeves which fit over your finger, impregnated with minty freshness.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great idea that I went out and bought some.  </li>
            <li> and i love it sooo much , so useful and can take it with you to any where , i will by it again</li>
            <li> They fit into my bag and you can carry them anywhere you go.</li>
            <li> Otherwise good old fashioned teeth brushing still can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t replace a good old toothbrush, but then I guess it&#x27;s not supposed to.</li>
            <li> We thought since they were small, fairly easy to use, and supposedly no water needed they would be perfect for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally got these when I was out camping and didn&#x27;t trust the water I had available.</li>
            <li> I found the packaging to be very easy to open, and the brushes come out very easily.  </li>
            <li> Travel friendly</li>
            <li> The Colgate Wisp is a unique product in that you do not need water and the toothpaste is already on the brush.</li>
            <li> I love these little wisp, great to have in your purse and specially when I travel.</li>
            <li> I use them whenever we have salad or something else that gets stuff in my braces to clean my teeth and braces after lunch unless I don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel clean and l recommend brushing your toungue too.</li>
            <li> I feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> but it gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li> Though Colgate&#x27;s \\&quot;Wisp\\&quot; is a good concept -- a travel-friendly method of refreshing your breath -- I still think you&#x27;re better off bringing a bit of mouthwash in a small container</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love that it is one more thing to throw away -- just not very green.</li>
            <li> think Colgate got this one just right!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m aware that these nifty little brushes are no substitute for a \\&quot;real\\&quot; brushing, they&#x27;re perfect for when I&#x27;m in a rush or on the go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wisps are also good for outdoor sports, particularly camping, where you have a lack of facilities and though you could live without brushing your teeth would really feel more comfortable if you did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> what a cool concept.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is not as intense as mouthwash but (to me) stronger than most mint gum flavors.</li>
            <li> I also liked how soft the bristles were on mine.</li>
            <li> I loved those tiny brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle on my very sensitive gums, but did a good job of getting food out of my teeth after meals.</li>
            <li> (if you buy a value jumbo bottle of mouth wash and funnel it yourself, it ends up being much more cost effective) or, better yet, a small toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A single-use mini toothbrush with a breath freshening bead that allows you to have a clean, fresh mouth anywhere, anytime no water or rinsing</li>
            <li> For the final interview though, I had a Wisp in my pocket, so I had a snack (Yodells), then brushed my teeth in the train station men&#x27;s room, and was flawless for my meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> When you are on the go and need a quick way to freshen your breath and remove food particles from your teeth, Colgate Wisps will do to the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate</li>
            <li> Still, I felt like it was plenty adequate as a toothbrush</li>
            <li> Luckily I tried one just for the heck of it.</li>
            <li> having some handy for occasions when there&#x27;d be no other alternative makes a lot of sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a little dab of breathminty stuff in the middle that serves as a toothpaste and is delicious and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is not only double charging, but incredibly unethical to sell supposedly free samples in any retail capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is so \\&quot;not green\\&quot;, and it is easy to come up with a quick solution that is much cheaper and \\&quot;greener\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> The bristles do seem hard at first, but one you get the gel and some saliva on them, they work great!     </li>
            <li> Love that it is so handy - takes up so much less space than a travel toothbrush and mini  toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is pleasant enough, but you will still want to head to a sink to spit and rinse (I suppose if you&#x27;re really on-the-go, you could swallow, but</li>
            <li> Use one stay fresh all day</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a real hurry, aren&#x27;t near a sink, and your breath is really foul, then these would be a good option.</li>
            <li> Now you show up to your meeting with fresh breath....and sticky hands...</li>
            <li> covered things you might need if your breath is fresh enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The juice is a good idea, you break open the back and start scrubbing your mouth and it  does refresh and seem to work OK.  </li>
            <li> Just to have a fresh mouth.</li>
            <li> cool thing is one brush actually fits in my wallet, which is nice to have during a long day of eating and drinking.. and the girls can very easily stash them in their purses or wallets as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As of right now my review of the product is it was made to just freshen breath</li>
            <li> do you really want to with a mouth full of minty saliva and debris from your teeth?).</li>
            <li> It is small, portable and works great.  </li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a fine point, it is really flimsy and cannot really get anything that is stuck in between teeth.    </li>
            <li> When I first saw Colgate Wisp</li>
            <li> After the first time I got used to the idea of not rinsing.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m aware that method seems archaic and troublesome.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try these for awhile, and was glad that I finally had a chance to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these!</li>
            <li> On some of my gigs we get meals as a courtesy and being able to brush afterwards is a big help.</li>
            <li> They offered to ship more overnight and waive the shipping charge if I wanted to place another order for the same thing.  </li>
            <li> First, swish and rinse with the water.</li>
            <li> While it is better than nothing I will not be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is ok everything about the description is skewed such as 16 count pack of 2.  </li>
            <li> Love these brushes can&#x27;t find them anywhere locally</li>
            <li> There are many times I have been in my vehicle going somewhere and wished I had brushed my teeth.  </li>
            <li> SUGGESTION:  Making it bigger would make it cost more and become bulky too, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested to try a spearmint version as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth, gentle, leaves mouth and breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> That is way too much!</li>
            <li> They are good to keep in the desk for a messy lunch or some thing like that.</li>
            <li> They work great with a small amount of tooth paste already in the brush!</li>
            <li> would take a star away in comparison to a regular toothbrush, but for the unique functionality, portability, and handiness of this item it gets the full five.</li>
            <li> These, of course, aren&#x27;t meant to replace tooth brushing, but in my opinion, if you&#x27;re already at the sink anyway, you might as well just use mouthwash or quickly use a travel brush and paste to do the job; the bristles would be soft, and the paste would help get any garlic or any other offensive odor out of your mouth much more effectively, even if you&#x27;re rushing to get back to your date.</li>
            <li> Finally, the pick is only good at getting something out of your teeth that isn&#x27;t stuck--</li>
            <li> They should really make this more obvious.  </li>
            <li> While the flavor is good and keeps breath fresh as well as a lozenge does, the brush is not easy to handle (it is so small) and there is no bristle height to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Price is higher than is reasonable, however.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t do a good job cleaning and it is so small, using it gave my thumb a cramp.  </li>
            <li> They left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> then, Colgate doesn&#x27;t intend for Wisps to take the place of brushing your teeth, only to supplement during those times when you can&#x27;t easily brush.  </li>
            <li> They are good toothbrushes for on the go, but not for everyday use as replacement for your normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> breath bead certainly gives a nice momentary fresh feeling in your mouth, although it won&#x27;t last as long as brushing will, of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits in my briefcase and does a fine job \\&quot;brushing up\\&quot; on my teeth while traveling, especially after eating a meal at the airport.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had something really pungent then you&#x27;ll still need a breath mint to really finish the job, but it really helps your teeth feel cleaner.   </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li> l highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing compared to a brush though.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product beyond a real emergency.</li>
            <li> and it really is a must have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it does freshen you up, it wouldn&#x27;t do for a whole weekend.  </li>
            <li> like my whole mouth was freshened.</li>
            <li> Though they did not come in the package shown, that really doesn&#x27;t matter, does it?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure would be handy for a multitude of other purposes like cleaning dirt out of tight spaces or polishing up a silver ring (or ornate silver surface) in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Your date will be pleasantly surprised later when she realizes how fresh and clean your breath is.  </li>
            <li> They will not replace my toothbrush, of course, partially due to cost and environmental concerns, but there is nothing better for travel or to throw in my purse.</li>
            <li> Strange as it seems, these brushes work great on my little 5 pound dog.  </li>
            <li> They actually make your teeth feel CLEAN.    </li>
            <li> I am fairly diligent about brushing while away from home, and, I sanitize my assortment of ordinary soft toothbrushes myself.  </li>
            <li> I really use these on a daily basis and not just for a quick travel use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be about the same price and last much longer as well as have much better results.</li>
            <li> They have a slight refreshing flavor that isn&#x27;t over powering but reminescent of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> all I can&#x27;t really see my way clear to recommending these things to anyone for much of anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a nice size, the small pick on the opposite side as the brush easily dislodges big leftover bits...  and the brush is a reasonable size to use while still being pocket sized.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the mint drop in the middle didn&#x27;t really taste all that great &amp; I wanted to rinse my mouth out afterwards because it was such a strong taste.</li>
            <li> The price at which they sell is a little steep, however, if it is something you are willing to invest in and keep discrete, this is a fine tool to use.</li>
            <li> Even the little pearl of gel provided nothing in the way of a refreshing feeling.     </li>
            <li> I love these little brushes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to use the toothpick end of the Wisp, and I thought it was too soft.  </li>
            <li> I suspect I&#x27;m not the only musician who&#x27;d find this useful</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to go to that trouble, you can put together a kit with one or more of these items and keep them in your desk or car:</li>
            <li> If anyone remembers those Crest brush-on-the-go things from a few years ago (rip, slip, brush, aahh), these portable brushes are worlds better.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I love using Colgate Wisps.</li>
            <li> covered things you might need if your breath is fresh enough.      </li>
            <li> Yes, anyone paying close attention would not have       to worry about this, but imagine the kind of people who are going to be using      this, or at least some of them.  </li>
            <li> Get a quick, refreshing dose of oral hygiene from a package small enough to hide in a pocket.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are individually sealed yet open easily from a foil backing.</li>
            <li> Same can be said of the bristles- just the right firmness.</li>
            <li> Most come with a lot in a large bag and it makes it hard to carry in the purse.  </li>
            <li> Left my teeth feeling clean and breath fresh and the tooth pick on the other end</li>
            <li> In the middle of the brush is a center of mint (or whatever flavor) that bursts with use and provides a refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> Green and clean!</li>
            <li> Just like any other \\&quot;mini\\&quot; item, they&#x27;re harder for adults to use effectively.</li>
            <li> These little \\&quot;wisps\\&quot; are perfect for the office, you don&#x27;t look silly bringing a whole bottle of toothpaste and a toothbrush into a public office restroom, if you happen to work in a large office like myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tip is a good combination of being firm enough to use as a toothpick yet soft enough to not hurt gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the cost on these is high, I won&#x27;t be using them everyday, but will most likely keep them in my desk and work and use them when I&#x27;ve had a pungent lunch.  </li>
            <li> Of course this might be a positive if you are an environazi hatin&#x27; SUV driver and want to freshen up after eating your BK double cheeseburger with beef from clear cut rainforest...</li>
            <li> product itself is just fine, but Dealway (who I bought it from) is not fine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re packaged two in one blister so with this much space I could actually store a travel toothbrush and a travel</li>
            <li> They say that you don&#x27;t need a sink or water, but my experience was that after I was done using it, you have enough saliva from the minty capsule that you really want some place to spit and rinse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are much easier to open (one handed, while driving, speaking from experience) and easier to use (slip it over your finger and then rub your teeth, gums, etc)  </li>
            <li> They are much easier to open (</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter is a competition dancer who has braces.</li>
            <li> You have to really try to get back to brush your       tongue and rear teeth.    </li>
            <li> Finally, I bet very soon some intoxicated person is going to be using this and lose       it</li>
            <li> maybe  we will eventually see a big handle that you store the wisps inside and replace them  after each use that allows you to brush your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> Everything about this is a complete waste.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Could the packaging be bigger and waste more plastic</li>
            <li> The bristles are teeny tiny and seem to fray rather quickly (after trying to clean only one side of a few teeth?)</li>
            <li> Next is the size of the toothbrush--if you have small hands, it probably works fine, but I&#x27;ve got large hands and just brushing for a couple minutes gave my thumb cramps.  </li>
            <li> There is a small \\&quot;pick\\&quot; that slides easily under brackets to help out too.</li>
            <li> My breath felt a little fresher, but still wasn&#x27;t that \\&quot;just brushed\\&quot; clean feeling.</li>
            <li> First of all, you get four in a package, they&#x27;re individually sealed, and they&#x27;re small enough to easily tuck in a purse.  </li>
            <li> it were a touch longer it would be easier to use, particularly when using on the back</li>
            <li> However, I can NOT recommend this product for use on a daily basis, mainly because it is SO wasteful to use a toothbrush and then throw it away every day, not to mention all the packaging that must be disposed of, too.</li>
            <li> I was just using as a quick freshen up before a dental appointment...while I did feel slightly fresher in the mouth</li>
            <li> total shipping was high</li>
            <li> Once I understood that I was expected to pay for another order in order to receive what I thought I ordered in the first place, I suggested they correct the item description and send me a return label.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a big plus, from me, because I feel like I need to rinse meticulously after normal toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li> The ball didn&#x27;t last long enough to really feel like my whole mouth was freshened.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not up to the level of scrubbing one would get from a conventional full size tooth brush, but they work well enough for this.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle, antibacterial wash that doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this four times I decided the only advantage this has is that it&#x27;s smaller (not by much) than the smallest travel toothbrushes and you don&#x27;t have to carry around any toothpaste - you can also use those without a sink if you have a kleenex to spit into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next floss carefully (learn to do it right, curving it around each tooth and under the gum).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations when I tries these little disposable toothbrushes for the first time, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Reality, however, was far different from my expectations.      </li>
            <li> My first thought about this product was what a odd idea.  </li>
            <li> I also think back packers might like these because they are so light, small, compact and technically do not need water to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically a mini toothbrush with a blue alien fish egg in the middle filled with minty freshness.</li>
            <li> (I assume where the capsule leaked / ruptured), but the other side didn&#x27;t get much.</li>
            <li> We were lucky to have these along (in my purse) when we we took a trip and found we&#x27;d left certain essential toiletries behind.</li>
            <li> I cannot see myself using the product more than occasionally for the \\&quot;breath emergency\\&quot; - which is disappointing because I did have very high hopes for the product.  </li>
            <li> Gently brush, opposite end is a sharp point (toothpick), and throw away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small dab of a peppermint flavored cleaning gel embedded in the brush end provides extra cleaning action and freshening of breath; it&#x27;s small but potent.</li>
            <li> Reading the ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t appear to have fluoride, which could possibly have been a redeeming value for keeping teeth strong / healthy (though I doubt it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up just using my regular toothbrush after the miserable failure with these things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> *is* a toothbrush, it really isn&#x27;t in my opinion) about the size of your finger or perhaps a little larger with a head about the size of your pinky fingernail.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff and really take the plaque off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the Wisp is small which might be a problem for someone with large hands, but I coped well enough.</li>
            <li> The brush head is so small that it was hard to feel how I was brushing, but it&#x27;s definitely better than no toothbrush at all.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this product is convenient--super portable, and sanitary--and it does a decent job, with some flaws, like the handle being too short, and the bristles being a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> Appearance is important in these interviews of course, so when I went to the first one, despite being horribly hungry right before the interview, I couldn&#x27;t eat anything for fear that I would have pieces of food in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it would if I&#x27;d have brushed or if I&#x27;d have used some mouthwash</li>
            <li> First, the packaging does not allow for single toothbrush travel--you must take at least two, and the packaging although small is pretty bulky in a pocket.  </li>
            <li> And, the minty feeling from these doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about as long as my middle finger&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I wanted to know how long the flavor would last, I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; is palatable, but it does not last long enough to really freshen your breath--likewise trying to brush your tongue clean is a painful process.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be more some generic artificial ingredients aimed at breath-freshening.</li>
            <li> 3) Same as above, but once this thing gets wet</li>
            <li> and it is hard       to push it back in place of keep it steady.    </li>
            <li> Also, to clean the surfaces of your teeth, simply use the napkin---no need to get those silly finger wipe things.    </li>
            <li> The bristles are like a vegetable scrubber, small, pointy and stiff--they&#x27;re painful if you have sensitive gums, and they don&#x27;t really brush the teeth clean as well as a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I thought there would at least be a bit of real toothpaste on the brush.  </li>
            <li> Fingers can end up in the mouth if one tries for those molars back there.  </li>
            <li> bristles of the brush end are not exactly soft, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I got these Wisps in an effort to help her for those long days of competition so she could brush backstage after snacks and meals.</li>
            <li> you have a long day.  </li>
            <li> My other problem is that the flavor bead is a little intense and I do agree with the other reviewers I had to urge to rinse my mouth out with water afterwards (which does defeat the portability water-free aspect).  </li>
            <li> My seller was TLinc, but I see other reviewers having the same issue from another vendor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using it, my teeth felt as clean as if I just popped in a breath mint.  </li>
            <li> Intended for just one use each, the breath bead lasts only for a few minutes, so you want to cover the entire tooth area before concentrating on one spot or you&#x27;ll not spread the breath bead around.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews, but I guess we all have different hand and mouth sizes, as well as manual dexterity.</li>
            <li> I would definitely take the trouble to pack a regular brush and toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The wisp toothbrushes are way too small for an adult.   </li>
            <li> there is a toothpick to get loose meals dislodged from your teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it is going to swallow it, or choke on it because it is going to get loose in       their hand and kill someone.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work and the brush is very firm, way too firm</li>
            <li> These little disposable toothbrushes are convenient for use when you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush, but they are tiny and the plastic bristles don&#x27;t feel like toothbrush bristles.  </li>
            <li> but it may work for some people who&#x27;d rather take a little extra time to brush their teeth than pop a breath mint.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is slim and may be a little too slim for those with larger hands or arthritis.</li>
            <li> tried the \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; end of the Wisp - which is plastic, not really bristles at all - and while it was fine on the surface of the teeth, it did nothing to help me get that bit of chicken either.  </li>
            <li> Rather than a toothpick  which not very many dentists recommend, I would rather see one of those U-shaped  flossers and a cache for the heads and the flossers inside a larger and easier to  manipulate handle.  </li>
            <li> But, in the end, I found they really didn&#x27;t do much and were ungainly, bordering on painful to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to go over the entire tooth area once and then concentrate on the trouble</li>
            <li> The center bead (Makes you think it&#x27;s toothpaste), seems to be a mint candy.    </li>
            <li> You also have to be careful about how you hold it when using it, otherwise you end up with saliva on your hands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use the Wisp on an everyday basis, but I would get some to have around for camping and similar events.  </li>
            <li> The big push seems to be  for green products and even with toothbrushes the idea of a replaceable  head has already been done.    </li>
            <li> The pick does not get completely between teeth, as it is too thick.  </li>
            <li> For this use, the Wisp falls a little flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read how some of the bristles were harder for other users, so</li>
            <li> the bristles are too small and hard to work even somewhat like a real toothbrush, and the \\&quot;freshening bead\\&quot; is a joke.  </li>
            <li> several other reviewers have pointed out, the plastic on these is sharp and the bristles are stiff, but I didn&#x27;t find those aspects to be too problematic.  </li>
            <li> Mints mask bad breath, these clean it!</li>
            <li> The head was tiny and ineffective, bordering on painful and wore out rather quickly.    </li>
            <li> Usual for traveling especially</li>
            <li> As a functional toothbrush without need of water, it does brush teeth, and the other end works semi-well at tooth-picking.  </li>
            <li> Because this is a review of the Peppermint Colgate Wisps, I rate this a four due to my issue with the flavor.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Oral B Whipes, the Wisp is a *brush* with the \\&quot;freshener bead\\&quot; built in, but the other end is a flexible tooth pick as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and these are small enough to throw in my instrument case.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find any problem at all with it being overpowering, nor did I feel any need to rinse.  </li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that softer bristles might be an improvement.  </li>
            <li> a small bottle of mouthwash, such as Biotene, 3.a paper napkin, 4.</li>
            <li> I keep a tiny bottle of it, flip the lid, take a small bit, swish and spit into a paper napkin.</li>
            <li> Brush is way too small (smaller than my pinky nail)</li>
            <li> They are so small you can keep them in your wallet next to other foil</li>
            <li> They are so small you can keep them in your wallet next to other foil</li>
            <li> but if you want to try these i do not recommend purchasing through amazan at this point due to you can buy them cheaper for $1 at rite aide</li>
            <li> I just read some of the other reviews, and I have to say, I disagree with what I read.  </li>
            <li> I wish I tried a small pack locally..</li>
            <li> too small to reach the back teeth...</li>
            <li> The trouble with the flavor was that it is sunk way down inside the brush part, so I was sucking on the Wisp to get the flavor, long after I was finished with the brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a little ball of [something] in the center of the head.</li>
            <li> The handle is also very short and they are hard to hold, so if I had access to water</li>
            <li> It is doubtful that many people carry a toothbrush with them for after lunch</li>
            <li> These probably just take a few tries to get used to.  </li>
            <li> they are going to be drunk and throw up and want something to clean      the nasty taste out of their mouths, and they are going to use this like they have      many times before, and then they are going to let it slip and</li>
            <li> Back to the Wisp, the bristles are a little on the hard side; they did become softer as I used it, but I still felt paranoid about scratching my teeth, even though the product description promises not to.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d no much better buying a travel toothbrush and toothpaste for a single use and throwing them both away.</li>
            <li> However, as other reviewers have mentioned there are a few problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another plus is the tooth pick on the end which is very sharp and gets between the teeth</li>
            <li> For me anyway it seemed to give a slightly minty feeling in one portion of my mouth</li>
            <li> I bought some of these after seeing a commercial on TV and let me tell you that it was not a good experience for me.</li>
            <li> Because she is so small, regular doggie toothbrushes are hard to get into her mouth.  </li>
            <li> The are little, come pre-loaded with toothpaste and even have a small pic on the other end.</li>
            <li> You do not need water to use this, you can use the little brush anywhere</li>
            <li> you have little leverage and it starts to rotate in       your hands moving the brush part away from your teeth and tongue</li>
            <li> I figured that at the very least I&#x27;d have something I could occasionally use while I&#x27;m at work &amp; don&#x27;t have access to a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> peppermint flavor was just a bit too harsh for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably buy a few and stash them in places where you sometimes want a toothbrush- gym bag, work drawer, camper.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money--</li>
            <li> The brushes come four to a pack, individually wrapped behind a tinfoil wrapped.  </li>
            <li> The shaft of the brush is round</li>
            <li> I had a date a few days ago and bought a pack.</li>
            <li> I will use these for is to keep a few in my desk at work or in my purse.  </li>
            <li> So, it felt rather uneven.</li>
            <li> (If you&#x27;re a gal, and you&#x27;ve already done your makeup, this doesn&#x27;t mess it up!)  </li>
            <li> The little dab of mouth freshening gel is not overwhelming either.  </li>
            <li> they were extremely hard- not very comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I think they are a little expensive to use on a daily basis after lunch though.  </li>
            <li> The brush was next to useless for me.  </li>
            <li> Because the brush is small you have to work if you want to reach all of your teeth, but it&#x27;s still has some reach over the Oral B Whipes which just slip over your finger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foil packaging is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small, remember?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too small, round and slippery, otherwise it is a super-great idea!    </li>
            <li> I recently had implants and I can use these after every meal wherever I am- in order to keep food from getting imbedded and uncomfortable until I can fully brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> My main beef is the bristles are very hard and this makes brushing awkward.  </li>
            <li> bristles are very stiff.</li>
            <li> the bristles are hard plastic.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles were way too hard.</li>
            <li> I did not have any problem with the bristles being too hard ...</li>
            <li> but the bristles weren&#x27;t hard at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find two disposable brushes in a pack.  </li>
            <li> can, although it is a bit icky, not use water.</li>
            <li> If you try to use this after a late night at the bar - you&#x27;ll probably drop it on the floor, and that puddle isn&#x27;t beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My breath smells and tastes fresher for quite some time and it gets all of the ickies off of my teeth while working late.</li>
            <li> The ad for them could be misread to mean that 16 packages would be included in the order.  </li>
            <li> The tiny handle makes the   toothbrush unwieldy and impossible to brush the molars.</li>
            <li> In some cases it was actually minutely painful to try...</li>
            <li> The head was tiny and ineffective, bordering on painful and wore out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed for the opposite reason.  </li>
            <li> and it does not make your mouth dry either or leave a bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit difficult to hold and the head is so small as to be useless.</li>
            <li> You know how, after you&#x27;ve eaten something pungent such as Indian food, you feel like your breath is awful and your teeth feel covered in a film of crud?  </li>
            <li> This product is useless--</li>
            <li> , sorry Colgate...</li>
            <li> Yeah, sorry Colgate...</li>
            <li> really useless</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with these</li>
            <li> The pick end works well for in between the teeth without cutting the gum, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it at work after eating chicken salad.  </li>
            <li> I stuck it between my teeth to try to get a piece of chicken that was stuck there, and the Wisp toothpick end just bent, leaned, yielded to whatever was in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Usual for traveling especially</li>
            <li> How many times have we found ourselves in a situation where our breath is stale and we are about to meet someone? The Colgate Wisp Peppermint toothbrushes are a perfect solution. The are little, come pre-loaded with toothpaste and even have a small pic on the other end. You use and throw away! Mints mask bad breath, these clean it!</li>
            <li> When I first saw Colgate Wisp I though what a cool concept.  It is doubtful that many people carry a toothbrush with them for after lunch and I thought the Wisp would be a convenient alternative to keeping a toothbrush at work.  Unfortunately after using it, my teeth felt as clean as if I just popped in a breath mint.  The bristles don&#x27;t do a good job cleaning and it is so small, using it gave my thumb a cramp.  On the bright side, the Wisp leaves the mouth with a nice mint flavor an d there is a toothpick to get loose meals dislodged from your teeth.  But that isn&#x27;t enough to justify basically a dollar per Wisp that you throw away after one use.</li>
            <li> Great way to brush your teeth while on the go or at the office.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> These little disposable toothbrushes are convenient for use when you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush, but they are tiny and the plastic bristles don&#x27;t feel like toothbrush bristles.  The mint freshener works fine, and the end of the handle is a flexible toothpick.  The brush head is so small that it was hard to feel how I was brushing, but it&#x27;s definitely better than no toothbrush at all.  These probably just take a few tries to get used to.  Great idea and handy to take along.  Give them a try if you brush at work or while on the road, etc.</li>
            <li> Wisp sounded like a great idea.  Get a quick, refreshing dose of oral hygiene from a package small enough to hide in a pocket.  Reality, however, was far different from my expectations.      First, the brush is just too small.  Fingers can end up in the mouth if one tries for those molars back there.  Okay, so let&#x27;s just stick with the teeth up front.  The widely spaced bristles did nothing, as far as I could tell.  Even the little pearl of gel provided nothing in the way of a refreshing feeling.     Bottom line:  The brush was next to useless for me.  A piece of sugarless gum is my choice for between brushing oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unemployed since January of this year and only this morning received the final word that I got the job.  Appearance is important in these interviews of course, so when I went to the first one, despite being horribly hungry right before the interview, I couldn&#x27;t eat anything for fear that I would have pieces of food in my teeth.  For the final interview though, I had a Wisp in my pocket, so I had a snack (Yodells), then brushed my teeth in the train station men&#x27;s room, and was flawless for my meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not of course the best toothbrushes in the world, but if you&#x27;re not prone to carrying a full size toothbrush and toothpaste, this is a great way to freshen up your mouth for that important meeting or other encounter such as a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wisps are also good for outdoor sports, particularly camping, where you have a lack of facilities and though you could live without brushing your teeth would really feel more comfortable if you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would take a star away in comparison to a regular toothbrush, but for the unique functionality, portability, and handiness of this item it gets the full five.</li>
            <li> So as in all things, this mini toothbrush from Colgate is a good idea with some pros and cons.    As a functional toothbrush without need of water, it does brush teeth, and the other end works semi-well at tooth-picking.  Likewise, it is small/compact enough to be \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size.    Now for the toothbrush&#x27;s flaws.  First, the packaging does not allow for single toothbrush travel--you must take at least two, and the packaging although small is pretty bulky in a pocket.  Next is the size of the toothbrush--if you have small hands, it probably works fine, but I&#x27;ve got large hands and just brushing for a couple minutes gave my thumb cramps.  The bristles are like a vegetable scrubber, small, pointy and stiff--they&#x27;re painful if you have sensitive gums, and they don&#x27;t really brush the teeth clean as well as a traditional toothbrush.  The \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; is palatable, but it does not last long enough to really freshen your breath--likewise trying to brush your tongue clean is a painful process.  Finally, the pick is only good at getting something out of your teeth that isn&#x27;t stuck--although it&#x27;s a fine point, it is really flimsy and cannot really get anything that is stuck in between teeth.    Does this product replace the traditional toothbrush and floss?  Heck no, but it may work for some people who&#x27;d rather take a little extra time to brush their teeth than pop a breath mint.</li>
            <li> When you are on the go and need a quick way to freshen your breath and remove food particles from your teeth, Colgate Wisps will do to the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Wisps fit easily in a purse, the glove compartment of your car, your desk drawer, and more.  Intended for just one use each, the breath bead lasts only for a few minutes, so you want to cover the entire tooth area before concentrating on one spot or you&#x27;ll not spread the breath bead around.  I like to go over the entire tooth area once and then concentrate on the trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do a fine job of removing most debris and some plaque.  The pick end works well for in between the teeth without cutting the gum, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The breath bead certainly gives a nice momentary fresh feeling in your mouth, although it won&#x27;t last as long as brushing will, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, Colgate doesn&#x27;t intend for Wisps to take the place of brushing your teeth, only to supplement during those times when you can&#x27;t easily brush.  Since you don&#x27;t need to rinse with water, you can easily use Wisps even in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint flavor was just a bit too harsh for my tastes.  I do enjoy peppermint mints and gum, even the curiously strong Altoids, but something about the peppermint flavor Colgate uses was off for me.  I tried some spearmint Wisps and found that flavor much more to my liking.  Because this is a review of the Peppermint Colgate Wisps, I rate this a four due to my issue with the flavor.  I would give the Spearmint Colgate Wisps a five.</li>
            <li> Use one stay fresh all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews, but I guess we all have different hand and mouth sizes, as well as manual dexterity. I am in love with these. They will not replace my toothbrush, of course, partially due to cost and environmental concerns, but there is nothing better for travel or to throw in my purse. My teeth feel amazingly clean after and my breath is so good. After the first time I got used to the idea of not rinsing. The bristles do seem hard at first, but one you get the gel and some saliva on them, they work great!     Give these a try!</li>
            <li> I decided to give these a try after seeing them on sale. Though Colgate&#x27;s \\&quot;Wisp\\&quot; is a good concept -- a travel-friendly method of refreshing your breath -- I still think you&#x27;re better off bringing a bit of mouthwash in a small container (if you buy a value jumbo bottle of mouth wash and funnel it yourself, it ends up being much more cost effective) or, better yet, a small toothbrush and toothpaste. But I&#x27;m aware that method seems archaic and troublesome. Back to the Wisp, the bristles are a little on the hard side; they did become softer as I used it, but I still felt paranoid about scratching my teeth, even though the product description promises not to. The centered mint bead bursts as you use it. The flavor is pleasant enough, but you will still want to head to a sink to spit and rinse (I suppose if you&#x27;re really on-the-go, you could swallow, but do you really want to with a mouth full of minty saliva and debris from your teeth?). You&#x27;re left with a half-clean feeling, like you&#x27;re mixing crud with mint freshener. These, of course, aren&#x27;t meant to replace tooth brushing, but in my opinion, if you&#x27;re already at the sink anyway, you might as well just use mouthwash or quickly use a travel brush and paste to do the job; the bristles would be soft, and the paste would help get any garlic or any other offensive odor out of your mouth much more effectively, even if you&#x27;re rushing to get back to your date. If you&#x27;re in a real hurry, aren&#x27;t near a sink, and your breath is really foul, then these would be a good option. Otherwise good old fashioned teeth brushing still can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I tried [[ASIN:B000296Z0I Oral B Brush-ups, Textured Teeth Wipes]] and they just didn&#x27;t work any better then rubbing my teeth with a napkin or paper towel.  I saw these shortly before I was to go work all day at an outdoor event where there isn&#x27;t a lot in the way of running water.  Unlike the Oral B Whipes, the Wisp is a *brush* with the \\&quot;freshener bead\\&quot; built in, but the other end is a flexible tooth pick as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles of the brush end are not exactly soft, but they get the job done.  Because the brush is small you have to work if you want to reach all of your teeth, but it&#x27;s still has some reach over the Oral B Whipes which just slip over your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that you should take these camping with you rather then a travel size tooth paste and brush, but if you are out and about for the day and space, time and/or the availability of water are uncertain?  These are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> We were lucky to have these along (in my purse) when we we took a trip and found we&#x27;d left certain essential toiletries behind. My son loved the tiny size and declared them a great invention, but I still craved my full-sized brush to do a thorough job. They are - as they claim - for impromptu freshening. And they do that job well enough (though I still want a piece of gum afterwards to help out). Just like any other \\&quot;mini\\&quot; item, they&#x27;re harder for adults to use effectively. Still, I&#x27;ll purchase more to keep in my purse for emergencies.</li>
            <li> The wisp toothbrushes are way too small for an adult.   I am unclear whether this represents an elaborate toothpick  or an infant&#x27;s size toothbrush. The tiny handle makes the   toothbrush unwieldy and impossible to brush the molars. There  is not enough breath freshener or toothpaste on the brush to   make any difference. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try these for awhile, and was glad that I finally had a chance to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As several other reviewers have pointed out, the plastic on these is sharp and the bristles are stiff, but I didn&#x27;t find those aspects to be too problematic.  After all, these aren&#x27;t meant to replace regular brushing, but are rather designed to be used in a pinch when you need to freshen up your teeth and breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the cost on these is high, I won&#x27;t be using them everyday, but will most likely keep them in my desk and work and use them when I&#x27;ve had a pungent lunch.  I really like these!</li>
            <li> We took these camping and tried them out. We thought since they were small, fairly easy to use, and supposedly no water needed they would be perfect for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great in a pinch and I&#x27;ll probably buy a few and stash them in places where you sometimes want a toothbrush- gym bag, work drawer, camper. However, as other reviewers have mentioned there are a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very stiff. It didn&#x27;t bother me too much but my husband who has sensative gums ended up hating these things simply because the bristles are so stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were a touch longer it would be easier to use, particularly when using on the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can, although it is a bit icky, not use water. However, both my husband I felt the need to use water when using these. For the places that we will &#x27;stash&#x27; them, it will be fine because we have water at work and at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are great as a back up brush for in a pinch. I also think back packers might like these because they are so light, small, compact and technically do not need water to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> A single-use disposable toothbrush you can use anywhere? This is not something that would have occurred to me to look for, but having tried it now I can see how it has its uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wisp is a tiny brush on a short handle with a semi-soft point that doubles as a pick for cleaning between teeth. A small dab of a peppermint flavored cleaning gel embedded in the brush end provides extra cleaning action and freshening of breath; it&#x27;s small but potent. The brush is a ring of plastic bristles. They&#x27;re not up to the level of scrubbing one would get from a conventional full size tooth brush, but they work well enough for this. You don&#x27;t need a sink or running water to use the Wisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Wisp is small which might be a problem for someone with large hands, but I coped well enough. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d want to pack a set of just these alone for a trip, but having some handy for occasions when there&#x27;d be no other alternative makes a lot of sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a musician; I play trombone and these are small enough to throw in my instrument case. On some of my gigs we get meals as a courtesy and being able to brush afterwards is a big help. I suspect I&#x27;m not the only musician who&#x27;d find this useful - this might be a nice gift idea for musician friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the Wisp isn&#x27;t going to replace my regular toothbrush, but it looks like having a pack handy for those occasions when nothing else but brushing will do would be a good thing.

            <li> You know how, after you&#x27;ve eaten something pungent such as Indian food, you feel like your breath is awful and your teeth feel covered in a film of crud?  Well, that was when I tried these out. First of all, you get four in a package, they&#x27;re individually sealed, and they&#x27;re small enough to easily tuck in a purse.  Or if you&#x27;re a guy, you could break one off and stick it in a shirt or coat pocket, or in your briefcase.  They have a little dab of breathminty stuff in the middle that serves as a toothpaste and is delicious and refreshing. Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find any problem at all with it being overpowering, nor did I feel any need to rinse.  (If you&#x27;re a gal, and you&#x27;ve already done your makeup, this doesn&#x27;t mess it up!)  It&#x27;s like a miniature tootbrush so you can brush your teeth and tongue, and it has a pick on one end so can be used as a toothpick too.  If you&#x27;ve had something really pungent then you&#x27;ll still need a breath mint to really finish the job, but it really helps your teeth feel cleaner.   And, the minty feeling from these doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  I do agree with other reviewers that softer bristles might be an improvement.  But for what it is---an emergency toothbrush that you can use with no water (like just before that big meeting!)---these ROCK.  I plan to NEVER be without one in my purse!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations when I tries these little disposable toothbrushes for the first time, but I was pleasantly surprised. They are a comfortable size, and I liked the toothpick on one end. They left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling clean. The bristles are gentle on my very sensitive gums, but did a good job of getting food out of my teeth after meals. Within the plastic carry-case (which is perfect for a purse or glove box), the brushes are individually foil sealed, eliminating worries about leaving them in the car or in the bottom of my bag. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again.</li>
            <li> This product is useless-- the bristles are too small and hard to work even somewhat like a real toothbrush, and the \\&quot;freshening bead\\&quot; is a joke.  I thought there would at least be a bit of real toothpaste on the brush.  Don&#x27;t waste your money-- you&#x27;d no much better buying a travel toothbrush and toothpaste for a single use and throwing them both away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item thinking that I would receive 16 packages of 2 brushes.  Instead I received 2 packages of 8 brushes.  Customer Service said they couldn&#x27;t do anything about sending a replacement because they ship out what the vendor provides.  They offered to ship more overnight and waive the shipping charge if I wanted to place another order for the same thing.  Once I understood that I was expected to pay for another order in order to receive what I thought I ordered in the first place, I suggested they correct the item description and send me a return label. Not the level of customer service I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are OK toothbrushes for on the go or for school if you have braces. I use them whenever we have salad or something else that gets stuff in my braces to clean my teeth and braces after lunch unless I don&#x27;t have time. They are good toothbrushes for on the go, but not for everyday use as replacement for your normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Everyone likes to have clean, fresh teeth and mouth, and \\&quot;Colgate Wisp\\&quot; is quite handy for that. However, I can NOT recommend this product for use on a daily basis, mainly because it is SO wasteful to use a toothbrush and then throw it away every day, not to mention all the packaging that must be disposed of, too. Yes, this product is convenient--super portable, and sanitary--and it does a decent job, with some flaws, like the handle being too short, and the bristles being a bit stiff. But it is so \\&quot;not green\\&quot;, and it is easy to come up with a quick solution that is much cheaper and \\&quot;greener\\&quot;.    I am fairly diligent about brushing while away from home, and, I sanitize my assortment of ordinary soft toothbrushes myself.  If you don&#x27;t want to go to that trouble, you can put together a kit with one or more of these items and keep them in your desk or car: 1. dental floss (I use the individual pks of \\&quot;threader floss\\&quot;), 2. a small bottle of mouthwash, such as Biotene, 3.a paper napkin, 4. sugar-free gum with Xylitol. 5.a bottle of drinking water.  First, swish and rinse with the water. Next floss carefully (learn to do it right, curving it around each tooth and under the gum). Third, if you would like, use a mouthwash like \\&quot;Biotene\\&quot;. It is a gentle, antibacterial wash that doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate. I keep a tiny bottle of it, flip the lid, take a small bit, swish and spit into a paper napkin. Next sugar-free gum. Xylitol has be PROVEN to reduce tooth decay, so always chew gum with this sweetener after meals. \\&quot;Orbit\\&quot; brand has the most Xylitol.  Also, to clean the surfaces of your teeth, simply use the napkin---no need to get those silly finger wipe things.    Now throw away the paper napkin (or compost it), and the piece of dental floss. Green and clean!</li>
            <li> These are a good idea, and they work pretty well.  I think they are a little expensive to use on a daily basis after lunch though.  The handle is also very short and they are hard to hold, so if I had access to water I would definitely take the trouble to pack a regular brush and toothpaste.  However these would come in handy for special circumstances, like camping at festivals, red-eye flights, etc.</li>
            <li> While the flavor is good and keeps breath fresh as well as a lozenge does, the brush is not easy to handle (it is so small) and there is no bristle height to be effective.  The pick does not get completely between teeth, as it is too thick.  The foil packaging is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I just tried the product after lunch today. My husband bought it for me.     1) The price for the 4 item packet is a lot to only toss it after one use.   2) the bristles are hard plastic. I fear it will ruin my enamel.   3) The center bead (Makes you think it&#x27;s toothpaste), seems to be a mint candy.    After I used the product, I had to flush out my mouth with water. I felt I brushed candy all over my teeth.     I think this product has potential- but needs a lot of work.   Pricing is important, as well since the item is used once.     I won&#x27;t use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for work.  You can use them after lunch and not worry about using water.</li>
            <li> My first thought about this product was what a odd idea.  Ok I will review it for amazon.  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work and the brush is very firm, way too firm I suspect for many people.  At first I thought there would be no refreshing taste but eventually it does get there.     While it is better than nothing I will not be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m aware that these nifty little brushes are no substitute for a \\&quot;real\\&quot; brushing, they&#x27;re perfect for when I&#x27;m in a rush or on the go.  I love the nice, clean feeling I get after using a Wisp.  The plastic bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff and really take the plaque off.  And I like the peppermint flavor, too.  The brushes come four to a pack, individually wrapped behind a tinfoil wrapped.  I found the packaging to be very easy to open, and the brushes come out very easily.  The brushes are about the same size as my peppermint chapstick.  They&#x27;re easy to to hold, and extremely easy to use.  I can easily fit the pack into my bag tiniest of bags, even in the pocket of my jeans if I need to.    If anyone remembers those Crest brush-on-the-go things from a few years ago (rip, slip, brush, aahh), these portable brushes are worlds better.  They actually make your teeth feel CLEAN.    Long story short, I love using Colgate Wisps.</li>
            <li> Basically a mini toothbrush with a blue alien fish egg in the middle filled with minty freshness. The opposite end has a flexible point that serves like a toothpick while overall it&#x27;s about as long as my middle finger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I Could not open the package until I spotted the pull tab.  They should really make this more obvious.  Even then, you have to fish the thing out, a two handed job.  Could the packaging be bigger and waste more plastic please?  They&#x27;re packaged two in one blister so with this much space I could actually store a travel toothbrush and a travel toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They say that you don&#x27;t need a sink or water, but my experience was that after I was done using it, you have enough saliva from the minty capsule that you really want some place to spit and rinse.  You also have to be careful about how you hold it when using it, otherwise you end up with saliva on your hands.  Now you show up to your meeting with fresh breath....and sticky hands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Brush is way too small (smaller than my pinky nail) so it takes a while to get good coverage - oh yeah, also those bristles are STIFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Iffy ergonomics  - it&#x27;s small, remember?  Oh, now it&#x27;s covered with your spit, so kind of slippery too.  There&#x27;s a groove to help prevent it rotating in your fingers but it does take some coordination and attention to use properly.  Forget about using it while driving.  If you try to use this after a late night at the bar - you&#x27;ll probably drop it on the floor, and that puddle isn&#x27;t beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) This product wastes a reasonable amount of plastic with each use. Of course this might be a positive if you are an environazi hatin&#x27; SUV driver and want to freshen up after eating your BK double cheeseburger with beef from clear cut rainforest...;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this four times I decided the only advantage this has is that it&#x27;s smaller (not by much) than the smallest travel toothbrushes and you don&#x27;t have to carry around any toothpaste - you can also use those without a sink if you have a kleenex to spit into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I recommend the Oral B Brush-Ups.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000296Z0I Oral B Brush-ups, Textured Teeth Wipes, 12 wipes]]&lt;br /&gt;These are textured sleeves which fit over your finger, impregnated with minty freshness.  They are so small you can keep them in your wallet next to other foil covered things you might need if your breath is fresh enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are much easier to open (one handed, while driving, speaking from experience) and easier to use (slip it over your finger and then rub your teeth, gums, etc)  Use it while driving, jogging, bungee-jumping, or playing tennis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve found this review to be helpful, please let me know!use those without a sink if you have a kleenex to spit into.    Instead, I recommend the Oral B Brush-Ups.

            <li> Great for keeping in your car.</li>
            <li> As of right now my review of the product is it was made to just freshen breath it is ok everything about the description is skewed such as 16 count pack of 2.  I was told by a seller i could not understand the product description saying two come in a pack. I have used these before many a time knowing they came in a pack of 4 so i was expecting 16 count package of 2 &#x3D; 32 brushes total shipping was high but if you want to try these i do not recommend purchasing through amazan at this point due to you can buy them cheaper for $1 at rite aide you can purchase 4 of these. will update if experience has changed. the seller I went through was VHSales</li>
            <li> Everything came in fine. But instead of 16 packs of 2, it was 8 packs of 4. As we are using these for OOT baskets so it made us come up short.</li>
            <li> This product is the best! It is small, portable and works great.  The brushes are individually sealed yet open easily from a foil backing. One could be in a pocket or purse and is great for those &amp;#34;breath emergencies&amp;#34;. The brush itself is slim and may be a little too slim for those with larger hands or arthritis. The tip is a good combination of being firm enough to use as a toothpick yet soft enough to not hurt gums. Same can be said of the bristles- just the right firmness. In the middle of the brush is a center of mint (or whatever flavor) that bursts with use and provides a refreshing taste. You do not need to be by a sink or have water to use the wisp. l think this is a goood alternative for in between regular brushing and flossing. Your teeth feel clean and l recommend brushing your toungue too. And the freshness stays. The flavor is not as intense as mouthwash but (to me) stronger than most mint gum flavors. l highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These little \\&quot;wisps\\&quot; are perfect for the office, you don&#x27;t look silly bringing a whole bottle of toothpaste and a toothbrush into a public office restroom, if you happen to work in a large office like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For guys, this is perfect, on a date and just finished dinner? Just stick one of these in your pocket, hit the bathroom after dinner and freshen your mouth up.  Your date will be pleasantly surprised later when she realizes how fresh and clean your breath is.  The little dab of mouth freshening gel is not overwhelming either.  You do not need water to use this, you can use the little brush anywhere and it does not make your mouth dry either or leave a bad aftertaste.  The Gel is perfect IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Colgate got this one just right!</li>
            <li> I use these \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; after eating out at restaurants or someone else&#x27;s house. Because I have braces I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m depending on these more and more. They have a slight refreshing flavor that isn&#x27;t over powering but reminescent of toothpaste. I feel refreshed and clean. There is a small \\&quot;pick\\&quot; that slides easily under brackets to help out too.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter is a competition dancer who has braces. I got these Wisps in an effort to help her for those long days of competition so she could brush backstage after snacks and meals. Worked like a charm and she loved the portability. These will definitely be a permanent fixture in her dance kit!</li>
            <li> Product was as described and shipped on time.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles were way too hard.</li>
            <li> What does the product promise? A single-use mini toothbrush with a breath freshening bead that allows you to have a clean, fresh mouth anywhere, anytime no water or rinsing required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How well does it achieve those goals? The Colgate Wisp in Peppermint does do the job it&#x27;s intended to do. My breath smells and tastes fresher for quite some time and it gets all of the ickies off of my teeth while working late. I have never had the urge to rinse using any of these tooth brushes, either. Another plus is the tooth pick on the end which is very sharp and gets between the teeth nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a good value? for whom? The price at which they sell is a little steep, however, if it is something you are willing to invest in and keep discrete, this is a fine tool to use.</li>
            <li> Love these for during the day when at work and need to clean my teeth. Keep a couple in the car and desk. Good for travel too.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes can&#x27;t find them anywhere locally</li>
            <li> These are just ok. They are good to keep in the desk for a messy lunch or some thing like that. They have a funky taste but they can clean the teeth pretty good. Absolutely nothing compared to a brush though. Travel friendly</li>
            <li> I bought some of these after seeing a commercial on TV and let me tell you that it was not a good experience for me. While I realize they are not toothbrush quality I found my wisps to be anything but- they were extremely hard- not very comfortable at all. I was just using as a quick freshen up before a dental appointment...while I did feel slightly fresher in the mouth I do not recommend this product beyond a real emergency. I would rather bring a toothbrush and tube of toothpaste with me.</li>
            <li> great for travels and taking along when going out</li>
            <li> I received a sample and LOVED it.  Used it at work after eating chicken salad.  Left my teeth feeling clean and breath fresh and the tooth pick on the other end is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed for the opposite reason.  I just read some of the other reviews, and I have to say, I disagree with what I read.  I really wanted to use the toothpick end of the Wisp, and I thought it was too soft.  I stuck it between my teeth to try to get a piece of chicken that was stuck there, and the Wisp toothpick end just bent, leaned, yielded to whatever was in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; end of the Wisp - which is plastic, not really bristles at all - and while it was fine on the surface of the teeth, it did nothing to help me get that bit of chicken either.  Still, I felt like it was plenty adequate as a toothbrush substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the flavor, and didn&#x27;t feel like I had to rinse after - so that&#x27;s a big plus, from me, because I feel like I need to rinse meticulously after normal toothbrushing.  The trouble with the flavor was that it is sunk way down inside the brush part, so I was sucking on the Wisp to get the flavor, long after I was finished with the brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use the Wisp on an everyday basis, but I would get some to have around for camping and similar events.  Probably a nice thing to offer guests, if they inquire about a toothpick or something, too.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these when she travels.</li>
            <li> Strange as it seems, these brushes work great on my little 5 pound dog.  Because she is so small, regular doggie toothbrushes are hard to get into her mouth.  I take out the minty paste capsule in the middle and use doggie toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was really glad to see this product.  There are many times I have been in my vehicle going somewhere and wished I had brushed my teeth.  This is a great product for just that need.  I keep them in my truck and use them several times a week.  It is a very nice mough freshener and the quick brusl for the teeth keeps them feeling clean.</li>
            <li> great idea, a mini toothbrush.  Love that it is so handy - takes up so much less space than a travel toothbrush and mini  toothpaste tube.  And the rubber pick is great. Don&#x27;t love that it is one more thing to throw away -- just not very green.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this product, seemed almost like a gimmick, but I was wrong. The Colgate Wisp is a unique product in that you do not need water and the toothpaste is already on the brush. Pair this with the disposable nature and it really is a must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing is one brush actually fits in my wallet, which is nice to have during a long day of eating and drinking.. and the girls can very easily stash them in their purses or wallets as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Colgate Wisp doesn&#x27;t replace your toothbrush and its not meant to, but as a disposable and functional brush, it is a good product to have.</li>
            <li> If you showed up at work and had totally forgotten to brush your teeth, these might be a lifesaver.  However, I decided to test these after a greek (read GARLIC) lunch....&lt;br /&gt;They are a nice size, the small pick on the opposite side as the brush easily dislodges big leftover bits...  and the brush is a reasonable size to use while still being pocket sized.  I liked the pepermint gel flavor - so that is also a plus in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottom line is that even though it did get the bits out of my smile, it was not effective in overcoming my garlic breath.  Two pieces of gum later and I was suitable to work around others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I predict these will be a fad item....  but they are cute and I&#x27;m sure would be handy for a multitude of other purposes like cleaning dirt out of tight spaces or polishing up a silver ring (or ornate silver surface) in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This is such a great idea that I went out and bought some.  I think it is a great idea, but I am  not so sure it does not need some more work.    The juice is a good idea, you break open the back and start scrubbing your mouth and it  does refresh and seem to work OK.  It is not overpowering, and is pleasant and makes your  mouth feel fresh.  I could swallow it if I had to, but I would rather spit it out.    The problems I had, or think others might have are this:    1) The brush itself is just a bit too short.  You have to really try to get back to brush your       tongue and rear teeth.    2) The shaft of the brush is round so  you have little leverage and it starts to rotate in       your hands moving the brush part away from your teeth and tongue and it is hard       to push it back in place of keep it steady.    3) Same as above, but once this thing gets wet it starts to get slippery and slides       around quite a bit.    4)  Finally, I bet very soon some intoxicated person is going to be using this and lose       it and it is going to swallow it, or choke on it because it is going to get loose in       their hand and kill someone.  Yes, anyone paying close attention would not have       to worry about this, but imagine the kind of people who are going to be using      this, or at least some of them.  They are going to be in bars and clubs, and meet      someone, of they are going to be drunk and throw up and want something to clean      the nasty taste out of their mouths, and they are going to use this like they have      many times before, and then they are going to let it slip and BIG PROBLEMS FOR      COLGATE.    It&#x27;s just too small, round and slippery, otherwise it is a super-great idea!    SUGGESTION:  Making it bigger would make it cost more and become bulky too, so maybe  we will eventually see a big handle that you store the wisps inside and replace them  after each use that allows you to brush your whole mouth.  Rather than a toothpick  which not very many dentists recommend, I would rather see one of those U-shaped  flossers and a cache for the heads and the flossers inside a larger and easier to  manipulate handle.  that would be perfect, with maybe one Swiss-army style  removable toothpick for those that want to use it.    I wonder if anyone else had thought of this either.  The big push seems to be  for green products and even with toothbrushes the idea of a replaceable  head has already been done.    I did not have any problem with the bristles being too hard ... it was a pleasant  sensation, a nice gum massage and my teeth felt smooth and clean after I used  it.  This is just my honest feedback after using one pack.</li>
            <li> These things are a great idea. I had a date a few days ago and bought a pack. Luckily I tried one just for the heck of it. My breath felt a little fresher, but still wasn&#x27;t that \\&quot;just brushed\\&quot; clean feeling. My advice? Buy a travel toothbrush that folds in itself and keep a tube in your pocket. It&#x27;ll be about the same price and last much longer as well as have much better results.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, so glad that someone suggestion I try getting on-line as I can&#x27;t find them locally.  They are so handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of the Colgate Wisp waterless toothbrushes.  I intended to use them for short weekend trips to get one liquid out of the equation for the 3-1-1 quart bag.  For this use, the Wisp falls a little flat.  While it does freshen you up, it wouldn&#x27;t do for a whole weekend.  My main beef is the bristles are very hard and this makes brushing awkward.  My other problem is that the flavor bead is a little intense and I do agree with the other reviewers I had to urge to rinse my mouth out with water afterwards (which does defeat the portability water-free aspect).  I do like how the bottom of the toothbrush is a pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I will use these for is to keep a few in my desk at work or in my purse.  Sometimes if you have garlic, onions or another strong food for lunch, you cannot get the taste out of your mouth all day - gum, mints, nothing will work.  The Wisp is the perfect portable solution without having to lug a toothbrush and toothpaste to the bathroom.  I will purchase again for this function, but not for travel.  I cannot see myself using the product more than occasionally for the \\&quot;breath emergency\\&quot; - which is disappointing because I did have very high hopes for the product.  If they made the bristles softer it would improve the product.  I&#x27;d be interested to try a spearmint version as well.</li>
            <li> Out of sheer curiousity, I tried these. I figured that at the very least I&#x27;d have something I could occasionally use while I&#x27;m at work &amp; don&#x27;t have access to a toothbrush. (Soup &amp; Frito breath isn&#x27;t exactly a great aroma to have on your breath.) The experience was both under &amp; overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I have to say that I like how tiny the brush is. It fits in my purse easily &amp; I&#x27;ll admit it- if it was bigger I&#x27;d feel guiltier about buying something big that I&#x27;m just going to dispose of afterwards. (It shouldn&#x27;t get any tiner, though- as it is you&#x27;ll have to put part of your hand in your mouth just to get the back teeth.) I also liked how soft the bristles were on mine. I&#x27;ve read how some of the bristles were harder for other users, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or not but the bristles weren&#x27;t hard at all. My teeth feel nice &amp; clean, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the mint drop in the middle didn&#x27;t really taste all that great &amp; I wanted to rinse my mouth out afterwards because it was such a strong taste. Since I wanted to know how long the flavor would last, I didn&#x27;t &amp; I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it would if I&#x27;d have brushed or if I&#x27;d have used some mouthwash afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good thing if you don&#x27;t like bringing your toothbrush to work with you or if you are stuck in a situation where you can&#x27;t, like at a work meeting or something. I do have to warn anyone who likes wearing lipstick- you WILL need to reapply your lipstick afterwards &amp; I actually recommend removing the lipstick before brushing otherwise it&#x27;ll get everywhere. This doesn&#x27;t replace a good old toothbrush, but then I guess it&#x27;s not supposed to. This is good for after meals where you can&#x27;t get a toothbrush, but if you are traveling then I recommend popping out &amp; getting a real toothbrush &amp; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had thought that perhaps these would be good for something. Say camping or carrying around in your pocket for after lunch or a purse (if you&#x27;re a lady). But, in the end, I found they really didn&#x27;t do much and were ungainly, bordering on painful to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, they consist of a toothbrush-like device (don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking it *is* a toothbrush, it really isn&#x27;t in my opinion) about the size of your finger or perhaps a little larger with a head about the size of your pinky fingernail. It seems a bit difficult to hold and the head is so small as to be useless. The bristles are teeny tiny and seem to fray rather quickly (after trying to clean only one side of a few teeth?) and don&#x27;t seem to do an especially good job of cleaning or getting around / between teeth. In some cases it was actually minutely painful to try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a little ball of [something] in the center of the head. I&#x27;d thought it was perhaps toothpaste that foams up when moistened by your saliva. Nope. It seems to be more some generic artificial ingredients aimed at breath-freshening. But it seems like it&#x27;s a capsule and not any kind of slow-release ball. For me anyway it seemed to give a slightly minty feeling in one portion of my mouth (I assume where the capsule leaked / ruptured), but the other side didn&#x27;t get much. So, it felt rather uneven. Reading the ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t appear to have fluoride, which could possibly have been a redeeming value for keeping teeth strong / healthy (though I doubt it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up just using my regular toothbrush after the miserable failure with these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marginally saving grace was the rubber, curved toothpick-like thing at the end opposite the head. It actually did a passable job of cleaning junk from around the gumline and between teeth. But couldn&#x27;t I just get toothpicks for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I can&#x27;t really see my way clear to recommending these things to anyone for much of anything. The ball didn&#x27;t last long enough to really feel like my whole mouth was freshened. I gave up on trying to \\&quot;brush my teeth\\&quot; with it. The head was tiny and ineffective, bordering on painful and wore out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, sorry Colgate... Not good. Back to the drawing board. I&#x27;ll stick with my toothbrush &amp; toothpaste for tooth cleaning and breath freshening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had something better to say.feel like my whole mouth was freshened.

            <li> I use this product while traveling out of town. It fits in my briefcase and does a fine job \\&quot;brushing up\\&quot; on my teeth while traveling, especially after eating a meal at the airport. The toothpaste is built in, and it says it is Ok to swallow. The peppermint taste is great.</li>
            <li> Great idea but hubby hates them. Bought them for his overnight fishing trips</li>
            <li> this brushes is so cute and i love it sooo much , so useful and can take it with you to any where , i will by it again</li>
            <li> I originally got these when I was out camping and didn&#x27;t trust the water I had available. I keep them in my glove compartment for &#x27;emergencies&#x27;. They certainly don&#x27;t replace brushing but are great in a pinch.</li>
            <li> perfect for our wedding needs</li>
            <li> Awesome, can&#x27;t find these at any drug stores anymore.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wisps are a wonderful invention, a little disposable toothbrush for on-the-go breath freshening and a toothpick.  Requires no water, just saliva to moisten the bead of mouthwash in the middle of the brush. Gently brush, opposite end is a sharp point (toothpick), and throw away.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this product is described as a 2 pack of 16, arrived as 4 of 4, total 16.  My seller was TLinc, but I see other reviewers having the same issue from another vendor.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and the issue was immediately resolved to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, incorrect qty. listed.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal!  Though they did not come in the package shown, that really doesn&#x27;t matter, does it?</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Was on time which was great...</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in your briefcase, pocket, or backpack, these are ideal for those who want to maintain a fresh mouth after meals when you don&#x27;t have time or are not in a location where you can fully brush.  Cleans teeth, gentle, leaves mouth and breath fresh.  Disposable after use.  I can see many uses for these with children, people with braces or mouth surgeries.  Great idea.  Price is higher than is reasonable, however.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is a complete waste.&lt;br /&gt;A regular toothbrush is already made of plastic and you reuse it, so what is the point in this?&lt;br /&gt;Buy a regular toothbrush and reuse it you dingus!</li>
            <li> got for bride and groom emergency room kits - perfect!!</li>
            <li> I have Invisalign so these are the perfect tool to keep my teeth clean throughout the day. Love the minty freshness!</li>
            <li> Like these when I&#x27;m traveling or just stick in a purse&lt;br /&gt;when you have a long day.  These are also good for little&lt;br /&gt;kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already submitted a review pointing out that this product from this seller costs twice what I might have bought it for locally, but looking at the product, it&#x27;s not 2 brushes per packet, but 1 brush per packet with a &amp;#34;Sample. Not for retail sale&amp;#34; marking on it. ( I did get all 16 brushes that I ordered) This is not only double charging, but incredibly unethical to sell supposedly free samples in any retail capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is just fine, but Dealway (who I bought it from) is not fine. I will report this to Amazon, even though they won&#x27;t GAF. I would not avoid buying this product, but make sure that you&#x27;re not buying it from weasels. It should cost about 50 cents a brush, and they shouldn&#x27;t be selling samples.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  I wish I tried a small pack locally.. I will never use them.. too small to reach the back teeth... really useless</li>
            <li> I loved those tiny brushes. They fit into my bag and you can carry them anywhere you go. after using them you feel so fresh&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find two disposable brushes in a pack.  Most come with a lot in a large bag and it makes it hard to carry in the purse.  with these you just tuck them in your purse and go.</li>
            <li> I recently had implants and I can use these after every meal wherever I am- in order to keep food from getting imbedded and uncomfortable until I can fully brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these little wisp, great to have in your purse and specially when I travel. Just to have a fresh mouth. peppermint taste is so good.</li>
            <li> This item consists of  4 tiny toothbrushes in each package.  The ad for them could be misread to mean that 16 packages would be included in the order.  Bottom line.. I paid $50 for 8 packages of 4 in each.  That is way too much!</li>
            <li> These wisp tooth brushes are so handy to keep in your car, or bottom of your purse when you need a quick brush-up!  They work great with a small amount of tooth paste already in the brush!</li>
            <li> these pre flavored little brush piks are the perfect on the go tooth care you cant go wrong with these they have a great flavor assortment and there all good the tooth pick works great thru the cracks of your teeth the brush isnt electric but it gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes. Always keep them in my bag for emergencies. Much better than gum. Cleans teeth and freshens the breath. Will def repurchase!</li>
            <li> There are more brushes than I need but they are great at the end of a red-eye flight.</li>
            <li> Great to keep in my purse when out for the whole day or when traveling and stop for lunch.  I always keep these with me.</li>
            <li> I really use these on a daily basis and not just for a quick travel use.&lt;br /&gt;They are great for your gums and keep mine quite healthy.</li>
