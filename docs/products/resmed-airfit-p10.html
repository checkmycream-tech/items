            <li>Loved this thing.</li>
            <li>An adjustible head gear option may be nice, but the ease of putting this on and taking off is great.</li>

            <li>Nice but did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first of all the mask itself is a very good item...</li>
            <li>This is a great improvement over my full face</li>
            <li>The good: Love the mask, very light</li>
            <li>Best mask I have used thus far!  </li>
            <li>I have used CPAP for 20 years and this is by far the best and quietest mask I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This was an authentic Resmed, but it is the kind of unit used in the overnight testing for sleep apnea at clinics.</li>
            <li>All these mask have there problems but this one is by far the best I found.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Despite those shortcomings it is the best and quietest and lightest mask we have tried so far</li>
            <li>All and all I would rate this as the best mask that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>Its by far the best one I&#x27;ve used to date</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 3 CPAP masks and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll prefer this over the SwiftFx (which was the best thing I&#x27;d found so far.)</li>
            <li>They work great better than the full mask.</li>
            <li>Excellent, easy fit, comfortable and easy to keep on all night.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Fits great so much lighter!</li>
            <li>Works great at first..  </li>

            <li>very comfortable and light-weight.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t come off my head and the nose piece is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight and no air leaks.</li>
            <li>Mask and headgear is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very light.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very comfortable and feels like you don&#x27;t have anything on your face.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit once you find the right size nose piece, no leaks, very comfortable, easy to use, and best of all no red marks and cuts on your nose like I had.</li>
            <li>Seller is good and responds quickly.</li>
            <li>in all, very pleased with this mask and the user friendly design.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried...Would recommend seller and product to a friend</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, much better than a mask.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and can sleep better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Excellent and quiet.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the masks I would recommend this to all users of cpac machines.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than any of the others have been.</li>
            <li>I just love this nasal pillow.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>Much lighter, quieter, and great for side sleeping on either side.</li>
            <li>The Airfit P10 is the newest generation and it may be the perfect CPAP nasal mask (this is my second one).  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it is.  </li>
            <li>East Coast Medical customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li>I have tried many CPAP devices over the years, from masks to nasal pillows and all had some form of drawback until I had this nasal pillow recommended to me.</li>
            <li>This is so much more compact and softer.</li>
            <li>it is much more lighter than swift fx,but</li>
            <li>though I sleep almost ok.</li>
            <li>Also found I was able to move my head much more without causing leaks,</li>
            <li>If this had the head strap of the Aloha mask, it would be much better.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;I LOVE IT&amp;#34; because it is a CPAP mask after all.</li>
            <li>Cn inhale OK but can&#x27;t exhale without effort.  </li>
            <li>The claims of better sleep, easier use, cleaning, fitment, staying on while sleeping.</li>
            <li>AND I do sleep better and longer since I started using this mask.</li>
            <li>Excellent, better than former models...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy and recommend until I find something that&#x27;s better, although I don&#x27;t think that will happen soon.</li>
            <li>Light weight and creates a nice seal.</li>
            <li>So much better than the swift.</li>
            <li>but make more pain and problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head straps stretch effortlessly to contour the head and keep it in place most of the night.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working okay for me.  </li>
            <li>is ok)</li>
            <li>My favorite, since I have issues with my mouth being covered.</li>
            <li>I took a flyer on the Airfit and found it to be OK.  </li>
            <li>Just need to be able to buy nose fitting for just your size and not all.   </li>
            <li>For me, I like it better than the face cup mask.</li>
            <li>(has more to do with the seller than the product though).  </li>
            <li>This is my third CPAP mask, and the best yet.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS MASK</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Very pleased with the item, packed well.</li>
            <li>I am a side and back sleeper, and this thing is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>love the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the Airfit P10.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>Excellent Service, especially as we are in Australia!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Best of all, you can snuggle up to the person next to you without them getting a jet of air on their neck.</li>
            <li>After time it does not seem to work as good as far as getting a good seal is concerned on my nose.  </li>
            <li>If it had an adjustment I would be able to compensate for the strap stretching a bit.</li>
            <li>all right, good seller</li>
            <li>A great replacement for my older version.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased that its designed for easy cleaning and washing and doesn&#x27;t need anything special.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to care for.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have a Fisher &amp; Paykel Opus nasal pillow that I&#x27;ve used for well over a year and have found it to be pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a great step forward &amp; very light,comfortable &amp; fit&#x27;s well</li>
            <li>It is easy to disassemble and clean and the headband returns to shape after washing in warm soapy water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this mask for more than 2 months now and this is the quietest and most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve worn bar none.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to attempt to get away from the full mask, I purchased this unit along with the chin strap and am impressed with it so far I have been able to keep this unit on all night vs the full mask that usally</li>
            <li>The Airfit P10 is very light and relatively comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But the things that pleased me the most is how customer friendly and serviceable it is.</li>
            <li>loves this one - it&#x27;s so much more comfortable and the quality is great so far.</li>
            <li>I was most comfortable with, but I used it through the night, regardless of the size.</li>
            <li>The most comfortable mask I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>More comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li>the difference between the two is the swift nosepiece is all soft material which is great for side sleepers like me....</li>
            <li>So much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Finally a comfortable, light weight  device!</li>
            <li>This mask is the lightest, quietest and most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a CPAP for 7 years and this is the most comfortable mask that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So it is important that you use the size that gives you the most comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much easier to handle when tossing and turning and keeps a good seal.  </li>
            <li>It fits so comfortably, stays in place and maintain an excellent seal all night long.</li>
            <li>this is the most comfortable and easy mask to use.</li>
            <li>In fact, for the first week I kept pulling the mask away and checking for airflow to make sure it was on!  </li>
            <li>I think this item is way better than the product nose pillow and setup originally provided with my CPAP.</li>
            <li>An easy to use mask, seals well and isn&#x27;t bulky.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on, and lighter than others</li>
            <li>Fits easily,  reduced</li>
            <li>Strong grip.</li>
            <li>fits great, barely know it&#x27;s even there.</li>
            <li>Works better than the full mask.</li>
            <li>Much better than the full face mask.</li>
            <li>so I did not need to worry about a more full mask.</li>
            <li>have heard a lot of good things about the new nasal masks, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now (this order was just a backup) and it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine price for a Resmed Airfit P10.  </li>
            <li>light weight and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is fine  as others described it but unless they tell me this is a mistake</li>
            <li>It is so light and easy to use, I almost forget I am wearing it.</li>
            <li>Delivery was on time but not as quick as most things ordered.  </li>
            <li>I still strongly recommend this mask to anyone who wants the best night sleep possible despite having to use CPAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t block your face or feel as if something huge is on your face.  </li>
            <li>However, compared to the Airfit, the Opus is huge.  </li>
            <li>So comfortable you almost forget you are wearing it.</li>
            <li>it is so comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light.  </li>
            <li>in all I like it and will alternate between the swift and the airfit as they are both great...</li>
            <li>It is so light and comfortable yet stays put all night.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the nasal mask, but I imagine it would be as comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This one truly is light as air and in no way confining.  </li>
            <li>The mask is so comfortable I often forget I have it</li>
            <li>Light, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable as I was lead to belief</li>
            <li>The strap doesn&#x27;t hold the pillows in place that secure.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no annoying swivel to whistle.</li>
            <li>I found the medium size worked great for me and after only a day or two</li>
            <li>I started with the nasal mask and could never get comfortable -</li>
            <li>The P10 is extremely light</li>
            <li>Nose pillows come in three sizes to assure a comfort fit.  </li>
            <li>The exhaust vents allow air to escape with no annoying whistle sound like I had with the Wisp.  </li>
            <li>these are so comfortable and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>With some patience for a just a few nights, these are great!</li>
            <li>Feels quite comfortable</li>
            <li>and if I roll over it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Seller took great care in shipping and I received it earlier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Stays were I put it and is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t get those noisy leak spots or angles.</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence on whether to upgrade to this mask, allow me to shove you over the edge as this mask is far superior to anything I have tried in the 20 years I&#x27;ve been using a cpap.....</li>
            <li>Great upgrade - nice and small format.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant, because the person who originally fitted me for a mask said he didn&#x27;t like this style because it shoots air up the person&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li>This mask is ten times more effective and comfortable than the mask that originally came with my resmed system.</li>
            <li>Best Pap mask I used in the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li>More comfortable and much easier to sleep with.</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable and does not leak much at all.</li>
            <li>I have used several &amp;#34;nose pad&amp;#34; style masks, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is nice, i love the quiet vent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, and very stable.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this unit.  </li>
            <li>I now use it my full nights rest</li>
            <li>I have been using a full face mask for years and thought I&#x27;d give the nasal pillows a try.  </li>
            <li>so I was getting ready to drop another $150 and realized there must be a better mask out there by now.  </li>
            <li>Mask is very quiet and works good.  </li>
            <li>Good enough for me to write a review!</li>
            <li>need a full face mask.</li>
            <li>The Airfit P10 fits very nicely, and its very much more quiet than my old nasal mask.  </li>
            <li>It does rotate at the fitting that connects to the main hose, but I&#x27;ve had problems with the hose coiling up during the night.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this smaller mask and am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>I switched to nasal pillows a couple of years ago, and while a great improvement over a nasal mask, I still had trouble keeping a good seal despite trying different size pillows.  </li>
            <li>aside - overall, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>So much lighter and quieter than a full face mask!</li>
            <li>I have been using another resmed nasal system for many years and decided it was time to try out something new.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mask.</li>
            <li>i get better sleep with this new mask</li>
            <li>attached hose is very flexible, but does not crush easily.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and very comfortable plus because the air only flows in my nose, I don&#x27;t use the humidifier</li>
            <li>comfortable, compact, does not sit on lip, quiet, low air exhaust-( which makes my spouse happy</li>
            <li>After a few nights of use I was acclimated and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Soooo much better than old mask.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I needed to gasp for fresh air.</li>
            <li>This one is more comfortable and the only thing is I wish the straps had an adjustment on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the feel of the air feeds stuck in my nostrils, and it tends to make my septum and nostrils a bit sore.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really enjoying this one.  </li>
            <li>Love this mask, comfortable enough</li>
            <li>Works much better than the old ResMed Mirage II</li>
            <li>Simply the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mask for over a month now, and it is the most comfortable and quiet mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Sleeping is much more natural, and the bridge of my nose doesn&#x27;t get sore.</li>
            <li>Keeping those issues in mind, it&#x27;s worth the price, even if insurance won&#x27;t reimburse you.</li>
            <li>I was exclusively using the earlier generation Swift FX, but this is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than my old Resmed Mirage mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable and quiet mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best mask I&#x27;ve used so far (out of a total of two), but it has one major flaw.</li>
            <li>Still searching for the right</li>
            <li>so it is on the right track.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had to tape over the staples put in right.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it will hold up over time, I have my doubts but for right now it is by far and away the best mask I have worn</li>
            <li>Somehow, I miss the Darth Vader-like breathing sound from my old full face mask...  </li>
            <li>BUT....it is way better than my previous favorite nasal pillow-type mask, the Swift FX.</li>
            <li>The head straps are not adjustable but the material is soft and stretchy enough that the fit is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product and I would recommend buying this as long as you don&#x27;t have any sinus issue at all, or just have a full face mask for allergy season</li>
            <li>I have several different masks and this style is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very nose sensitive,  and he says it fits very comfortably.</li>
            <li>Is lighter than  what i&#x27;d been using which is good, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an &amp;#34;exhaust&amp;#34; function so it feels odd.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and quiet.</li>
            <li>and I have used the original Swift, the Swift II, the Swift LT and the Swift FX as each new generation was released.  </li>
            <li>I had high hope that this would give me an option from the full face mask.</li>
            <li>Comes with small medium and large nose pillows so you can really get a good fit.</li>
            <li>product description and installation instructions clear &amp; accurate.</li>
            <li>with this unit your able to sleep on your back or side and iit</li>
            <li>Item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>but it really does work well!</li>
            <li>No weird whistles or wooshes or rushes of air.</li>
            <li>After an extensive Amazon search and a some more internet research on this product, like would it be compatible with my Respironics machine, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure won&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>First time using a CPAP and this mask worked without flaw</li>
            <li>I like the mask and it is very quiet and so far, the most comfortable CPAP mask I have worn.  </li>
            <li>my first try</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I love the that is comes with 3 different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super quiet and comfortable to boot.  </li>
            <li>He has a rather large (but adorable) german nose and still uses the medium size that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Bought from Cpap Deals and tried this product as an alternative to the Resmed head mask after reading the great reviews ..turns out that it was close to causing serious complications for me.</li>
            <li>Others have complained about the lack of adjustment of the headgear, but the current headband works perfectly for me:  </li>
            <li>I love the cushion system, however I can&#x27;t wear the headgear because it can&#x27;t be adjusted for a smaller head &amp; slides off my fine hair the second I move.</li>
            <li>The other big positives for me are that these pillows are much more comfortable than masks and these work better by far for me.</li>
            <li>It sure beats the full and half mask.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried a nasal pillow-type mask, and I really like it, compared to the nasal cushion-type mask, with a plastic frame and forehead cushion.</li>
            <li>The attached hose is super soft and flexible.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t slip around at night and fits into my nasal passages very minimally and well.</li>
            <li>make sure you have humidifier and climateLine to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li>1st nasal pillow mask I&#x27;ve tried, transition from full mask was seamless, much lighter and easier to handle.</li>
            <li>I had my husband try it with the large pillows.</li>
            <li>(I have a large head)</li>
            <li>Then I tried the LARGE nasal pillow.  </li>
            <li>So what I did was simply staple right through the sleeve and plastic frame after I got it set to my perfect size (a little loose</li>
            <li>outside of the package is stamped with; &amp;#34;Not for sale, for use by sleep lab&amp;#34; ... which means someone is taking these items and reselling them at a HUGE mark up....</li>
            <li>Fits very well, will buy again when a replacement is needed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and quiet.  </li>
            <li>It is a real advance in CPAP technology.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, product as described, well priced.</li>
            <li>Fits a lot faster than the swift fx and very adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So comfortable, no lines on my face and so quiet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s quiet, but none</li>
            <li>Resmed needs to make a mask with the quiet venting of the Airfit P10 with the comfortable headgear of the Swift FX.</li>
            <li>Very rapid shipment.</li>
            <li>The head gear that comes with this mask is so much easier to wear</li>
            <li>Fits on nose very well.</li>
            <li>this was a much needed change</li>
            <li>Almost silent performance and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real sleep apnea patient and this is not a shill review...</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li>Very noisy when I breathe out.</li>
            <li>The mask is very silent and light weight.</li>
            <li>; strap that really doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much care for the head gear.</li>
            <li>Fits better than I expected.</li>
            <li>So much so, I&#x27;ve bought 3</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>fast service and item as described</li>
            <li>so I actually had more length than the old mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of masks over the last 10 years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The nasal pad is so soft, fits just right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light, doesn&#x27;t move around during the night, and is incredibly quiet (almost silent).</li>
            <li>I received the nasal pillow and had a full nights sleep in various positions in my bed!!</li>
            <li>This mask is small, light, quiet, and seals beautifully with practically no pressure, possibly due to the two layer design of the nasal pads.  </li>
            <li>I think that it is very comfortable and seems to keep the nose pillows snug, without being too tight.  </li>
            <li>Im getting a much better sleep with less weight on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several different masks throughout the years, but this one is absolutely my favorite</li>
            <li>an older Resmed mask I had.  </li>
            <li>but then I realized it connects to the main tube that&#x27;s connected to the machine</li>
            <li>Easier to sleep with just the one main strap</li>
            <li>My pressure is a bit high and there was concern about using this type of mask.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this one out.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who hates using a nose mask to sleep.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, a must buy.</li>
            <li>This vendor is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these for anyone to try.</li>
            <li>This is the mask my son uses and loves, so I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, I highly recommend the Opus for side sleepers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s much less intrusive and it helps me feel just a little bit more normal at bedtime :)</li>
            <li>and I had to get used to a little more forceful exhale.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, and I adapted to it very quickly (was previously using the swift fx model).</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t feel a breeze more than a few inches from it.  </li>
            <li>During the 11 years I have used a CPAP machine I have had success only with nasal masks.  </li>
            <li>I finally found right mask for me.  </li>
            <li>The nasal pieces (comes with 3; S, M and L) snap right off for daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s low profile, comfortable, quiet, and the main</li>
            <li>Snug fit that does not let air out like my other masks have when I did sleep.</li>
            <li>Quieter than other &#x27;air pillow&#x27; designs and fit to head is improved.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any of these problems with the new mask.</li>
            <li>If you can afford to buy new every 4 months</li>
            <li>A bit tight at first in comparison, but got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>.... I will go online to a reseller for further purchases as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; mask set is only $99 bucks with free shipping...</li>
            <li>It is very soft on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Most have complex strap systems that don&#x27;t work well, and I usually wake up in the middle of the night and it is leaking and not giving good air flow.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the strap stretches over time but can be remedied by soaking in HOT water and throwing in drier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only two cons are: First; the head strap stretches over time, however it can be remedied by throwing it in the dryer for 10 mins.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned about the short hose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first solid night of sleep without any pain or discomfort.  </li>
            <li>With the old mask, the cpap suppliers were trying to sign me up for a 3 year, $300/year annual &#x27;maintenance&#x27; package, which included 2 new hoses, new mask, cleaning wipes etc.  </li>
            <li>Light weight made so the price seemed a little high.</li>
            <li>This new unit is so quite no matter what position I sleep in or what is near it</li>
            <li>Light and stays on my head with less straps</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of an elastic fabric that gets stretched out of shape so that the mask doesn&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
            <li>It is very light and you hardly know that you have it on.  </li>
            <li>Feels so light like a little headband.</li>
            <li>I would like to be able to make it a little looser than I can currently make it.  </li>
            <li>If they offered one size larger and maybe a little wider straps to distribute the force, it would be even better.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive as well</li>
            <li>My apnea is completely under control...</li>
            <li>Wow - anyone with a nose mask should throw it in the trash and buy this nasal pillow.</li>
            <li>This mask is way beyond any of the others as far as comfort.</li>
            <li>Until this mask came out my nothing came close to the Resmed Swift FX which was loud and had a tendency to break seal with position changing.</li>
            <li>No issues so far...</li>
            <li>How much could it possibly cost to make the strap adjustable with hook &amp; loop?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very simple design but works really well without any leaks from day one.  </li>
            <li>My old mask, which was also a ResMed, tended to move around and fall off as the velcro strap came undone, which woke me up.</li>
            <li>This mask is not only WAY more comfortable but for some reason doesn&#x27;t create that annoying sound.</li>
            <li>I had to remove during the night and revert to my old mask.  </li>
            <li>One of the problems I had with my old CPAP full-face mask is that it would leak air around the silicone seal.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how I slept at night, my face may shift my old mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easily stays in place, no more pressure on my face.</li>
            <li>I had found that my previous masks with the velcro adjustments seemed to pick up lint from my pillow and eventually become less effective.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, not knowing how it would work for him, since his original was not comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I tried a full face mask for 3 weeks and was still unable to sleep in bed comfortably causing me to resort to my recliner.</li>
            <li>It is a HUGE improvement over past masks.</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy, and it doesn&#x27;t stand up to long term usage at all.</li>
            <li>I used the large nasal pillow still it did not fit very well.  </li>
            <li>While it takes a little careful arrangement, it even allows me to sleep on my stomach,  my preferred position but something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of cpap and started with a Philiips Nuance nasal mask which squashed my nose, ears and left marks on my face.</li>
            <li>Again, thanks to those tiny silent vents.</li>
            <li>One last thing, with the full face mask my air flow was at 15 but with this one, I&#x27;m down to 11.</li>
            <li>While at first it seemed to be fine - after a while it did feel uncomfortable and sore.  </li>
            <li>This is the third mask I&#x27;ve tried and is, by far, the easiest for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li>I barely feel it in place.</li>
            <li>You can barely feel that the mask is there.  </li>
            <li>put this on downstairs when I opened the box and realized how much easier it is to do other things while it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>Although this fit comfortably and sealed tight, I felt like I was suffocating.</li>
            <li>This CPAP mask is quiet because of the mesh to allow air escape when you exhale, however the mesh does not allow as large a volume of air to escape as other masks, so you need to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>used to find my old gel masks on ebay for around 20 bucks, but those days are long gone.  </li>
            <li>The headstrap is only slightly adjustable by changing the distance between the split straps behind your head, and of course the elasticity of the strap, and at first it bothered me because it didn&#x27;t feel secure enough.</li>

            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job of that.  </li>
            <li> But beware after time it will stretch and lose that good seal it had before.</li>
            <li> Loved this thing.</li>
            <li> An adjustible head gear option may be nice, but the ease of putting this on and taking off is great.</li>

            <li> This is a good example of superiority through simplicity.</li>

            <li> I first got it, it was awesome.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful apparatus - much better than the full face mask.  </li>

            <li> This mask is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Great mask, comfortable and quieter than the one I had before, I will keep buying it</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve now discovered the ResMed Airfit P10, and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nice but did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first of all the mask itself is a very good item...</li>
            <li> This is a great improvement over my full face</li>
            <li> The good: Love the mask, very light</li>
            <li> Best mask I have used thus far!  </li>
            <li> I have used CPAP for 20 years and this is by far the best and quietest mask I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This was an authentic Resmed, but it is the kind of unit used in the overnight testing for sleep apnea at clinics.</li>
            <li> All these mask have there problems but this one is by far the best I found.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Despite those shortcomings it is the best and quietest and lightest mask we have tried so far</li>
            <li> All and all I would rate this as the best mask that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> Its by far the best one I&#x27;ve used to date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 CPAP masks and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll prefer this over the SwiftFx (which was the best thing I&#x27;d found so far.)</li>
            <li> They work great better than the full mask.</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy fit, comfortable and easy to keep on all night.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Fits great so much lighter!</li>
            <li> Works great at first..  </li>
            <li> quick and works great for a great price compared to the normal dr office equipment</li>

            <li> very comfortable and light-weight.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t come off my head and the nose piece is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very light weight and no air leaks.</li>

            <li> Very light.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very comfortable and feels like you don&#x27;t have anything on your face.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit once you find the right size nose piece, no leaks, very comfortable, easy to use, and best of all no red marks and cuts on your nose like I had.</li>
            <li> Seller is good and responds quickly.</li>
            <li> in all, very pleased with this mask and the user friendly design.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried...Would recommend seller and product to a friend</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, much better than a mask.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and can sleep better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Excellent and quiet.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the masks I would recommend this to all users of cpac machines.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than any of the others have been.</li>
            <li> I just love this nasal pillow.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> Much lighter, quieter, and great for side sleeping on either side.</li>
            <li> The Airfit P10 is the newest generation and it may be the perfect CPAP nasal mask (this is my second one).  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it is.  </li>
            <li> East Coast Medical customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I have tried many CPAP devices over the years, from masks to nasal pillows and all had some form of drawback until I had this nasal pillow recommended to me.</li>
            <li> This is so much more compact and softer.</li>
            <li> it is much more lighter than swift fx,but</li>
            <li> though I sleep almost ok.</li>
            <li> Also found I was able to move my head much more without causing leaks,</li>
            <li> If this had the head strap of the Aloha mask, it would be much better.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;I LOVE IT&amp;#34; because it is a CPAP mask after all.</li>
            <li> Cn inhale OK but can&#x27;t exhale without effort.  </li>
            <li> The claims of better sleep, easier use, cleaning, fitment, staying on while sleeping.</li>
            <li> AND I do sleep better and longer since I started using this mask.</li>
            <li> Excellent, better than former models...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy and recommend until I find something that&#x27;s better, although I don&#x27;t think that will happen soon.</li>
            <li> Light weight and creates a nice seal.</li>
            <li> So much better than the swift.</li>
            <li> but make more pain and problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head straps stretch effortlessly to contour the head and keep it in place most of the night.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working okay for me.  </li>
            <li> is ok)</li>
            <li> My favorite, since I have issues with my mouth being covered.</li>
            <li> I took a flyer on the Airfit and found it to be OK.  </li>
            <li> Just need to be able to buy nose fitting for just your size and not all.   </li>
            <li> For me, I like it better than the face cup mask.</li>
            <li> (has more to do with the seller than the product though).  </li>
            <li> This is my third CPAP mask, and the best yet.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MASK</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Very pleased with the item, packed well.</li>
            <li> I am a side and back sleeper, and this thing is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> love the price.  </li>
            <li> I love the Airfit P10.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service, especially as we are in Australia!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Best of all, you can snuggle up to the person next to you without them getting a jet of air on their neck.</li>
            <li> After time it does not seem to work as good as far as getting a good seal is concerned on my nose.  </li>
            <li> If it had an adjustment I would be able to compensate for the strap stretching a bit.</li>
            <li> all right, good seller</li>
            <li> A great replacement for my older version.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased that its designed for easy cleaning and washing and doesn&#x27;t need anything special.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have a Fisher &amp; Paykel Opus nasal pillow that I&#x27;ve used for well over a year and have found it to be pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a great step forward &amp; very light,comfortable &amp; fit&#x27;s well</li>
            <li> It is easy to disassemble and clean and the headband returns to shape after washing in warm soapy water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this mask for more than 2 months now and this is the quietest and most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve worn bar none.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to attempt to get away from the full mask, I purchased this unit along with the chin strap and am impressed with it so far I have been able to keep this unit on all night vs the full mask that usally</li>
            <li> The Airfit P10 is very light and relatively comfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But the things that pleased me the most is how customer friendly and serviceable it is.</li>
            <li> loves this one - it&#x27;s so much more comfortable and the quality is great so far.</li>
            <li> I was most comfortable with, but I used it through the night, regardless of the size.</li>
            <li> The most comfortable mask I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> More comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> the difference between the two is the swift nosepiece is all soft material which is great for side sleepers like me....</li>
            <li> So much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Finally a comfortable, light weight  device!</li>
            <li> This mask is the lightest, quietest and most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a CPAP for 7 years and this is the most comfortable mask that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So it is important that you use the size that gives you the most comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much easier to handle when tossing and turning and keeps a good seal.  </li>
            <li> It fits so comfortably, stays in place and maintain an excellent seal all night long.</li>
            <li> this is the most comfortable and easy mask to use.</li>
            <li> In fact, for the first week I kept pulling the mask away and checking for airflow to make sure it was on!  </li>
            <li> I think this item is way better than the product nose pillow and setup originally provided with my CPAP.</li>
            <li> An easy to use mask, seals well and isn&#x27;t bulky.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on, and lighter than others</li>
            <li> Fits easily,  reduced</li>
            <li> Strong grip.</li>
            <li> fits great, barely know it&#x27;s even there.</li>
            <li> Works better than the full mask.</li>
            <li> Much better than the full face mask.</li>
            <li> so I did not need to worry about a more full mask.</li>
            <li> have heard a lot of good things about the new nasal masks, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now (this order was just a backup) and it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine price for a Resmed Airfit P10.  </li>
            <li> light weight and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> The mask itself is fine  as others described it but unless they tell me this is a mistake</li>
            <li> It is so light and easy to use, I almost forget I am wearing it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time but not as quick as most things ordered.  </li>
            <li> I still strongly recommend this mask to anyone who wants the best night sleep possible despite having to use CPAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t block your face or feel as if something huge is on your face.  </li>
            <li> However, compared to the Airfit, the Opus is huge.  </li>
            <li> So comfortable you almost forget you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> it is so comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light.  </li>
            <li> in all I like it and will alternate between the swift and the airfit as they are both great...</li>
            <li> It is so light and comfortable yet stays put all night.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the nasal mask, but I imagine it would be as comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This one truly is light as air and in no way confining.  </li>
            <li> The mask is so comfortable I often forget I have it</li>
            <li> Light, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not as comfortable as I was lead to belief</li>
            <li> The strap doesn&#x27;t hold the pillows in place that secure.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no annoying swivel to whistle.</li>
            <li> I found the medium size worked great for me and after only a day or two</li>
            <li> I started with the nasal mask and could never get comfortable -</li>
            <li> The P10 is extremely light</li>
            <li> Nose pillows come in three sizes to assure a comfort fit.  </li>
            <li> The exhaust vents allow air to escape with no annoying whistle sound like I had with the Wisp.  </li>
            <li> these are so comfortable and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> With some patience for a just a few nights, these are great!</li>
            <li> Feels quite comfortable</li>
            <li> and if I roll over it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Seller took great care in shipping and I received it earlier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Stays were I put it and is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t get those noisy leak spots or angles.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence on whether to upgrade to this mask, allow me to shove you over the edge as this mask is far superior to anything I have tried in the 20 years I&#x27;ve been using a cpap.....</li>
            <li> Great upgrade - nice and small format.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant, because the person who originally fitted me for a mask said he didn&#x27;t like this style because it shoots air up the person&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> This mask is ten times more effective and comfortable than the mask that originally came with my resmed system.</li>
            <li> Best Pap mask I used in the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> More comfortable and much easier to sleep with.</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable and does not leak much at all.</li>
            <li> I have used several &amp;#34;nose pad&amp;#34; style masks, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The mask itself is nice, i love the quiet vent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, and very stable.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this unit.  </li>
            <li> I now use it my full nights rest</li>
            <li> I have been using a full face mask for years and thought I&#x27;d give the nasal pillows a try.  </li>
            <li> so I was getting ready to drop another $150 and realized there must be a better mask out there by now.  </li>
            <li> Mask is very quiet and works good.  </li>
            <li> Good enough for me to write a review!</li>
            <li> need a full face mask.</li>
            <li> The Airfit P10 fits very nicely, and its very much more quiet than my old nasal mask.  </li>
            <li> It does rotate at the fitting that connects to the main hose, but I&#x27;ve had problems with the hose coiling up during the night.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this smaller mask and am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> I switched to nasal pillows a couple of years ago, and while a great improvement over a nasal mask, I still had trouble keeping a good seal despite trying different size pillows.  </li>
            <li> aside - overall, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> So much lighter and quieter than a full face mask!</li>
            <li> I have been using another resmed nasal system for many years and decided it was time to try out something new.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mask.</li>
            <li> i get better sleep with this new mask</li>
            <li> attached hose is very flexible, but does not crush easily.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and very comfortable plus because the air only flows in my nose, I don&#x27;t use the humidifier</li>
            <li> comfortable, compact, does not sit on lip, quiet, low air exhaust-( which makes my spouse happy</li>
            <li> After a few nights of use I was acclimated and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Soooo much better than old mask.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I needed to gasp for fresh air.</li>
            <li> This one is more comfortable and the only thing is I wish the straps had an adjustment on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the feel of the air feeds stuck in my nostrils, and it tends to make my septum and nostrils a bit sore.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really enjoying this one.  </li>
            <li> Love this mask, comfortable enough</li>
            <li> Works much better than the old ResMed Mirage II</li>
            <li> Simply the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for over a month now, and it is the most comfortable and quiet mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Sleeping is much more natural, and the bridge of my nose doesn&#x27;t get sore.</li>
            <li> Keeping those issues in mind, it&#x27;s worth the price, even if insurance won&#x27;t reimburse you.</li>
            <li> I was exclusively using the earlier generation Swift FX, but this is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than my old Resmed Mirage mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and quiet mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best mask I&#x27;ve used so far (out of a total of two), but it has one major flaw.</li>
            <li> Still searching for the right</li>
            <li> so it is on the right track.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had to tape over the staples put in right.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will hold up over time, I have my doubts but for right now it is by far and away the best mask I have worn</li>
            <li> Somehow, I miss the Darth Vader-like breathing sound from my old full face mask...  </li>
            <li> BUT....it is way better than my previous favorite nasal pillow-type mask, the Swift FX.</li>
            <li> The head straps are not adjustable but the material is soft and stretchy enough that the fit is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great product and I would recommend buying this as long as you don&#x27;t have any sinus issue at all, or just have a full face mask for allergy season</li>
            <li> I have several different masks and this style is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li> My husband is very nose sensitive,  and he says it fits very comfortably.</li>
            <li> Is lighter than  what i&#x27;d been using which is good, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an &amp;#34;exhaust&amp;#34; function so it feels odd.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and quiet.</li>
            <li> and I have used the original Swift, the Swift II, the Swift LT and the Swift FX as each new generation was released.  </li>
            <li> I had high hope that this would give me an option from the full face mask.</li>
            <li> Comes with small medium and large nose pillows so you can really get a good fit.</li>
            <li> product description and installation instructions clear &amp; accurate.</li>
            <li> with this unit your able to sleep on your back or side and iit</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> but it really does work well!</li>
            <li> No weird whistles or wooshes or rushes of air.</li>
            <li> After an extensive Amazon search and a some more internet research on this product, like would it be compatible with my Respironics machine, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure won&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> First time using a CPAP and this mask worked without flaw</li>
            <li> I like the mask and it is very quiet and so far, the most comfortable CPAP mask I have worn.  </li>
            <li> my first try</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I love the that is comes with 3 different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super quiet and comfortable to boot.  </li>
            <li> He has a rather large (but adorable) german nose and still uses the medium size that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Bought from Cpap Deals and tried this product as an alternative to the Resmed head mask after reading the great reviews ..turns out that it was close to causing serious complications for me.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the lack of adjustment of the headgear, but the current headband works perfectly for me:  </li>
            <li> I love the cushion system, however I can&#x27;t wear the headgear because it can&#x27;t be adjusted for a smaller head &amp; slides off my fine hair the second I move.</li>
            <li> The other big positives for me are that these pillows are much more comfortable than masks and these work better by far for me.</li>
            <li> It sure beats the full and half mask.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried a nasal pillow-type mask, and I really like it, compared to the nasal cushion-type mask, with a plastic frame and forehead cushion.</li>
            <li> The attached hose is super soft and flexible.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t slip around at night and fits into my nasal passages very minimally and well.</li>
            <li> make sure you have humidifier and climateLine to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li> 1st nasal pillow mask I&#x27;ve tried, transition from full mask was seamless, much lighter and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> I had my husband try it with the large pillows.</li>
            <li> (I have a large head)</li>
            <li> Then I tried the LARGE nasal pillow.  </li>
            <li> So what I did was simply staple right through the sleeve and plastic frame after I got it set to my perfect size (a little loose</li>
            <li> outside of the package is stamped with; &amp;#34;Not for sale, for use by sleep lab&amp;#34; ... which means someone is taking these items and reselling them at a HUGE mark up....</li>
            <li> Fits very well, will buy again when a replacement is needed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and quiet.  </li>
            <li> It is a real advance in CPAP technology.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described, well priced.</li>
            <li> Fits a lot faster than the swift fx and very adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So comfortable, no lines on my face and so quiet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s quiet, but none</li>
            <li> Resmed needs to make a mask with the quiet venting of the Airfit P10 with the comfortable headgear of the Swift FX.</li>
            <li> Very rapid shipment.</li>
            <li> The head gear that comes with this mask is so much easier to wear</li>
            <li> Fits on nose very well.</li>
            <li> this was a much needed change</li>
            <li> Almost silent performance and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real sleep apnea patient and this is not a shill review...</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy when I breathe out.</li>
            <li> The mask is very silent and light weight.</li>
            <li> ; strap that really doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the head gear.</li>
            <li> Fits better than I expected.</li>
            <li> So much so, I&#x27;ve bought 3</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> fast service and item as described</li>
            <li> so I actually had more length than the old mask.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of masks over the last 10 years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The nasal pad is so soft, fits just right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light, doesn&#x27;t move around during the night, and is incredibly quiet (almost silent).</li>
            <li> I received the nasal pillow and had a full nights sleep in various positions in my bed!!</li>
            <li> This mask is small, light, quiet, and seals beautifully with practically no pressure, possibly due to the two layer design of the nasal pads.  </li>
            <li> I think that it is very comfortable and seems to keep the nose pillows snug, without being too tight.  </li>
            <li> Im getting a much better sleep with less weight on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different masks throughout the years, but this one is absolutely my favorite</li>
            <li> an older Resmed mask I had.  </li>
            <li> but then I realized it connects to the main tube that&#x27;s connected to the machine</li>
            <li> Easier to sleep with just the one main strap</li>
            <li> My pressure is a bit high and there was concern about using this type of mask.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this one out.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who hates using a nose mask to sleep.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, a must buy.</li>
            <li> This vendor is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these for anyone to try.</li>
            <li> This is the mask my son uses and loves, so I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, I highly recommend the Opus for side sleepers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s much less intrusive and it helps me feel just a little bit more normal at bedtime :)</li>
            <li> and I had to get used to a little more forceful exhale.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, and I adapted to it very quickly (was previously using the swift fx model).</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t feel a breeze more than a few inches from it.  </li>
            <li> During the 11 years I have used a CPAP machine I have had success only with nasal masks.  </li>
            <li> I finally found right mask for me.  </li>
            <li> The nasal pieces (comes with 3; S, M and L) snap right off for daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s low profile, comfortable, quiet, and the main</li>
            <li> Snug fit that does not let air out like my other masks have when I did sleep.</li>
            <li> Quieter than other &#x27;air pillow&#x27; designs and fit to head is improved.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any of these problems with the new mask.</li>
            <li> If you can afford to buy new every 4 months</li>
            <li> A bit tight at first in comparison, but got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> .... I will go online to a reseller for further purchases as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; mask set is only $99 bucks with free shipping...</li>
            <li> It is very soft on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Most have complex strap systems that don&#x27;t work well, and I usually wake up in the middle of the night and it is leaking and not giving good air flow.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the strap stretches over time but can be remedied by soaking in HOT water and throwing in drier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only two cons are: First; the head strap stretches over time, however it can be remedied by throwing it in the dryer for 10 mins.</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned about the short hose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first solid night of sleep without any pain or discomfort.  </li>
            <li> With the old mask, the cpap suppliers were trying to sign me up for a 3 year, $300/year annual &#x27;maintenance&#x27; package, which included 2 new hoses, new mask, cleaning wipes etc.  </li>
            <li> Light weight made so the price seemed a little high.</li>
            <li> This new unit is so quite no matter what position I sleep in or what is near it</li>
            <li> Light and stays on my head with less straps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of an elastic fabric that gets stretched out of shape so that the mask doesn&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
            <li> It is very light and you hardly know that you have it on.  </li>
            <li> Feels so light like a little headband.</li>
            <li> I would like to be able to make it a little looser than I can currently make it.  </li>
            <li> If they offered one size larger and maybe a little wider straps to distribute the force, it would be even better.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive as well</li>
            <li> My apnea is completely under control...</li>
            <li> Wow - anyone with a nose mask should throw it in the trash and buy this nasal pillow.</li>
            <li> This mask is way beyond any of the others as far as comfort.</li>
            <li> Until this mask came out my nothing came close to the Resmed Swift FX which was loud and had a tendency to break seal with position changing.</li>
            <li> No issues so far...</li>
            <li> How much could it possibly cost to make the strap adjustable with hook &amp; loop?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very simple design but works really well without any leaks from day one.  </li>
            <li> My old mask, which was also a ResMed, tended to move around and fall off as the velcro strap came undone, which woke me up.</li>
            <li> This mask is not only WAY more comfortable but for some reason doesn&#x27;t create that annoying sound.</li>
            <li> I had to remove during the night and revert to my old mask.  </li>
            <li> One of the problems I had with my old CPAP full-face mask is that it would leak air around the silicone seal.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how I slept at night, my face may shift my old mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easily stays in place, no more pressure on my face.</li>
            <li> I had found that my previous masks with the velcro adjustments seemed to pick up lint from my pillow and eventually become less effective.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, not knowing how it would work for him, since his original was not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I tried a full face mask for 3 weeks and was still unable to sleep in bed comfortably causing me to resort to my recliner.</li>
            <li> It is a HUGE improvement over past masks.</li>
            <li> It is very flimsy, and it doesn&#x27;t stand up to long term usage at all.</li>
            <li> I used the large nasal pillow still it did not fit very well.  </li>
            <li> While it takes a little careful arrangement, it even allows me to sleep on my stomach,  my preferred position but something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of cpap and started with a Philiips Nuance nasal mask which squashed my nose, ears and left marks on my face.</li>
            <li> Again, thanks to those tiny silent vents.</li>
            <li> One last thing, with the full face mask my air flow was at 15 but with this one, I&#x27;m down to 11.</li>
            <li> While at first it seemed to be fine - after a while it did feel uncomfortable and sore.  </li>
            <li> This is the third mask I&#x27;ve tried and is, by far, the easiest for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I barely feel it in place.</li>
            <li> You can barely feel that the mask is there.  </li>
            <li> put this on downstairs when I opened the box and realized how much easier it is to do other things while it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> Although this fit comfortably and sealed tight, I felt like I was suffocating.</li>
            <li> This CPAP mask is quiet because of the mesh to allow air escape when you exhale, however the mesh does not allow as large a volume of air to escape as other masks, so you need to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> used to find my old gel masks on ebay for around 20 bucks, but those days are long gone.  </li>
            <li> The headstrap is only slightly adjustable by changing the distance between the split straps behind your head, and of course the elasticity of the strap, and at first it bothered me because it didn&#x27;t feel secure enough.</li>
            <li> Oh Airfit, where have you been all my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost 13 years of struggling with my nasal mask, dealing with broken gel cushions, stretched out head gear that I have to put under my hair and constantly adjust, leaking air from the mask, sometimes right into my eyes, red lines all over my face, constant adjusting at night, loud noise and just an all over pain in the</li>
            <li> I used the older swift unit and always had trouble trying to find a position that would not create noise.  </li>
            <li> As produced by Resmed it does also include one pillows in each of the sizes small, medium, and large.  </li>
            <li> It comes with small, medium and large nasal pillows.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the the set that came with a small, medium and large pillow.</li>
            <li> Had tried other nose pieces before but they were uncomfortable and came off of my head very easily.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to use this mask because even the small nasal pillow was much too large for my nose.  </li>
            <li> Headgear is stretchy and thin, mask is hard to fit and seems to not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> My only minor issue is the &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; on the hose.  </li>
            <li> It was uncomfortably tight on me and even after a week it hadn&#x27;t stretched, or at least not enough to make it comfortable.  </li>
            <li> sonic early falls down causing the seal to break.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy burrowing my head into the pillows, which with other masks has created an annoying sound hitting the pillow.</li>
            <li> Will be back for future purchases and thank you as we cannot get this and other resmed products at this price in Australia.</li>
            <li> then i do with the old one ive used for over 4 years, little tricky with side sleeping still working out the kinks.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered for 11 years with awkward fitting CPAP masks, air leakage, soars on my nose, pinched lips and marks on my cheeks, etc.</li>
            <li> Long term update:</li>
            <li> Was a long time</li>
            <li> As long as it all keeps tension .</li>
            <li> I no longer wake up with red marks all over my face, or dried out eyes because of the vents that used to be in the plastic part that covered my entire nose before I ordered this gem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is stiff even after several weeks of daily use which results in tangles on occasion.  </li>
            <li> or it will be too loose and not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> This one comes loose off the head at night and air leaks at that point.</li>
            <li> There were also three Velcro straps that kept coming loose.</li>
            <li> Putting it on upside down is a 50% possibility every time, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> The only negative (small one) is that the nasal pillows seem to be firmer than those on the swift, but not really a comfort problem after the first day.  </li>
            <li> It literally weighs only a few ounces, does not seem durable, and definitely does not FEEL like a product costing $70 to $100 (the price was $100 two weeks ago, and that&#x27;s what I paid, not knowing they hike the price on occasion, which is not exactly highly-ethical from a seller standpoint).  </li>
            <li> Printed on the side of the blue material, in black it says in caps, &amp;#34;NOT FOR SALE SLEEP CENTER MASK&#x27;.</li>
            <li> and so I had to add a little piece in the middle to make it about an inch longer.</li>
            <li> the airfit has the hard frame which the soft nose piece snaps in to... it can dislodge if you are a restless side sleeper...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it works over time, but it is by far the lightest and least cumbersome mask I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Then toss it in the dryer for just a few minutes and it &#x27;tightens it back up&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Also minimal air leakage.</li>
            <li> I expect trouble such as this when I order from Ebay, but when I order from Amazon I expect the item to be a legitimately offered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a rough sleeper, and the mask stays in place.  </li>
            <li> Stanford Sleep Center recommended this one.</li>
            <li> This performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If you are struggling with a complicated nose mask definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you can sleep with your mouth closed like I do, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few months.  </li>
            <li> After less than 5 months the strap has stretched so the mask becomes lose</li>
            <li> The straps are very thin and small so its comfortable.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I cannot wear any other type of mask.  </li>
            <li> No more red mask marks on the face!</li>
            <li> No brand markings were noted as stated by other buyers.</li>
            <li> Have used 3 different pillows over the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> so I did not experience the problems other reviewers are discussing.</li>
            <li> Seller was extremely helpful in transaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other nostril pillow apparatus which did nothing</li>
            <li> If you have been punishing yourself with other masks, stop now and order the P10 via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I started with small, not enough air flow, so stepped up to medium</li>
            <li> only other not-so-good thing about this mask is if you open your mouth with this nasal mask while your CPAP is running, you will blow air out your mouth, make a horrible alien-like snoring sound, and you may frighten your partner!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the medium sized nasal pillows were too large, and the small ones felt like they weren&#x27;t providing enough air flow; inhaling felt like work.</li>
            <li> The headgear stretches after a few weeks and becomes too loose, so that the nasal pillows begin to leak.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> The ONLY complaint I have is the headgear slips off the holder.</li>
            <li> any my restlessness has improved from 80% to average 97%</li>
            <li> There may be some minimal adjusting to ensure each pillow is firmly in each nostril.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My average AHI was dropped down from 3.0 to 1.0.  </li>
            <li> I can sleep in any position with this (except face down of course).</li>
            <li> Wish we could try these things before we plunk down $80.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m getting a less interrupted sleep.</li>
            <li> have to get this thing off for a while&amp;#34; as I used to with both my previous masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use the half nasal face mask and I</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s weird breathing out, because all the back pressure builds in your nostrils in a way that is quite different from a fully enclosed nose model CPAP.  </li>
            <li> somehow i feel that i get less air</li>
            <li> something my previous nasal mask had severe issues with.  </li>
            <li> Less noisy.</li>
            <li> The problem with the Swift FX was twofold: 1) the amount of exhaust from the mask, and 2) a slight whistling from the swivel/elbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s why the price is so slow, but I find the nondisclosure very shabby or worse if it&#x27;s violating an agreement with the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not true.  </li>
            <li> The typical feeling you are fighting it a little like it was making use of every bit of pressure it can.</li>
            <li> if that matters when it&#x27;s so tight</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel tight, but it stays in place all night and keeps the mask under my nose.  </li>
            <li> He felt the straps were too tight on his head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter, doesn&#x27;t leak as I roll around at night, doesn&#x27;t put excessive pressure on my nostrils, the band doesn&#x27;t rub my cheeks as my other nasal pillow mask did.</li>
            <li> I think the strap stretches over a little time and it makes the mask too</li>
            <li> Upon examining the exhale vents, I do not see how this could possibly properly vent exhaled air unless you were exhaling very, very hard.</li>
            <li> I hated my full face mask because the cushions were expensive, they never sealed right and the bottom strap always cut into my neck.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased.</li>
            <li> It took a few nights to figure out which size pillow</li>
            <li> My husband has used a CPAP for a few years and likes the comfort of the nose pillows.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few issues.  </li>
            <li> others seem to be a waste</li>
            <li> but it had trouble sealing around my moustache.</li>
            <li> I started out with a Wisp and switched to this one after a few months.  </li>
            <li> The bad: First of all it has stamped on the side &amp;#34;not for sale clinic studies&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to break the hard plastic frame of my previous mask when it got jostled around in my airline luggage.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with the previous model was if you had anything in front of your face (like pillow or sheets)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I went back to my old CPAP for now, for what that implies.</li>
            <li> If you use a resmed mirage Micro TM Nasal farms system Mask it takes a little committed persistence to get used to !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I get lazy sometimes</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s a small one)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch, just usually hits me in the face.</li>
            <li> No more line marks on my face in the morning.  </li>
            <li> not sure what you can do with them.</li>
            <li> I think I need small though, but I haven&#x27;t changed it out yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from chronic allergy and rhinitis issues for over fifty years and was not sure if I could use these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, fits snugly without leaving a crease on my face.  </li>
            <li> I usually change positions during the night and the Airfit P10 stays in place and does not get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The AirFit P10 is so small and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> It felt comfortable at the start but during the night it caused my nostrils to blow up like a balloon, very painful and the air pressure seemed to increase causing me to be out of breadth.</li>
            <li> because it has very thin straps believe they will stretch later on.</li>
            <li> I originally had a nose mask that i hated using.</li>
            <li> With that said, the mask that was sent to me was labeled for sleep lab use only, not for sale, so that is a little bit of a disappointment</li>
            <li> plus is that there is not a strong stream of air blowing from the mask!</li>
            <li> The worst was if I drooled, saliva accumulated in the mask and either ended up down the tube which would wake me up with the gurgling noise and I&#x27; d have to drain the tube before I could go back to sleep or it would end up back on my face.</li>
            <li> , you hardly know you have something on.</li>
            <li> Air does not blow out hard against someone sleeping in the bed with you.</li>
            <li> i hardly noticed it on.</li>
            <li> Hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> You hardly know you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> I had complex apnea and was prescribed a BiPAP machine.  </li>
            <li> I felt that the correspondence with the vendor bordered on rude.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is not with the mask but with the seller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The suggested retail price is $129 and it usually sells for approximately $110.  </li>
            <li> Not good if you move around in your sleep.</li>
            <li> no good.</li>
            <li> Hardly know its there!  </li>
            <li> They are so uncomfortable by comparison and will usually cause irritation one way or another after time.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to get positioned correctly.  </li>
            <li> However all the headgear associated with the ones he had get irritating and have to be readjusted&lt;br</li>
            <li> Game changer for me.  </li>
            <li> I read that if you keep each strap together behind your head, that is the tightest setting.  </li>
            <li> But alas, I will never win any beauty pageants with this thing.  </li>
            <li> there is nothing bad  to say about the system ,its just hard to get use to.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to say how well it works...</li>
            <li> All of them were uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to those nasty red marks on the bridge of your nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy another one if and when this one fails...</li>
            <li> that said, it is not perfect.  </li>
            <li> Ill check in after some time....</li>
            <li> The exhaust would always blow on something and make noise or blow cold air on my wife.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about blowing cold air on your husband or wife.  </li>
            <li> Bad if you have any sinus issues.</li>
            <li> After removing the AirFit P10 nasal mask in the morning, I do have a bit of soreness on my nostril area - but it is not that bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m claustrophobic when it comes to a face mask-</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way disappointed in this item, and will be way disappointed in Amazon if they allow this seller to continue using their system.</li>
            <li> If you use a nasal pillow, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not wearing your mask like you should or simply hate yours..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible design.</li>
            <li> It made my nose hurt something awful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the headgear is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome. Fits great so much lighter!</li>
            <li> I love it. I hated my full face mask because the cushions were expensive, they never sealed right and the bottom strap always cut into my neck. The worst was if I drooled, saliva accumulated in the mask and either ended up down the tube which would wake me up with the gurgling noise and I&#x27; d have to drain the tube before I could go back to sleep or it would end up back on my face. Then there was the hassle of buying water for the humidifier. I don&#x27;t have any of these problems with the new mask. It is light weight and very comfortable plus because the air only flows in my nose, I don&#x27;t use the humidifier and therefore I don&#x27;t have to buy water. One last thing, with the full face mask my air flow was at 15 but with this one, I&#x27;m down to 11.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m claustrophobic when it comes to a face mask-so I stopped using my CPAP machine.  My mom bought this and suggested I give it a try. It works great for me!  VERY SATISFIED with the product.  It took a few nights to figure out which size pillow I was most comfortable with, but I used it through the night, regardless of the size.</li>
            <li> great product and seller</li>
            <li> I tried a full face mask for 3 weeks and was still unable to sleep in bed comfortably causing me to resort to my recliner. I received the nasal pillow and had a full nights sleep in various positions in my bed!! What a blessing!!</li>
            <li> Soooo much better than old mask. Working great shipped on time. I will use again! A lot cheaper online also!</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy fit, comfortable and easy to keep on all night.</li>
            <li> Good.Happy with the goods and service.fast.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence on whether to upgrade to this mask, allow me to shove you over the edge as this mask is far superior to anything I have tried in the 20 years I&#x27;ve been using a cpap.....enough said...</li>
            <li> Easily stays in place, no more pressure on my face.</li>
            <li> Although this fit comfortably and sealed tight, I felt like I was suffocating. I kept having to yawn as if I was not getting enough oxygen. It felt as if I was repeatedly breathing back in the air I had just exhaled. Upon examining the exhale vents, I do not see how this could possibly properly vent exhaled air unless you were exhaling very, very hard. My heart started pounding and I felt like I needed to gasp for fresh air. Terrible, terrible design.</li>
            <li> My husband has used a CPAP for a few years and likes the comfort of the nose pillows. However all the headgear associated with the ones he had get irritating and have to be readjusted&lt;br /&gt;He loves this one - it&#x27;s so much more comfortable and the quality is great so far.</li>
            <li> Coming from another Resmed nasal pillow mask, I was not dissapointed.  This thing is whisper quiet.  My biggest complaint with the previous model was if you had anything in front of your face (like pillow or sheets) you&#x27;d hear the air blowing.  This one doesn&#x27;t do that.  Only issue I&#x27;ve had is the strap wasn&#x27;t quite big enough and so I had to add a little piece in the middle to make it about an inch longer.</li>
            <li> The good: Love the mask, very light, you hardly know you have something on. Very light weight. The straps are very thin and small so its comfortable. I never have to adjust for air leakage. Air does not blow out hard against someone sleeping in the bed with you. That is the reason I bought it and it does a good job of that.  The bad: First of all it has stamped on the side &amp;#34;not for sale clinic studies&amp;#34;. Haven&#x27;t figured that one out. No adjustment, don&#x27;t need them now but because it has very thin straps believe they will stretch later on. Light weight made so the price seemed a little high. Not sure how it will hold up over time, I have my doubts but for right now it is by far and away the best mask I have worn and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Delivery was on time but not as quick as most things ordered.  Long term update: The most comfortable mask I have ever owned. So comfortable you almost forget you are wearing it. The only problem is what I thought might happen. After less than 5 months the strap has stretched so the mask becomes lose and there is no adjustment. If you can afford to buy new every 4 months or so you can&#x27;t beat this mask.  But beware after time it will stretch and lose that good seal it had before.</li>
            <li> This one is the winner for me. This is the third mask I&#x27;ve tried and is, by far, the easiest for me to sleep in. It does seem to slip occasionally, but all of the masks I&#x27;ve tried have done so at about the same frequency.</li>
            <li> I love it it is so comfortable</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing.  I finally found right mask for me.  My average AHI was dropped down from 3.0 to 1.0.  Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different masks throughout the years, but this one is absolutely my favorite it&#x27;s low profile, comfortable, quiet, and the main plus is that there is not a strong stream of air blowing from the mask! The head straps are not adjustable but the material is soft and stretchy enough that the fit is quite nice. Hopefully the elastic remains that way over time.  As for now, I&#x27;m going to stick with this mask.</li>
            <li> all right, good seller</li>
            <li> Works better than the full mask. More comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> 1st nasal pillow mask I&#x27;ve tried, transition from full mask was seamless, much lighter and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> This mask is the best mask I have used ever.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the strap stretches over time but can be remedied by soaking in HOT water and throwing in drier.</li>
            <li> This unit is awesome.  I used the older swift unit and always had trouble trying to find a position that would not create noise.  The exhaust would always blow on something and make noise or blow cold air on my wife.  This new unit is so quite no matter what position I sleep in or what is near it and you don&#x27;t feel a breeze more than a few inches from it.  It is much easier to handle when tossing and turning and keeps a good seal.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this unit.  BUY IT!  You won&#x27;t regret it.  The only negative (small one) is that the nasal pillows seem to be firmer than those on the swift, but not really a comfort problem after the first day.  Again, BUY IT!  You won&#x27;t regret it.    Update: I have noticed a few issues.  Since the strap is a one piece unit, you can&#x27;t place any additional padding which might help with imprinting on the scalp for us bald guys.  Also, it adjusts by spreading the straps apart.  I would like to be able to make it a little looser than I can currently make it.  If they offered one size larger and maybe a little wider straps to distribute the force, it would be even better.</li>
            <li> If you use a resmed mirage Micro TM Nasal farms system Mask it takes a little committed persistence to get used to ! You feel initially oxygen starved ! Otherwise it is a great step forward &amp; very light,comfortable &amp; fit&#x27;s well</li>
            <li> Great mask, comfortable and quieter than the one I had before, I will keep buying it</li>
            <li> Loved this thing. very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fits very well, will buy again when a replacement is needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent and quiet. I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt; very pleased</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.  I had complex apnea and was prescribed a BiPAP machine.  My pressure is a bit high and there was concern about using this type of mask.  I have facial hair so the over-the-mouth mask kept leaking.. and I&#x27;m not shaving.  This has worked wonderfully!  I have gotten so used to it that I don&#x27;t even notice I&#x27;m wearing it anymore.  It&#x27;s so light.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now (this order was just a backup) and it&#x27;s just fine.  I remove the fabric band to wash it by hand.  Then toss it in the dryer for just a few minutes and it &#x27;tightens it back up&#x27;.  The nasal pieces (comes with 3; S, M and L) snap right off for daily cleaning.  I&#x27;ll admit I get lazy sometimes and I was warned that the oil from your face can deteriorate the mask.  I haven&#x27;t had that issue at all.  My skin is sensitive as well but no issues there either.  Meanwhile, I cannot wear any other type of mask.  They are so uncomfortable by comparison and will usually cause irritation one way or another after time.  My apnea is completely under control... and it&#x27;s great to sleep again at night!  If you&#x27;re not wearing your mask like you should or simply hate yours.. I highly recommend trying this one out.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable unobtrusive I would recommend it</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you why... first of all the mask itself is a very good item... my dissatisfaction is not with the equipment itself... it is with the sellers of this item...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside of the package is stamped with; &amp;#34;Not for sale, for use by sleep lab&amp;#34; ... which means someone is taking these items and reselling them at a HUGE mark up.... I purchased mine for $54.99 plus $4.99 S and H.... five days later they have gone up 20 bucks !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this item being for sleep labs only is that there are only 2 separate pieces instead of 3... the short tube and entire strap piece are fused together... so it is NOT the same item you would buy elsewhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mask.... it is comparable to the Resmed fx swift, which I currently have... the difference between the two is the swift nosepiece is all soft material which is great for side sleepers like me.... the airfit has the hard frame which the soft nose piece snaps in to... it can dislodge if you are a restless side sleeper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like it and will alternate between the swift and the airfit as they are both great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But.... I will go online to a reseller for further purchases as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; mask set is only $99 bucks with free shipping...</li>
            <li> Much better than the masks I would recommend this to all users of cpac machines.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have used yet.  It is so light and comfortable yet stays put all night.  The attached hose is super soft and flexible.  There is almost no noise.  I don&#x27;t know how they did it but I love it.</li>
            <li> I originally had a nose mask that i hated using. I only used it for the 4 hours required and i would take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The airlift p10 is a night and day difference.  I now use it my full nights rest and it does not bother me one bit.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who hates using a nose mask to sleep.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to attempt to get away from the full mask, I purchased this unit along with the chin strap and am impressed with it so far I have been able to keep this unit on all night vs the full mask that usally at some point during the night I discard it...... with this unit your able to sleep on your back or side and iit stays in place without pulling against you.....</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t breathe through your sinuses once you put it on</li>
            <li> Is lighter than  what i&#x27;d been using which is good, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an &amp;#34;exhaust&amp;#34; function so it feels odd. It is an adjustment to accumulate the cushion or pillow.</li>
            <li> It sure beats the full and half mask. This one is more comfortable and the only thing is I wish the straps had an adjustment on it.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;CPAP friends&amp;#34; told me to buy this and it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> Best mask I&#x27;ve had.  it&#x27;s light and quiet.  Very good for travel.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use this mask because even the small nasal pillow was much too large for my nose.  I felt that the correspondence with the vendor bordered on rude.  I was not very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve done since getting my CPAP many years ago. I was reluctant, because the person who originally fitted me for a mask said he didn&#x27;t like this style because it shoots air up the person&#x27;s nose. Nothing could be further from the truth. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used a full-face mask all these years. This thing is amazing. It&#x27;s super light, doesn&#x27;t move around during the night, and is incredibly quiet (almost silent). I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this mask, and I will be using it from this point forward. WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> This is my third CPAP mask, 2nd with nasal pillows. It&#x27;s so much better than any of the others have been. It&#x27;s lighter, doesn&#x27;t leak as I roll around at night, doesn&#x27;t put excessive pressure on my nostrils, the band doesn&#x27;t rub my cheeks as my other nasal pillow mask did. I know I&#x27;m getting a less interrupted sleep. I never wake up with the feeling &amp;#34;I have to get this thing off for a while&amp;#34; as I used to with both my previous masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint (and it&#x27;s a small one) is I wish there was a pivot for the hose closer to the mask. It does rotate at the fitting that connects to the main hose, but I&#x27;ve had problems with the hose coiling up during the night. It doesn&#x27;t pinch, just usually hits me in the face. I wake up, twist it at the coupling, and all is well for the rest of the night.</li>
            <li> best sleep I have had since getting this mask. I have had a cpap for 8 years, mask stays put and vents air away from me so it does not interfere with my sleep. Fits in nostrils great.</li>
            <li> It made my nose hurt something awful.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and perfect for my application</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.  Light weight.  The one downside is that the elastic straps that hold the nose piece in place tend to stretch.  Eventually, they will become too lose and will have to be replaced.</li>
            <li> OMG! I just love this nasal pillow. It doesn&#x27;t block your face or feel as if something huge is on your face.  I used to use the half nasal face mask and I just couldn&#x27;t get use to it. My wife and kids would get scared too but not anymore. Im getting a much better sleep with less weight on my face.</li>
            <li> This is my secend purchase it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomend.Locally sells around $100</li>
            <li> Much better than the full face mask.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the lack of adjustment on the straps</li>
            <li> I love the cushion system, however I can&#x27;t wear the headgear because it can&#x27;t be adjusted for a smaller head &amp; slides off my fine hair the second I move. If it had headgear like the swift fx nasal pillows it would be my perfect mask.</li>
            <li> Was a long time Swift FX user, this has been a great change for me. Very comfortable and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> Fits well..nice to know there are options that are cheaper than my dr..and the quality is the same.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Item exactly as advertised. Service great.</li>
            <li> I have used CPAP for 20 years and this is by far the best and quietest mask I have ever used.  It is a real advance in CPAP technology.  I don&#x27;t use the nasal mask, but I imagine it would be as comfortable.  This one truly is light as air and in no way confining.  It would be great for those with claustrophobia</li>
            <li> This has met all of my expectations.  It is very light weight and yet does not come off at night. No more line marks on my face in the morning.  Also minimal air leakage.</li>
            <li> I have been using another resmed nasal system for many years and decided it was time to try out something new. So glad I did. Much lighter, quieter, and great for side sleeping on either side.</li>
            <li> During the 11 years I have used a CPAP machine I have had success only with nasal masks.  My preference is Resmed and I have used the original Swift, the Swift II, the Swift LT and the Swift FX as each new generation was released.  Each generation has been an improvement.  The Airfit P10 is the newest generation and it may be the perfect CPAP nasal mask (this is my second one).  Others have complained about the lack of adjustment of the headgear, but the current headband works perfectly for me:  The mask is so comfortable I often forget I have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested retail price is $129 and it usually sells for approximately $110.  The great  price I paid buying through Amazon was $71.25.</li>
            <li> This is a fine price for a Resmed Airfit P10.  But the description shows the entire mask and states that there are 3 in the package at a cost of $22 or so per each.  That&#x27;s not true.  This is the standard package from Resmed containing one Airfit P10 mask.  As produced by Resmed it does also include one pillows in each of the sizes small, medium, and large.  But understand that you will only be receiving 1 mask, not 3 as specified in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just noticed the imprint on the side of the mask that says this mask is not for resale.  I don&#x27;t know if I can change my \\&quot;star\\&quot; count or not, but this is way to unbecoming of a offering from Amazon.com.  I expect trouble such as this when I order from Ebay, but when I order from Amazon I expect the item to be a legitimately offered product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way disappointed in this item, and will be way disappointed in Amazon if they allow this seller to continue using their system.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described, well priced. Will be back for future purchases and thank you as we cannot get this and other resmed products at this price in Australia.</li>
            <li> works great. very comfortable. The only thing I&#x27;ve ever used since I needed a cpap.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the nasal pillow.  Wow - anyone with a nose mask should throw it in the trash and buy this nasal pillow. So much more comfortable.  No more red mask marks on the face!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, works great!</li>
            <li> I used to use the &amp;#34;over the nose with forehead pad,&amp;#34;style CPAP attachment.  I took a gamble on this product.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it is.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should.  I&#x27;ll never go back..</li>
            <li> The Resmed Airfit P10 is a lot flimsier than I assumed it would be.  It literally weighs only a few ounces, does not seem durable, and definitely does not FEEL like a product costing $70 to $100 (the price was $100 two weeks ago, and that&#x27;s what I paid, not knowing they hike the price on occasion, which is not exactly highly-ethical from a seller standpoint).  I&#x27;m not crazy about the feel of the air feeds stuck in my nostrils, and it tends to make my septum and nostrils a bit sore.  Plus it&#x27;s weird breathing out, because all the back pressure builds in your nostrils in a way that is quite different from a fully enclosed nose model CPAP.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I went back to my old CPAP for now, for what that implies.</li>
            <li> Game changer for me.  Light, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have evre owned. I&#x27;m buying another to have as a spare for when I travel</li>
            <li> Best nasal pillow I&#x27;ve had. . Super quiet and comfortable to boot.  If you use a nasal pillow, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Airfit P10 fits very nicely, and its very much more quiet than my old nasal mask.  I&#x27;m a rough sleeper, and the mask stays in place.  The product came in a retail box.  East Coast Medical customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit once you find the right size nose piece, no leaks, very comfortable, easy to use, and best of all no red marks and cuts on your nose like I had. Highly recommended, a must buy.</li>
            <li> Quieter that an older Resmed mask I had.  More comfortable and much easier to sleep with.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. He says it is the best mask he has had, and doesn&#x27;t even know he has it on. No brand markings were noted as stated by other buyers.</li>
            <li> I have tried many CPAP devices over the years, from masks to nasal pillows and all had some form of drawback until I had this nasal pillow recommended to me. It is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t slip around at night and fits into my nasal passages very minimally and well. The straps are elastic and self adjust to your head size without having to keep adjusting them during the night. It is difficult to say how well it works...but it really does work well!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried a nasal pillow-type mask, and I really like it, compared to the nasal cushion-type mask, with a plastic frame and forehead cushion. It is also very quiet, venting through a mesh to either side of the nose. I&#x27;ve managed to break the hard plastic frame of my previous mask when it got jostled around in my airline luggage. This is so much more compact and softer. This appears to be a regular commercial product, as opposed to some reviewers who mentioned that their masks were stamped &#x27;not for sale&#x27;; I can&#x27;t find anything like that on mine.</li>
            <li> Not as comfortable as I was lead to belief and I still have issues with leaks</li>
            <li> been using a different style mask. there is nothing bad  to say about the system ,its just hard to get use to.</li>
            <li> I am using it for two weeks it is much more lighter than swift fx,but somehow i feel that i get less air though I sleep almost ok. But woke up several times maybe it s just for getting use it.</li>
            <li> Quiet, but often slips off. Not good if you move around in your sleep.</li>
            <li> An easy to use mask, seals well and isn&#x27;t bulky.  Also found I was able to move my head much more without causing leaks, something my previous nasal mask had severe issues with.  Fits snug, I can see some people having issues with that, but with this type of rubber band style head gear, it&#x27;s either that or it will be too loose and not stay in place.  So far I&#x27;m really enjoying this one.  An adjustible head gear option may be nice, but the ease of putting this on and taking off is great.</li>
            <li> Have used 3 different pillows over the past 2 years. This one comes loose off the head at night and air leaks at that point. The strap doesn&#x27;t hold the pillows in place that secure. I do like the way the air vents on each side of the tube. Less noisy. If this had the head strap of the Aloha mask, it would be much better. The Aloha doesn&#x27;t move off the head like this one, but the vent is on the tube attachment and makes too mush noise because it leaks around the swivel connection. Still searching for the right mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stanford Sleep Center recommended this one. Dr&#x27;s don&#x27;t know everything...that&#x27;s for sure. I&#x27;ve worked with enough!</li>
            <li> Very happy customer in Canada that bought this product. Saved over 50% vs Canadian retailers!  Very lightweight, and I adapted to it very quickly (was previously using the swift fx model). Fits a lot faster than the swift fx and very adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the things that pleased me the most is how customer friendly and serviceable it is. Very pleased that its designed for easy cleaning and washing and doesn&#x27;t need anything special.  With the old mask, the cpap suppliers were trying to sign me up for a 3 year, $300/year annual &#x27;maintenance&#x27; package, which included 2 new hoses, new mask, cleaning wipes etc.  None of which were necessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very pleased with this mask and the user friendly design.</li>
            <li> I recent started using a CPAP and tried several masks. All of them were uncomfortable. This mask is way beyond any of the others as far as comfort.</li>
            <li> This was an authentic Resmed, but it is the kind of unit used in the overnight testing for sleep apnea at clinics. It is very flimsy, and it doesn&#x27;t stand up to long term usage at all. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> All these mask have there problems but this one is by far the best I found.&lt;br /&gt;Nice it comes with three size noise pieces but once you find the one that fits&lt;br /&gt;the others seem to be a waste not sure what you can do with them.</li>
            <li> So comfortable, no lines on my face and so quiet.  Beyond happy!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Item was retail packaging and sealed.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all. This is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this mask, comfortable enough I can feel my pillow on the back of my head again!</li>
            <li> This nasal mask is about the best I have ever used to date (5 yrs.). Until this mask came out my nothing came close to the Resmed Swift FX which was loud and had a tendency to break seal with position changing. The Airfit P10 is the best out there in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two cons are: First; the head strap stretches over time, however it can be remedied by throwing it in the dryer for 10 mins. and Second; the extension hose does not swivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these to things were perfected it would be the end all in nasal pillow mask perfection. I still strongly recommend this mask to anyone who wants the best night sleep possible despite having to use CPAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI I purchased this mask from D.H.M. so I did not experience the problems other reviewers are discussing.</li>
            <li> Headgear is too snug, no matter how I adjusted it. It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s quiet, but none if that matters when it&#x27;s so tight it keeps you awake. Resmed needs to make a mask with the quiet venting of the Airfit P10 with the comfortable headgear of the Swift FX.</li>
            <li> Very rapid shipment. Fit is perfect, couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. This vendor is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They work great better than the full mask.</li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;I LOVE IT&amp;#34; because it is a CPAP mask after all. Does anyone &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; any CPAP mask? BUT....it is way better than my previous favorite nasal pillow-type mask, the Swift FX. It is more comfortable and does not leak much at all. No weird whistles or wooshes or rushes of air. I don&#x27;t miss the swivel-tube connection at all. Also, don&#x27;t miss the blast of air that came out of the FX. I can sleep in any position with this (except face down of course).</li>
            <li> Finally a comfortable, light weight  device!</li>
            <li> I have been using a full face mask for years and thought I&#x27;d give the nasal pillows a try.  Best decision I could have ever made.  I would highly recommend these for anyone to try.</li>
            <li> Best and lightest ever!  Hardly know its there!  Built with a lot of thought!  Can&#x27;t say enough about it and intend to recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Cant sleep with it.  Cn inhale OK but can&#x27;t exhale without effort.  Very disappointed.  I had high hope that this would give me an option from the full face mask.</li>
            <li> Headgear is stretchy and thin, mask is hard to fit and seems to not stay on very well. Despite those shortcomings it is the best and quietest and lightest mask we have tried so far so it is on the right track.</li>
            <li> nothing is fun about wearing a nasal thing but this is the greatest one ever invented I give it 10 stars</li>
            <li> 20 years and 6 cpap masks this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Best CPAP mask I have ever used. The claims of better sleep, easier use, cleaning, fitment, staying on while sleeping. AND I do sleep better and longer since I started using this mask. The only one I will use now.</li>
            <li> So much lighter and quieter than a full face mask!</li>
            <li> This performs as expected.  My husband is very nose sensitive,  and he says it fits very comfortably. He has a rather large (but adorable) german nose and still uses the medium size that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nasal masks and nasal pillows. I&#x27;ve used a Swift FX for years. The problem with the Swift FX was twofold: 1) the amount of exhaust from the mask, and 2) a slight whistling from the swivel/elbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Airfit P10 resolves both of those problems for me. I&#x27;m simply amazed as I know that air must be leaving the mask, but it&#x27;s so well diffused that I find it to be nearly silent. There&#x27;s no annoying swivel to whistle. It&#x27;s lightweight. The strap is not as adjustable as the Swift FX was, but it works every bit as well. This is a good example of superiority through simplicity.</li>
            <li> Excellent, better than former models...</li>
            <li> Oh Airfit, where have you been all my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost 13 years of struggling with my nasal mask, dealing with broken gel cushions, stretched out head gear that I have to put under my hair and constantly adjust, leaking air from the mask, sometimes right into my eyes, red lines all over my face, constant adjusting at night, loud noise and just an all over pain in the ***, this product is heaven sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to find my old gel masks on ebay for around 20 bucks, but those days are long gone.  I&#x27;ve been spending around $150 to replace them.  The gel cushion split open exposing that sticky blue gel so I was getting ready to drop another $150 and realized there must be a better mask out there by now.  After an extensive Amazon search and a some more internet research on this product, like would it be compatible with my Respironics machine, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in a week (earlier than estimated) and I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it all these years!  It comes with small, medium and large nasal pillows.  The medium were already attached so I started using it that way.  I think I need small though, but I haven&#x27;t changed it out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on downstairs when I opened the box and realized how much easier it is to do other things while it&#x27;s on.  I can see the tv, I can breathe and talk.  At first I was concerned about the short hose but then I realized it connects to the main tube that&#x27;s connected to the machine so I actually had more length than the old mask.  This one doesn&#x27;t swivel but it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headgear is very light and just slips over my head, no need to do the hair ritual every night.  I read that if you keep each strap together behind your head, that is the tightest setting.  It doesn&#x27;t feel tight, but it stays in place all night and keeps the mask under my nose.  There may be some minimal adjusting to ensure each pillow is firmly in each nostril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quieter and I sleepbetter.  I no longer wake up with red marks all over my face, or dried out eyes because of the vents that used to be in the plastic part that covered my entire nose before I ordered this gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s much less intrusive and it helps me feel just a little bit more normal at bedtime :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did pay $84 for it, and I see now that it&#x27;s only $66!</li>
            <li> What a difference ! The nasal pad is so soft, fits just right. Great improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice. very comfortable and light-weight.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the old ResMed Mirage II I was using.  Pillows and tubing _do not leak_.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I took a chance when I purchased this mask. I initially had a mask that covered my entire nose but it had trouble sealing around my moustache. I decided to try this smaller mask and am very glad I did. I barely feel it in place. I decided to purchase the the set that came with a small, medium and large pillow. I found the medium size worked great for me and after only a day or two i hardly noticed it on. The head gear that comes with this mask is so much easier to wear and I don&#x27;t feel it if I roll over. I definitely would recommend this to anyone thinking about going with the nose pillow design.</li>
            <li> Honesty this is the most comfortable and easy mask to use. Snug fit that does not let air out like my other masks have when I did sleep.</li>
            <li> Feels so light like a little headband. Fits on nose very well. Three size nose pillows. Excellent design.</li>
            <li> Best i have ever worn  Comfee and so easy to use</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Husband loves this.  I ordered this, not knowing how it would work for him, since his original was not comfortable.  He loves this one.  Thanx!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 months now.... works and feels great!</li>
            <li> Could not get use to wearing it.  And the hose gets in the way.  The head straps are too flimsy I&#x27;m sure won&#x27;t last.  I used the large nasal pillow still it did not fit very well.  Total waste of money.  Wish we could try these things before we plunk down $80.</li>
            <li> This mask is ten times more effective and comfortable than the mask that originally came with my resmed system.</li>
            <li> Had tried other nose pieces before but they were uncomfortable and came off of my head very easily.  This head gear is lite it hasn&#x27;t come off my head and the nose piece is very comfortable.  Will continue to buy and recommend until I find something that&#x27;s better, although I don&#x27;t think that will happen soon.</li>
            <li> Makes me sneeze and congested. Wanted as alternative to full-face, which makes my face red, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for several months now.  I really like it!  It is very light and you hardly know that you have it on.  It has no noticeable exhaust port so you don&#x27;t have to worry about blowing cold air on your husband or wife.  All and all I would rate this as the best mask that I have used so far.  If you like a nasal mask I am quite sure you will like this one!</li>
            <li> Wonderful apparatus - much better than the full face mask.  Sleeping wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Best Pap mask I used in the past 10 years.  Very light weight and no air leaks.</li>
            <li> Mask and headgear is very comfortable. We&#x27;ll see how it works over time, but it is by far the lightest and least cumbersome mask I&#x27;ve tried. Seller was extremely helpful in transaction.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, and lighter than others</li>
            <li> I started with the nasal mask and could never get comfortable - this was a much needed change and I&#x27;m getting a great night sleep</li>
            <li> This is the mask my son uses and loves, so I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, the medium sized nasal pillows were too large, and the small ones felt like they weren&#x27;t providing enough air flow; inhaling felt like work. I had my husband try it with the large pillows. He felt the straps were too tight on his head. He is 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; tall and I am 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; just for a frame of reference. I think my son is 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; or so. My mask of preference at this time is the Tap Pap, and number two is the Breeze.</li>
            <li> The Airfit P10 is very light and relatively comfortable.  Its by far the best one I&#x27;ve used to date and this is my 3rd or 4th different CPAP mask.</li>
            <li> Mask fits perfectly.  Light weight and creates a nice seal.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Arrived quickly. Almost silent performance and extremely comfortable. So much better than the swift. Very happy :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real sleep apnea patient and this is not a shill review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered for 11 years with awkward fitting CPAP masks, air leakage, soars on my nose, pinched lips and marks on my cheeks, etc. etc. etc.  I&#x27;ve also tried other nostril pillow apparatus which did nothing but make more pain and problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now discovered the ResMed Airfit P10, and it is amazing.  I&#x27;ve had my first solid night of sleep without any pain or discomfort.  The P10 is extremely light and I actually forgot that I had it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t exclaim it enough!  If you have been punishing yourself with other masks, stop now and order the P10 via Amazon.  They have the best price.  You will be happy.</li>
            <li> light weight and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed.  The head straps stretch effortlessly to contour the head and keep it in place most of the night.  Nose pillows come in three sizes to assure a comfort fit.  This thing is very quiet that will make you wonder if your CPAP is even on.</li>
            <li> Over this last year I have tried 16 different masks. The Airfit p10 is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt; Pros-  comfortable, compact, does not sit on lip, quiet, low air exhaust-( which makes my spouse happy he&#x27;s not getting air blown in his face)&lt;br /&gt;Cons- head strap not adjustable sonic early falls down causing the seal to break. I clamped it with a rubber band to keep it from falling</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  I started out with a Wisp and switched to this one after a few months.  It fits great and allows freedom of movement.  The exhaust vents allow air to escape with no annoying whistle sound like I had with the Wisp.  My only minor issue is the &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; on the hose.  It is stiff even after several weeks of daily use which results in tangles on occasion.  It is easy to disassemble and clean and the headband returns to shape after washing in warm soapy water.</li>
            <li> Best mask ever. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> My complaint is not with the mask but with the seller. Printed on the side of the blue material, in black it says in caps, &amp;#34;NOT FOR SALE SLEEP CENTER MASK&#x27;. I just re-checked and see no mention of this in the Amazon product description. I suppose that&#x27;s why the price is so slow, but I find the nondisclosure very shabby or worse if it&#x27;s violating an agreement with the manufacturer. The mask itself is fine  as others described it but unless they tell me this is a mistake, I would not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very comfortable. If you are struggling with a complicated nose mask definitely worth the money. Such lightweight that you can even sleep on your side without any inconviency.</li>
            <li> no good. the deliver package was miss part. fragile connection.</li>
            <li> Super Cpap mask!! Light and stays on my head with less straps</li>
            <li> Very hard to get positioned correctly.  Hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> fits great, barely know it&#x27;s even there.</li>
            <li> Very noisy when I breathe out.</li>
            <li> Works perfect with my  ResMed S9 VPAP Auto. If you can sleep with your mouth closed like I do, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you have humidifier and climateLine to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best mask I&#x27;ve used so far (out of a total of two), but it has one major flaw. The headgear stretches after a few weeks and becomes too loose, so that the nasal pillows begin to leak. Please fix this, Resmed!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and quiet. I love it.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to those nasty red marks on the bridge of your nose.  This CPAP mask is quiet because of the mesh to allow air escape when you exhale, however the mesh does not allow as large a volume of air to escape as other masks, so you need to get used to it.  It seems to be working okay for me.  It comes with three different sized &amp;#34;pillows&amp;#34;.  You select the size you think is correct for you, and snap it into the mask.  It comes with simple instructions.</li>
            <li> Dump the mask!!!! These air pillows are incredible. I started with small, not enough air flow, so stepped up to medium and it was perfect. The ONLY complaint I have is the headgear slips off the holder. So what I did was simply staple right through the sleeve and plastic frame after I got it set to my perfect size (a little loose is ok); snug is perfect, it&#x27;s going to stretch. Staple from the inside to the outside so that the bent over staples don&#x27;t dig into your skin. I haven&#x27;t even had to tape over the staples put in right. Never any irrigation from the staples. I sleep through the night and even up to 10 am sometimes these are so comfortable and unobtrusive. Get one, you&#x27;ll never go back to the mask.</li>
            <li> Simply the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These straps are not adjustable....Leaks often.</li>
            <li> My favorite, since I have issues with my mouth being covered. That phobia led me to these pillows. The other big positives for me are that these pillows are much more comfortable than masks and these work better by far for me. I&#x27;ve suffered from chronic allergy and rhinitis issues for over fifty years and was not sure if I could use these. With some patience for a just a few nights, these are great!</li>
            <li> No issues so far...I&#x27;d buy another one if and when this one fails...Very comfortable compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried...Would recommend seller and product to a friend</li>
            <li> I changed from a nasal mask to this and has helped me sleep longer and have a good night&#x27;s rest. The mask is very silent and light weight. The straps help adjust the tightening of the nasal insert. No leaks at all.</li>
            <li> Good purchase. Will be going back to this supplier.&lt;br /&gt;It is what I expected.  Fits easily,  reduced noise.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery to Australia, well within stated timeframe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for over a month now, and it is the most comfortable and quiet mask I have ever used. I no longer wake up with indentations in my face. ( Before it looked like I had slept with a bridle on my head). It fits so comfortably, stays in place and maintain an excellent seal all night long.</li>
            <li> I have a Fisher &amp; Paykel Opus nasal pillow that I&#x27;ve used for well over a year and have found it to be pretty good.  However, compared to the Airfit, the Opus is huge.  I took a flyer on the Airfit and found it to be OK.  After a week, though, I was back to the Opus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big problem with the Airfit (IMHO) is the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; strap that really doesn&#x27;t do the job.  It was uncomfortably tight on me and even after a week it hadn&#x27;t stretched, or at least not enough to make it comfortable.  How much could it possibly cost to make the strap adjustable with hook &amp; loop?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I highly recommend the Opus for side sleepers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the head gear. It&#x27;s made of an elastic fabric that gets stretched out of shape so that the mask doesn&#x27;t fit properly. There are no mechanisms for adjusting it. I used needle and thread to snug it up a bit, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what they intend.</li>
            <li> Very good product, had mine for a month and works great. Just need to be able to buy nose fitting for just your size and not all.   First time using a CPAP and this mask worked without flaw</li>
            <li> For me, I like it better than the face cup mask. Sleeping is much more natural, and the bridge of my nose doesn&#x27;t get sore. Putting it on upside down is a 50% possibility every time, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> A great replacement for my older version.  A bit tight at first in comparison, but got used to it quickly. (I have a large head)</li>
            <li> Item works great. Fits better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This mask is the lightest, quietest and most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever used.  My wife is no longer disturbed by the jet of air from the exhale exhaust of my former mask.  The Airfit P10 rates 5 stars in my view.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Excellent distributor.  Product arrived in perfect packaging condition.  Perfect everything.</li>
            <li> Still testing it. Feels quite comfortable</li>
            <li> Easier to sleep with just the one main strap and if I roll over it is comfortable. I am a teeth clencher so I did not need to worry about a more full mask.</li>
            <li> I like the mask and it is very quiet and so far, the most comfortable CPAP mask I have worn.  With that said, the mask that was sent to me was labeled for sleep lab use only, not for sale, so that is a little bit of a disappointment (has more to do with the seller than the product though).  I personally like that there is no adjustment on the elastic strap.  I think that it is very comfortable and seems to keep the nose pillows snug, without being too tight.  I had found that my previous masks with the velcro adjustments seemed to pick up lint from my pillow and eventually become less effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this mask for more than 2 months now and this is the quietest and most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve worn bar none. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, but it&#x27;s not for everyone.  It is the quietest, lightest cpap mask I&#x27;ve ever used..  The permanent elastic straps, with no adjustment, weren&#x27;t as issue for me, but I can see how they could be for others.  There isn&#x27;t a pivoting connector at the mask, so sometimes the hose gets kinked and can pull the mask, causing an air leak.  As others have noted, it is not labeled for retail.  Keeping those issues in mind, it&#x27;s worth the price, even if insurance won&#x27;t reimburse you.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for the CPAP mask.  You hardly know you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is my third CPAP mask, and the best yet.  Very comfortable, and very stable.  If you&#x27;re a side sleeper like I am, this is a very good choice.</li>
            <li> Works really good. Quieter than other &#x27;air pillow&#x27; designs and fit to head is improved. Will buy again. Very satisfied. Good delivery time. 100%</li>
            <li> Very light.  Fits well.</li>
            <li> Very simple design but works really well without any leaks from day one.  This is my new favorite mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of masks over the last 10 years and this is by far my favorite. So much so, I&#x27;ve bought 3 just in case the discontinue it. Compared to the others, it&#x27;s almost like not having anything on. No worry of how you lay, air doesn&#x27;t leak. If it does, all you have to do is adjust it by pulling it our your nostril and sticking it pack in. I LOVE THIS MASK</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, much better than a mask.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Very pleased with the item, packed well.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. It is a HUGE improvement over past masks. I can now sleep through the night without the mask waking me up. My old mask, which was also a ResMed, tended to move around and fall off as the velcro strap came undone, which woke me up. I am a side and back sleeper, and this thing is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask.  I switched to nasal pillows a couple of years ago, and while a great improvement over a nasal mask, I still had trouble keeping a good seal despite trying different size pillows.  I even damaged the skin on my nose a couple of times.  This mask is small, light, quiet, and seals beautifully with practically no pressure, possibly due to the two layer design of the nasal pads.  Overflow air is directed in such a way that you don&#x27;t feel it on your face or hear it.  The headstrap is only slightly adjustable by changing the distance between the split straps behind your head, and of course the elasticity of the strap, and at first it bothered me because it didn&#x27;t feel secure enough. In fact, for the first week I kept pulling the mask away and checking for airflow to make sure it was on!  While it takes a little careful arrangement, it even allows me to sleep on my stomach,  my preferred position but something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.</li>
            <li> This mask works great. I wish I had it 10 years ago. Stays on your head and in place. I have tried several masks over the years.&lt;br /&gt;Best one yet.</li>
            <li> I love this item. I think this item is way better than the product nose pillow and setup originally provided with my CPAP. I would definitely recommend this and use this over and over.</li>
            <li> Best mask I have used thus far!  It did make marks on my face, but they all have.  I wrapped the straps with microfiber cloth and taped it with satin tape so now it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 CPAP masks and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used. I really enjoy burrowing my head into the pillows, which with other masks has created an annoying sound hitting the pillow. This mask is not only WAY more comfortable but for some reason doesn&#x27;t create that annoying sound. Definitely sticking with this mask for the next couple of years.</li>
            <li> Bought from Cpap Deals and tried this product as an alternative to the Resmed head mask after reading the great reviews ..turns out that it was close to causing serious complications for me. It felt comfortable at the start but during the night it caused my nostrils to blow up like a balloon, very painful and the air pressure seemed to increase causing me to be out of breadth. I had to remove during the night and revert to my old mask.  Dealer refused to give me a refund as package was opened...only resolution was to exchange for another product.  Buyer beware. .</li>
            <li> Mask is very quiet and works good.  The headgear stated not for resale but the seller explained and we then had no issues. Seller is good and responds quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Very comfortable and can sleep better. Seller took great care in shipping and I received it earlier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, fits snugly without leaving a crease on my face.  It does a good job and is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not adjustable for starters. Bad if you have any sinus issues. I think it&#x27;s very comfortable and feels like you don&#x27;t have anything on your face. Comes with small medium and large nose pillows so you can really get a good fit. Overall it is a great product and I would recommend buying this as long as you don&#x27;t have any sinus issue at all, or just have a full face mask for allergy season</li>
            <li> I have several different masks and this style is by far the best I have used.  I was exclusively using the earlier generation Swift FX, but this is much more comfortable.  You also cannot beat the price!  Excellent purchase</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I will continue to use it. There is no mark on my face in the morning. It is very soft on my nose and cheeks. There is nothing blocking my view so I can read before falling asleep. It does not shift during the night.</li>
            <li> love the price.  product same as purchased for over $200.00 at medical supply store.</li>
            <li> I have used several &amp;#34;nose pad&amp;#34; style masks, and this one is by far the best. Most have complex strap systems that don&#x27;t work well, and I usually wake up in the middle of the night and it is leaking and not giving good air flow. This is the simplest design I have had yet and works the best. Stays were I put it and is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t get those noisy leak spots or angles. Good enough for me to write a review!</li>
            <li> Great upgrade - nice and small format.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a CPAP for 7 years and this is the most comfortable mask that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer nasal pillow masks because they are not as noisy or confining as a nose/mouth mask.&lt;br /&gt;The attached hose is very flexible, but does not crush easily. I usually change positions during the night and the Airfit P10 stays in place and does not get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the Airfit P10.  I&#x27;m new to the world of cpap and started with a Philiips Nuance nasal mask which squashed my nose, ears and left marks on my face. There were also three Velcro straps that kept coming loose. I had resigned myself to living with discomfort until I tried the P10. It is so light and easy to use, I almost forget I am wearing it. Love, love, love. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service, especially as we are in Australia!&lt;br /&gt;The product was perfect, new and without any issues - Thank You!!</li>
            <li> Nice but did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a full face mask.</li>
            <li> One of the problems I had with my old CPAP full-face mask is that it would leak air around the silicone seal.  Depending on how I slept at night, my face may shift my old mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard a lot of good things about the new nasal masks, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better!  The AirFit P10 is so small and lightweight.  This is much better than my old Resmed Mirage mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first try, I decided to use the MEDIUM nasal pillow.  While at first it seemed to be fine - after a while it did feel uncomfortable and sore.  Then I tried the LARGE nasal pillow.  Much better!  So it is important that you use the size that gives you the most comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it is not perfect.  After removing the AirFit P10 nasal mask in the morning, I do have a bit of soreness on my nostril area - but it is not that bad.  This is a great improvement over my full face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other not-so-good thing about this mask is if you open your mouth with this nasal mask while your CPAP is running, you will blow air out your mouth, make a horrible alien-like snoring sound, and you may frighten your partner!  It doesn&#x27;t help that I look like a cyborg elephant wearing this nasal mask.  But alas, I will never win any beauty pageants with this thing.  Somehow, I miss the Darth Vader-like breathing sound from my old full face mask...  *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jokes aside - overall, I am very pleased.  ;-)</li>
            <li> quick and works great for a great price compared to the normal dr office equipment</li>
            <li> Great product and prompted delivery !!</li>
            <li> fast service and item as described</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and quiet mask I have ever used. It is so lightweight it is as close to wearing nothing at all as possible. It did take a couple of nights to get used to it even for this experienced wearer. That came from the fact it has very tiny side vents on the nasal pillow. The smaller holes, there&#x27;s a lot of them, are the reason for the quiet use and I had to get used to a little more forceful exhale. The typical feeling you are fighting it a little like it was making use of every bit of pressure it can. After a few nights of use I was acclimated and it&#x27;s great. Best of all, you can snuggle up to the person next to you without them getting a jet of air on their neck. Again, thanks to those tiny silent vents. I am tempted to get a second one just to guard against future unavailability.</li>
            <li> Works great at first..  After time it does not seem to work as good as far as getting a good seal is concerned on my nose.  I think the strap stretches over a little time and it makes the mask too loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, it was awesome.  You can barely feel that the mask is there.  I love the that is comes with 3 different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side to this mask there is no adjustment for the strap.  If it had an adjustment I would be able to compensate for the strap stretching a bit.</li>
            <li> i get better sleep with this new mask then i do with the old one ive used for over 4 years, little tricky with side sleeping still working out the kinks. Ive only had it for a week and i use a fitbit to track sleeping any my restlessness has improved from 80% to average 97% but im worried the straps are getting stretched or wont last as long as my old mask. Ill check in after some time.... felt it was important to share since use Sleep Aps seem to always be searching for that perfect mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
            <li> product description and installation instructions clear &amp; accurate. Strong grip.</li>
            <li> The mask itself is nice, i love the quiet vent.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the headgear is terrible. I wake up several times each night becuase the headgear bands have moved and the mask has slipped out of position.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the headgear stretches and gets looser over time and there is no way to adjust it.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t blow exhaust air out the front like the SwiftFx I had before.  (I can&#x27;t actually find where it exhausts.)  I&#x27;ve only had it a few months.  The headstrap is elastic.  As long as it all keeps tension . . . I&#x27;ll prefer this over the SwiftFx (which was the best thing I&#x27;d found so far.)</li>
