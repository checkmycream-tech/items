            <li>I bought this for someone else and when I asked what perfume they were wearing because it smelled so good</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about this product and brand.</li>
            <li>but it smells good and works really good.</li>
            <li>see all of these good reviews about this product, and I wonder why it did not work that well for me.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good heat product i would recommend trying Garrnier or Herbal Essence; those two work way better.</li>
            <li>I love hair products that smell so good that I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair.</li>
            <li>3 stars because it does smell nice and It can be used as a lightweight hairspray.</li>
            <li>smells nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and that&#x27;s mostly what I use it for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheaper and more effective heat protection products.</li>
            <li>I love all the products in this line.</li>
            <li>This spray keeps my hair  legitimately healthy and protected.</li>
            <li>If anything this might be my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li>Again, it smells a lot like most hairsprays you buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just stating my opinion. :)</li>
            <li>but there are better ones out there</li>
            <li>I also love that this brand is sulfate free</li>
            <li>Smells strongly of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased Not Your Mothers Beat The Heat Thermal Shield Spray, I thought it would be a nice, reliable heat protect-er for my hair.</li>
            <li>Most of them are great (like the dry shampoo).</li>
            <li>i loved it,the spray was very light on my hair when i applied it before my flat iron routine</li>
            <li>one isn&#x27;t very good compared to other heat shields I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I experienced what most of the unhappy customers experienced.</li>
            <li>it didnt leave my hair stiff nor crunchy and my hands were not sticky like other products do, this is a great protectant with a great smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is significantly more dry and breaks far more easily when I use this product as opposed to when I do not use any heat protectant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy hair, so I&#x27;m constantly using my straightener.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel especially great to the touch but offers some serious staying power.</li>
            <li>that they had just straightened their hair  using this spray first.</li>
            <li>The spray smells like a cocktail at first</li>
            <li>I love this heat protector and use it before I blowdry or flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have healthy looking hair, but with this product my hair feels and looks like straw after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>Personally, this product was a huge bust for me</li>
            <li>I found this at Wal-mart and decided to try it because of the reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>Used once won&#x27;t use it ever again, and certainly don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, and let me say this if it helps, my hair is very soft, shiny and \\&quot;good\\&quot; and this makes the ends look</li>
            <li>but I can assure you I will not be purchasing THIS particular product again.</li>
            <li>but it does make your hair kind of hard and sticky</li>
            <li>My hair looked nice and I thought I should buy a similar product due to my use of a hair dryer, flat iron, and/or curling iron.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel very crunchy and straw-like and also has kind of a weird smell.</li>
            <li>far as the smell goes, it&#x27;s in-your-face fruity for about twenty minutes before fading.</li>
            <li>It only made mine sticky when I sprayed too much and the stickiness disappeared once I ran my straightener through it.</li>
            <li>I think I am going to try a different one, even though I&#x27;m only halfway through my bottle because I just really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>I took a big leap using this after realizing that you spray it on dry hair BEFORE flat ironing..knowing full well</li>
            <li>But this one Ruins my hair; first of all it smells downright gross, second of all it makes your hair very hard,crispy almost.</li>
            <li>I just know I wasted money I could have used on a product that&#x27;s worth the a salon price tag.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as some $20 sprays but for the price ill take it!</li>
            <li>but if your looking for heat protectant with a thinner consistency that doesn&#x27;t feel so hairsprayish or thick you should look into more expensive sprays like Chi or John Freida, worth the $$$ price!</li>
            <li>I sprayed it in my hair, and the first thing I noticed was it made my hair stiff, which was one thing I did not like.</li>

            <li> protects the hair from the heat when using a flat iron/blowdryer.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected at all, when I put it on to blow dry my hair it makes my hair stiff, looks toasted, for real like if I put spray on it before styling it!</li>
            <li> I typically wear my hair in waves or soft curls but this product causes my curls to lump up and not move.  </li>
            <li> I agree that it makes your hair stiff (though I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; That would probably depend on the amount used.)</li>
            <li> No other product I&#x27;ve EVER used made my hair feel so damaged and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the fact that it does the exact opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to, it tangled my hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a hairspray, and makes straightening and curling hair almost impossible if used before styling hair.</li>
            <li> I have seen Not Your Mothers products popping up in a lot of stores recently and after running out of my previous heat protectant I opted to give this brand a shot.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it and think it&#x27;s a lousy heat protectant, you could get your money&#x27;s worth using it as a medium-hold hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have no idea what the other Not Your Mothers products are like</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviewers I found this spray to.</li>
            <li> But one other thing I did not like, was that the smell of the heat and the spray smelled like burning fruit.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said it made their hair sticky.</li>
            <li> After using my hair became dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does what it&#x27;s meant to do!</li>
            <li> , it gets to stiff</li>
            <li> So I continued straightening my hair, and it was still really stiff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives your hair a very weird texture, kind of like hairspray but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down, which is always an issue for me because my hair is thin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard even to comb it.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not believe it protected my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> i just recieved this product today, when i recieved it i opened it to get the scent first because i hate bad smelling products in my hair</li>
            <li> but after it sits for a while it doesn&#x27;t smell to bad..</li>
            <li> It does not smell that bad in bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was horrific.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I love all the products in this line. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this heat protector and use it before I blowdry or flat iron my hair.  It protects from heat and helps hold the style + it smells great. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I agree that it makes your hair stiff (though I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; That would probably depend on the amount used.) It doesn&#x27;t feel especially great to the touch but offers some serious staying power. If you buy it and think it&#x27;s a lousy heat protectant, you could get your money&#x27;s worth using it as a medium-hold hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell goes, it&#x27;s in-your-face fruity for about twenty minutes before fading.

            <li> This product is not what I expected at all, when I put it on to blow dry my hair it makes my hair stiff, looks toasted, for real like if I put spray on it before styling it! Used once won&#x27;t use it ever again, and certainly don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, and let me say this if it helps, my hair is very soft, shiny and \\&quot;good\\&quot; and this makes the ends look&lt;br /&gt;damaged, it gets to stiff it&#x27;s hard even to comb it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of products by this brand for an obvious reason: the price. Most of them are great (like the dry shampoo). But i did not like this one. I straighten or curl my hair on a day to day basis so Heat product is necessary. But this one Ruins my hair; first of all it smells downright gross, second of all it makes your hair very hard,crispy almost. I am not satisfied with this product at all. If you are looking for a good heat product i would recommend trying Garrnier or Herbal Essence; those two work way better.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy hair, so I&#x27;m constantly using my straightener. This spray keeps my hair  legitimately healthy and protected. It does not weigh my hair down, which is always an issue for me because my hair is thin. I also love that this brand is sulfate free</li>
            <li> I love hair products that smell so good that I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair. I bought this for someone else and when I asked what perfume they were wearing because it smelled so good they said no perfume but that they had just straightened their hair  using this spray first. Now I&#x27;m using it for myself. Great!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of Not Your Mothers hair products to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;This one isn&#x27;t very good compared to other heat shields I&#x27;ve used. The smell is nice and that&#x27;s mostly what I use it for now!&lt;br /&gt;It gives your hair a very weird texture, kind of like hairspray but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviews comparing this to hairspray. It makes your hair feel very crunchy and straw-like and also has kind of a weird smell. I think I am going to try a different one, even though I&#x27;m only halfway through my bottle because I just really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Probably the best heat protectant spray you can get for that cheap of a price! I personally don&#x27;t like the smell of it and if u don&#x27;t comb or brush it through your hair before you use it it will make your hair stiff/sticky like hairspray. Other than that it does what it&#x27;s meant to do! For the price it&#x27;s a good product but if your looking for heat protectant with a thinner consistency that doesn&#x27;t feel so hairsprayish or thick you should look into more expensive sprays like Chi or John Freida, worth the $$$ price!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used a heat shield product but it had a salon price tag that accompanied it. My hair looked nice and I thought I should buy a similar product due to my use of a hair dryer, flat iron, and/or curling iron. I found this at Wal-mart and decided to try it because of the reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a couple times. I have healthy looking hair, but with this product my hair feels and looks like straw after I blow dry it. No other product I&#x27;ve EVER used made my hair feel so damaged and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the fact that it does the exact opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to, it tangled my hair like crazy. I had to stop blow drying about 5 times just to brush through the tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my experience, your&#x27;s could be different. I just know I wasted money I could have used on a product that&#x27;s worth the a salon price tag.</li>
            <li> This is not a heat protection spray. This product is more of a hairspray, and makes straightening and curling hair almost impossible if used before styling hair. 3 stars because it does smell nice and It can be used as a lightweight hairspray. I&#x27;ve used cheaper and more effective heat protection products. If anything this might be my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about this product and brand. But I wish I read the reviews before purchasing.. I experienced what most of the unhappy customers experienced. After using my hair became dry and stiff. I took a big leap using this after realizing that you spray it on dry hair BEFORE flat ironing..knowing full well what ironing wet/damp hair does to your hair. The spray smells like a cocktail at first but after it sits for a while it doesn&#x27;t smell to bad..I&#x27;ll keep it for a hairspray but I am NEVER using it as a heat protectant again...</li>
            <li> I have seen Not Your Mothers products popping up in a lot of stores recently and after running out of my previous heat protectant I opted to give this brand a shot.  Personally, this product was a huge bust for me and I&#x27;ll explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This product makes my hair stiff/sticky.  I typically wear my hair in waves or soft curls but this product causes my curls to lump up and not move.  It seems as if they meant to label it \\&quot;Hairspray\\&quot; and not \\&quot;Heat Protectant\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Smells strongly of alcohol.  Again, it smells a lot like most hairsprays you buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I honestly do not believe it protected my hair at all.  My hair is significantly more dry and breaks far more easily when I use this product as opposed to when I do not use any heat protectant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the other Not Your Mothers products are like but I can assure you I will not be purchasing THIS particular product again.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviewers I found this spray to. Work very well. It did not leave my hair crunchy at all. It protected my hair from any heat a threw at it and smells FANTASTIC!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a goo help from heat but it does make your hair kind of hard and sticky but it smells good and works really good.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased Not Your Mothers Beat The Heat Thermal Shield Spray, I thought it would be a nice, reliable heat protect-er for my hair. I smelled it while in the bottle. It has a alcohol/fruit smell. It does not smell that bad in bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got home. I sprayed it in my hair, and the first thing I noticed was it made my hair stiff, which was one thing I did not like. So I continued straightening my hair, and it was still really stiff. But one other thing I did not like, was that the smell of the heat and the spray smelled like burning fruit. It was horrific. I would not recommend this product to anyone. But that is just my matter of opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see all of these good reviews about this product, and I wonder why it did not work that well for me. Then again, all products work different on everyone. So yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am definitely not trying to bash the product. Just stating my opinion. :)</li>
            <li> My granddaughter wanted this for C-mas.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Protects my hair from the heat and has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> i just recieved this product today, when i recieved it i opened it to get the scent first because i hate bad smelling products in my hair, this was so fruity scented i loved it,the spray was very light on my hair when i applied it before my flat iron routine it didnt leave my hair stiff nor crunchy and my hands were not sticky like other products do, this is a great protectant with a great smell. i recommend it totally</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff out there!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this spray. It isn&#x27;t as good as some $20 sprays but for the price ill take it! It smells like raspberries to me. Other reviews said it made their hair sticky. It only made mine sticky when I sprayed too much and the stickiness disappeared once I ran my straightener through it. If you are looking for an inexpensive heat protector I&#x27;d recommend this but there are better ones out there but they are more expensive.</li>
            <li> protects the hair from the heat when using a flat iron/blowdryer. smells nice. keeps hair tamed no frizz no fuss. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
