            <li>They need alittle more than shampoo.</li>
            <li>My favorite out all Head and Shoulders products</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this shampoo for many years, and we both love it.  </li>
            <li>it works better than many others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>love the volume in my hair when using this product :)</li>
            <li>is how clean and bouncy my hair looks after using it!</li>
            <li>This really added volume to my hair and did a good job with dandruff control.  </li>
            <li>- it takes care of itchy flaky scalps and adds life to my fine</li>
            <li>We both have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Wash my hair with this so smooth smell</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Extra Volume is far and away the best dandruff shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>hair feels clean and looks clean</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo and I will continue using it, even if as recommended by the specialists, alternating with another simple shampoo.</li>
            <li>being female with flakes just doesn&#x27;t seem fair.</li>
            <li>Nice soft feel after wash...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so loyal to head and shoulder.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smooth but still light and has</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>It suds nicely, but not too much, removed that unwanted residue and added a modest amount of volume.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels like the original stinky dandruff shampoo but smells so great that it&#x27;s hard to believe that it&#x27;s saving my shoulders from dandruff pile ups.  </li>
            <li>My color has a lot of red, which tends to fade quickly, and this product keeps my color fresh-looking through many shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When them white flakes show up this works good-smells good and leaves hair soft</li>
            <li>cant wait to order more in the future!</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair clean, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Even though I do not have dandruff, I find that  using  various volumnizing products for fine hair was leaving residue on my scalp .After</li>
            <li>This shampoo works really well</li>
            <li>dont know that i really cared for this one, i ended up giving the rest of the bottle to my boyfriend to use up.</li>
            <li>Works very well on his dandruff.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice much volume enhancement or dandruff control.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t dry my hair out all and seemed to actually add moisture which I liked.</li>
            <li>trying many more expensive &amp;#34;clairfing&amp;#34; shampoos with  mixed success, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t really like the smell of this particular one, but he did like how soft it made his hair feel compared tot</li>
            <li>I only wish it were available in the larger pump bottle size.</li>
            <li>Where other products have left me pulling out clumps of hair after a shampoo, this one leaves my hair healthy and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it supposed to - controls flakes and gives hair extra volume.</li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s better than a lot of other cheaper shampoos that really dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>Dandruff clearly reduced</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have noticed any extra volume, but I can&#x27;t say I really got it for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair really soft, too.</li>
            <li>some reason, this formula of Head &amp; Shoulders disappeared from most of our local grocery and drugstore shelves a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of dandruff shampoo in general.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it leaves a greasy residue on my scalp, which weighs my roots down more than usual.</li>

            <li> It fights off dandruff, as expected from Head &amp; Shoulders, but it does not provide extra volume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you have itchy scalp or dandruff and have found that other products leave your hair looking dry and dead.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this formula --it didn&#x27;t give me extra volume and even make my hair feel like I hadn&#x27;t rinsed it well enough, although I made sure I did.</li>

            <li> This product is average in quality.</li>
            <li> I found this on a Subscribe and Save deal and after viewing the shoulders of my black shirt decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never experienced such a fiercely stinging sensation from any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does give your hair a little bit of a lift</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have that weird medical smell that other Head and Shoulders products have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more flaky hair.  </li>
            <li> Or is that a falacy of false cause?</li>
            <li> Faintly floral.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is that it leaves your hair feeling as waxy as the cucumbers at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I used to have really really bad dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It feels weird and smells awful.  </li>

            <li> I have noticed more volume in my hair after using this shampoo. It&#x27;s nice when a product does what is claims to do!</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo. This is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my head itchy.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it smells great.  The bad news is that it leaves your hair feeling as waxy as the cucumbers at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works really well - it takes care of itchy flaky scalps and adds life to my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned however, this shampoo will sting your eyes like nobody&#x27;s business. I don&#x27;t know what is in it that does that but I&#x27;ve never experienced such a fiercely stinging sensation from any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Extra Volume is far and away the best dandruff shampoo on the market. The other dandruff shampoos, Head and Shoulders products included, are too rough on the hair and scalp. Where other products have left me pulling out clumps of hair after a shampoo, this one leaves my hair healthy and refreshed. It also doesn&#x27;t have that weird medical smell that other Head and Shoulders products have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this is how clean and bouncy my hair looks after using it! I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with a dandruff shampoo before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a perpetually itchy scalp. I started using this once a week about a year ago and problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly an incredible product. I highly recommend if you have itchy scalp or dandruff and have found that other products leave your hair looking dry and dead.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo and I will continue using it, even if as recommended by the specialists, alternating with another simple shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It does give your hair a little bit of a lift but I wish it smelled better. Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This really added volume to my hair and did a good job with dandruff control.  I have been using it for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Husband loves head and shoulders.  He didn&#x27;t really like the smell of this particular one, but he did like how soft it made his hair feel compared tot he other varieties I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> No more flaky hair.  Well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for over 22 years.  I use it everyday and I love it.  It gives my hair body, smells wonderful (I always get compliments), and I used to have really really bad dandruff.  Since I started using this years ago my &#x27;snow&#x27; days are over.</li>
            <li> Winter....oh how my hair hates you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff fixes winter scalp and gives an extra lift to my hair! My hair is soft and smooth but still light and has volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells nice too</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has created an excellent product for those of us with straight, fine hair.  I only wish it were available in the larger pump bottle size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s head and shoulders, it does what it is supposed to do! Great deal when on sale at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean, smells great and no dandruff.</li>
            <li> being female with flakes just doesn&#x27;t seem fair. I&#x27;ve been using HS for a while  now and it is the #1 solution to winter flaking. Recently bought the volume shampoo and now my hair is bouncy like a pantene commercial.</li>
            <li> Fav Shampoo, great price.</li>
            <li> My boys are pre-teen. They need alittle more than shampoo. My hubby likes it too! This is perfect! Smells good too</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it supposed to - controls flakes and gives hair extra volume. My favorite out all Head and Shoulders products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have noticed any extra volume, but I can&#x27;t say I really got it for that purpose.  I bought this over the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dry Scalp&amp;#34; versions because it was on sale.  The smell is pleasant, but I do not notice a difference in the product or the results it gives my hair.  Good shampoo; nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nice to just subscribe and forget. Also, there is no buildup with this shampoo. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get good results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I get buildup from other products so I thought this would be worth a try. Unfortunately, I must be allergic to one of the ingredients in this as my scalp burned/hurt right after I got out of the shower. I also noticed a ton of flakes I&#x27;ve never had before coating my scalp.    It sounds like a miracle product for most people! I just want to warn those who have skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great!</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders is the go to Shampoo for the men in my household. It leaves the hair clean, soft and manageable. It is also very easy on the budget.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this formula --it didn&#x27;t give me extra volume and even make my hair feel like I hadn&#x27;t rinsed it well enough, although I made sure I did.</li>
            <li> dont know that i really cared for this one, i ended up giving the rest of the bottle to my boyfriend to use up.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this shampoo for many years, and we both love it.  We both have fine hair.  It takes care of the &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; wonderfully well, has a nice scent, and gives you great volume.  The best part, for me, is the nice, soapy cleansing it gives without stripping the color from my hair -- it isn&#x27;t advertised as a &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; shampoo but it works better than many others I&#x27;ve tried.  My color has a lot of red, which tends to fade quickly, and this product keeps my color fresh-looking through many shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, this formula of Head &amp; Shoulders disappeared from most of our local grocery and drugstore shelves a few years ago.  We were happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent  experience.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo my husband will use. Works very well on his dandruff.</li>
            <li> does the job. smells great fora dandruff shampoo. hair feels clean and looks clean</li>
            <li> This product is average in quality. It fights off dandruff, as expected from Head &amp; Shoulders, but it does not provide extra volume. As a matter of fact, it leaves a greasy residue on my scalp, which weighs my roots down more than usual.</li>
            <li> great deal with coupon!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It has a really good smell and lathers well but I didn&#x27;t notice much volume enhancement or dandruff control. My husband used H&amp;S regularly and loves it so I figured I would give this a try. Will continue to use up the bottle but may try something else next. I will say it&#x27;s better than a lot of other cheaper shampoos that really dry out my hair. This didn&#x27;t dry my hair out all and seemed to actually add moisture which I liked.</li>
            <li> Just want to say:  This smells great!!!  I&#x27;m not a fan of dandruff shampoo in general.  It feels weird and smells awful.  I found this on a Subscribe and Save deal and after viewing the shoulders of my black shirt decided to try it.  Faintly floral.  It looks and feels like the original stinky dandruff shampoo but smells so great that it&#x27;s hard to believe that it&#x27;s saving my shoulders from dandruff pile ups.  Great product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shampoo - i use it, but don&#x27;t have dandruff ... oh wait....maybe i don&#x27;t have dandruff because of the product? Or is that a falacy of false cause? who knows.</li>
            <li> When them white flakes show up this works good-smells good and leaves hair soft</li>
            <li> Nice soft feel after wash... Dandruff clearly reduced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so loyal to head and shoulder. I&#x27;ve been using this for 5years</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  It keeps my dandruff at bay without smelling medicinal.  Leaves my hair really soft, too.</li>
            <li> love the volume in my hair when using this product :) cant wait to order more in the future!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to give him any extra volume, but it does work for getting rid of white flakes.  He prefers the Head &amp; Shoulders line to other OTC shampoos, so we&#x27;ll keep this on our radar the next time he needs shampoo.</li>
            <li> Even though I do not have dandruff, I find that  using  various volumnizing products for fine hair was leaving residue on my scalp .After trying many more expensive &amp;#34;clairfing&amp;#34; shampoos with  mixed success, I decided to try this product. It suds nicely, but not too much, removed that unwanted residue and added a modest amount of volume. After a weeks use, I have decided to alternate between my regular volume shampoo and this product. Very pleased to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! One of my daily items that are a must!</li>
            <li> Wash my hair with this so smooth smell so good keeping my hair healthy so I would recommended to anybody it&#x27;s great shampoo</li>
