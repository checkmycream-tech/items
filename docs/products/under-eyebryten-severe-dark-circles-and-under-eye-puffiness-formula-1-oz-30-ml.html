    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But I will continue using this product and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>It says its the best eye cream, but its not.  </li>
            <li>- I think it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it because I paid for it and it will not do any harm but  probably will not order it again unless something wonderful happens after using it for a while.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m extremely happy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 years now and still have great results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely happy about that.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Great product, does it&#x27;s job..</li>
            <li>I think it took a good 2-3 months to start working for me.</li>
            <li>My advice, forget about this stuff and get a good concealer.    </li>
            <li>It goes on great, feels great, wonderful texture and goes on well under makeup, but then so does my other products.</li>
            <li>So far Vita-K is THE BEST product out there.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product on 6/10 and was advised the product will be arrived latest 25th.</li>
            <li>(many of the ones I tried before cost 5 - 10x as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this until the bottle is gone, and then I will update more.    </li>
            <li>this one copies at a fraction of the price)that will work any better.</li>
            <li>It is now that I am on the downside of that hill that it has bothered me more than ever.  </li>
            <li>asked if I was getting more sleep since my under eye circles seemed diminished.  </li>
            <li>and i feel so much better about my appearence.</li>
            <li>I love this product.it does help to reduce under eye swelling .</li>
            <li>Probably 2/3s better.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, and I began to see results within a short time.  </li>
            <li>I used lots of different products, ranging from $10 o $25, before using Eyebryten and this has been the best one.  </li>
            <li>I did not hate the product!!!  </li>
            <li>I use another product for my eyes and this one out weight it the most.</li>
            <li>It works very fast and I am very pleased with the results I have ordered 2 more bottles of it.</li>
            <li>Significantly!  </li>
            <li>I first put on the product, its sorta gets warm and has a very light burn feeling.</li>
            <li>It is chock full of ingredients that are suppose to thicken your skin by increasing collagen levels so eventually the circles may lighten even more.</li>
            <li>This cream is wonderful for removing any dark spots or age spots any where on your body.</li>
            <li>The best one of these products I ever used is Teamine, but it is LUMINESCENT under black lights, which are EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li>After reading mixed reviews, I decided to, but while it works great as a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t remove any puffiness or darkness under the eyes.</li>
            <li>That to me is success and worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>so  a 50% improvement is better than nothing the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I now use just a light, water-based foundation to cover the remaining circles.  </li>
            <li>I notice if I live healthy, it works better.  </li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>Originally a good product; since making this purchase I haven&#x27;t seen the same results yet.  </li>
            <li>Like most products it does absolutely nothing for dark circles, but it is a great moisturizer.    </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for one month and it really does reduced the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>For under $20, this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I also know that the mind is a powerful thing.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully for 3 weeks on the right eye, just to see if there would be a difference.</li>
            <li>I apply morning and night and wear it right under my make up.  </li>
            <li>I lightened my dark circles to a good extent.</li>
            <li>I have been using Eyebryten for about 5 weeks for the dark circle under my eyes and it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am also healthy, so the darkness is not a medical issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used the product exactly as stated on the package for over a month.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have only made my eyes more darker.</li>
            <li>It felt ok, but was not enough moisterizing either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it exactly as directed for over 2 months</li>
            <li>Currently I am off all medications, save one, and the problem is so much better, though it still exists to some extent, but NOT like it was.  </li>
            <li>some light cardio and/or yoga and the puffiness and dark circles around my eyes are more amenable to treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 weeks now, and I have not seen positive results.</li>
            <li>Eye Bryten  may not completely rid me of them but makes them 75% better.  </li>
            <li>good consistency and application but my puffiness and small amouht  of circling did not respond to treatment.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other dark circle eye creams that state \\&quot;amazing results\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted something to help diminish the darkness forming under my eyes with age, and this doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I am beginning to wonder if anything out there with a reasonable price works at all.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.  </li>
            <li>Between these two things, my eye area has always been very dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much hopes for this product</li>
            <li>Concealer goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li>Its doesnt really take away your puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>this product really works and for the price</li>
            <li>ok when i started using this something felt fishy about it then realized its just coco butter in a smaller bottle but for more its a waste of money people</li>
            <li>For anyone with under eye darkness this really works</li>
            <li>Did not work for me that much.  </li>
            <li>It may work very well with routine puffiness.</li>
            <li>It is much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used from the drugstore, and better than the shiseido eye cream I was using religiously for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are much better, I don&#x27;t even use concealer anymore.</li>
            <li>It made me look even older.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I bought this at Winners for only $10 because it doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
            <li>As per my original title, as long as you are not expecting a miracle, you will see some results.   </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Which says something since guys don&#x27;t normally notice this type of thing ...</li>
            <li>now after using it for around 2 weeks, I have to say that the area is completely normal skin tone to the rest of my face</li>
            <li>, now I look normal.    </li>
            <li>More cream is NOT better.    </li>
            <li>I also saw a slight disappearance of the fine lines underneath my lower lashes.      </li>
            <li>Hard to rate when you have more than one variable.  </li>
            <li>When off this medication, if ever, I may even order more, so it is hard to use the &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; rating.</li>
            <li>As far as the burning that some reviewers complain about...</li>
            <li>I think that the burning only occurs when you apply too much cream</li>
            <li>The only thing that really made a difference was TATTOO CONCEALER - the ultra-high pigment concealer that covers up tattoos.  </li>
            <li>Puffiness did go away significantly, maybe just a little, that is all.  </li>
            <li>For the price I think it&#x27;s worth to give a try; since, based on the other reviews, it seems to work for some people and not others.</li>
            <li>It reduced my dark circles by about 30% which is more than any other products I had tried before.</li>
            <li>In any case, let me start by saying that I have had dark circles under my eyes ever since elementary school.  </li>
            <li>I recommend anyone with dark circles give this a try because its worth the price to see if it works for you.    </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t believe so especially after someone last week</li>
            <li>but I will keep using it until the bottle is empty which will probably be a few more months.</li>
            <li>No other eye cream has ever given me visible results before.</li>
            <li>Also, I think it&#x27;s a bit telling and rather amusing that one of the suggested tags for this product is &#x27;useless&#x27;.    </li>
            <li>However, I used it twice the first day and by nightfall, it could of just been me, but my eye area looked to me to be slightly lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Do not expect this product take away dark circles totally, but It reduces the appearance of it about very much.</li>
            <li>However, after a few hours, one of my regular older customers made the statement .. &amp;#34; You must of got a new mattress or something, because it looks like you been sleeping alot better.&amp;#34;  --</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not extremely happy with the results, have purchased another similar product on Amazon last year and received better results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think anything of it at first, but I seemed to be getting a few looks from my regular customers.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with dark under eye circles since high school.  </li>
            <li>If you are serious about improving your dark circles and can spend a few $$$, have a good practitioner use a CO2 laser in your undereye area.</li>

            <li> The improving of my dark circles was an unexpected benefit!</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes does appear more supple, and the dark color mid-eye outward has decreased to an extent.</li>
            <li> but so far I have not found any changes in the dark circles or the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I know they caused the problem, though if I take in too much salt, I get that puffiness, but not like this past year.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark under eye circles and I can&#x27;t say they have changed much; maybe a little.  </li>
            <li> cuz I saw how people were so pleased about  and turns out I just waste my money cuz this thing is no good at all!</li>
            <li> Strange....  </li>
            <li> I spent years and countless dollars on every concealer known to man to cover this problem up.    </li>
            <li> I have not used it long</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem any different from any other eye cream...</li>
            <li> but I have not used it a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottle lasts a very long time, i think i go through one bottle every 6 to 8 months</li>
            <li> dark circles still the same.</li>
            <li> Was I only imagining a lessening of the dark circles because I wanted it to work?  </li>
            <li> However, the dark color mid-eye to inner only lightened slightly, and not satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> and when I wear it, my eyes look younger and the wrinkles seem finer, not sure if its this eye cream alone or the combination of facial creams along with this</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical initially, but this product worked really gr8t for me.</li>
            <li> But, you have to use it for at least six weeks before there is marked improvement.</li>
            <li> I used as directed, morning and eve and after showering, for about a month now, and no real results.</li>
            <li> I have also had dark circles around my eyes for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no improvement in the condition and appearance of my underwear area.  </li>
            <li> I had expected over time for its effectiveness to lessen but it hasn&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ve had dark circle since I was young and they never bothered me until now hitting my late thirties.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from severe dark circles since i was a child This product does not completely get rid of dark circles</li>
            <li> This product produced absolutely NO results in my under-eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think there is any other product out there (except the produt</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s absolutely no change to my dark circles.</li>
            <li> i have tried other products that did not work at all</li>
            <li> I feel the puffiness has receded due to the cessation of the medications ,but your product could have had some input, also.  </li>
            <li> I see very minimal changes</li>
            <li> even as a young girl i always had dark circles, they made me look tired and mean because I have such deep set eyes that were so dark.    </li>
            <li> The puffiness is still there since i also have puffy eyes but the dark circles at 80% gone...</li>
            <li> have &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; set eyes than the average person.</li>
            <li> I had already purchased dark under eye products from $50+</li>
            <li> With my dark circles reduced but not gone, I decided to switch to another product.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cream that has made my dark circles disappear, but it has \\&quot;worked\\&quot; to some extent.</li>
            <li> that cause the dark circles so no matter what the cream is, it may not work for some.</li>
            <li> and I already see improvement of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I was born with genetic dark circles and i caint be seen without makeup.</li>
            <li> I used this for over 2 months and saw no changes in my dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> Dark circles are still there after using the product for almost a month.</li>
            <li> its not oily or heavy like some other eye creams, my only negative experience was when I applied it on my eyelids as well as under my eyes, in the morning</li>
            <li> I still do use concealer, but much less than before.</li>
            <li> i use less makeup</li>
            <li> Manufacturer deserves the black eye.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight brightening of my under eye circles, although not to the point that I could stop wearing concealer during the week.  </li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> I had it done for creases under my eyes, which it helped a little.  </li>
            <li> Now, the dark circles have not magically disappeared...not even by half, but I would say there is a 25-30% reduction for me.  </li>
            <li> I have had very dark circles since I was a child.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> and after a few days, I knew I saw a change.</li>
            <li> everyday and there is still no change at all.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> That seems so harsh.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple...it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes, had then all my life!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has changed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this one!</li>
            <li> Not able to give my review on this product as I still haven&#x27;t received it.     </li>
            <li> Not sure I see results so hoping in a couple weeks</li>
            <li> The bottle seems small</li>
            <li> I concur with other reviewers that there are two types of conditions (genetics and broken blood vessels)</li>
            <li> it was a LITTLE less expensive, but a bottle lasted me a friggin year, so what am I complaining about?</li>
            <li> and I find it hard to believe the reviews that say it does.</li>
            <li> I seriously looked like I had been punched in the face</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than someone giving a review of any product the day after they receive it without living with it for a while.  </li>
            <li> I feel badly that under the first star it says that I hate it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the rest of the product for moisturizing, but I am disappointed in the product&#x27;s other claims.</li>
            <li> I am still in search of a product that adaquately decreases/prevents dark under eye circles :-(</li>
            <li> I tried this product after hearing about the \\&quot;name-branded original\\&quot; and buffing at the expensive price tag (around $70) to \\&quot;try\\&quot; something out.</li>
            <li> I was sad to see that star so enumerated.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad a different terminology isn&#x27;t used, versus, I hate it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any puffiness, the skin is very thin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> However, I came across this product and the price wasn&#x27;t bad, so</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed with this product, Didn&#x27;t work at all!  </li>
            <li> Bad service and unreliable seller!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Originally a good product; since making this purchase I haven&#x27;t seen the same results yet.  Not sure if it has changed.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of use, I think that I can detect a lightening under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried the Under EyeBryten for 4.5 weeks. The skin under my eyes does appear more supple, and the dark color mid-eye outward has decreased to an extent. However, the dark color mid-eye to inner only lightened slightly, and not satisfactorily. (I never had a problem with puffiness around the eye) I am still in search of a product that adaquately decreases/prevents dark under eye circles :-(</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed with this product, Didn&#x27;t work at all!  I ended up throwing it, Would Never buy again!</li>
            <li> Well, I tried it. After reading mixed reviews, I decided to, but while it works great as a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t remove any puffiness or darkness under the eyes. I used as directed, morning and eve and after showering, for about a month now, and no real results. It goes on great, feels great, wonderful texture and goes on well under makeup, but then so does my other products. I really wanted something to help diminish the darkness forming under my eyes with age, and this doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ll use the rest of the product for moisturizing, but I am disappointed in the product&#x27;s other claims. I am beginning to wonder if anything out there with a reasonable price works at all. Does anyone know anything that does?!</li>
            <li> I have had very dark circles since I was a child. I was always embarrassed about the way I looked. I have been using this product for over 2 yrs now and it has been a Godsend. It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of them totally, but enough where I&#x27;m not mortified if I have to leave the house w/o concealer. I still do use concealer, but much less than before. I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t work for some people. Must be luck of the draw. I think it took a good 2-3 months to start working for me. I do wish they sold it in stores though.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple...it did nothing. I have tried many other dark circle eye creams that state \\&quot;amazing results\\&quot;.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on this one!</li>
            <li> This product claims to have Eyeliss.  I see it in the product discription and can see it in the product graphic noted.  I rec&#x27;d mine yesterday and to my surprise, no mention of Eyeliss anywhere on package or on the bottle.  Strange....  I have used this 3 times as directed with NO visible results.  Very dissappointed.  So far Vita-K is THE BEST product out there.  It tightens the skin around your eyes within 30 seconds of application and lasts all day.  My only problem with Vita-K is that after prolonged use, my eye lids twitch!  Not cool.  Stopped using although doc says it is nothing to worry about - just an irritant.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical initially, but this product worked really gr8t for me. I lightened my dark circles to a good extent.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for a month now and still no results...I feel like I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for a couple weeks.  Not extremely happy with the results, have purchased another similar product on Amazon last year and received better results.</li>
            <li> This product produced absolutely NO results in my under-eye dark circles. I used it faithfully for 3 weeks on the right eye, just to see if there would be a difference. In the end both eyes remained the same. No change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used it for 4 to 5 months.  No results, puffiness was not reduced, nothing changed.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best one of these products I ever used is Teamine, but it is LUMINESCENT under black lights, which are EVERYWHERE.  So I quit using it.  this is a close second.  I notice if I live healthy, it works better.  some light cardio and/or yoga and the puffiness and dark circles around my eyes are more amenable to treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was a LITTLE less expensive, but a bottle lasted me a friggin year, so what am I complaining about?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any puffiness, the skin is very thin under my eyes. I have darkness there - this stuff doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I\\&quot;ve had dark circle since I was young and they never bothered me until now hitting my late thirties.  I have to say this product does work.  The puffiness is still there since i also have puffy eyes but the dark circles at 80% gone...quite an improvement.  I would def recommned this product</li>
            <li> I would give it a try. It reduced my dark circles by about 30% which is more than any other products I had tried before. It work reduced puffiness but about 80%. For the price I think it&#x27;s worth to give a try; since, based on the other reviews, it seems to work for some people and not others.</li>
            <li> Like most products it does absolutely nothing for dark circles, but it is a great moisturizer.    If you are serious about improving your dark circles and can spend a few $$$, have a good practitioner use a CO2 laser in your undereye area. I had it done for creases under my eyes, which it helped a little.  The improving of my dark circles was an unexpected benefit!</li>
            <li> good consistency and application but my puffiness and small amouht  of circling did not respond to treatment.</li>
            <li> Not able to give my review on this product as I still haven&#x27;t received it.     Bad service and unreliable seller!!! I purchased this product on 6/10 and was advised the product will be arrived latest 25th. I still haven&#x27;t received the product til now. Neither Amazon nor the seller bothered to reply my email.</li>
            <li> This product works for me! I have very dark circles under my eyes, had then all my life! Eye Bryten  may not completely rid me of them but makes them 75% better.  I have tried others and they do not produce the results that this product does!</li>
            <li> Here is a bit of background: I am a male, 34 and a barber. I am also healthy, so the darkness is not a medical issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; set eyes than the average person. I have also had dark circles around my eyes for as long as I can remember. Between these two things, my eye area has always been very dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several products over the years to correct this, but nothing ever works. However, I came across this product and the price wasn&#x27;t bad, so I figured what the heck (many of the ones I tried before cost 5 - 10x as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put on the product, its sorta gets warm and has a very light burn feeling. However, I used it twice the first day and by nightfall, it could of just been me, but my eye area looked to me to be slightly lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Over the next 6 days or so, I kept using the product twice per day ... and after a few days, I knew I saw a change. Anyway, after the weekend I went to work and opened my shop of tuesday. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it at first, but I seemed to be getting a few looks from my regular customers. However, after a few hours, one of my regular older customers made the statement .. &amp;#34; You must of got a new mattress or something, because it looks like you been sleeping alot better.&amp;#34;  -- Thats when I knew. Since then, several of people have made the same type of complement. Which says something since guys don&#x27;t normally notice this type of thing ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now after using it for around 2 weeks, I have to say that the area is completely normal skin tone to the rest of my face</li>
            <li> Not sure I see results so hoping in a couple weeks, I will.  I have no opinion at this time.</li>
            <li> I used the product exactly as stated on the package for over a month.  There is absolutely no improvement in the condition and appearance of my underwear area.  This product serves no purpose</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now, and I have not seen positive results. It seems to have only made my eyes more darker.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and it doesn&#x27;t seem any different from any other eye cream...dark circles still the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on a clearance bin so I took a chance.  I had already purchased dark under eye products from $50+ and they didnt work so I figured, spending $5 wouldn&#x27;t hurt.  I didn&#x27;t have much hopes for this product but I am truly amazed.  I smoothed it on my darkest eye before bedtime and I immediately saw a difference the next day.  I have been using it for  a couple of weeks already and when I wear it, my eyes look younger and the wrinkles seem finer, not sure if its this eye cream alone or the combination of facial creams along with this but I&#x27;m extremely happy.  My dark circles are much better, I don&#x27;t even use concealer anymore.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: With my dark circles reduced but not gone, I decided to switch to another product. It was a disaster! I have gone back to this product. As per my original title, as long as you are not expecting a miracle, you will see some results.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: After 3 weeks of use, I have seen some improvement. It is not a miracle cream that has made my dark circles disappear, but it has \\&quot;worked\\&quot; to some extent. I will continue to use this until the bottle is gone, and then I will update more.    As far as the burning that some reviewers complain about...I think that the burning only occurs when you apply too much cream and it gets on the lashes and in the eyes. It happened to me once (on the 2nd day I think)and that was the cause. Otherwise, I haven&#x27;t had that problem. More cream is NOT better.    I tried this product after hearing about the \\&quot;name-branded original\\&quot; and buffing at the expensive price tag (around $70) to \\&quot;try\\&quot; something out. I concur with other reviewers that there are two types of conditions (genetics and broken blood vessels) that cause the dark circles so no matter what the cream is, it may not work for some. For under $20, this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one month and it really does reduced the fine lines under my eyes. Concealer goes on much smoother. I have hereditary dark under eye circles and I can&#x27;t say they have changed much; maybe a little.  But I will continue using this product and hope for the best. It is chock full of ingredients that are suppose to thicken your skin by increasing collagen levels so eventually the circles may lighten even more. These things take time and I don&#x27;t think there is any other product out there (except the produt this one copies at a fraction of the price)that will work any better.</li>
            <li> I waited a month or so to give my results and opinion.  Nothing worse than someone giving a review of any product the day after they receive it without living with it for a while.  In any case, let me start by saying that I have had dark circles under my eyes ever since elementary school.  It is now that I am on the downside of that hill that it has bothered me more than ever.  It made me look even older.  Let me also say that I am one of the world&#x27;s biggest skeptics with anything.  Having said all this...it has indeed worked!  Now, the dark circles have not magically disappeared...not even by half, but I would say there is a 25-30% reduction for me.  That to me is success and worthwhile.  I was not expecting miracles. I also know that the mind is a powerful thing.  Was I only imagining a lessening of the dark circles because I wanted it to work?  I really don&#x27;t believe so especially after someone last week asked if I was getting more sleep since my under eye circles seemed diminished.  I see an improvement and will be reordering so I personally give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles under my eyes. It felt ok, but was not enough moisterizing either. I preferred the eye creme by Philosophy and combine that with Vitaville Argan oil. Moroccan and Indian women have been using argan oil for centuries and it&#x27;s prized for its anti-aging and healing properties.</li>
            <li> I see very minimal changes but I have not used it a very long time.  But if I can see results now, I can only imagine what is going to be like in 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Its doesnt really take away your puffy eyes. It says its the best eye cream, but its not.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> Luckily I bought this at Winners for only $10 because it doesn&#x27;t work at all... and I find it hard to believe the reviews that say it does. I&#x27;ve used it exactly as directed for over 2 months and there&#x27;s absolutely no change to my dark circles. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as a moisturizer but will never again spend my money on these products. I was hesitant to believe the hype and was proven correct in my disbelief. My advice, forget about this stuff and get a good concealer.    Also, I think it&#x27;s a bit telling and rather amusing that one of the suggested tags for this product is &#x27;useless&#x27;.    Update...it&#x27;s October now, I&#x27;m still using this *bleep* (rhymes with &#x27;pit&#x27;) everyday and there is still no change at all. Not even the slightest bit. It&#x27;s moisturizer...that&#x27;s all it is. How it ended up with any favourable reviews is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from severe dark circles since i was a child This product does not completely get rid of dark circles but it does   make them alot lighter. you must keep using it or they will return as soon as you stop. i have tried other products that did not work at all so  a 50% improvement is better than nothing the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> this product really works and for the price - I think it&#x27;s a great deal! I have been using twice daily for about a week and I already see improvement of my dark circles. I will continue to use and would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> ok when i started using this something felt fishy about it then realized its just coco butter in a smaller bottle but for more its a waste of money people</li>
            <li> even as a young girl i always had dark circles, they made me look tired and mean because I have such deep set eyes that were so dark.    I spent years and countless dollars on every concealer known to man to cover this problem up.    I have been using this product for 2 years now and still have great results.  It took about 6 weeks initially to see results.  I had expected over time for its effectiveness to lessen but it hasn&#x27;t at all.  I apply morning and night and wear it right under my make up.  I still wear under eye concealer, but don&#x27;t need layers of it.  in fact i sometimes go without make up on the weekends, which I never could have done before.  I seriously looked like I had been punched in the face, now I look normal.    its not oily or heavy like some other eye creams, my only negative experience was when I applied it on my eyelids as well as under my eyes, in the morning the area around my eyes was red and irritated, haven&#x27;t had any problems when following the directions correctly.    I recommend anyone with dark circles give this a try because its worth the price to see if it works for you.    Also, the bottle lasts a very long time, i think i go through one bottle every 6 to 8 months, that&#x27;s like $3/month!</li>
            <li> I can recommend this cream because it works for me.  It definitely improves the appearance of the skin around and over the eyes.  But, you have to use it for at least six weeks before there is marked improvement.</li>
            <li> I was born with genetic dark circles and i caint be seen without makeup. I use this product after my chemical peel and it is a life changer. Don&#x27;t know how it works using it by itself but after having a chemical peel lighten up my circles and topping it off with product changes everything. I stopped wearing eyeliner,concealer,color shadows and blush.everytime my face improves i use less makeup now i wear one layer of powder foundation and soon i won&#x27;t need that either. my selfasteem is raising to the roof and i feel so much better about my appearence.</li>
            <li> using daily and puffiness is decreasing and am using it twice per day after shower and just before bed time</li>
            <li> What a disappointment! What a waste of money. Used it faithfully for about 6 weeks &amp; no noticeable difference. Manufacturer deserves the black eye.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and she said it doesn&#x27;t work-sorry.</li>
            <li> This product always does its job...will buy it over and over again.  For anyone with under eye darkness this really works</li>
            <li> I love this product.it does help to reduce under eye swelling .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Philosophy Hope in a Tube for Eyes/Lips.  When I bought (and later returned in exchange for this generic product) the more expensive name brand eye product, the woman at Macy&#x27;s said I would still need an additional eye cream to moisturize.  I agree that the same is needed for this product, which is why I also use the philosophy.    I did notice a slight brightening of my under eye circles, although not to the point that I could stop wearing concealer during the week.  I also saw a slight disappearance of the fine lines underneath my lower lashes.      I will continue to use this and the Philosophy product.  It is much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used from the drugstore, and better than the shiseido eye cream I was using religiously for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dark under eye circles since high school.  The only thing that really made a difference was TATTOO CONCEALER - the ultra-high pigment concealer that covers up tattoos.  After about a month of using Under Eye Bryten, they&#x27;re fading!  Significantly!  Probably 2/3s better.  I now use just a light, water-based foundation to cover the remaining circles.  I&#x27;m a fan.  No other eye cream has ever given me visible results before.</li>
            <li> Make my &amp;#34;under-eye&amp;#34; area get scaly.  Did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Why people have to lie ? I try this cuz I saw how people were so pleased about  and turns out I just waste my money cuz this thing is no good at all!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to apply this 2x per day and I only apply it in the morning after a shower.  The bottle seems small but it&#x27;s not for the amount needed each use.  Haven&#x27;t had any noticeable change in under-eye coloring but I will keep using it until the bottle is empty which will probably be a few more months.</li>
            <li> I used this for over 2 months and saw no changes in my dark under eye circles.  I know it&#x27;s hereditary and there is probably no cream in the world that can change that so i blame myself for even thinking a cream could work.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and I began to see results within a short time.  The next time I order the product, I will order a larger amount, because 1 oz.  doesn&#x27;t last very long.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long but so far I have not found any changes in the dark circles or the puffiness under my eyes. I have followed the directions as stated on the product. I will continue to use it because I paid for it and it will not do any harm but  probably will not order it again unless something wonderful happens after using it for a while. Ask me again in 30 days.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for removing any dark spots or age spots any where on your body. It works very fast and I am very pleased with the results I have ordered 2 more bottles of it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eyebryten for about 5 weeks for the dark circle under my eyes and it worked pretty good. I used lots of different products, ranging from $10 o $25, before using Eyebryten and this has been the best one.  Do not expect this product take away dark circles totally, but It reduces the appearance of it about very much.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me that much.  Puffiness did go away significantly, maybe just a little, that is all.  Dark circles are still there after using the product for almost a month.</li>
            <li> undecided. will update.</li>
            <li> I did not hate the product!!!  I was sad to see that star so enumerated.  I take various medications and I think , I know they caused the problem, though if I take in too much salt, I get that puffiness, but not like this past year.  Currently I am off all medications, save one, and the problem is so much better, though it still exists to some extent, but NOT like it was.  I feel the puffiness has receded due to the cessation of the medications ,but your product could have had some input, also.  Hard to rate when you have more than one variable.  I used other products, far more expensive, that did nothing. It is too bad a different terminology isn&#x27;t used, versus, I hate it.  That seems so harsh.  I still have the product and even used some today.  I feel badly that under the first star it says that I hate it.  In fact, I don&#x27;t.  When off this medication, if ever, I may even order more, so it is hard to use the &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; rating. It may work very well with routine puffiness.</li>
            <li> I use another product for my eyes and this one out weight it the most. My eyes look lighter and I look much younger. I&#x27;m definitely happy about that. Lol</li>
            <li> Great product, does it&#x27;s job..</li>
    </ol>
