            <li>First, I want to start by saying how impressed I am by how quickly the item shipped to me, I hadn&#x27;t been expecting it for several more days when I saw it in my mailbox.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the container it comes in is so cute!</li>
            <li>Both were easy to make, easy to apply and a breeze to clean up.</li>

            <li>I put it on and my face was so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Nourishing supplement on the face will smooth, tone and moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li>Clea  and smooth.</li>
            <li>makes skin feel so smooth and taut.  </li>
            <li>The area around my nose was oil free and pores were not noticeable.</li>
            <li>so you really have to make your own measurements,</li>
            <li>I enjoy waking up to a sn&#x3D;motth face.</li>
            <li>- I tried first helping before bodywraps supplies has arrived - still made me sweat!!- smooth out skin and a notice of improvement  on celluite - smoothes skin out-</li>
            <li>other than this Sea Weed works great love</li>
            <li>Since this product is organic, kosher amd cruelty free, I trusted trying it, and now I can happily say I have no regrets and would highly recommend it!!!    </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Tha purchase was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the smell was super strong too.</li>
            <li>You definetely will get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try out this product at a promotional discount.</li>
            <li>But overall i really liked the product!</li>
            <li>I am excited to add it to my go-to gift list.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It was fun to have a spa night with my friends!</li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s powderized, you have double the amount since you just use your own water to rejuvenate and make it into the cream!</li>
            <li>so when I first started looking for these types of things, I wasnt sure what to look for.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I didn&#x27;t see any dirt on the cotton balls while toning, which shows just how clean my face</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>After rinsing off, my skin felt refreshed, smoothe and clean.  </li>
            <li>Hopped in the shower after and it rinsed off cleanly.</li>
            <li>I managed it, but wasn&#x27;t sure if the hassle was worth the effort it took to get it right.</li>
            <li>After ten minutes, I washed my face with warm water to reveal super smooth, clean skin!</li>
            <li>I had always heard that Seaweed has a lot of health benefits, and I&#x27;m excited to think I&#x27;m finally doing something that is good for my skin</li>
            <li>At first, she was unsure but she liked the result afterwards so much that she just asked me if we could do it again.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, men loves back treatments</li>
            <li>I left the mask on for a good 30 - 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the spa and leaves me with nice soft skin.</li>
            <li>Having said that, if you mix the mask with warm water (while wearing a clothespin on your nose), mix it into a paste and apply it to your problem areas with cellulite, then cover the mask with plastic wrap and wait 30 minutes; you can see a marked difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>Be aware the smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>After using, my face felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the include a website link for you to refer to for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, the include a website link for you to refer to for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seaweed powder is something that I have been looking for and I am lucky to have gotten a chance to find and receive this.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get a trial from the company</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite positive for future results to be amazing!</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, goes on smooth, and you can see instant results!</li>
            <li>for a long time because it&#x27;s very concentrated thus making it a great value for your dollar.</li>
            <li>It does come in powder form, but it&#x27;s a pretty good size container, so should last awhile!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super easy and you are getting more product for your money with the powder not already being mixed with ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love Seaweed Mask Spa Professional Line!</li>
            <li>First time trying powder seaweed mask !</li>
            <li>Other then that the quality was nice, shipping was quick and the product was presented accurately.</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try it for cheap.</li>
            <li>but I love how soft my skin feels after washing it off.  </li>
            <li>It did well to keep my acne under control and  infuse more moisture in my face ( making it incredibly soft).</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so fresh and looking radiant.</li>
            <li>and that is a rare thing for me</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, it is easily mixed and can be used on your body OR face!</li>
            <li>Really love this seaweed  power spa which  makes my skin soft .</li>
            <li>I chose rose hip oil and mixed it up according to the instructions.  </li>
            <li>It goes on kind of gritty.  </li>
            <li>I plan on making one of my own to add a personal touch to my gifts.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a natural product and that it is seaweed.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am very happy with this item and will definitely be telling all of my friends about it and possibly buying more in the future after this runs out!</li>
            <li>I also mixed in warm water to make consistancy of mud.</li>
            <li>I feel my face fresh and glowing after I use it as a face mask.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t seem to get the consistency right</li>
            <li>They want you to go to the website for recipes, but I just wanted to do it right away.</li>
            <li>It says to use a moisturizer after wards but honestly, you might not even need one it left my skin soft and smooth  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are great and the seaweed smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice, large jar so it should last a while.</li>
            <li>To prepare this mask, I used warm water and bit of rose water and made a thin paste.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>To prepare this mask, I used warm water and bit of rose water and made a thin paste.</li>
            <li>It was super gentle on my psoriasis, too.</li>
            <li>From what I could tell, it makes the skin very soft and smooth however....</li>
            <li>Very much seaweed.</li>
            <li>I love to try different mask on face or body.</li>
            <li>For me is the first time using seaweed</li>
            <li>Secondly, I just love this product.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon powder is more than enough for a face and neck mask.</li>
            <li>What exactly do you expect it to smell like?</li>
            <li>so I was aware on how to deal with it .  </li>
            <li>but My first time after using I seen results ..</li>
            <li>I see smooth skin with a soft touch.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a seaweed mask.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling hydrated and fresh, really does help diminish the appearance of stretchmarks and cellulite.</li>
            <li>This isn’t the first time I am using a sea weed mask.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter loves it and took it from me :)  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a powdered mask.</li>
            <li>I washed the mask off later, and I felt so refreshing</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using a sea weed mask.</li>
            <li>I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions.</li>
            <li>I really like this as a mask!</li>
            <li>because I definitely need to lose some baby weight! :-)</li>
            <li>sure you put on facial lotion after.</li>
            <li>Finally I added a bunch of water and it worked better</li>
            <li>My face definitely felt softer after use and I look forward to using it more and will update my review when I do.</li>
            <li>My face feels truly soft and smooth once removed.</li>
            <li>but after my first use there is a tad difference.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it made my skin on my face and neck soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; a good 2-3 minutes, let it sit for a few minutes and then rinsed off.</li>
            <li>Hands down love it!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this stuff six stars, because it has made my skin so soft, and clear, and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>body feels totaly like a new person!!</li>
            <li>duh, it&#x27;s a seaweed mask!), but I have heard great things about seaweed.</li>
            <li>I used to have black heads on my face and after using this  my face now looked smooth and blackhead free.</li>
            <li>skin after using the mask feels nice and tight, my pores are dramatically reduced and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The seaweed powder is fine and must be mixed with oil and water to make the mask which needs to stay on for about 30 minutes while it dries.</li>
            <li>It comes in powder form and you can use a little oil and warm water to make a paste to apply to the skin.  </li>
            <li>really like that it&#x27;s in powder form</li>
            <li>I really like the way it works</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is my second day using the spa mask, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This mask really smells like seaweed...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like to use this mask when I am having a break out.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so much softer and firmer after one use.</li>
            <li>This was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I grew up using sea kelp (konbu) facial scrubs as it leaves your skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know how much of that was the seaweed mask and</li>
            <li>It is very versatile.</li>
            <li>I also used it as a body wrap and didn&#x27;t really care for it.  </li>
            <li>It works very</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Seaweed Mask so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin but sometimes make it feel softer(that could be my cleanser).It</li>
            <li>but I feel like my forehead isn&#x27;t wrinkling as much.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon</li>
            <li>I use it for a face mask and really like the way it makes my face feel after...</li>
            <li>Cant say its the best seaweed mask Ive tried but definitely not the worse.</li>
            <li>Just used my new Seaweed Powder for the first time.</li>
            <li>After mixing it together as directed I applied onto my face, and waited 30 minutes , I am completely blown away with the results, I did not expect to see visible results that you could feel right away.</li>
            <li>glad I read the other reviews</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice size container and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast - a day early, in fact.</li>
            <li>My face is pretty sensitive and it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Would have returned it if I had only paid full price for it</li>
            <li>but no you recieve and jar full of seaweed powder that can last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 star is lack of direction.. Would be good if they included a little pamphlet to show some examples of what you could mix it with, and the consistency it should be.</li>
            <li>I am new to the whole face cream/masks/treatment stuff</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so important to use the sunscreen after this product if you&#x27;re near a window or outside to prevent any progress from reversing).&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were quickly gone within the next day or two.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I planning a home spa day and this will be the main feature!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only reason I gave it four star is that it smells funny, I know its seaweed powder it suppose to smell funny</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel so soft and pure.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>It was more radiant than usual, it really made my skin glow.</li>
            <li>Although the product can be a bit messy (make sure you have a towel on hand)</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s worth using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review after using it a few more times.</li>
            <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t feel like your typical scrub (no sharp or grainy particles) and the powder clumped up a bit at first, but I still found it effective.</li>
            <li>In addition, the strong seaweed odor was a little off putting, but not so much that I would disqualify it for that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, mild and at the same time deep cleaning to help get all the dirt, grime and leftover makeup out of my pores.</li>
            <li>I was left with smooth, clean skin and even a little brighter</li>
            <li>I finally found one with the right ingredients</li>
            <li>First, the packaging is nice enough, but it&#x27;s hard to read the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Probably because they&#x27;re free of all the pollutants and other crud that this mask helped to extract.</li>
            <li>because you have to mix the mask yourself it can get messy, so be sure to just pick an old bowl that you don&#x27;t need and mix it up.</li>
            <li>It left the skin radiant, soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It left the skin radiant, soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I mixed mine with water and 100% white aloe alcohol free that I got from walmart-</li>
            <li>After removing it, my pores are tightened and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft after use.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt so refreshed and so very soft.</li>
            <li>There is no special smell and easy to prepare.</li>
            <li>I mixed my powder with extra virgin olive oil and let it dry completely which took about 35 minutes, then rinsed with warm water.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and helps clear out pores!</li>
            <li>so much that I could barely stand the smell.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time and it left my face feeling</li>
            <li>I did not see any side effects on my skin, however if you are allergic please test it on small part of your body to be sure.    </li>
            <li>After the first use you will definitely feel like your skin is cleaner and tighter.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin especially when it gets hot</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night and I am still blown away by the results.</li>
            <li>I left the mask on my face for 45mins and after washing it off, my skin was left feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>The smell of hot uncooked fish was just too much for me.</li>
            <li>After patting dry and toning, I was left with really smooth skin.</li>
            <li>As a mask, it works well and leaves skin feeling tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different facial treatments, all of which were okay, but this was one product that really stood out!</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of makeup everyday and I am prone to huge pores, It diminished them immediately after rinsing the mask off.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even leave my skin as soft and refreshed as this did either.</li>
            <li>and I am liking what I see so far.</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I used it not only on my face but my whole body.</li>
            <li>She has used it numerous times and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It is natural, what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used twice this seaweed powder so far.  </li>
            <li>This review is for SEAWEED MASK Spa Professional Line ★</li>
            <li>really feels like it cleans deep into pores.  </li>
            <li>and my skin felt soft and cleansed.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feels soft</li>
            <li>This is a professional grade sea weed wrap that deserves five stars, but I can&#x27;t give it a five for two reasons.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable especially compared the cost of a seaweed wrap at a salon!</li>
            <li>I have only tried masks a few other times in my life, but the quality of this one is far superior to the ones I tried before.  </li>
            <li>This mask is a little time consuming but worth it!  </li>
            <li>Spread over area, let dry then wrap with hot damp wraps and saran wrap or body sweat suit.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to smooth out due to this at home seaweed wrap and my exercise regimen.</li>
            <li>Super sensitive skin use less vinegar and add water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The value of this jar is outstanding since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>When I washed off the mask my skin felt really clean and firm.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of tea tasting in San Francisco and the first time I recognized what wet dirt smelled like when I was 6 years old.</li>
            <li>While I do not break out anymore, I still have dark marks (which I expected) but my skin is so under control that I can prevent more marks from happening.</li>
            <li>The order came within a few days after placing my order it was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The mask has a nice clinging property, thus becomes less messy.</li>
            <li>The directions pn the side of the bottle are so small and light that you can&#x27;t read them.</li>
            <li>It arrived very timely, was well packaged, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It is a really large jar and I only need to use one spoon every time, so it will definitely last a while!</li>
            <li>This one felt fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally,  the container is bigger than I expected and contains a lot of powder.</li>
            <li>My personal recipes I&#x27;ve used and have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite shower scrub, massage over damp skin in shower, rinse and cleanse as usual.&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp seaweed powder&lt;</li>
            <li>Second, as a vegan I&#x27;m very sensitive to fishy odor</li>
            <li>The treatments left my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>so far have only used it as a mask and it has left my skin feeling refreshed and soft!  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to a friend with the caveats I mentioned, but if I were looking for a seaweed facial mask, I would probably select one that is already mixed next time.</li>
            <li>I spent time looking for a mask that would do something for my acne and dark spots - this one seem to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>but I was squinting and turning the bottle trying to read the white print on the clear plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the mask a couple of times so far</li>
            <li>Now as far as body, I did a back treatment on my bf and his back was so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I used to get the professional seaweed wraps when I lived in Japan and the results are similar.</li>
            <li>You can barely read what is written on the label.</li>
            <li>Only used it on my face so far.</li>
            <li>The smell at fist is kind of weird</li>
            <li>I do highly reccomend this product and it will last a long time as well.</li>
            <li>I decided to use this because I&#x27;m approaching 30 and concerned about my skin in general, since it has become a lot more sensitive in the past few years.</li>
            <li>The caffeine isn&#x27;t extremely noticeable as far as waking you up or anything since it&#x27;s such low dose and your skin is technically the one absorbing it.</li>
            <li>The words on the jar is way too small and not the right color to go with it.</li>
            <li>When i took it off my face it  felt soft and moisturized(i have very dry skin).</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and notice that it didn&#x27;t break me out like other masks</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fast shipping and the container it comes in is so cute!</li>

            <li> Clea  and smooth.</li>
            <li> makes skin feel so smooth and taut.  </li>
            <li> The area around my nose was oil free and pores were not noticeable.</li>
            <li> so you really have to make your own measurements,</li>
            <li> I enjoy waking up to a sn&#x3D;motth face.</li>
            <li> - I tried first helping before bodywraps supplies has arrived - still made me sweat!!- smooth out skin and a notice of improvement  on celluite - smoothes skin out-</li>
            <li> other than this Sea Weed works great love</li>

            <li> Tha purchase was quick and easy.</li>

            <li> You definetely will get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try out this product at a promotional discount.</li>
            <li> But overall i really liked the product!</li>
            <li> I am excited to add it to my go-to gift list.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It was fun to have a spa night with my friends!</li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s powderized, you have double the amount since you just use your own water to rejuvenate and make it into the cream!</li>
            <li> so when I first started looking for these types of things, I wasnt sure what to look for.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I didn&#x27;t see any dirt on the cotton balls while toning, which shows just how clean my face</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> After rinsing off, my skin felt refreshed, smoothe and clean.  </li>
            <li> Hopped in the shower after and it rinsed off cleanly.</li>
            <li> I managed it, but wasn&#x27;t sure if the hassle was worth the effort it took to get it right.</li>
            <li> After ten minutes, I washed my face with warm water to reveal super smooth, clean skin!</li>
            <li> I had always heard that Seaweed has a lot of health benefits, and I&#x27;m excited to think I&#x27;m finally doing something that is good for my skin</li>
            <li> At first, she was unsure but she liked the result afterwards so much that she just asked me if we could do it again.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, men loves back treatments</li>
            <li> I left the mask on for a good 30 - 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the spa and leaves me with nice soft skin.</li>
            <li> Having said that, if you mix the mask with warm water (while wearing a clothespin on your nose), mix it into a paste and apply it to your problem areas with cellulite, then cover the mask with plastic wrap and wait 30 minutes; you can see a marked difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> Be aware the smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li> After using, my face felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the include a website link for you to refer to for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Very easy to apply, goes on smooth, and you can see instant results!</li>
            <li> for a long time because it&#x27;s very concentrated thus making it a great value for your dollar.</li>
            <li> It does come in powder form, but it&#x27;s a pretty good size container, so should last awhile!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super easy and you are getting more product for your money with the powder not already being mixed with ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love Seaweed Mask Spa Professional Line!</li>
            <li> First time trying powder seaweed mask !</li>
            <li> Other then that the quality was nice, shipping was quick and the product was presented accurately.</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try it for cheap.</li>
            <li> but I love how soft my skin feels after washing it off.  </li>
            <li> It did well to keep my acne under control and  infuse more moisture in my face ( making it incredibly soft).</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so fresh and looking radiant.</li>
            <li> and that is a rare thing for me</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, it is easily mixed and can be used on your body OR face!</li>
            <li> Really love this seaweed  power spa which  makes my skin soft .</li>
            <li> I chose rose hip oil and mixed it up according to the instructions.  </li>
            <li> It goes on kind of gritty.  </li>
            <li> I plan on making one of my own to add a personal touch to my gifts.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a natural product and that it is seaweed.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very happy with this item and will definitely be telling all of my friends about it and possibly buying more in the future after this runs out!</li>
            <li> I also mixed in warm water to make consistancy of mud.</li>
            <li> I feel my face fresh and glowing after I use it as a face mask.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t seem to get the consistency right</li>
            <li> They want you to go to the website for recipes, but I just wanted to do it right away.</li>
            <li> It says to use a moisturizer after wards but honestly, you might not even need one it left my skin soft and smooth  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are great and the seaweed smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice, large jar so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> To prepare this mask, I used warm water and bit of rose water and made a thin paste.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> To prepare this mask, I used warm water and bit of rose water and made a thin paste.</li>
            <li> It was super gentle on my psoriasis, too.</li>
            <li> From what I could tell, it makes the skin very soft and smooth however....</li>
            <li> Very much seaweed.</li>
            <li> I love to try different mask on face or body.</li>
            <li> For me is the first time using seaweed</li>
            <li> Secondly, I just love this product.</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon powder is more than enough for a face and neck mask.</li>
            <li> What exactly do you expect it to smell like?</li>
            <li> so I was aware on how to deal with it .  </li>
            <li> but My first time after using I seen results ..</li>
            <li> I see smooth skin with a soft touch.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a seaweed mask.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling hydrated and fresh, really does help diminish the appearance of stretchmarks and cellulite.</li>
            <li> This isn’t the first time I am using a sea weed mask.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves it and took it from me :)  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a powdered mask.</li>
            <li> I washed the mask off later, and I felt so refreshing</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using a sea weed mask.</li>
            <li> I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions.</li>
            <li> I really like this as a mask!</li>
            <li> because I definitely need to lose some baby weight! :-)</li>
            <li> sure you put on facial lotion after.</li>
            <li> Finally I added a bunch of water and it worked better</li>
            <li> My face definitely felt softer after use and I look forward to using it more and will update my review when I do.</li>
            <li> My face feels truly soft and smooth once removed.</li>
            <li> but after my first use there is a tad difference.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it made my skin on my face and neck soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; a good 2-3 minutes, let it sit for a few minutes and then rinsed off.</li>
            <li> Hands down love it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this stuff six stars, because it has made my skin so soft, and clear, and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> body feels totaly like a new person!!</li>
            <li> duh, it&#x27;s a seaweed mask!), but I have heard great things about seaweed.</li>
            <li> I used to have black heads on my face and after using this  my face now looked smooth and blackhead free.</li>
            <li> skin after using the mask feels nice and tight, my pores are dramatically reduced and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The seaweed powder is fine and must be mixed with oil and water to make the mask which needs to stay on for about 30 minutes while it dries.</li>
            <li> It comes in powder form and you can use a little oil and warm water to make a paste to apply to the skin.  </li>
            <li> really like that it&#x27;s in powder form</li>
            <li> I really like the way it works</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my second day using the spa mask, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This mask really smells like seaweed...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like to use this mask when I am having a break out.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so much softer and firmer after one use.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I grew up using sea kelp (konbu) facial scrubs as it leaves your skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know how much of that was the seaweed mask and</li>
            <li> It is very versatile.</li>
            <li> I also used it as a body wrap and didn&#x27;t really care for it.  </li>
            <li> It works very</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Seaweed Mask so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin but sometimes make it feel softer(that could be my cleanser).It</li>
            <li> but I feel like my forehead isn&#x27;t wrinkling as much.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I use it for a face mask and really like the way it makes my face feel after...</li>
            <li> Cant say its the best seaweed mask Ive tried but definitely not the worse.</li>
            <li> Just used my new Seaweed Powder for the first time.</li>
            <li> After mixing it together as directed I applied onto my face, and waited 30 minutes , I am completely blown away with the results, I did not expect to see visible results that you could feel right away.</li>
            <li> glad I read the other reviews</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice size container and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast - a day early, in fact.</li>
            <li> My face is pretty sensitive and it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Would have returned it if I had only paid full price for it</li>
            <li> but no you recieve and jar full of seaweed powder that can last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 star is lack of direction.. Would be good if they included a little pamphlet to show some examples of what you could mix it with, and the consistency it should be.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole face cream/masks/treatment stuff</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so important to use the sunscreen after this product if you&#x27;re near a window or outside to prevent any progress from reversing).&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were quickly gone within the next day or two.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I planning a home spa day and this will be the main feature!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it four star is that it smells funny, I know its seaweed powder it suppose to smell funny</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel so soft and pure.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this product.</li>
            <li> It was more radiant than usual, it really made my skin glow.</li>
            <li> Although the product can be a bit messy (make sure you have a towel on hand)</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s worth using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review after using it a few more times.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t feel like your typical scrub (no sharp or grainy particles) and the powder clumped up a bit at first, but I still found it effective.</li>
            <li> In addition, the strong seaweed odor was a little off putting, but not so much that I would disqualify it for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, mild and at the same time deep cleaning to help get all the dirt, grime and leftover makeup out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I was left with smooth, clean skin and even a little brighter</li>
            <li> I finally found one with the right ingredients</li>
            <li> First, the packaging is nice enough, but it&#x27;s hard to read the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Probably because they&#x27;re free of all the pollutants and other crud that this mask helped to extract.</li>
            <li> because you have to mix the mask yourself it can get messy, so be sure to just pick an old bowl that you don&#x27;t need and mix it up.</li>
            <li> It left the skin radiant, soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It left the skin radiant, soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I mixed mine with water and 100% white aloe alcohol free that I got from walmart-</li>
            <li> After removing it, my pores are tightened and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft after use.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt so refreshed and so very soft.</li>
            <li> There is no special smell and easy to prepare.</li>
            <li> I mixed my powder with extra virgin olive oil and let it dry completely which took about 35 minutes, then rinsed with warm water.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and helps clear out pores!</li>
            <li> so much that I could barely stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time and it left my face feeling</li>
            <li> I did not see any side effects on my skin, however if you are allergic please test it on small part of your body to be sure.    </li>
            <li> After the first use you will definitely feel like your skin is cleaner and tighter.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin especially when it gets hot</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and I am still blown away by the results.</li>
            <li> I left the mask on my face for 45mins and after washing it off, my skin was left feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> The smell of hot uncooked fish was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> After patting dry and toning, I was left with really smooth skin.</li>
            <li> As a mask, it works well and leaves skin feeling tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different facial treatments, all of which were okay, but this was one product that really stood out!</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of makeup everyday and I am prone to huge pores, It diminished them immediately after rinsing the mask off.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even leave my skin as soft and refreshed as this did either.</li>
            <li> and I am liking what I see so far.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I used it not only on my face but my whole body.</li>
            <li> She has used it numerous times and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It is natural, what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice this seaweed powder so far.  </li>
            <li> This review is for SEAWEED MASK Spa Professional Line ★</li>
            <li> really feels like it cleans deep into pores.  </li>
            <li> and my skin felt soft and cleansed.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feels soft</li>
            <li> This is a professional grade sea weed wrap that deserves five stars, but I can&#x27;t give it a five for two reasons.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable especially compared the cost of a seaweed wrap at a salon!</li>
            <li> I have only tried masks a few other times in my life, but the quality of this one is far superior to the ones I tried before.  </li>
            <li> This mask is a little time consuming but worth it!  </li>
            <li> Spread over area, let dry then wrap with hot damp wraps and saran wrap or body sweat suit.</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to smooth out due to this at home seaweed wrap and my exercise regimen.</li>
            <li> Super sensitive skin use less vinegar and add water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The value of this jar is outstanding since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I washed off the mask my skin felt really clean and firm.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of tea tasting in San Francisco and the first time I recognized what wet dirt smelled like when I was 6 years old.</li>
            <li> While I do not break out anymore, I still have dark marks (which I expected) but my skin is so under control that I can prevent more marks from happening.</li>
            <li> The order came within a few days after placing my order it was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The mask has a nice clinging property, thus becomes less messy.</li>
            <li> The directions pn the side of the bottle are so small and light that you can&#x27;t read them.</li>
            <li> It arrived very timely, was well packaged, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a really large jar and I only need to use one spoon every time, so it will definitely last a while!</li>
            <li> This one felt fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally,  the container is bigger than I expected and contains a lot of powder.</li>
            <li> My personal recipes I&#x27;ve used and have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite shower scrub, massage over damp skin in shower, rinse and cleanse as usual.&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp seaweed powder&lt;</li>
            <li> Second, as a vegan I&#x27;m very sensitive to fishy odor</li>
            <li> The treatments left my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> so far have only used it as a mask and it has left my skin feeling refreshed and soft!  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to a friend with the caveats I mentioned, but if I were looking for a seaweed facial mask, I would probably select one that is already mixed next time.</li>
            <li> I spent time looking for a mask that would do something for my acne and dark spots - this one seem to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> but I was squinting and turning the bottle trying to read the white print on the clear plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the mask a couple of times so far</li>
            <li> Now as far as body, I did a back treatment on my bf and his back was so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used to get the professional seaweed wraps when I lived in Japan and the results are similar.</li>
            <li> You can barely read what is written on the label.</li>
            <li> Only used it on my face so far.</li>
            <li> The smell at fist is kind of weird</li>
            <li> I do highly reccomend this product and it will last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this because I&#x27;m approaching 30 and concerned about my skin in general, since it has become a lot more sensitive in the past few years.</li>
            <li> The caffeine isn&#x27;t extremely noticeable as far as waking you up or anything since it&#x27;s such low dose and your skin is technically the one absorbing it.</li>
            <li> The words on the jar is way too small and not the right color to go with it.</li>
            <li> When i took it off my face it  felt soft and moisturized(i have very dry skin).</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and notice that it didn&#x27;t break me out like other masks</li>
            <li> I only needed a small amount of powder ( 1/2 a tablespoon) to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> The color is a little gross but my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> It mask is in powder form which makes it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Next time I do the facial I am going to use only 2 tablespoons of the powder and mix the wet ingredients accordingly.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dead skin after my normal skin cleanser</li>
            <li> it really stank and was very very messy..</li>
            <li> While I hate walking around with whiteheads (and I try really hard not to pop or pick), it&#x27;s nice to see such quick</li>
            <li> I looked for instructions on how to best use but was unable to find any, so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that this arrived in powder form since I was expecting something already mixed, but I believe that was my fault for not looking carefully.</li>
            <li> (long overdue).  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Long as it works and it do!&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> This powder will last a very long time since you add the wet ingredients separate.</li>
            <li> I mixed a little powder with some fractionated coconut oil, mixed it together in my hands and started rubbing it all over my face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend at least trying this out if your looking for a new product!</li>
            <li> I like that my face didn&#x27;t feel dry after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I tried to apply on dry skin and that wasn&#x27;t working, so I splashed my face with water and tried again.</li>
            <li> I used equal parts powder and apple cider vinegar, and occasionally I add a few tsp the Indian healing clay (also on Amazon)</li>
            <li> When I first opened it it smelled like matcha powder (green tea), not sure what to expect</li>
            <li> The only negative i see with this product is the instructions are super hard to read from the bottle!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dry!</li>
            <li> Not only do my wrinkles feel less, but my face feels smoother.</li>
            <li> but wow what a mess!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a couple tiny little whiteheads popping up (clogged pores).</li>
            <li> I have had problems with other masks leaving a dry feeling.</li>
            <li> The label is clear, so it&#x27;s really hard to read anything on it.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin and acne a little bit, and couple white head comes out the next day after I used it the night before</li>
            <li> only complaint about the mask is not related to the product, it&#x27;s the container that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to keep trying it and see how different my skin looks in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Nowadays, brown sugar is a bit too rough for my face</li>
            <li> I either mixed it with green tea, or mix it with matcha powder (food grade)</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected .</li>
            <li> I see a difference in my skin in only a few days</li>
            <li> Do not use 1/4 cup if it&#x27;s going to be just for your face, I wasted 75% of the mixture because I only used it on my face.</li>
            <li> definitely have less oil!</li>
            <li> I think the caffeine is what you feel as a slight cooling tingle but overall the smell is not distinct or overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suffer from only minor acne, and they&#x27;re slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that i had to get the directions from the amazon listing because the clear container has a clear label with gray writing which is extremely difficult to read.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use and can be messy but makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I left the paste on my face for about half an hour until it was dried.</li>
            <li> I have purchased facial masks in the past.</li>
            <li> I only had one small problem with this mask.  </li>
            <li> You are not paying money for other ingredients that we all have at our disposal, being an oil of our choice and water.</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle that you can use this mask as a scrub, but due to the smell, I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> have given this product 3 stars because it is hard to mix, messy, hard to rinse off and the writing on the package is so small and light color</li>
            <li> only downside is very messy-</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not as physically active like I used to be.</li>
            <li> It mixes up easily, no clumps or dry spots</li>
            <li> Its a little bit harder to use than an premix mask but still does the job</li>
            <li> The smell is my only complaint about the product, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, every other day, since I&#x27;ve received it, which was on the 9th of February, 2015.    </li>
            <li> That was gross but I am totally serious.)</li>
            <li> Part of the directions include wrapping in plastic wrap, and when I did that, I could feel a slight tingling.</li>
            <li> I could feel it working into my skin a slight tingle cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a slight difference on my legs.</li>
            <li> and No it&#x27;s a mess with the oil!&lt;br /&gt;Use water to make your paste for your face!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend using a little less of the powder when making the mask to avoid using it up.</li>
            <li> I do wish that it a little less messy</li>
            <li> so I was a little concerned but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> I could feel my face tighten a little.</li>
            <li> I mix it along with coconut oil and water, and just a little bit works for each section.</li>
            <li> I felt little itchy</li>
            <li> Is this supposed to help with little wrinkles like on the forehead?</li>
            <li> I wish the package came with a little scoop to make getting things out and not so messy.</li>
            <li> I even let my 12-year-old daughter try it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I used organic Aloe Vera juice instead of water and either a few drops of Rosehip oil or Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> product itself is a green powder that you have to mix with water to make into a mud mask.</li>
            <li> I used the mask a night and basically let it sit until it dried.</li>
            <li> so I use this powder as a mask instead a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money threw it in the trash..</li>
            <li> I used a small mason jar and measured 1/4 of the powder and 3 tablespoons of bio oil for stretch marks, dark spots, scars and cellulite.  </li>
            <li> but you get used to it after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but this odor was like dried cuttlefish.</li>
            <li> Once you apply a thin layer (after mixing the powder with some water), the mask begins to dry within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and it was almost like wet sand when it was too thick and also had a hard time staying on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can get past the smell</li>
            <li> One suggestion is to take small quantity at a time to avoid wastage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell like most masks do.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a small jar or even foil packets</li>
            <li> After using this item several times I am sad to say I am not thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy and hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> I put a small portion on my face for at least 30 minutes, and then scrub it off my face using a sponge or hard towel.</li>
            <li> I found the directions a little tough because I had to look online.</li>
            <li> I did have a bit of a hard time getting the mask to stick to my face</li>
            <li> With the oil, it is also hard to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> II find it hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the Sea Weed was in powder direction on the container is hard to read</li>
            <li> Also the directions on the package are extremely hard to read so go to the website that it suggests on the pack.</li>
            <li> The powder is hard to mix with the water.  </li>
            <li> I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell, but I did not have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> and then I applied it on  my face after I cleansed it and exfoliated it (i like a thick texture).</li>
            <li> Really dried the skin on my legs and my cheeks broke out something horrible- small and large pimps and opened my pores.</li>
            <li> and when it was too thin, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my skin</li>
            <li> lt has made a difference in my skin, it makes if feel smoother and the smell is not that bad, on the other hand my sister told me about this product</li>
            <li> Maybe if using 2-3 tablespoons of both water and oil each otherwise you might have a hard time mixing and applying to your skin!!</li>
            <li> I made the mud according to the instructions, which were almost impossible to read on the bottle and hard to find online, and it came out like puddy.</li>
            <li> I hate to waste it for trial and error.</li>
            <li> Curiously nostalgic.    </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt or feel uncomfortable at all, I just couldn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> Needless to say, both of us are fans of this product now.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost impossible to read the directions or anything else on the label.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost impossible to read the directions or anything else on the label.</li>
            <li> so it is nearly impossible to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i didnt see anything bad happen to my skin, and it did feel softer.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love to try different mask on face or body. After using this seaweed mask, my face is getting moisture and bright. It works well on me. There is no special smell and easy to prepare. Love this mask</li>
            <li> This is seaweed so please understand that seaweed smells like seaweed..  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 star is lack of direction.. Would be good if they included a little pamphlet to show some examples of what you could mix it with, and the consistency it should be. I hate to waste it for trial and error. Good product itself. My face is pretty sensitive and it didn&#x27;t bother me. Would recommend to try it. But know you will have to go online for usage.</li>
            <li> Great mask. Love the formula and my skin feels wonderful afterward.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask. After using, my face felt clean and fresh. It was more radiant than usual, it really made my skin glow. I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to everyone. It does wonders for your skin. Trust me!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried it yet but the texture is great</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m really impressed with this mask. For me is the first time using seaweed so I was a little concerned but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m not dissapointed! :)</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and smoother and my pores are definitely smaller. Probably because they&#x27;re free of all the pollutants and other crud that this mask helped to extract. (Okay. That was gross but I am totally serious.) Don&#x27;t let the aroma scare you away. It&#x27;s a seaweed mask and thus smells like the ocean. There&#x27;s a reason that spas everywhere offer seaweed facials and wraps. They work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has never felt cleaner. I even let my 12-year-old daughter try it a few days ago. At first, she was unsure but she liked the result afterwards so much that she just asked me if we could do it again. It&#x27;s an excellent way to prevent future breakouts. And you can&#x27;t put a price tag on that for a 12-year-old or her (cough)-year-old mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it&#x27;s in powder form so you can control the consistency yourself. And I&#x27;ve read about some users adding essential oils to it instead of water (which is what I used) to boost the aromatherapy experience. In any event, I&#x27;ll be using this jar (and sharing it with my daughter!) for a long time because it&#x27;s very concentrated thus making it a great value for your dollar. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First, I want to start by saying how impressed I am by how quickly the item shipped to me, I hadn&#x27;t been expecting it for several more days when I saw it in my mailbox.  Secondly, I just love this product. I have only tried masks a few other times in my life, but the quality of this one is far superior to the ones I tried before.  I&#x27;ve only tried the mask a couple of times so far but I love how soft my skin feels after washing it off.  I can&#x27;t wait to keep trying it and see how different my skin looks in a few weeks.  It may just be me, but I feel like my skin looks better and fresher.  I had always heard that Seaweed has a lot of health benefits, and I&#x27;m excited to think I&#x27;m finally doing something that is good for my skin (long overdue).  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> After one use , I noticed an instant glow!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this product! I&#x27;ve used it a few times, every other day, since I&#x27;ve received it, which was on the 9th of February, 2015.    I decided to use this because I&#x27;m approaching 30 and concerned about my skin in general, since it has become a lot more sensitive in the past few years. Also, I&#x27;m not as physically active like I used to be. I don&#x27;t work out like I used to and have noticed dimples on the back of my thighs. Since this product is organic, kosher amd cruelty free, I trusted trying it, and now I can happily say I have no regrets and would highly recommend it!!!    Tha purchase was quick and easy. The delivery was very fast - a day early, in fact. The product was well packaged and directions were not just on the label of the product, but also on a separate paper inside the package. The powder was very finely ground with a rich, earthy smell. It reminded me of tea tasting in San Francisco and the first time I recognized what wet dirt smelled like when I was 6 years old. Curiously nostalgic.    It was very easy to mix and apply, and it felt cool and refreshing on my skin. Part of the directions include wrapping in plastic wrap, and when I did that, I could feel a slight tingling. It didn&#x27;t hurt or feel uncomfortable at all, I just couldn&#x27;t help but KNOW I was feeling it work. It felt the same every time and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks more radiant and feels a lot smoother in the areas I applied the product to!    A great experience and exciting discovery!</li>
            <li> I love it! I have been looking for something like this for a long time now. I went to the spa once to have a seaweed body treatment and it costed me like $80! It didn&#x27;t even leave my skin as soft and refreshed as this did either. I am very happy with this product, it is easy to use, convenient to have at home, and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg! I&#x27;m sure with continued use I will see more benefits to my skin with this product.</li>
            <li> My personal recipes I&#x27;ve used and have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite shower scrub, massage over damp skin in shower, rinse and cleanse as usual.&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp seaweed powder&lt;br /&gt;2 Tbs white sugar&lt;br /&gt;2 Tbs olive oil  yeilds 1 treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For face I used equal parts powder and apple cider vinegar, and occasionally I add a few tsp the Indian healing clay (also on Amazon) I leave it on about 15 minute. Super sensitive skin use less vinegar and add water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body wrap same as face but added clay and olive or oil of choice for scent. Spread over area, let dry then wrap with hot damp wraps and saran wrap or body sweat suit. I wear about an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now.  I really like the way it works, I have seen definite improvement to the appearance of cellulite on my backside.  I do wish that it a little less messy but I guess that is just the nature of the product.</li>
            <li> I had never done a seaweed based facial treatment before, but I have heard wonderful things about it&#x27;s benefits. I was a little surprised that this arrived in powder form since I was expecting something already mixed, but I believe that was my fault for not looking carefully. However, I found that I didn&#x27;t care for having to mix it myself. I couldn&#x27;t seem to get the consistency right and when it was too thin, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my skin and it was almost like wet sand when it was too thick and also had a hard time staying on. I managed it, but wasn&#x27;t sure if the hassle was worth the effort it took to get it right. In addition, the strong seaweed odor was a little off putting, but not so much that I would disqualify it for that. I liked the way my skin looked and felt afterward, but I also followed to recommendation to use paste as an exfoliant rather than a mask and I liked that much better! I have been treating the areas on my body where cellulite is a problem and I am liking what I see so far. I would certainly recommend this to a friend with the caveats I mentioned, but if I were looking for a seaweed facial mask, I would probably select one that is already mixed next time.</li>
            <li> The Seaweed Powder is a must in your essentials! Feels good and leaves the face feeling refreshing! Will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> The color is a little gross but my skin is so soft! I love this product and will absolutly order again! Best of all it lasts a long time!!!</li>
            <li> lt has made a difference in my skin, it makes if feel smoother and the smell is not that bad, on the other hand my sister told me about this product but she doesn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> The website on the side of the bottle does not work. The directions pn the side of the bottle are so small and light that you can&#x27;t read them. After looking the directions up on the internet from another brand, the product seems to work as described.</li>
            <li> Cant say its the best seaweed mask Ive tried but definitely not the worse. It did make me breakout a bit.Its actually very easy to mix .. The trick is to use enough liquid. 1 tablespoon powder is more than enough for a face and neck mask. I used organic Aloe Vera juice instead of water and either a few drops of Rosehip oil or Jojoba oil. I think I liked it better as body mask as it made my skin very soft. As for the smell , Im not quite sure why ppl are complaining... Its Seaweed!! What exactly do you expect it to smell like? You should want it to smell like seaweed, after all thats what your paying for.</li>
            <li> I thought it was ok, it comes in powder form...but i didnt see anything bad happen to my skin, and it did feel softer. Thanks for letting me try it for cheap.</li>
            <li> I love it 😊 glad I read the other reviews so I was aware on how to deal with it .  I put it on and my face was so smooth afterwards. I will use it couple days a week...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now and I enjoy it. I didn&#x27;t have too many wrinkles to begin with, but I do feel my face has improved and I feel refreshed. I like that it&#x27;s a powder so that I can mix to my choice of consistency. I haven&#x27;t tried it on cellulite yet, but I look forward to and I&#x27;ll have to update this review to let you know how it goes!</li>
            <li> Nice consistency; left my skin feeling amazing! Looking forward to continued results!</li>
            <li> I really love ❤ this product ! I didnt think it would work honestly but My first time after using I seen results .. You definetely will get your money&#x27;s worth! They give you alot in the jar for the price. My face feels wonderful,  i am about to order another jar this product is really amazing ! And great for getting ready fornthe summertime :)</li>
            <li> I spent time looking for a mask that would do something for my acne and dark spots - this one seem to fit the bill. I only used this product 3 times a week for one week now and I found my face making some progress. It did well to keep my acne under control and  infuse more moisture in my face ( making it incredibly soft). I used this mask in combination with a tone,vitamin e oil, Nature&#x27;s Cure tablets, a 30 spf sunscreen, and a vitamin c cream. (note: it&#x27;s so important to use the sunscreen after this product if you&#x27;re near a window or outside to prevent any progress from reversing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a green powder that you have to mix with water to make into a mud mask. I only needed a small amount of powder ( 1/2 a tablespoon) to cover my whole face. I used the mask a night and basically let it sit until it dried. Afterwards, I would wash it off with warm water and used a vitamin c moisturizer. While I do not break out anymore, I still have dark marks (which I expected) but my skin is so under control that I can prevent more marks from happening. I&#x27;m quite positive for future results to be amazing!</li>
            <li> *I received a discount code to buy this item to review*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is very cool. It comes in powder form and then you mix it with water to create the mask. It has a strong seaweed smell (duh, it&#x27;s a seaweed mask!), but I have heard great things about seaweed. I was not disappointed! My skin felt great afterwards! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am VERY impressed with this seaweed powder; it is no difference than the the ones used in spas (I graduated from Master Aesthetics school). I used distilled water to mix the powder with and then I applied it on  my face after I cleansed it and exfoliated it (i like a thick texture). I absolutely did not expect this product to work this good. After removing it, my pores are tightened and my skin feels very soft. I have oily, sensitive and acne prone skin and this is safe and helps with all of these issues. Now as far as body, I did a back treatment on my bf and his back was so soft afterwards. If you would like to know how to do a back treatment, just ask? Surprisingly, men loves back treatments lol. I have seen some reviewers using oil to mix it with (I have yet to try it), but I do recommend using olive oil or an organic coconut oil as these are healthy oils and it is good for your skin; however, if you have sensitive,acne prone or oily skin (face), use distilled water just to be on the safer side.</li>
            <li> Pros: The seaweed mask does an amazing job at cleaning your skin. I used it on my face and chest. It leaves my skin soft and clean. I used to get the professional seaweed wraps when I lived in Japan and the results are similar. It mask is in powder form which makes it last for a long time. You can also put it into cute travel size tube for friends. Cons: It is really messy and you have to find your own perfect mixture to get it to stick to your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It leaves my face feeling so fresh and looking radiant. This has become part of my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> Generous size, this will last me forever. Great value and is very soothing on my skin. Be aware the smell is quite strong. I smelled like a piece of sushi while I had the mask on.</li>
            <li> This is my second day using the spa mask, and it is fantastic. It truly feels like a spa on your face. It&#x27;s soft, most, and provides excellent detail when you removed from your skin. I put a small portion on my face for at least 30 minutes, and then scrub it off my face using a sponge or hard towel. I see smooth skin with a soft touch. I suffer from only minor acne, and they&#x27;re slowly disappearing. So I can only imagine what happens when I finish using it for the following week. For anyone looking for a good spa mask, I recommend this to be a part of your house collection.</li>
            <li> I love Seaweed Mask Spa Professional Line! It comes in a powder form is ORGANIC! Yes! You also get to control the consistency with powdered form make it as smooth and creamy as you would like! I am so glad I tried this product out. Thank you for the chance to try your product and with the help of Snagshout I was able to purchase at discounted price! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> works so good!  so far have only used it as a mask and it has left my skin feeling refreshed and soft!  will try on cellulite after I have this baby to see if it works and will update!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for about 2.5 months now (once a week) and i&#x27;m loving the improvements. Not only do my wrinkles feel less, but my face feels smoother. (Out in the sun all day so my skin bares the brunt of that)</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a seaweed mask. I have purchased facial masks in the past. My current routine involves Queen Helene mint julep mask. because you have to mix the mask yourself it can get messy, so be sure to just pick an old bowl that you don&#x27;t need and mix it up. I mixed mine with Jojoba and grapeseed oil. The instructions on the package are not legigle and need to be changed. They want you to go to the website for recipes, but I just wanted to do it right away. I let the mask sit for 15 minutes, while I did the laundry. I could feel my face tighten a little. When I washed off the mask my skin felt really clean and firm. I will likely purchase this again. I wish the package came with a little scoop to make getting things out and not so messy. You can treat yourself in the middle of preparing dinner and treat make yourself a priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to purchase this product. All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Awesome face mask! I finally found one with the right ingredients</li>
            <li> Love the Seaweed Mask! It made my skin feel so soft and pure. I used it not only on my face but my whole body. The flab on my arms has tightened noticeably after just one use. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love all the good ingredients that are in this mask powder. I also bought charcoal and goats milk so I could make soap, if you try this make sure you add a scent... because PU the seaweed has a stink. I have noticed a more even complexion and will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing after I used this! My skin feels so supple and nourished. I only used it once, and I am hooked.</li>
            <li> This mask really smells like seaweed...so much that I could barely stand the smell. The smell is my only complaint about the product, however. As a mask, it works well and leaves skin feeling tight and smooth. You can also add more water and use it as a scrub, which also works well. I have sensitive skin and this mask worked great for me, and I feel that it even cleared my skin up a bit while I was dealing with PMS.</li>
            <li> Just used my new Seaweed Powder for the first time. I&#x27;ve bought a cream for cellulite from the same company and absolutely LOVED it! So when I saw this I just couldn&#x27;t help myself, I had to check it out... And I&#x27;m VERY HAPPY I DID! It leaves skin feeling hydrated and fresh, really does help diminish the appearance of stretchmarks and cellulite. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use and can be messy but makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible,</li>
            <li> This isn’t the first time I am using a sea weed mask. This comes in a powder form. To prepare this mask, I used warm water and bit of rose water and made a thin paste. I left it on for 30 minutes and then washed it with a sponge. It left the skin radiant, soft and fresh.  I really like to use this mask when I am having a break out. It&#x27;s very gentle, mild and at the same time deep cleaning to help get all the dirt, grime and leftover makeup out of my pores. SPA AT HOME  FEELING!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome I absolutely love it! Moisturizing and helps clear out pores! Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone in my family and friends! It arrives in powder form which I found interesting!</li>
            <li> It does come in powder form, but it&#x27;s a pretty good size container, so should last awhile! Works great!</li>
            <li> The stuff is nice. Don&#x27;t like having to go on the web to figure out how to use the product. You can barely read what is written on the label. But the product itself is nice.</li>
            <li> does what it promised, nice</li>
            <li> OMG, I almost threw up when applying this. The smell of hot uncooked fish was just too much for me. Also I had to wait a day for a magnifying glass to read the instructions after I got it. The words on the jar is way too small and not the right color to go with it. Also I did not feel a difference on my face, it felt the same and looked the same also. Would have returned it if I had only paid full price for it</li>
            <li> Detoxify and deep cleanse your skin with a weekly mask. Nourishing supplement on the face will smooth, tone and moisturize your skin. Creating your own spa treatments at home is an exercise in adaptation</li>
            <li> I love this seaweed mask.  It leaves your face feeling so rejuvenated.  I only had one small problem with this mask.  I used it one time and have not saw the jar again.  My teenage daughter loves it and took it from me :)  She has used it numerous times and absolutely loves it.  It comes in a nice, large jar so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> Overall Buying experience thee best , customer service between the seller and I great with keeping in contact and answering all questions and concerns.The order came within a few days after placing my order it was pretty fast. If you are looking for a mud mask this is it!! Its very easy to use and blend into a mud mask , its really smooth and paste like. After mixing it together as directed I applied onto my face, and waited 30 minutes , I am completely blown away with the results, I did not expect to see visible results that you could feel right away. I could feel it working into my skin a slight tingle cooling sensation. I wear a lot of makeup everyday and I am prone to huge pores, It diminished them immediately after rinsing the mask off.It says to use a moisturizer after wards but honestly, you might not even need one it left my skin soft and smooth  and that is a rare thing for me,I have problematic skin  issues. The mask itself comes in powder form,it comes in a screw top jar , easy and perfect for storing and putting away, the jar itself is plastic so that  is huge plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about it when shipping and spilling or breaking.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is natural, what I was looking for. Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> I had never used a seaweed mask before this and thanks to this product i am a believer and in love!! The packaging is nice, it is easily mixed and can be used on your body OR face! I mixed and applied to my face and left it on there for about 20 minutes. When i took it off my face it  felt soft and moisturized(i have very dry skin). I am impressed with the ingredients, Caffeine - Retinol - Hyaluronic Acid - and will continue to use my mask and use it on my legs for my cellulite and aging skin!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I tried the Seaweed mask on my legs and face. Really dried the skin on my legs and my cheeks broke out something horrible- small and large pimps and opened my pores. I guess everyone&#x27;s body makeup is different and the reaction would be different each person. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the smell was super strong too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice this seaweed powder so far.  Really love this seaweed  power spa which  makes my skin soft .</li>
            <li> I love this seaweed mask! I tried it for the first time and it left my face feeling Clea  and smooth. I like that my face didn&#x27;t feel dry after. I have had problems with other masks leaving a dry feeling. This one felt fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally,  the container is bigger than I expected and contains a lot of powder.</li>
            <li> Great mask that really leaves my skin feeling nice! Very easy to apply, goes on smooth, and you can see instant results! Skin feels so much softer and firmer after one use. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a powdered mask. Although the product can be a bit messy (make sure you have a towel on hand), it&#x27;s kind of fun mixing together your own concoction for a mask. I decided to mix a TBSP of the powder with a Rosewater and Glycerin mixture and fractionated coconut oil (since I didn&#x27;t have regular on hand). It was very easy to mix everything together. I did have a bit of a hard time getting the mask to stick to my face (maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough liquid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I tried to apply on dry skin and that wasn&#x27;t working, so I splashed my face with water and tried again. That worked better. I left the mask on for a good 30 - 45 minutes. It was very easy to rinse off as well (with warm water). After patting dry and toning, I was left with really smooth skin. As a matter of fact, I didn&#x27;t see any dirt on the cotton balls while toning, which shows just how clean my face was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, I tried the mask as a scrub since the directions say that it can be used that way as well. I mixed a little powder with some fractionated coconut oil, mixed it together in my hands and started rubbing it all over my face. It definitely didn&#x27;t feel like your typical scrub (no sharp or grainy particles) and the powder clumped up a bit at first, but I still found it effective. I &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; a good 2-3 minutes, let it sit for a few minutes and then rinsed off. I was left with smooth, clean skin and even a little brighter complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day or two after using (each time) I noticed a couple tiny little whiteheads popping up (clogged pores). They were quickly gone within the next day or two. While I hate walking around with whiteheads (and I try really hard not to pop or pick), it&#x27;s nice to see such quick results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the mask is not related to the product, it&#x27;s the container that it comes in. The label is clear, so it&#x27;s really hard to read anything on it. While it&#x27;s a beautiful, generous size jar (and I really appreciate that), it&#x27;s almost impossible to read the directions or anything else on the label. Luckily, the include a website link for you to refer to for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.really appreciate that), it&#x27;s almost impossible to read the directions or anything else on the label.

            <li> This seaweed mask is awesome. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the spa and leaves me with nice soft skin.</li>
            <li> truly Great Product!!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;My body feels totaly like a new person!!</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected.  It arrived very timely, was well packaged, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I grew up using sea kelp (konbu) facial scrubs as it leaves your skin smooth and glowing. After rinsing it to remove salt, we would soak it in filtered water for a day before grinding and mixing it with brown sugar. The process is a bit cumbersome so I was excited to try out this product at a promotional discount. Nowadays, brown sugar is a bit too rough for my face so I use this powder as a mask instead a few times a week. I either mixed it with green tea, or mix it with matcha powder (food grade) + water and it does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this mask for my cellulite!! The only negative i see with this product is the instructions are super hard to read from the bottle! I went on google to find them because i could not read the text!! But overall i really liked the product! This is a gradual process and I will see more results the more i use it!</li>
            <li> This review is for SEAWEED MASK Spa Professional Line ★ The ONLY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seaweed is good for many things.  It is great in your diet.  So, put it on your face?  It sounds good.  All the minerals and vitamins in the seaweed should work wonders on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says to mix with oil and put on your face.  I chose rose hip oil and mixed it up according to the instructions.  It goes on kind of gritty.  It smells strongly of seaweed.  With the oil, it is also hard to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it work?  My skin was very soft after use.  I felt moisturized as well.  But I don&#x27;t know how much of that was the seaweed mask and what was the rose hip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given this product 3 stars because it is hard to mix, messy, hard to rinse off and the writing on the package is so small and light color so it is nearly impossible to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at no cost in order that I may test it and possibly provide this review.</li>
            <li> great mask!  makes skin feel so smooth and taut.  really feels like it cleans deep into pores.  love it</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail today and omg I&#x27;m in LOVE already! It is absolutely amazing, and works way better than I thought it would.  My face feels so clean and refreshed. I love it</li>
            <li> I looked for instructions on how to best use but was unable to find any, so that was disappointing. Other than that it seems like a good product. Very much seaweed.</li>
            <li> Loved this mask, loved the way my face felt afterwards too!</li>
            <li> I have tried this mask last night and it worked great! I used the rose water (from GNC) and blended with the seaweed powder to create a paste. I left the paste on my face for about half an hour until it was dried. I washed the mask off later, and I felt so refreshing and my skin felt soft and cleansed. It is a really large jar and I only need to use one spoon every time, so it will definitely last a while! It also has a nice packing which is easy to take to product out with a spoon and is easy to store.  Disclaimer: I received this product with a promotion. My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> This mask comes in a powder form and the instructions are very easy to follow. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft. Great product and great company!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I use it to wash my face</li>
            <li> The seaweed powder is fine and must be mixed with oil and water to make the mask which needs to stay on for about 30 minutes while it dries. It mixes up easily, no clumps or dry spots but it does have a bit of an earthy smell. I mixed my powder with extra virgin olive oil and let it dry completely which took about 35 minutes, then rinsed with warm water. After rinsing off, my skin felt refreshed, smoothe and clean.  My only complaint is that i had to get the directions from the amazon listing because the clear container has a clear label with gray writing which is extremely difficult to read.</li>
            <li> This is a nicely packaged item. I got it for a reduce priced to try. I found the directions a little tough because I had to look online. I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of using plastic wrap.  Other then that the quality was nice, shipping was quick and the product was presented accurately.</li>
            <li> Used once. I don&#x27;t think I can get past the smell so I could not evaluate its claims. Smells like a stagnant swamp.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It comes in powder form and you can use a little oil and warm water to make a paste to apply to the skin.  I left the mask on my face for 45mins and after washing it off, my skin was left feeling refreshed and clean.  I recommend using a little less of the powder when making the mask to avoid using it up.</li>
            <li> Works like it says. I would purchase this product again</li>
            <li> This is a great product. When I received it I researched what I could use it for. There are a multitude of treatments to make with this. It is very versatile. I have made a face mask and a body wrap. Both were easy to make, easy to apply and a breeze to clean up. The treatments left my skin so soft! My daughters and I planning a home spa day and this will be the main feature!&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift for a new mom, someone that is recovering from an illness or anyone that needs some relaxation and pampering. It is beautifully packaged. I am excited to add it to my go-to gift list.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would recommend is the addition of a recipe book provided with the product. I plan on making one of my own to add a personal touch to my gifts.</li>
            <li> Well.I wasted my money threw it in the trash..it really stank and was very very messy..Not quite what I expected .</li>
            <li> Love this product. I see a difference in my skin in only a few days</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my skin feels soft and I notice smaller pores</li>
            <li> This formula is amazing and is one of the best masks I have ever gotten and used! I love that this is a natural product and that it is seaweed. Some of the great features that caused me to get this include: Reduces the Appearance of Cellulite, Cleans Out &amp; Minimizes the Size of Pores, Antibacterial - Remove Impurities, Nourish the Skin with Important Minerals &amp; Trace Elements, Detoxifies and Draws Out Unwanted Toxins, Delivers Important Antioxidant Vitamins and Minerals, and Stimulates Circulation Exfoliating the Skin. With all of these great features, how could you not fall in love with it! It also comes in nice packaging. All in all, I am very happy with this item and will definitely be telling all of my friends about it and possibly buying more in the future after this runs out!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using a sea weed mask. This comes in a powder form. To prepare this mask, I used warm water and bit of rose water and made a thin paste. I left it on for 30 minutes and then washed it with a sponge. It left the skin radiant, soft and fresh.  It comes in a nice size container and will last for a long time. One suggestion is to take small quantity at a time to avoid wastage. I did not see any side effects on my skin, however if you are allergic please test it on small part of your body to be sure.

I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging was good! Very simple directions for mixing. I used a small mason jar and measured 1/4 of the powder and 3 tablespoons of bio oil for stretch marks, dark spots, scars and cellulite.  I also mixed in warm water to make consistancy of mud. I must say after the first use of it on my face, I really liked how it felt afterwards. The area around my nose was oil free and pores were not noticeable. My skin felt so refreshed and so very soft. When I applied it elsewhere, like my theighs and legs, I loved how my skin felt afterwards as well! My skin looked great. I have not seen a difference in cellulite but I haven&#x27;t used it for a week yet. I used it as a scrub and still need to try the wrap for my theighs. I do highly reccomend this product and it will last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of this mask. It can be used on the face and also on the body. After the first use you will definitely feel like your skin is cleaner and tighter. It&#x27;s like having your own Spa at home, but cheaper..</li>
            <li> I really like this as a mask! I have acne prone skin especially when it gets hot outside!&lt;br /&gt;Before using this mask please read the directions posted on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;My skin after using the mask feels nice and tight, my pores are dramatically reduced and&lt;br /&gt;I definitely have less oil! I have yet to try wrapping myself with this product.. I&#x27;ll do it&lt;br /&gt;soon because I definitely need to lose some baby weight! :-) Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I feel my face fresh and glowing after I use it as a face mask.  II find it hard to remove.  I also used it as a body wrap and didn&#x27;t really care for it.  It&#x27;s very messy and hard to wash off.  Used it only twice on my face so I can&#x27;t give a review on my results.  Does smell like seaweed but you get used to it after a few minutes.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product, Very finely grounded and easy to mix and works great.Only reason I gave it four star is that it smells funny, I know its seaweed powder it suppose to smell funny but I wish seller could do something regarding it.But overall it&#x27;s worth using.I got this at discounted price as part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This seaweed powder is something that I have been looking for and I am lucky to have gotten a chance to find and receive this. A lot of people have gotten into the craze of body wraps recently, but this is working as my at home wrap. I am in love with this powder! I mix it along with coconut oil and water, and just a little bit works for each section. I apply this on my body, then use saran wrap as my own body wrap. My skin is starting to smooth out due to this at home seaweed wrap and my exercise regimen. The value of this jar is outstanding since a little goes a long way. There is no reason for me to go to spas any longer!</li>
            <li> Inlove this product it does tighten the skin but you have to use regularly i use once per week.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly it smells so good</li>
            <li> Great product. Only used it on my face so far. I must say it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing on my skin. I have a lot of dead skin after my normal skin cleanser and this removes it all</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the Sea Weed was in powder direction on the container is hard to read so you really have to make your own measurements, other than this Sea Weed works great love it</li>
            <li> I have already done the wrap twice and I have seen a slight difference on my legs. I will continue to use the product and will post if i see more of a difference.</li>
            <li> It works very good!&lt;br /&gt;But Warning::: Don&#x27;t use Oil&lt;br /&gt;Oils don&#x27;t dry! Believe Me I tried the oil and No it&#x27;s a mess with the oil!&lt;br /&gt;Use water to make your paste for your face!&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s a strong smell of Seaweed but&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Seaweed Mask so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. Long as it works and it do!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you put on facial lotion after.</li>
            <li> I tried after 30 days later, Because I didn&#x27;t even doubt this mask , but one evening I tried mixed with just purified water and I put on my face with under the jar line. after 20 min. I felt little itchy so I washed off. and I saw My face is all red with rash. and feel itchy and sore.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had to return it. but I used 30 days later I received it. So, I couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I regret that I should try earlier.</li>
            <li> The product has potential.  From what I could tell, it makes the skin very soft and smooth however.... I made the mud according to the instructions, which were almost impossible to read on the bottle and hard to find online, and it came out like puddy. I put it on, and when i tried to rub it, it balled up and fell off.  Finally I added a bunch of water and it worked better but wow what a mess!! Please develop the body wrap instructions better and make two sets for face and body.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> I have only used this on my face and I loved it! It was fun to have a spa night with my friends! My skin was definitely firmer and my pores tighter after use! I love it! It was relaxing! *I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
            <li> This product is well package. Easy instructions on how to mix up and use. I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like having to miss up the powder but it&#x27;s super easy and you are getting more product for your money with the powder not already being mixed with ingredients. Nice smell and you feel renewed once you have used.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, feels great on skin, amazing mask ! I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and will be trying for the perfect combination to get the consistency that works best.The ingredients are great and the seaweed smell is not overwhelming.My face definitely felt softer after use and I look forward to using it more and will update my review when I do.I got a great deal on this product and am very happy to be able to try such a high quality product.After using this item several times I am sad to say I am not thrilled with it.It really doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin but sometimes make it feel softer(that could be my cleanser).It has all the ingredients I look for in a product but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this product. The smell at fist is kind of weird but after my 3-4 use I was over the smell. It leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> First time trying this mask product,feel good after first use,soft and smooth,easy to use,hope it will make me getting better skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using this Seaweed Mask product. I like that,in the jar, you are provided the seaweed powder alone. You are not paying money for other ingredients that we all have at our disposal, being an oil of our choice and water. I like using olive oil and I have yet needed to add any water to my mix. The mask has a nice clinging property, thus becomes less messy. My face feels truly soft and smooth once removed. I don&#x27;t even feel that I need to add additional moisturizers,one washed off, but I do. I&#x27;ve recently retired so I have more time to pamper myself and I will continue using this seaweed powder. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I used as a body mask with plastic wrap. Hopped in the shower after and it rinsed off cleanly. Was easy to mix and apply</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the container it comes in is so cute! When I first opened it it smelled like matcha powder (green tea), not sure what to expect but I tried it as a face mask and it was very refreshing! I eyeballed the mixture so i had some left and used it as a scrub on my arms. I think the caffeine is what you feel as a slight cooling tingle but overall the smell is not distinct or overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review after using it a few more times.</li>
            <li> Stains easily, Used once and threw away, put the mask on, does not work.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great mask. I REALLY love it, and it worked. I used to have black heads on my face and after using this  my face now looked smooth and blackhead free. Yes Yes, it does work. I recommend you to buy this product. IFit worked for me why not you? You should get while its still in stock, and its a great deal. So go on and get this Mask. I enjoy waking up to a sn&#x3D;motth face.</li>
            <li> In love with it! First time trying powder seaweed mask ! Hands down love it! It also smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and notice that it didn&#x27;t break me out like other masks do so.&lt;br /&gt;Will deff be recommending it to friends and family .</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face, but not too sure about it reducing cellulite. Make sure your evening is free as there is prep time involved with using this product.</li>
            <li> Is this supposed to help with little wrinkles like on the forehead? Idk if it claims or states that it is but after my first use there is a tad difference. I am also unsure if it was my lotion( st ives body lotion) that I used. I will be trying this a couple times a week to confirm this but I feel like my forehead isn&#x27;t wrinkling as much. To be honest I have never tried a spa quality mask so I have no idea if this is how this supposed to feel and smell. I smell like I have sea weed all over my face hehe but hey if it helps my face in any way that&#x27;s alright with me. Also the directions on the package are extremely hard to read so go to the website that it suggests on the pack. Do not use 1/4 cup if it&#x27;s going to be just for your face, I wasted 75% of the mixture because I only used it on my face. Next time I do the facial I am going to use only 2 tablespoons of the powder and mix the wet ingredients accordingly. Also If you are going to use it on your body, 2-3 tablespoons of water/ oil is not enough! Maybe if using 2-3 tablespoons of both water and oil each otherwise you might have a hard time mixing and applying to your skin!! Well, I had problems because it was like clay instead of mud so I had to add more water. This powder will last a very long time since you add the wet ingredients separate.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell like most masks do. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff - I tried first helping before bodywraps supplies has arrived - still made me sweat!!- smooth out skin and a notice of improvement  on celluite - smoothes skin out- can&#x27;t weight to try it out with bodywrap!!!!- I mixed mine with water and 100% white aloe alcohol free that I got from walmart- I also bought a $4 blanket to wrap myself in once I get the bodywrap supplies - this stuff  is awesome!!!!!- only downside is very messy- you will want to put stuff on body in bathroom- but cleaning up bathroom beats paying day spa $150-$300!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My pores and skin love this stuff. I mixed 1/2 tablespoon of the seaweed mask with 1 1/2 tablespoons of water, a couple drops of lemon essential oil (to help minimize the seaweed smell) and about 6 drops of Tamanu oil, then BAM! Happy pores!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this stuff six stars, because it has made my skin so soft, and clear, and I just love it.  It was super gentle on my psoriasis, too.</li>
            <li> I love this seaweed mask its amazing. thanks amazon</li>
            <li> This stuff works good. You have to mix it with water and oil, till it becomes like mud. You leave it on then wrap skin in cellophane. then rinse. It&#x27;s a bit of a process, but your skin will look amazing.</li>
            <li> The powder is hard to mix with the water.  The mask end up with lots of crumb.  It dried my skin and acne a little bit, and couple white head comes out the next day after I used it the night before</li>
            <li> Its a little bit harder to use than an premix mask but still does the job</li>
            <li> This is a professional grade sea weed wrap that deserves five stars, but I can&#x27;t give it a five for two reasons. First, the packaging is nice enough, but it&#x27;s hard to read the instructions on the bottle. I don&#x27;t need reading glasses but I was squinting and turning the bottle trying to read the white print on the clear plastic bottle. There werent any paper instructions included. Second, as a vegan I&#x27;m very sensitive to fishy odor but this odor was like dried cuttlefish. It made me gag. It says on the bottle that you can use this mask as a scrub, but due to the smell, I wouldn&#x27;t. Having said that, if you mix the mask with warm water (while wearing a clothespin on your nose), mix it into a paste and apply it to your problem areas with cellulite, then cover the mask with plastic wrap and wait 30 minutes; you can see a marked difference in your skin. Your skin will look radiant and firmer. The price is reasonable especially compared the cost of a seaweed wrap at a salon! You could save hundreds! Depending on the size of the area treated, one container could last multiple times.</li>
            <li> This  powder is great! I was lucky to get a trial from the company and I love how my skin feels now! Really nice! Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my legs! Add some drops of scented oil, and it&#x27;s a great face mask.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and I am still blown away by the results. Once you apply a thin layer (after mixing the powder with some water), the mask begins to dry within a few seconds. Some people complained about the smell, but I did not have any problems with it. After ten minutes, I washed my face with warm water to reveal super smooth, clean skin! I was amazed by the results that I made my mom do it too. She could not believe the results either. Needless to say, both of us are fans of this product now. I have tried others, namely the non-powder ones, and this one is made to last, since it&#x27;s powderized, you have double the amount since you just use your own water to rejuvenate and make it into the cream! I think it&#x27;s a brilliant idea. The caffeine isn&#x27;t extremely noticeable as far as waking you up or anything since it&#x27;s such low dose and your skin is technically the one absorbing it.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  The packaging was very surprisingly cute. I was expecting a small jar or even foil packets but no you recieve and jar full of seaweed powder that can last for quite some time. Very impressed. I have never used something like this before and I feel that it made my skin on my face and neck soft and smooth.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! I am new to the whole face cream/masks/treatment stuff so when I first started looking for these types of things, I wasnt sure what to look for. I have tried a few different facial treatments, all of which were okay, but this was one product that really stood out! I use it for a face mask and really like the way it makes my face feel after... Since using this product my skin seems softer and firmer at the same time. I would recommend at least trying this out if your looking for a new product!</li>
            <li> This mask is a little time consuming but worth it!  Just after one use I can feel an amazing difference in my skin.  Will definitely continue using!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I love it. I have used it one my face as a mask and on my thighs and hips as a wrap. I could tell a noticeable difference after just one use!</li>
