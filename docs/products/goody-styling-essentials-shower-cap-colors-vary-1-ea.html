            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>I have layered shoulder length hair &amp; this is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>so this one is wonderful in comparison.</li>

            <li>and for a good price.</li>
            <li>Elastic holds my hair in good.</li>
            <li>This is as good a shower cap as you&#x27;d ever want to get unless you want one of those cloth-lined ones or ones for wearing to the pool.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>perfect, great value, works very well</li>
            <li>Good price ,.. Love it!</li>

            <li>this is much better!</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, effective, and compact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to get this online through the add-on program.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didnt care about the color, but just a heads up.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li>Still does, for the most part, the job.</li>
            <li>Very comfy and a great buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m wearing it out of the house. :)</li>
            <li>When one clicks on the product for more details, the image changes.</li>
            <li>I could have bought packets with more than one shower cap for slightly more that would have made the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better, for the price</li>
            <li>Most are probably feminine designs.</li>
            <li>You know the kind that can even go over your head if you have a huge bun.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, fits my entire head and hair.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re cheap, handy covers for my leather bicycle seat.</li>
            <li>They stay on better than plastic bags...</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted something a bit more sturdy and permanent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>This shower cap is better than the free ones you get from hotels in that it is a thicker, more durable material.  </li>
            <li>It was a good purchase for the money, doesn&#x27;t hold the hair very well and there is a hold in the plastic.  </li>
            <li>Very poofy and made from a good quality material.</li>
            <li>Yes, it works fine.</li>
            <li>When my shoulder length hair grows, it will no longer fit.</li>
            <li>they must have found it useful or they wouldn&#x27;t have used it more than once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought cheap shower caps before that hardly fit my head, never mind covered my hair.  </li>
            <li>THIS ONE FIT</li>
            <li>I had been using the free ones given in hotels.....</li>
            <li>Good so far.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s your standard every day good for most shower cap.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable, good for travel, and they come in different colors.</li>
            <li>It has a nice piece of elastic that stays tight and the cap portion is nice and full.</li>
            <li>you need a shower cap that is large make sure it is advertised as Very Large.</li>
            <li>Im able to do a high bun and have it cover it without a problem.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit very snug.  </li>
            <li>Not an exciting item, but</li>
            <li>worth the price anyday</li>
            <li>This shower cap is worth</li>
            <li>Might have preferred a less bright color, but that was not a choice.</li>
            <li>Also good for travel since it takes up little space.</li>
            <li>I also find that they do repel water pretty well when you&#x27;re in the shower.</li>
            <li>It smelled funny.</li>
            <li>THE BILL DID EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It kind of smells odd, but I&#x27;m pretty senstive to smells</li>
            <li>It came in hot pink and it is form fitting around the face.</li>
            <li>I think this regular-size shower cap can meet up the expectation of a large number of customers.</li>
            <li>In all, it certainly suits my expectation.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a large head.</li>
            <li>I have very long and thick hair, and it holds my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>a terry lined plastic very large shower cap to fit my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I have looked for an oversize shower cap and this one really fit the bill at a terrific cost.  </li>
            <li>This shower cap would be fantastic if you are Andre the Giant or Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a shower cap, but who wants to go out in traffic for a shower cap?  </li>
            <li>It is misleading and very</li>
            <li>The elastic has held up very well - I can&#x27;t see or feel a change since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Cute pink polka dots.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use this shower cap but it wasn&#x27;t what I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I find the shower cap to be very roomy.  </li>
            <li>Good quality shower cap with thick plastic and durable elastic that fits snugly.</li>
            <li>It fits better than my previous one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t test it for water, and mainly I use it while cooking to protect my hair from the smoke of cooking.</li>
            <li>This is a decent shower cap.</li>
            <li>Decent quality but not</li>
            <li>In a word, it sucks in many ways!</li>
            <li>High quality shower cap.</li>
            <li>and I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Good product.. material is thick enough</li>
            <li>Overall its good for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it under the water, but I doubt if many shower caps if any are water proof in that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower cap has plenty of room for my long hair that is in a loose bun while I shower.  </li>
            <li>I hope it lasts a while, but if not, at least it is inexpensive and easy to replace!</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure what color the cap would come in, but it was pink with purple and pink polka dots.</li>
            <li>Vinyl odor nearly knocked me out when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shower cap, thick and large enough to keep your hair from getting wet, that&#x27;s what shower caps are for!</li>
            <li>I am not sure what I expected from a shower cap but certainly feel the price was right and the quality is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I received the pink one and the color is pretty.  </li>
            <li>i have thick, curly hair which I would like to only wash every other day, because people on the internet tell me it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li>My old saggy-but-lined shower cap just came out of the trash and is back in action.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to stuff my long hair into and the elastic stays put.</li>
            <li>I generally keep my head out of the water, but the cap serves to protect from humidity/moisture.  </li>
            <li>Also kind of difficult to put on your head with all your hair in it.</li>
            <li>Feel a little silly wearing this in the shower, but it keeps my flat ironed hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>The image on the left misleads one to believe that the packet consists of 3 shower caps - a blue, light pink, and dark pink one.</li>

            <li> Some other reviewers complained that it was not large enough, but it seems huge to me!</li>
            <li> Big enough to put long hair up in a clip and then slip on cap.</li>
            <li> Also, the product didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if the elastic will hold up, but it seems like it will.  </li>
            <li> Mine is pink with blue polka-dots, so it&#x27;s a little loud in style, but</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It stays on, covers my very long hair and keeps it completely dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair dry with no problems.</li>
            <li> Pretty average shower cap to say the least.</li>
            <li> where you know your hair is not getting wet</li>
            <li> My wife has no complaints, she has a lot of hair and it all fits in there without getting wet.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Do like the pink color</li>
            <li> Because they come in pink and polka dots.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair or a bouffant style this is not really going to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed and recommend nobody else buying this product any more.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely on the small side and will flatten your hair</li>
            <li> knew this would be quality due to the Goody name.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have a big head or thick hair, but this is a small cap, and the elastic barely holds anything in.</li>
            <li> However, I am an average sized person with an average sized head in a hotel room with wet hair.  </li>
            <li> In the picture, it shows at least three caps, because I saw the same set (as in the picture)in Kroger and there are three in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered because it&#x27;s not worth returning them.</li>
            <li> Not worth $5.00 but not worth returning.</li>
            <li> I am 5ft 1 with thick hair halfway down my back and it fits snug on my head and covers all my hair.</li>
            <li> The elastic fights snugly but not so tight</li>
            <li> covers all my hair, and is not too tight.</li>
            <li> Tooooooooo much trouble.</li>
            <li> I keep a few in my cycling bag...</li>
            <li> I purchased a few to put in the guest bath.</li>
            <li> The elastic holding it on is very tight and it pops off my head in the shower.  </li>
            <li> it works as advertised, and I was unable to find one in a local store.</li>
            <li> Usually like Goody products</li>
            <li> but I found that it was rather small</li>
            <li> I do have a small head though.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but has an awful plastic smell I can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> You get a random color/design, mine was pink polka dots.</li>
            <li> this cap fits all of my thick horsey head hair.</li>

            <li> It was a good purchase for the money, doesn&#x27;t hold the hair very well and there is a hold in the plastic.  Still does, for the most part, the job.</li>
            <li> There is an inch-long slit in the crown of the cap which renders the cap useless because water gets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with packaging or delivery, etc., just the hole in the cap.</li>
            <li> Product was received in perfect condition. It has a nice piece of elastic that stays tight and the cap portion is nice and full.</li>
            <li> I have looked for an oversize shower cap and this one really fit the bill at a terrific cost.  I would recommend totally.</li>
            <li> Good quality shower cap with thick plastic and durable elastic that fits snugly. I have very long hair and it fits all of it perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap that works for me.  Not fancy, but very simple and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Good product.. material is thick enough where you know your hair is not getting wet</li>
            <li> I recently received this shower cap.  The quality was terrible.  It was thin plastic and not as bouffant as I had hoped it would be.  I was very disappointed.  I wanted preferably a terry lined plastic very large shower cap to fit my long hair.  That is what I thought I was ordering.  Not good.</li>
            <li> Not an exciting item, but it works as advertised, and I was unable to find one in a local store.</li>
            <li> Very comfy and a great buy.  I received the pink one and the color is pretty.  It fits better than my previous one.</li>
            <li> Good so far. My wife has no complaints, she has a lot of hair and it all fits in there without getting wet. It&#x27;s also the sexiest shower cap she&#x27;s had, so about a 1.2 on a scale of 10.</li>
            <li> The picture of the cap is cheating. In the picture, it shows at least three caps, because I saw the same set (as in the picture)in Kroger and there are three in it. However, the one I received has a totally different appearance as in the picture. There is only one cap in it. 9 dollars for one cap I must say it&#x27;s definitely cheating.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, in kroger, the three-set package is only sold at $4/pack. It&#x27;s robbery! I&#x27;m really disappointed and recommend nobody else buying this product any more.Worst of all, it smells like the hell. I couldn&#x27;t imagine what my hairs would smell like after I show with this cap on. In a word, it sucks in many ways!</li>
            <li> Works great, covers all my hair on days I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> perfect, great value, works very well</li>
            <li> Works fine, but has an awful plastic smell I can&#x27;t get rid of. Also kind of difficult to put on your head with all your hair in it.</li>
            <li> The shower cap serves it&#x27;s purpose. I am 5ft 1 with thick hair halfway down my back and it fits snug on my head and covers all my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> This shower cap would be fantastic if you are Andre the Giant or Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.  However, I am an average sized person with an average sized head in a hotel room with wet hair.  And my average sized head is very unhappy with this ginormous and ineffective pink shower cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald, but my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap. It keeps my hair dry. That&#x27;s what I needed. Actually, it&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it would be which is a plus because sometimes I take showers with rollers in my hair and the cap fits over the rollers. Added bonus!</li>
            <li> This shower cap is NOT bouffant and lets water in.  Usually like Goody products but this one definitely sucks !</li>
            <li> The cap is made well but it runs very small. When my shoulder length hair grows, it will no longer fit.</li>
            <li> i have thick, curly hair which I would like to only wash every other day, because people on the internet tell me it&#x27;s a good idea. this cap fits all of my thick horsey head hair. and for a good price. and i didnt have to put on pants to purchase it. win win.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping the two I ordered because it&#x27;s not worth returning them. Tooooooooo much trouble. But there is no terrycloth lining inside this cap. My old saggy-but-lined shower cap just came out of the trash and is back in action.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Do like the pink color The cap is just one step up than the shower cap in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> Feel a little silly wearing this in the shower, but it keeps my flat ironed hair looking great.  It is a throw back to another time, but still does the trick.  Might have preferred a less bright color, but that was not a choice.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, effective, and compact. I use this after working out so I don&#x27;t have to deal with drying my hair. It keeps my hair dry with no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to get this online through the add-on program.  It&#x27;s just a shower cap, but who wants to go out in traffic for a shower cap?  Since I repeatedly forgot to pick one up when I was in a store, or, when it was on my list I found the store didn&#x27;t carry shower caps, I searched Amazon.  It works.</li>
            <li> Watch out! The picture shows a pack of three. It is misleading and very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Ironically this picture changed on the day I received my order</li>
            <li> I think this regular-size shower cap can meet up the expectation of a large number of customers. I didn&#x27;t test it for water, and mainly I use it while cooking to protect my hair from the smoke of cooking. I have very long and thick hair, and it holds my hair perfectly. In all, it certainly suits my expectation.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure what color the cap would come in, but it was pink with purple and pink polka dots. I honestly didnt care about the color, but just a heads up. It kind of smells odd, but I&#x27;m pretty senstive to smells and I can live with it. I sprayed it with perfume and it seems tolerable. Overall its good for people with thick hair. Im able to do a high bun and have it cover it without a problem. Pretty average shower cap to say the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap without holes. Awesome.</li>
            <li> nothing special but I needed it, wont pay over 4 bucks for a darn shower cap. worth the price anyday</li>
            <li> Very poofy and made from a good quality material. Mine is pink with blue polka-dots, so it&#x27;s a little loud in style, but hey who cares? It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m wearing it out of the house. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap!!!  What else can I say!</li>
            <li> I have had this for a while now and use it every night for my shower before bedtime.  The elastic has held up very well - I can&#x27;t see or feel a change since I started using it.  I am not sure what I expected from a shower cap but certainly feel the price was right and the quality is more than I expected.  I will probably have and use this for the next decade.</li>
            <li> I have layered shoulder length hair &amp; this is the perfect size. Cute pink polka dots.  Elastic holds my hair in good. I would recommend this cap.</li>
            <li> Ad not the same as advertised.  Felt ripped off.</li>
            <li> Goody makes very good quality shower caps and this one is exception. Enusre to purchase the size you require.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a shower cap that is large make sure it is advertised as Very Large.</li>
            <li> This says that it&#x27;s a bouffant but I found that it was rather small and I don&#x27;t have a large head. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s considered a bouffant, it&#x27;s definitely on the small side and will flatten your hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable, good for travel, and they come in different colors. I also find that they do repel water pretty well when you&#x27;re in the shower. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap.  It works.  Some other reviewers complained that it was not large enough, but it seems huge to me!</li>
            <li> High quality shower cap. Does have that plastic fringe around the elastic at the face but doesn&#x27;t bother me. World order again.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is worth it&#x27;s money. It will probably last for about 6 months, but it&#x27;s durable and does the deed.</li>
            <li> The image on the left misleads one to believe that the packet consists of 3 shower caps - a blue, light pink, and dark pink one. When one clicks on the product for more details, the image changes. I dont appreciate marketing deception. I could have bought packets with more than one shower cap for slightly more that would have made the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better, for the price it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap. Yes, it works fine.</li>
            <li> It smelled funny. Also, the product didn&#x27;t last long at all. It had a cut on one side and after using it 5-6 times, the cut started widening. Within a couple of weeks, the cap became useless.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I have been looking for a proper shower cap. But every where I have looked has only sold multiple packs of shower caps some 3 others 6 per pack and all of them worthless.&lt;br /&gt;I knew this would be quality due to the Goody name. It came in hot pink and it is form fitting around the face. Which is necessary to keep water out. Big enough to put long hair up in a clip and then slip on cap.</li>
            <li> Vinyl odor nearly knocked me out when I opened the package. Gave me a headache. It went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I like this shower cap...it has worked out quite well for me.  I had been using one I saved from a hotel so this one is wonderful in comparison. It stays on, covers my very long hair and keeps it completely dry. I have noticed that my daughters borrow it sometimes too...they must have found it useful or they wouldn&#x27;t have used it more than once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shower cap, thick and large enough to keep your hair from getting wet, that&#x27;s what shower caps are for! You get a random color/design, mine was pink polka dots. Most are probably feminine designs. This is as good a shower cap as you&#x27;d ever want to get unless you want one of those cloth-lined ones or ones for wearing to the pool.</li>
            <li> yes, finally one big enough for all my hair!&lt;br /&gt;good grief I had to go through so many to find this perfect one. will buy more!</li>
            <li> This gets the job done but I was hoping for that jumbo shower cap.  You know the kind that can even go over your head if you have a huge bun. That&#x27;s not this. But it&#x27;s your standard every day good for most shower cap.</li>
            <li> Works fine, excellent price.</li>
            <li> It is a shower cap, inexpensive and serves its purpose.  The elastic fights snugly but not so tight it comes off.  Also good for travel since it takes up little space.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this shower cap but it wasn&#x27;t what I had expected.  The elastic holding it on is very tight and it pops off my head in the shower.  Also the edges of the shower cap are jagged around my face-they are unfinished, which is quite scratchy on my face and around my hairline.  This shower cap is usable, but not comfy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought cheap shower caps before that hardly fit my head, never mind covered my hair.  They would also leave marks on my scalp.  This product fits well, and is snug without leaving lines.</li>
            <li> NEEDED A SHOWER SAW THIS ONE FIT THE BILL DID EXACTLY AS ADVERISED KEPT THE WATER OFF MY HAIR AND SAVED MY DO</li>
            <li> Perfect size, fits my entire head and hair. I had been using the free ones given in hotels.....this is much better!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t use these as shower caps... but they&#x27;re cheap, handy covers for my leather bicycle seat. Because they come in pink and polka dots. I keep a few in my cycling bag... and if it looks like rain I pop one on. They stay on better than plastic bags... and there&#x27;s enough airflow between the cap and seat, unlike purpose-made bicycle seat covers, that you can leave it on your bicycle while it&#x27;s in storage without worrying about your seat getting funky underneath.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shower cap. It&#x27;s large enough to stuff my long hair into and the elastic stays put. I purchased a few to put in the guest bath.</li>
            <li> Good price ,.. Love it!</li>
            <li> covers all my hair, and is not too tight.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have a big head or thick hair, but this is a small cap, and the elastic barely holds anything in. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Leaks.  Doesn&#x27;t fit very snug.  My hair is to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but I do shower every day.  I had been using disposable shower caps to cover my hair as I showered.  I decided I wanted something a bit more sturdy and permanent.  I bought this and am very pleased with it.  I should note that I do NOT let the water pour over my head.  I generally keep my head out of the water, but the cap serves to protect from humidity/moisture.  I have not tried it under the water, but I doubt if many shower caps if any are water proof in that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower cap has plenty of room for my long hair that is in a loose bun while I shower.  I find the shower cap to be very roomy.  I do have a small head though.</li>
            <li> Decent quality but not what I would call \\&quot;bouffant\\&quot;. Basically a regular size shower cap maybe a tiny drop bigger. If you have a lot of hair or a bouffant style this is not really going to do the job. Not worth $5.00 but not worth returning.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is better than the free ones you get from hotels in that it is a thicker, more durable material.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if the elastic will hold up, but it seems like it will.  I was sort of hoping it would have a fabric lining, like a lot of shower caps have, but it does not.  It is essentially a vinyl cap with elastic.  I hope it lasts a while, but if not, at least it is inexpensive and easy to replace!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Good quality.</li>
