            <li> Received it to review and actually had my daughter try this as her lashes are very sparse and thin.</li>
            <li> Lashes are not going to be as long as false lashes, but the do get very dense.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, but I&#x27;m careful not to get it in my eyes either.</li>
            <li> eyelashes grew about a inch, though it was difficult to tell because my eyelashes do not naturally curl, but instead grew straight out so no one could tell that i even had eyelashes to begin with.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> because at least it helped me gauge the growth progress overall, by the end of the month i could tell that&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now.</li>
            <li> While I see slight changes in my lashes, they have not been drastic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there is slight &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; when you close the lid, which to me signals there is a tight seal.</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancement serum is what I like to call a little miracle in a tube.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really sure why.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different Eyelash Growth serums in the past and have always been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results within 2 weeks even though the company suggests to give it at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> Guess i&#x27;ll need to purchase some now as she is afraid that if she stops using this product, her lashes will go back to the way they were.</li>
            <li> and I see some slow growth.</li>
            <li> I  am disappointed in the product.</li>

            <li> This serum comes in a .24 oz container of serum and it is applied like mascara. I love that is is easily applied and I had no irritation after applying it. I noticed minimal improvement in thickness after just a few uses and more thickness after each application. I also used on eyebrows and noticed thickening of sparse eyebrow hairs. I would defiantly recommend this product for thickening and lengthening of eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got this at a discounted price for my honest review*</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different Eyelash Growth serums in the past and have always been disappointed. This one did not darken my lashes at all but today I noticed they did appear a bit longer. At first I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t remove all my mascara but I checked them in my magnifying mirror and all my mascara was cleaned off. I will continue to use this product and will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Rated at 4 for now.  It&#x27;s been three days now.  So can&#x27;t say much.  I&#x27;m excited though to see results in 30 days.  Will get back then 😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now. While I see slight changes in my lashes, they have not been drastic.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product would lengthen my lashes and fill them out, however all I&#x27;ve noticed is that the serum makes them stronger; as I have not had any shedding of my eyelashes since starting the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I do want to add though, that my eyes burn sometimes after applying...and I&#x27;m not really sure why.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month I can not see any difference in the length of my eye lashes. I  am disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It is so easy to apply. You apply on your lid like you would a eye liner. I&#x27;ve been using for a while now and I swear it is working. My lashes seem more full and thicker. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, but I&#x27;m careful not to get it in my eyes either. It comes in a tube like mascara but with a lining tip. It&#x27;s like a orange-ish brown color. And it goes on clear. Really easy and beneficial!</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancement serum is what I like to call a little miracle in a tube. I started seeing results within 2 weeks even though the company suggests to give it at least 30 days. Within 2 weeks I started seeing new lashes growing in (the ones I lost during my pregnancy) and my lashes look noticeably thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply this serum just like you would a liquid eyeliner right on the line of your lashes. Its super easy to apply and the serum in clear. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never doubt a product again since using this serum..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works yet, it&#x27;s only been a week.  However, if you get it in your eyes, it really burns.  I&#x27;ve used LilLash and Babe Lash and neither burned my eyes.  I&#x27;m happy to post later.</li>
            <li> I think it is working I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars if it does</li>
            <li> Still waiting for a lash change</li>
            <li> I only have used this serum for 3 days and my lashes are lengthening! I really see the length with mascara, wow! I originally bought this for my eyebrows and I see some slow growth. However, my lashes are loving this stuff!</li>
            <li> got it for my wife and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Actually worked better than expected, I have tried many types to make my lash&#x27;s look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> apparently it worked since my makeup lady said I had long lower eyelashes and I didn&#x27;t before.  I used for 6 weeks, about, before wedding.  MUCH better and cheaper than trying to get fake eyelashes.  No thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have tiny lashes and the reviews convinced me I&#x27;d get fabulous ones in a few weeks. I liked that the ingredients were listed and none of them have side effects (such as eye color change) as in the prescription lash product. The tube is well-made and substantial....there is slight &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; when you close the lid, which to me signals there is a tight seal. The product goes on easily- like an eyeliner- and dries quickly. Then why the lowered stars? I wake up every morning with itchy, puffy eyes.  Not worth it for me. I knew there would be a risk as I&#x27;m very sensitive though. I&#x27;ll pass it onto one of my more hardy-eyed friends.</li>
            <li> this does not irritated the eyes or burn the eyelid. Put it on and forget it is there. I use it twice a day. I have noticed that by using lash enhancers I never lose eyelashes. Lashes are not going to be as long as false lashes, but the do get very dense.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my lashes really are thicker or its just my hopeful imagination and new mascara. This is an ok product to me I will continue using it to see if the results really are what I hope they will be. I recieved this product dicounted to me.</li>
            <li> I love the look of long and lush lashes but for the most part, I am too lazy to deal with fake lashes. I don&#x27;t have the patience to use them and I lack the expertise to make them look just the way I want them to. I was very happy that I for to try Sieva&#x27;s Eyelash Growth Serum because I love the idea of getting longer lashes permanently! I have used quite a few of Sieva&#x27;s products in the past and I have nothing but good things to say about this brand. I was confident that this product would be as mild and effective as their other products that I have used - and I was not disappointed. It took some time before I posted my review because I wanted to see for myself how this serum works. I am happy to let you all know that with consistent usage, you will get the results that this product promises!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint</li>
            <li> although the start was pretty slow, i did not notice to much of anything until the end of the month came to an end, but that’s okay because i can safely say that this product DOES WORK. at first though i could only see results on my left eyelashes which was okay because at least it helped me gauge the growth progress overall, by the end of the month i could tell that&lt;br /&gt;my eyelashes grew about a inch, though it was difficult to tell because my eyelashes do not naturally curl, but instead grew straight out so no one could tell that i even had eyelashes to begin with. Now you can see my eyelashes although not as prominent its obvious because now you can see the noticeably longer lashes near the outer corners of my eyes, i’m guessing because of the length&lt;br /&gt;they have also decided to curl as well which makes me happy because now you can actually see that i have eyelashes. And on a side note, i did not however notice too much of a change in thickness as i did to the actual length, but i’m sure time will help with this process.&lt;br /&gt;Also although the directions say to apply to the top eyelashes only, i have also used it on my bottom eyelashes as well, and have noticed drastic length in thoes areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;Another note for thoes who do not use eye make-up on a regular basis, you may not be accustom to cleaning your eyelash line, but i recommend learning to do so, because i have noticed after some time that the product can potentially build up, if you keep applying without cleaning your lash lines first.&lt;br /&gt;This for me has caused progress to come slower, especially since dust and such is more likely to stick and build up with it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~I Received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback~</li>
            <li> It really worked! My lashes are thicker and longer. I have used it for 2 weeks. I was hoping for a little more growth but happy and surprised with what I have.</li>
            <li> This is a amazing product. Received it to review and actually had my daughter try this as her lashes are very sparse and thin. She is in heaven. After using this for about a month, her lashes are now fuller and thicker, she puts it on at night so her mascara doesn&#x27;t interfere with it. Applies it right to the lash line then outwards. doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, there is no odor, goes on smoothly. She noticed a difference within a week. Guess i&#x27;ll need to purchase some now as she is afraid that if she stops using this product, her lashes will go back to the way they were. She is finally loving her eyes</li>
