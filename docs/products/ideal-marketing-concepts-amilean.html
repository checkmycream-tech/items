            <li>I Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for about a month, and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve paid even more for wraps and treatments!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>i personally liked the product and asked for another sample.</li>
            <li>cream does contain capsaicin so it gets warm where you apply it</li>
            <li>I massage into my skin for about 30 seconds and it immediately gives me a warm, tingly sensation.  </li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, for the fact that when you do put it on, you can feel the burning feeling as if it is going to work, however, I have not lost inches.  </li>
            <li>The warming in the lotion however is nice and not over powering.</li>
            <li>used this stuff very often and it works magnificently.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO MANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIEND ALIKE, AND THEY WERE ALSO VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRICE, AND RESULTS.  </li>
            <li>I like it and has to be the best by far!</li>
            <li>The AmiLean is the most amazing slimming lotion I have ever use&lt;</li>
            <li>Ok, so let&#x27;s be honest, there is no \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for cellulite...</li>
            <li>A great buy right here!!!!!!!!Love it</li>
            <li>Ian extremely happy with this&#x27;s product, worth every penny and more:)</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Best used when doing cardio, in my opinion although it says use twice a day i use it only once.</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed seeing the improvements to my physique, the one problem area was my waist.  </li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;Magic</li>
            <li>will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it varies from person to person.</li>
            <li>But acts more like a thermogen.</li>
            <li>Think this is the best product out there for improving texture on your skin....has definitely worked for me.</li>
            <li>Im 20 and have used many creams for my cellulite , nothing seemed to work .</li>
            <li>My tummy is a bit more toned and not too flabby anymore.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This stuff will really smooth our your skin!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal and works really well.  </li>
            <li>I applied it twice a day with a rubber glove used to stimulate circulation and made sure to use pressure into the my problem areas.</li>
            <li>and when I do all my house cleaning, I love the heat I feel in the areas that I aply it.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>should I say areas I want to look better and better</li>
            <li>Using this in my abdominal area has enhanced it even better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Combined with exercise will visibly reduce your cellulite by 80% or more, and inches too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE BODY MASSAGE CREAM.</li>
            <li>It take about 2 months for you to see sure, noticeable results, like most workouts.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and you are sure to see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could have not been more satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and love that you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>Wife loved the smell not so much</li>
            <li>Amilean is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, we are really pleased with the excelent results of constantly using this product.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind diet and exercise play a HUGE role</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the last two years and have seen great results.</li>
            <li>It may not burn &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; but it does smooth out the fat dimples on your legs</li>
            <li>The lotion works best when combined with intense cardio workout and daily scrubbing and exfoliating followed by rich vitamin E cream.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it twice, hoping I would like it better than the first time, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It took 3 month with vigorous cardio and clean eating in addition to the cream.</li>
            <li>All I know so far after first use is the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love it and buy a new bottle before mine is gone!!</li>
            <li>I was using sweet sweat for a while before I decided to use this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Its the no 1 fat burner cream ever it really works alot not just for me for my friends too phenomenal</li>
            <li>so I am hoping it holds true to its name.</li>
            <li>It definitely is tighter, and it looks much better, narrower, and the muscles are more defined.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much more smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>After talking to numerous competitors and hearing so many great reviews, I finally went ahead and ordered it.</li>
            <li>REALLY HEATS THE MUSCLES AND PREPS THEM FOR A STRONG WORKOUT...</li>
            <li>So while I had a pretty toned body, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of my pear-shaped waist, or that my abs were covered by a layer of fat!    </li>
            <li>Yes this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what will happen in another month.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on this product but personally saw nothing out of it... might just work better for certain people.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It is by far the most efective slimming lotion</li>
            <li>This product is worth it if your trying to get those tones arms and legs and abs....</li>
            <li>worth buying</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I just had to for AmiLean.  </li>
            <li>For me, it may be something I use right before the summer every year.    </li>
            <li>yes it will work if you are doing all the right moves and</li>
            <li>My friends laugh at me about how much stuff I order online!  </li>
            <li>the most i can say is it diffently makes you sweat as far as burning the inches used the whole bottle and nothing</li>
            <li>I think I will need more than one bottle to last a months worth of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally seeing better definition in my abs.</li>
            <li>[...]  try the sample first.</li>
            <li>i have some winter weight i gotta get rid of fast!</li>
            <li>but it did seem to make my legs more toned and smoother overall</li>
            <li>I workout out and eat fairly healthy but have always had stubborn cellulite on the back of my thighs/buttocks.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot on the skin, but is not unbearable.  </li>
            <li>I have used it consistently per the directions for just over a month already with no difference.  </li>
            <li>but this has done exactly what it says in a shorter time &amp; it works anywhere</li>
            <li>Finally, I decided to give it a try and glad I did.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to those trying to lose fat, &amp; tighten your body.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I know every body is different, but I excited to have found something that works!  </li>
            <li>It definitely made me sweat more in the applied areas but not that much difference in losing the fat.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a year and my skin is so much more firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>You will really see results fast!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have used AmiLean (in conjunction with a male fat-burning pill called Noxycut), and I have been very pleased with the results both times.    </li>
            <li>, my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not this stuff does work to a certain degree.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t changed much in my diet or exercise routine.  </li>
            <li>the amilean lotion made my butt and thighs sweat so much</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do miracles; that&#x27;s not the intention of the product, however if you are getting ready for a photoshoot</li>
            <li>It really works.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I used it in the morning before my cardio and then again at night for about 4-5 weeks straight.</li>
            <li>Fenomenal it really works</li>
            <li>I hit the gym 6 times a week, cycle 5 days and follow a very strict diet</li>
            <li>As soon as this bottles are empty well order more, without a doublt.</li>
            <li>but, if you are FAT the product will not work as fast as your want.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I dont see any result as effectively as other brand I tried.</li>
            <li>The results are not overnight but being consistent with BID application, within a few weeks, the subcutaneous fat deposits on my abs and love handles are visibly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE THAT&#x27;S OUT THERE</li>
            <li>I had success last year with the combo of AmiLean &amp; Noxycut, so I decided to try it again before this summer.  </li>
            <li>at times pretty intense especially on my stomach.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if they tweaked the ingredients, or if my body just was more used to it this year.    </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone that is willing to also put in the work.</li>
            <li>My legs are more toned , no more cellulite.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually seems to do what it claims which is not surprising as there is some pretty good science backing up the use of aminophyline as a topical slimming agent.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve noticed it during workouts, and have also felt it when I&#x27;ve started a long drive right after I applied it).  </li>
            <li>I love the product,met my needs as stated ,the product does work wonders and you only need a little to apply in the problem areas.</li>
            <li>It takes about a minute or so to massage it in completely.  </li>
            <li>and so far, I&#x27;m n&#x27;t.happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a big difference</li>
            <li>but I guess i am sensitive to an ingredient in it.</li>
            <li>Wow...it really helps especially when used with the gym....</li>
            <li>I put it on right when I wake up, and then early evening (usually a little after dinner).  </li>
            <li>, it was hot outside, i walked a fast paced mile pushing a stroller-as i do everyday-</li>
            <li>No other formulas have the liposomal delivery in them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what &#x27;burn&#x27; other reviewers are talking about when they say they can tell it is working due to the heat it provides, cause the only burn I ever experienced was in my wallet after purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has really worked (or lasted very long)!  </li>
            <li>Feel the burning right away and after a few uses you start to see some results.</li>
            <li>While this is slightly gimmicky, it works if you already are pretty in shape.</li>
            <li>but this really does help you with those little problem areas.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> should I say areas I want to look better and better</li>
            <li> Using this in my abdominal area has enhanced it even better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Combined with exercise will visibly reduce your cellulite by 80% or more, and inches too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE BODY MASSAGE CREAM.</li>
            <li> It take about 2 months for you to see sure, noticeable results, like most workouts.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and you are sure to see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could have not been more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and love that you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> Wife loved the smell not so much</li>
            <li> Amilean is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, we are really pleased with the excelent results of constantly using this product.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind diet and exercise play a HUGE role</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last two years and have seen great results.</li>
            <li> It may not burn &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; but it does smooth out the fat dimples on your legs</li>
            <li> The lotion works best when combined with intense cardio workout and daily scrubbing and exfoliating followed by rich vitamin E cream.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it twice, hoping I would like it better than the first time, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It took 3 month with vigorous cardio and clean eating in addition to the cream.</li>
            <li> All I know so far after first use is the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love it and buy a new bottle before mine is gone!!</li>
            <li> I was using sweet sweat for a while before I decided to use this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Its the no 1 fat burner cream ever it really works alot not just for me for my friends too phenomenal</li>
            <li> so I am hoping it holds true to its name.</li>
            <li> It definitely is tighter, and it looks much better, narrower, and the muscles are more defined.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so much more smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> After talking to numerous competitors and hearing so many great reviews, I finally went ahead and ordered it.</li>
            <li> REALLY HEATS THE MUSCLES AND PREPS THEM FOR A STRONG WORKOUT...</li>
            <li> So while I had a pretty toned body, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of my pear-shaped waist, or that my abs were covered by a layer of fat!    </li>
            <li> Yes this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what will happen in another month.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product but personally saw nothing out of it... might just work better for certain people.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It is by far the most efective slimming lotion</li>
            <li> This product is worth it if your trying to get those tones arms and legs and abs....</li>
            <li> worth buying</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I just had to for AmiLean.  </li>
            <li> For me, it may be something I use right before the summer every year.    </li>
            <li> yes it will work if you are doing all the right moves and</li>
            <li> My friends laugh at me about how much stuff I order online!  </li>
            <li> the most i can say is it diffently makes you sweat as far as burning the inches used the whole bottle and nothing</li>
            <li> I think I will need more than one bottle to last a months worth of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally seeing better definition in my abs.</li>
            <li> [...]  try the sample first.</li>
            <li> i have some winter weight i gotta get rid of fast!</li>
            <li> but it did seem to make my legs more toned and smoother overall</li>
            <li> I workout out and eat fairly healthy but have always had stubborn cellulite on the back of my thighs/buttocks.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot on the skin, but is not unbearable.  </li>
            <li> I have used it consistently per the directions for just over a month already with no difference.  </li>
            <li> but this has done exactly what it says in a shorter time &amp; it works anywhere</li>
            <li> Finally, I decided to give it a try and glad I did.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product to those trying to lose fat, &amp; tighten your body.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I know every body is different, but I excited to have found something that works!  </li>
            <li> It definitely made me sweat more in the applied areas but not that much difference in losing the fat.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a year and my skin is so much more firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> You will really see results fast!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have used AmiLean (in conjunction with a male fat-burning pill called Noxycut), and I have been very pleased with the results both times.    </li>
            <li> , my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not this stuff does work to a certain degree.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed much in my diet or exercise routine.  </li>
            <li> the amilean lotion made my butt and thighs sweat so much</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do miracles; that&#x27;s not the intention of the product, however if you are getting ready for a photoshoot</li>
            <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the morning before my cardio and then again at night for about 4-5 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> Fenomenal it really works</li>
            <li> I hit the gym 6 times a week, cycle 5 days and follow a very strict diet</li>
            <li> As soon as this bottles are empty well order more, without a doublt.</li>
            <li> but, if you are FAT the product will not work as fast as your want.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I dont see any result as effectively as other brand I tried.</li>
            <li> The results are not overnight but being consistent with BID application, within a few weeks, the subcutaneous fat deposits on my abs and love handles are visibly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE THAT&#x27;S OUT THERE</li>
            <li> I had success last year with the combo of AmiLean &amp; Noxycut, so I decided to try it again before this summer.  </li>
            <li> at times pretty intense especially on my stomach.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if they tweaked the ingredients, or if my body just was more used to it this year.    </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone that is willing to also put in the work.</li>
            <li> My legs are more toned , no more cellulite.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually seems to do what it claims which is not surprising as there is some pretty good science backing up the use of aminophyline as a topical slimming agent.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve noticed it during workouts, and have also felt it when I&#x27;ve started a long drive right after I applied it).  </li>
            <li> I love the product,met my needs as stated ,the product does work wonders and you only need a little to apply in the problem areas.</li>
            <li> It takes about a minute or so to massage it in completely.  </li>
            <li> and so far, I&#x27;m n&#x27;t.happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a big difference</li>
            <li> but I guess i am sensitive to an ingredient in it.</li>
            <li> Wow...it really helps especially when used with the gym....</li>
            <li> I put it on right when I wake up, and then early evening (usually a little after dinner).  </li>
            <li> , it was hot outside, i walked a fast paced mile pushing a stroller-as i do everyday-</li>
            <li> No other formulas have the liposomal delivery in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what &#x27;burn&#x27; other reviewers are talking about when they say they can tell it is working due to the heat it provides, cause the only burn I ever experienced was in my wallet after purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has really worked (or lasted very long)!  </li>
            <li> Feel the burning right away and after a few uses you start to see some results.</li>
            <li> While this is slightly gimmicky, it works if you already are pretty in shape.</li>
            <li> but this really does help you with those little problem areas.</li>
            <li> All of those topical creams and such, they&#x27;ll somewhat work, as long as you keep using them...</li>
            <li> I had my left side thigh with minor cellulite and it took it away in two weeks.</li>
            <li> SO FAR LOVING THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;Was a little skeptical as I am towards all of these types of lotions as not easily taken in by a gimmick.</li>
            <li> and you need to be careful to wash your hands thoroughly to avoid getting it in your eyes or other sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results as far as loosing inches and have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Shrinks all over as you loose weight eating well and exercising or after loosing weight.</li>
            <li> They say to simply taper down to one use.  </li>
            <li> I have a similar product for only right before working out that smells bad and turns your skin red.</li>
            <li> I used about half the bottle, so one bottle should last me 2 months.    </li>
            <li> have noticed a slight difference in the last month of using this product</li>
            <li> foods.&lt;br /&gt;i was on a tight diet and a crazy workout schedule for 2.5 months, i added this product mostly for my butt and thighs</li>
            <li> But overall, if you are looking for a little help with your problem areas, I&#x27;d recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just about to turn 40, and I have gotten into fitness the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Have not really used this item to see if it truly works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for any other body part, so</li>
            <li> Lastly, since I&#x27;m a guy, I&#x27;m not sure how well it works on women.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s working the way I want the past several weeks</li>
            <li> I definitely suggest using it for at least 2 weeks before seeing results.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to be straight forward but after reading the reviews I had some hope.</li>
            <li> then i walked down to the park</li>
            <li> i could feel it dripping down my legs.</li>
            <li> Half of the bottle spilled on the box.</li>
            <li> There is a difference, but not super drastic.</li>
            <li> I use this and a scrubber from sephora everyday and can see a noticeable difference in my cellulite in less than a month</li>
            <li> I started to scrath the little bumps on my legs...</li>
            <li> TRYING TO LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT AROUND THE WAIST AREA.  </li>
            <li> I TRIED OTHER BELLY BUSTING PRODUCTS IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> I decided to start training for an NPC bikini competition a few months ago and noticed that the backs of my legs were a little lumpy</li>
            <li> I already workout and expected this to help at least a little in the problem areas after reading the reviews from others.  </li>
            <li> There are a few negatives.  </li>
            <li> My trainer recommended this lotion to help firm up my abs and thighs.</li>
            <li> At night, I apply the cream and massage it in using my anti-cellulite massager (round with bumps).  </li>
            <li> so slimming my midsection is not easy.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money if you&#x27;re not sure about it</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t exercise or eat well, or if you have an excessive amount of fat, it may not work well or at all for you.  </li>
            <li> I used everyday twice a day, as directed and then started to break out in itchy legs!  </li>
            <li> You feel the heat and the burn while working out and definitely helps you hit those difficult target areas.</li>
            <li> But I eat what I want in small portions.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product work or not, I am still using it, but have not seen any result.</li>
            <li> Therefore, anxious to see the results in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> and we have a seen a small difference.</li>
            <li> i mean</li>
            <li> I seriously see a difference with this stuff.</li>
            <li> not a good thing to do as you want to keep scratching and breaking the skin.  </li>
            <li> Arrived busted open :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly thin, but have health problems that cause poor circulation.  </li>
            <li> But considering it should last me 2 months (approximately 120 applications), it isn&#x27;t too awful.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried everything out there.</li>
            <li> in the process of cutting for a bodybuilding show.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this.I use it with my waist sharper.Best used when doing cardio, in my opinion although it says use twice a day i use it only once. It has a warming sensation when you body starts to heat up. I have recommended it to all my work out buddies.</li>
            <li> the most i can say is it diffently makes you sweat as far as burning the inches used the whole bottle and nothing i mean but it varies from person from person however it did do the sweating part</li>
            <li> My experience was one of neutral. I do not intend to use the product again. It definitely made me sweat more in the applied areas but not that much difference in losing the fat. I was already around 7% body fat.</li>
            <li> I felt something when I put it on but it did nothing. My son who works out daily also tried it and it did nothing...</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have used AmiLean (in conjunction with a male fat-burning pill called Noxycut), and I have been very pleased with the results both times.    I&#x27;m just about to turn 40, and I have gotten into fitness the last few years.  While I enjoyed seeing the improvements to my physique, the one problem area was my waist.  All of my fat was going there. So while I had a pretty toned body, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of my pear-shaped waist, or that my abs were covered by a layer of fat!    I had success last year with the combo of AmiLean &amp; Noxycut, so I decided to try it again before this summer.  I haven&#x27;t changed much in my diet or exercise routine.  But in the last 30 days since starting, my fat % dropped 2.5% (based off my Tanita scale), and the widest part of my waist dropped 2 inches. I&#x27;m finally seeing better definition in my abs. I only use it on my waist area.  It definitely is tighter, and it looks much better, narrower, and the muscles are more defined.  I used about half the bottle, so one bottle should last me 2 months.    Amilean is easy to use.  I put it on right when I wake up, and then early evening (usually a little after dinner).  It takes about a minute or so to massage it in completely.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue on your skin. You will sometimes feel the heat generating from it (I&#x27;ve noticed it during workouts, and have also felt it when I&#x27;ve started a long drive right after I applied it).  I thought it felt warmer last year.  So I&#x27;m not sure if they tweaked the ingredients, or if my body just was more used to it this year.    I haven&#x27;t used it for any other body part, so I can&#x27;t say if it works well on legs, butt, hips, arms, etc.  It also isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;Magic Bullet\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s going to help problem areas.  But if you don&#x27;t exercise or eat well, or if you have an excessive amount of fat, it may not work well or at all for you.  Lastly, since I&#x27;m a guy, I&#x27;m not sure how well it works on women.    There are a few negatives.  The bottlecosts about $35, so it&#x27;s not the cheapest item out there.  But considering it should last me 2 months (approximately 120 applications), it isn&#x27;t too awful.  Last year, I had noticed that the fat burning effects seemed to dwindle after using it daily for a couple months.  They say to simply taper down to one use.  For me, it may be something I use right before the summer every year.    But overall, if you are looking for a little help with your problem areas, I&#x27;d recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> [...]  try the sample first. their business hours have changed, 9-3 pacific mon-fri. don&#x27;t waste your money if you&#x27;re not sure about it</li>
            <li> You can fell the fat melting of your body!! is a good feeling after working out.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> Well, I must say this, 2% aminophylline, I don&#x27;t think so. I brought this product thinking that its will work and so far, I&#x27;m n&#x27;t.happy with this product. I saw no improvement. I Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The AmiLean is the most amazing slimming lotion I have ever use&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the most efective slimming lotion</li>
            <li> i got a sample of this. i put it on my butt and back of my thighs and stomach. then i walked down to the park, it was hot outside, i walked a fast paced mile pushing a stroller-as i do everyday- the amilean lotion made my butt and thighs sweat so much i could feel it dripping down my legs. my jean shorts were soaked. i couldnt believe it. i always sweat during good exercise but it was nuts. i felt a bit of a burn from the lotion. at times pretty intense especially on my stomach. i personally liked the product and asked for another sample. i now found it on amazon and placed my order. summer is coming i have some winter weight i gotta get rid of fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I dont see any result as effectively as other brand I tried. I do feel heat after applied. That&#x27;s all I see.</li>
            <li> yes it will work if you are doing all the right moves and foods.&lt;br /&gt;i was on a tight diet and a crazy workout schedule for 2.5 months, i added this product mostly for my butt and thighs but i used it on my belly too, i saw results.</li>
            <li> The product definitely makes you sweat.  I haven&#x27;t seen any results as far as loosing inches and have been using it for a few weeks but I&#x27;m sure it varies from person to person.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually seems to do what it claims which is not surprising as there is some pretty good science backing up the use of aminophyline as a topical slimming agent. The results are not overnight but being consistent with BID application, within a few weeks, the subcutaneous fat deposits on my abs and love handles are visibly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream does contain capsaicin so it gets warm where you apply it and you need to be careful to wash your hands thoroughly to avoid getting it in your eyes or other sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do miracles; that&#x27;s not the intention of the product, however if you are getting ready for a photoshoot and/or competition this stuff is great to rub under a sweat belt and feel the temperature of the skin increase. I&#x27;d reccomend it if you are in your final steps of prepping for something and not as a way of losing weight.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not this stuff does work to a certain degree. Don&#x27;t expect fat to just drip away. doesn&#x27;t happen. But acts more like a thermogen. Heats up underlying fat and when you work out you can feel it heating up.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a big difference but it did seem to make my legs more toned and smoother overall</li>
            <li> in the process of cutting for a bodybuilding show. With the aminophylline in the formula with the liposomal delivery the prodeuct is awesome. No other formulas have the liposomal delivery in them.</li>
            <li> Afetr watch Dr. Oz show, he recomended this cream to reduce Cellulite appearance.  I used everyday twice a day, as directed and then started to break out in itchy legs!  I started to scrath the little bumps on my legs...not a good thing to do as you want to keep scratching and breaking the skin.  I stopped for a couple of days using the cream, and the itchy feeling and rash went away.  Started up again, and it happenned again.  So I have stopped altogether.  Also, I did not see any difference with my cellulite.</li>
            <li> The Amilean lotion is an awesome product.  I have been using it for the last two years and have seen great results. It really works.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving my bottle of Amilean. I even paid extra to expedite it. However, when my package arrived the lid was screwed off. Half of the bottle spilled on the box. I attempted to try out what&#x27;s left in the bottle but the pump doesn&#x27;t work either. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I think this is the BEST cellulite cream ever.  It does what it say and you will feel it working.  I definitely suggest using it for at least 2 weeks before seeing results.  I massage into my skin for about 30 seconds and it immediately gives me a warm, tingly sensation.  I workout out and eat fairly healthy but have always had stubborn cellulite on the back of my thighs/buttocks.  Think this is the best product out there for improving texture on your skin....has definitely worked for me.</li>
            <li> it gave me red itchy bumps when i used it. I liked it but I guess i am sensitive to an ingredient in it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a big difference with the cream. This is my 3rd week on the product twice a day. I have lost centimeters in my waist and an inch pre leg</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use while working out. You feel the heat and the burn while working out and definitely helps you hit those difficult target areas. I definitely recommend this product to anyone that is willing to also put in the work.</li>
            <li> Yes this stuff really works!! I am a bikini competitor for the NPC interviews this for a while for show prep it works great. I&#x27;m also going to use it for my upcoming vacation. This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I think it is already working! It gets hot on the skin, but is not unbearable.  I will definately buy again.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Im 20 and have used many creams for my cellulite , nothing seemed to work . I saw amilean on facebook , someone post it and claimed it would help. I ecided to try it , its been a month now and I have seen a difference in all the areas I apply to. My legs are more toned , no more cellulite. My tummy is a bit more toned and not too flabby anymore. My arms are toned as well. Point is it works for me , and I only walk 30 minutes each day mon-fri, I dont consume soda,chips, ice cream, or candies. I try to drink alot of water. But I eat what I want in small portions. This product works and is awesome , my skin is super soft. A great buy right here!!!!!!!!Love it</li>
            <li> I am sooo impresses with this product, I literally lost 6 inches of my waist in 6.5 weeks. I could not believe it. It does heat up your skin so once you get used to it, it&#x27;s ok. I used it twice a day. I also, stared using it for my inner thighs and I lost 1/2 inches in two weeks. Ian extremely happy with this&#x27;s product, worth every penny and more:)</li>
            <li> Did not do work for me. Tried it twice a day, changed diet habits and exercise and still did not work.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product but personally saw nothing out of it... might just work better for certain people.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product for my son who wrestles and he likes to use this when he works out.  He claims it helps him sweat off the water weight.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really worked for me.  I feel no heat, nothing.  I&#x27;m in shape, workout regularly and have noticed nothing.  I would not order this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff will really smooth our your skin! It may not burn &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; but it does smooth out the fat dimples on your legs</li>
            <li> Love this product. Took two bottles but notice a difference in tummy area. I use morning and evening and results are coming.</li>
            <li> While results are only temporary, it does seem to improve the appearance of my skin . At 70 years of age anything that can improve appearance is welcome</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and works really well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want&#x27;s a great deal at a great price!</li>
            <li> This stuff works but doesn&#x27;t work all by itself. I trained for an npc bikini competition. I had cellulite. I&#x27;m also 39. It took 3 month with vigorous cardio and clean eating in addition to the cream. It helped diminish my cheese and tighten my skin. I used it religiously twice a day for 12 weeks. Great product.</li>
            <li> This item should have a money back guarantee.  I have used it consistently per the directions for just over a month already with no difference.  I already workout and expected this to help at least a little in the problem areas after reading the reviews from others.  I&#x27;m not sure what &#x27;burn&#x27; other reviewers are talking about when they say they can tell it is working due to the heat it provides, cause the only burn I ever experienced was in my wallet after purchasing this product.  Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a slight difference in the last month of using this product</li>
            <li> I was using sweet sweat for a while before I decided to use this lotion.  This product does what it says.  I had my left side thigh with minor cellulite and it took it away in two weeks. I am a mommy of four so slimming my midsection is not easy.  This lotion has started to slim my sides and working on my tummy which is great.  The lotion works best when combined with intense cardio workout and daily scrubbing and exfoliating followed by rich vitamin E cream.  Second time I have bought this cream but I only use it when I workout.</li>
            <li> I love the product,met my needs as stated ,the product does work wonders and you only need a little to apply in the problem areas.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! thank you</li>
            <li> Ok, so let&#x27;s be honest, there is no \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for cellulite... All of those topical creams and such, they&#x27;ll somewhat work, as long as you keep using them... I&#x27;m an esthetician by trade and have done and have learned about every cellulite treatment out there. Believe me when I say, it is a million-dollar industry. I decided to start training for an NPC bikini competition a few months ago and noticed that the backs of my legs were a little lumpy and I&#x27;ve always struggled with lower back fat... After talking to numerous competitors and hearing so many great reviews, I finally went ahead and ordered it. I was really skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried everything out there. I applied it twice a day with a rubber glove used to stimulate circulation and made sure to use pressure into the my problem areas. I used it in the morning before my cardio and then again at night for about 4-5 weeks straight. I did see a noticeable enough difference in that period of time that I am now ordering my second bottle and will continue to re-order it because it does actually seem to work. Keep in mind diet and exercise play a HUGE role but this really does help you with those little problem areas.</li>
            <li> This product is worth it if your trying to get those tones arms and legs and abs....twice a day and workout of course and you will see it.</li>
            <li> The best reducing &amp; firming lotion out there worth buying I had four kids &amp; had lost my shape after having kids  &amp; im one to try everything &amp; this gave me my body back its like lipo in a bottle but u must be cconsistent &amp; patient everything takes time but this has done exactly what it says in a shorter time &amp; it works anywhere</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I used every day before work out and when I do all my house cleaning, I love the heat I feel in the areas that I aply it.  it make me sweat a lot.  This the second bottle I have purchase in the last couple months</li>
            <li> Fenomenal it really works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  I use it before I work out and I am amazed at this product. Feel the burning right away and after a few uses you start to see some results. It recommends twice a day but I apply it once a day before I do housework, go for a run, or go to the gym. I love it....</li>
            <li> While this is slightly gimmicky, it works if you already are pretty in shape. It was recommended to me by a couple of friends to help tighten and diminish those cellulite bits. It worked, I guess. There is a difference, but not super drastic. And it is definitely not a fat burner, just meant to tighten a bit.</li>
            <li> Its the no 1 fat burner cream ever it really works alot not just for me for my friends too phenomenal</li>
            <li> I liked the product, for the fact that when you do put it on, you can feel the burning feeling as if it is going to work, however, I have not lost inches.  Not sure if this product work or not, I am still using it, but have not seen any result.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> SO FAR LOVING THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;Was a little skeptical as I am towards all of these types of lotions as not easily taken in by a gimmick. However, in only 3 days its working for me using it faithfully (morning and night) Therefore, anxious to see the results in a couple of weeks. I was recommended this by a friend who&#x27;s a bikini athlete/model who swore by it. Finally, I decided to give it a try and glad I did. I&#x27;m in great shape already. I hit the gym 6 times a week, cycle 5 days and follow a very strict diet but there are just some areas that challenge me or should I say areas I want to look better and better, Enough is just not enough! Using this in my abdominal area has enhanced it even better. Very pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. Feel a warming sensation when applying generously, if used sparingly feels like regular lotion. The warming in the lotion however is nice and not over powering. I like it and has to be the best by far! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!!! I can feel the heat as it starts to work. I use it on a daily while I sleep &amp; also during my workouts. This product has helped me tighten &amp; tone my body for my bikini competition. I would most definitely recommend this product to those trying to lose fat, &amp; tighten your body.</li>
            <li> Twice a day to achieve result, then once a day ...or so to maintain it. Firms and takes away appearance of celulite. Shrinks all over as you loose weight eating well and exercising or after loosing weight. Love it!</li>
            <li> Wow...it really helps especially when used with the gym....you sweat with this protect so you feel the fat melt away...Thanks!</li>
            <li> Arrived busted open :(</li>
            <li> I seriously see a difference with this stuff. I love it. I have been using it for a year and my skin is so much more firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> You will really see results fast! Combined with exercise will visibly reduce your cellulite by 80% or more, and inches too. Smoother look in just a couple of days!!! I love it and buy a new bottle before mine is gone!!</li>
            <li> I Love this product! It Burns Away the fat! I guarantee Great results! I&#x27;m about to make my second order!</li>
            <li> i LOVED THIS PRODUCT.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE THAT&#x27;S OUT THERE TRYING TO LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT AROUND THE WAIST AREA.  PRICE WAS ALSO RESONABLE.  IF PRICE STAYS AS IS, I&#x27;LL DEFINATELY PURCHASE IT AGAIN.  I RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO MANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIEND ALIKE, AND THEY WERE ALSO VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRICE, AND RESULTS.  I TRIED OTHER BELLY BUSTING PRODUCTS IN THE PAST THAT DID NOT WORK AT ALL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s working the way I want the past several weeks but I still have time to see if it does</li>
            <li> After using this product  for months I did not see a change at all in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer...because it made my skin feel good, BUT did not notices after (3) weeeks of applying after instructed in directions :_(((</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for about a month, and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  I&#x27;m fairly thin, but have health problems that cause poor circulation.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for this problem.  I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what will happen in another month.</li>
            <li> WILL DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife after hearing fron a friend. She loves that feeling that its working and we have a seen a small difference. We will definitely buy another to fully see if it did what we think its doing.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps me heat up during cardio. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Have not really used this item to see if it truly works. I hear great things about it so I am hoping it holds true to its name.</li>
            <li> very good product&lt;br /&gt;i used it for fat burn , i have a lot of fat and i lose 7 killos</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE BODY MASSAGE CREAM. REALLY HEATS THE MUSCLES AND PREPS THEM FOR A STRONG WORKOUT...use it EVERY leg/glute day!</li>
            <li> Great product, we are really pleased with the excelent results of constantly using this product. As soon as this bottles are empty well order more, without a doublt.</li>
            <li> This stuff truly works wonders. Pair it with a belly band to sweat in and go work out or even use it for just around the house. I had twins 16 months ago and I&#x27;m size 1.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff rocks</li>
            <li> I use amilene quite often and it is a product I will continue to buy. It has become a part of my daily workout prep.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and had been worried about it stinking like a medicine smell... Similar to bengay. I have a similar product for only right before working out that smells bad and turns your skin red. All I know so far after first use is the smell is pleasant. Yay! I don&#x27;t think I feel burning. But there is a cooling effect after my run. I think I will need more than one bottle to last a months worth of use.</li>
            <li> Sorry to be straight forward but after reading the reviews I had some hope. When people&lt;br /&gt;write great if you want to tighten up for competitions, what this means is if you have a washboard&lt;br /&gt;stomach and want to show more definition then this cream MIGHT help. Yes it warms up and yes it tingles&lt;br /&gt;but if you have some fat around your abs this will not make it go away and give you definition. Save your money&lt;br /&gt;and time.</li>
            <li> Not to offend anyone but, if you are FAT the product will not work as fast as your want. It take about 2 months for you to see sure, noticeable results, like most workouts. This product is intended to be used with diet and exercise. Follow the instructions and you are sure to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff very often and it works magnificently. I could have not been more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ordered it twice, hoping I would like it better than the first time, but I didn&#x27;t. Didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference,</li>
            <li> My trainer recommended this lotion to help firm up my abs and thighs. I use it twice a day and love that you can feel it working. I use this and a scrubber from sephora everyday and can see a noticeable difference in my cellulite in less than a month</li>
            <li> My friends laugh at me about how much stuff I order online!  I rarely write reviews, but I just had to for AmiLean.  I have tried just about every cellulite cream out there over the last 5 years.  I&#x27;ve paid up to $125 for a bottle and I&#x27;ve paid even more for wraps and treatments!  Nothing has really worked (or lasted very long)!  Then, I read about AmiLean and decided to give it one last try and I&#x27;ve had amazing results!  After only 2 weeks of applying it in the morning and again at night, I have lost an inch around my waist and another inch around my thighs!  My skin looks so much more smooth and soft.  At night, I apply the cream and massage it in using my anti-cellulite massager (round with bumps).  I&#x27;m not doing anything different with my regular diet and exercise program either.  I know every body is different, but I excited to have found something that works!  I&#x27;d recommend it! And no, I have nothing to do with the company and no one is paying me for this review!  LoL</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It was recommended by my trainer and I ordered it from Ideal Marketing Concepts.  They were great to work with.  Shipped fast and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Wife loved the smell not so much</li>
