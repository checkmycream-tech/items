            <li>this amazing hair.</li>
            <li>I think that at best the hair can be added to the ends of natural hair to extend the length.</li>
            <li>The Kanekelon seems to look better than this  </li>
            <li>Much better priced than purchasing in store.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair thinking that I would be able to use it to do kinky twists.</li>

            <li>Good quality and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It was easy to separate sections off for use.</li>
            <li>Good quality bur u really need to know how to use product.just like your real hair</li>
            <li>So it s a good synthetic kinky bulk but not a 100% human hair kinky bulk.</li>
            <li>so now im stuck with a full head of blk hair with spotted pieces of brown.</li>
            <li>I am currently wearing it in twists, and I am very satisfied.  </li>

            <li>Hair is very soft matches my hair perfectly light weight and natural</li>
            <li>Also, it  blends very well with coily/kinky hair textures.</li>
            <li>On me it looks so real that&lt;</li>
            <li>I get compliments, and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair.  </li>
            <li>so there really isn&#x27;t any length per se</li>
            <li>Espically, If your looking for a natural n&#x27; real look.</li>
            <li>It also washes well, and is soft to the touch.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I think the description should be changed because it is written on the box: 100 % Human Hair QUALITY. So it s a good synthetic kinky bulk but not a 100% human hair kinky bulk.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Good quality...this was used to thicken someone&#x27;s dreadlocs size and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Great hair !!! My beautician actually loved working with it (she would like the mixed grey) If possible could you add salt and pepper to your line?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks....</li>
            <li> Just like the Lord &amp; Cliff brand, it was shorter in some areas than the rest. I was not happy with this brand. I will stick to the afro kinky hair that is made out of Kanekelon. The Kanekelon seems to look better than this  \\&quot;100% human kinky hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Hair is very soft matches my hair perfectly light weight and natural</li>
            <li> I L-O-V-E this amazing hair. I have 4C Type hair very thick n&#x27; coily. I am in the process of growing out a bad haircut. I stumbled over this product a year ago looking for hair that would perfectly match my hair texture. This hair is absolutely perfect for kinky twist, twist outs, braiding. Espically, If your looking for a natural n&#x27; real look. Also, it  blends very well with coily/kinky hair textures. On me it looks so real that&lt;br /&gt;no one ever knows I&#x27;m wearing a weave, and I&lt;br /&gt;get countless compliments. My little secret ;)</li>
            <li> Perfect for loc extensions.. the color 2 hair feels a lot more natural than the color 1b hair.</li>
            <li> I bought ten packages of this hair to use for chest-length dreadlock extensions. I only needed six. My stylist said it was the best hair she had ever used! The texture is great, and matches my kinky 4c hair perfectly. No one will ever know they are extensions!</li>
            <li> Despite what some reviews might have said, this hair is very good!! I am currently wearing it in twists, and I am very satisfied.  I get compliments, and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair.  It also washes well, and is soft to the touch.  I would definitely buy again.  Yes, there are some strands which seem &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34;, but I just pull those out, and keep going.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Good quality bur u really need to know how to use product.just like your real hair</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery and easy to braid with</li>
            <li> This product gets one star only because the color was correct but it wasn&#x27;t 100% human hair -- there were several pieces of some type of wire mixed in the bulk hair...and I didn&#x27;t know it at the time but bulk hair is really hard to use for natural hair twist styles.</li>
            <li> Much better priced than purchasing in store. Good quality and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair thinking that I would be able to use it to do kinky twists. Boy, was I wrong ! The \\&quot;sections\\&quot; of the hair do not consist of continuous strands so there really isn&#x27;t any length per se. I think that at best the hair can be added to the ends of natural hair to extend the length. When I returned the items, the vendor (Hair Closet) applied a 15% restocking fee to my purchase. This fee was not stated anywhere in the vendor&#x27;s return policy. Had I known that a restocking fee would apply, I would have thought twice about making this purchase.</li>
            <li> No, because this was a total waste of my money. This hair was of no use to me at all.... I will; however, continue to make purchases from AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs to use for loc extensions. I had never tried it before and I&#x27;m horrid at doing hair so I thought it would be a disaster lol Luckily, the hair worked perfectly &amp; they came out well. I didn&#x27;t have much waste hair at all, but idk how that would be different if I were doing braids or something instead. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> THE WORST HAIR EVER!!! this is NOT 100% hair!! i used this hair in my locs for weaking areas and wanted a color change so i decided to go black from brown and unfortunely the hair DID NOT dye at all!! so now im stuck with a full head of blk hair with spotted pieces of brown.</li>
            <li> I think this is great hair. It arrives well packaged and predivided in to layers. It was easy to separate sections off for use. I was able to use just about all of the hair with very minimal waste and very few kinks. Overall, it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair! Just don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Please just turn and walk away! DO NOT SAY YOU WERE NOT WARNED!</li>
