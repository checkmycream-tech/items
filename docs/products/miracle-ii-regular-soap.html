            <li>Miracle II Regular Soap is Great!!!!!</li>
            <li>, the maker of it wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a quality product so he was giving it away to friends and relatives</li>
            <li>I love this product and am grateful to Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, and it still holds up to what it says it can do.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve watched the price creep up over the years but stay with it because we&#x27;ve yet to find a soap that we like more.  </li>
            <li>I had suffered with many health issues because of mercury poisoning.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s ok to drink, for detox purposes.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is the bomb, antibacterial, great degreaser, excellent for dishes, but will want to dilute, it&#x27;s VERY concentrated, cleaning cupboards, sinks, getting out stains, washing clothes, cleaning up after pet accidents--leaves no odor.  </li>
            <li>Dilute and clean everything, you, your house and IT REALY CLEAN GLASS!!</li>
            <li>this is THE best &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to be able to purchase it on amazon with free shipping</li>
            <li>Yes it is a very strong soap and will clean anything you want, and make it shine, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s glorified dish soap.</li>
            <li>Felt the price for the large bottle was fair.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers list the wonderful qualities of the product and I agree</li>
            <li>Neutral scent and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wash everything with this soap with great results and I&#x27;m totally OCD btw.</li>
            <li>Buying this by the gallon is great as it gets costly when you have to purchase it in smaller portions.</li>
            <li>Miracle 2 coined the term to sound scientific.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>/&gt;You know that our body is mostly water, right?  </li>
            <li>I almost never have to clean my tub, tub surround, and shower doors now</li>
            <li>I use it for everything: wash dishes and clothes, bathroom clean up.  </li>
            <li>When its time to clean the shower, I just put it on a washcloth and wash the walls and then spray them.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for nearly 8 years with excellent result especially for laundry.</li>
            <li>Breaks up grease and oil and leaves every surface clean.</li>
            <li>It is so sudsy, leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>sense, right!  </li>
            <li>This whole body wash is outstanding, without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>True to its word.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use more than twice as much every time I shower or use it for anything.  </li>
            <li>Been using this soap for years, cuz I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Stops pain on the spot and quick healing.  </li>
            <li>Wash your pets with it, its mild and kills fleas.  </li>
            <li>It seemed greatly watered down.</li>
            <li>I add my own oil to it for extra moisture.  </li>
            <li>I have major skin issues with many detergents.  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s that good, also its a great bug killer, spray it on spiders, ants, earwigs, etc, most are killed on spot or sometimes it slows them down enough so you can get-em!</li>
            <li>Miracle II also has several other great products available.</li>
            <li>NO harsh chemicals or strong perfumey stink and cleans, cleans, cleans.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle, mild, unscented and versatile.  </li>
            <li>I love just having one container under my sink that I keep refilling the smaller bottles with.</li>
            <li>I love English Ivy</li>
            <li>and they were all coming back for more and said he should sell it</li>
            <li>Anything natural and chemical free is tops for me.  </li>
            <li>I swear to you my skin seemed to get more sunspots, freckles, and just didn&#x27;t have the same look as it does when I use this soap to wash my hair, and since I started to use it again my hair is not as frizzy as it was when I wasn&#x27;t using this soap!</li>
            <li>One use of M-II bath for the little Maltese and the itch was gone and she looked like a brilliant white snowball.  </li>
            <li>I put water in a 32 oz spray bottle with 4 tbs Miracle 2 for light duty cleaning..windows, mirrors, counters, and have another bottle with twice as much of the soap for heavier cleaning where you may need a little more suds, bathroom toilets, sink, carpet and furniture cleaner, vertical and horizontal blinds.  </li>
            <li>I love this companies soap, but when I purchased this size online, it was like i got the same soap i love but watered down 50%.  </li>
            <li>This order arrived so fast</li>
            <li>use it as a shampoo, body wash, the whole works.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this it is very drying makes hand burn and tingle.</li>
            <li>Friends who&#x27;ve visited have all commented on how much they like this soap because it is so gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>&quot; is really \\&quot;sodium dedecyl</li>
            <li>sulfate\\&quot; or SDS.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;dehydrabiethylamine\\&quot; is not even a real word in chemistry.</li>
            <li>We really like the versatility of this soap from bathing the dog to cleaning the floor or taking a very cleansing, relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li>soft!&lt;br /&gt;It relieved my dogs itchy dry skin and left her soft and smelling nice!</li>
            <li>The product does work well but not the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>It has many other uses also.  </li>
            <li>I will give it another try from another company, perhaps the original sellers and if it is the same will probably stop using it.</li>
            <li>The Neutralizer gel in particular is a superior product when used as is or mixed with other magnesium based oils/products.</li>
            <li>There were no miracles while using this soap I got mainly for fungal areas around my toes</li>
            <li>Friend&#x27;s dog was having big itch problems after many different types of kennel bath soaps and left her gorgeous white fur a little dull-off white…</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, and they make up something new to science:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;electrically</li>
            <li>cuz I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>The most complex mixture of natural minerals and organics that has ever been blended together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is all natural and healing.</li>
            <li>(I understand being a natural type soap</li>
            <li>they crookedly use the word \\&quot;foaming agent\\&quot; instead of what it really is, \\&quot;Sodium laureth sulfate\\&quot; which I know is poison because I have done all the research in skin care products and know to avoid anything with that.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>A gallon lasts a long time because it&#x27;s concentrated, only use it full strength for stain removal or for toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My skin is silky and soft and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>No unknown ingredientsj---works for body and hair and  dishes and hands.</li>
            <li>Because it is highly concentrated, a gallon will last a long time.</li>

            <li> I almost never have to clean my tub, tub surround, and shower doors now</li>
            <li> I use it for everything: wash dishes and clothes, bathroom clean up.  </li>
            <li> When its time to clean the shower, I just put it on a washcloth and wash the walls and then spray them.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for nearly 8 years with excellent result especially for laundry.</li>
            <li> Breaks up grease and oil and leaves every surface clean.</li>
            <li> It is so sudsy, leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> sense, right!  </li>
            <li> This whole body wash is outstanding, without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> True to its word.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use more than twice as much every time I shower or use it for anything.  </li>
            <li> Been using this soap for years, cuz I love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Stops pain on the spot and quick healing.  </li>
            <li> Wash your pets with it, its mild and kills fleas.  </li>
            <li> It seemed greatly watered down.</li>
            <li> I add my own oil to it for extra moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have major skin issues with many detergents.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s that good, also its a great bug killer, spray it on spiders, ants, earwigs, etc, most are killed on spot or sometimes it slows them down enough so you can get-em!</li>
            <li> Miracle II also has several other great products available.</li>
            <li> NO harsh chemicals or strong perfumey stink and cleans, cleans, cleans.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely gentle, mild, unscented and versatile.  </li>
            <li> I love just having one container under my sink that I keep refilling the smaller bottles with.</li>
            <li> I love English Ivy</li>
            <li> and they were all coming back for more and said he should sell it</li>
            <li> Anything natural and chemical free is tops for me.  </li>
            <li> I swear to you my skin seemed to get more sunspots, freckles, and just didn&#x27;t have the same look as it does when I use this soap to wash my hair, and since I started to use it again my hair is not as frizzy as it was when I wasn&#x27;t using this soap!</li>
            <li> One use of M-II bath for the little Maltese and the itch was gone and she looked like a brilliant white snowball.  </li>
            <li> I put water in a 32 oz spray bottle with 4 tbs Miracle 2 for light duty cleaning..windows, mirrors, counters, and have another bottle with twice as much of the soap for heavier cleaning where you may need a little more suds, bathroom toilets, sink, carpet and furniture cleaner, vertical and horizontal blinds.  </li>
            <li> I love this companies soap, but when I purchased this size online, it was like i got the same soap i love but watered down 50%.  </li>
            <li> This order arrived so fast</li>
            <li> use it as a shampoo, body wash, the whole works.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this it is very drying makes hand burn and tingle.</li>
            <li> Friends who&#x27;ve visited have all commented on how much they like this soap because it is so gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> &quot; is really \\&quot;sodium dedecyl</li>
            <li> sulfate\\&quot; or SDS.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;dehydrabiethylamine\\&quot; is not even a real word in chemistry.</li>
            <li> We really like the versatility of this soap from bathing the dog to cleaning the floor or taking a very cleansing, relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li> soft!&lt;br /&gt;It relieved my dogs itchy dry skin and left her soft and smelling nice!</li>
            <li> The product does work well but not the same as the original.  </li>
            <li> It has many other uses also.  </li>
            <li> I will give it another try from another company, perhaps the original sellers and if it is the same will probably stop using it.</li>
            <li> The Neutralizer gel in particular is a superior product when used as is or mixed with other magnesium based oils/products.</li>
            <li> There were no miracles while using this soap I got mainly for fungal areas around my toes</li>
            <li> Friend&#x27;s dog was having big itch problems after many different types of kennel bath soaps and left her gorgeous white fur a little dull-off white…</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, and they make up something new to science:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;electrically</li>
            <li> cuz I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> The most complex mixture of natural minerals and organics that has ever been blended together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is all natural and healing.</li>
            <li> (I understand being a natural type soap</li>
            <li> they crookedly use the word \\&quot;foaming agent\\&quot; instead of what it really is, \\&quot;Sodium laureth sulfate\\&quot; which I know is poison because I have done all the research in skin care products and know to avoid anything with that.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> A gallon lasts a long time because it&#x27;s concentrated, only use it full strength for stain removal or for toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My skin is silky and soft and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li> No unknown ingredientsj---works for body and hair and  dishes and hands.</li>
            <li> Because it is highly concentrated, a gallon will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You really do not need much to do what it takes a half bottle of toxic cleaners to do.  </li>
            <li> concentrated so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user.  </li>
            <li> Because it is so concentrated this gallon goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Use it for everything as a soap, shampoo, handwash, dog wash... keeps skin from getting dry to.</li>
            <li> and of course it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> In the laundry it breaks down commercial laundry soaps so they rinse out.</li>
            <li> When other soaps fail, this will clean it. ..  </li>
            <li> I wash the interior of my car with it, floors, sinks, toilets windows.</li>
            <li> It finally pulled all the heavy metals out of my body.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever because it is concentrated; I only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> A little bit of it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You can get rid of all other house cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years and have never been disappointed with it</li>
            <li> Without this I could not use other laundry detergents.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it is the only soap that is not full of toxins, and other chemicals which are not good for your body.  </li>
            <li> (otherwise it was a little drying on my hair).    </li>
            <li> I mean is this, the skin will reject any other product.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves no soap scum in the shower and in fact cleans as it goes down the drain</li>
            <li> I even take a small amount of it with me when I travel and leave a supply at my children&#x27;s homes where I visit.  </li>
            <li> I dip the foliage in a diluted solution of Miracle Soap and no more spidermites.</li>
            <li> Not sure about eloptic energy.  </li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years, but was unable to find it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> but this batch was not what I usually find.</li>
            <li> it hardly doesn&#x27;t soap up at all.  </li>
            <li> We literally never have soap scum build up because of Miracle II.</li>
            <li> No more need for four bottles of products in the shower!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to have less suds because it doesn&#x27;t have some of the suds forming bad chemicals your typical soap or shampoo has.)  </li>
            <li> I had a big bad cock roach that lived behing my bathroom sink once and he would come out about once a day and crawl on my sink.</li>
            <li> I poured miracle soap behind my sink and he moved out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s quite a story behind the Miracle 2, thats why it mentions prayer</li>
            <li> but they always get crazy spidermites.</li>
            <li> I even use this soap on the nasty soap scum in the tub</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients from the website: (should have checked this before, whoever made the listing on Amazon is crooks.)&lt;br /&gt;Prayer, electrically engineered energized oxygenated water, ash of dedecyl solution, dehydrabiethylamine, calcium, potassium, magnesium, foaming agent, and the Anointing of God.</li>
            <li> an acid base.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used Miracle II products for years and am happy to find that Amazon can deliver them to me.  We have used nothing else on my grandchildren since birth for bathing and shampooing, I use it to bathe with, wash my hands with, and do hand laundering.  I almost never have to clean my tub, tub surround, and shower doors now that my bar soap-using son doesn&#x27;t use my tub any more.  I even take a small amount of it with me when I travel and leave a supply at my children&#x27;s homes where I visit.  This order arrived so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> I have major skin issues with many detergents.  This whole body wash is outstanding, without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a shampoo, body wash, the whole works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Miracle II soap for a number of years and have been very pleased with it.  When I got this one it seems that the products production methods must have changed.  I compared this soap with some of the soap I still had and it&#x27;s thinner and a different color.  It also smells different.  The product does work well but not the same as the original.  I was tempted to return it but in the end didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been using Miracle Soap for over 10 years. It is fantastic. You can get rid of all other house cleaning products. I love just having one container under my sink that I keep refilling the smaller bottles with. Superb for house cleaning!!! Completey non toxic!! I wash everything with this soap with great results and I&#x27;m totally OCD btw.I wash the interior of my car with it, floors, sinks, toilets windows. AND it&#x27;s great to get rid of bugs! If you follow the instructions in the booklet you can use it for your plants. I love English Ivy but they always get crazy spidermites. Not anymore! I dip the foliage in a diluted solution of Miracle Soap and no more spidermites. I had a big bad cock roach that lived behing my bathroom sink once and he would come out about once a day and crawl on my sink. I poured miracle soap behind my sink and he moved out. I don&#x27;t have a dog but if I did I would wash him or her with this soap. I use if for my own skin too. However, for the body I would get the moisturizing one cuz otherwise it&#x27;s too drying. It&#x27;s great for removing makeup. But i did stop using it on my face cuz I have super dry skin and now I use cream make up remover, but it works like a charm and sometimes I still use it cus it cleans my face so great. I bet it&#x27;s miraculous for oily skin. the best best most wonderful part is that it&#x27;s completely non toxic. What a gift. I tell all my friends I use one soap for everything!!</li>
            <li> Very easy on the hands and is a good all around multi purpose cleaner and degreaser. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use it for everything: wash dishes and clothes, bathroom clean up.  I find it works better when diluted.</li>
            <li> We love it in the shower. Both my husband and I use it as a body soap and shampoo. When its time to clean the shower, I just put it on a washcloth and wash the walls and then spray them. We literally never have soap scum build up because of Miracle II.</li>
            <li> Great soap...check web over priced here and price goes up weekly</li>
            <li> Have been using this for nearly 8 years with excellent result especially for laundry.</li>
            <li> Happy with this soap as the ingredients are non-toxic.  A little bit of it goes a long way.  Felt the price for the large bottle was fair.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for over 4 years now -- and I love it more every day.  I use this soap as a body wash and haven&#x27;t used anything else in years.  I even tried it as a shampoo, and it worked good, but I had to also use a separate conditioner (otherwise it was a little drying on my hair).    I even use this soap on the nasty soap scum in the tub and it works like a charm!  Miracle II Soap is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great soap, I keep reordering.</li>
            <li> There were no miracles while using this soap I got mainly for fungal areas around my toes it basically did nothing, however it works great for dish washing. Your better off using Bronners Soap for your body and this product for dish washing and laundry.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product that can be diluted to be used for many applications.  Not sure about eloptic energy.  Neutral scent and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing. I now use it for all cleaning. Shampoo, hand soap, glass cleaner, counter spray, dish soap, etc.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without my Miracle II Soap.  I use it for body, home, car, laundry, carpets and upholstery stains…  everything.  Great bubble bath…  Friend&#x27;s dog was having big itch problems after many different types of kennel bath soaps and left her gorgeous white fur a little dull-off white… One use of M-II bath for the little Maltese and the itch was gone and she looked like a brilliant white snowball.  There are just too many successful uses of this product … AND IT IS SAFE TO DRINK..SAFE FOR YOUR BODY.. SAFE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.</li>
            <li> Have been using these products for 13 years.  Best on the market&lt;br /&gt;for healthy and safe lifestyle.  Read the usage tips.  It does it all!&lt;br /&gt;Love the Gel!  Stops pain on the spot and quick healing.  Please&lt;br /&gt;realize that these products help balance the pH of your body.&lt;br /&gt;You know that our body is mostly water, right?  Now, think about&lt;br /&gt;a pool.  If the pH is not correct, what happens to the pool?  Now&lt;br /&gt;think about your body….makes sense, right!  BTW, cancer thrives&lt;br /&gt;in an acid base.  If you put cancer cells in balanced (alkaline) they&lt;br /&gt;instantly die.  Most US  are acid.  Could it be that simple???  YES!</li>
            <li> It is the only soap we use in our Bathroom, for showering, and washing our face, and hands.  it is the only soap that is not full of toxins, and other chemicals which are not good for your body.  We will not use anything else, and recommend ti to everyone. We have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years and have never been disappointed with it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years.  Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  I brush my teeth with it, bath and also laundry with it.  The one I revived destroyed all of my uniforms for work. It left faded spots. The formula has been alter.</li>
            <li> No unknown ingredientsj---works for body and hair and  dishes and hands. We refill our soap dispensers and it lasts forever</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this it is very drying makes hand burn and tingle. Does not suds at all do not like it</li>
            <li> Miracle 2 products are tops in my book.  I found out about them years ago when some gulf war vets said they were the only thing that helped them get over the mystery illnesses/rashes many came home with.  The Neutralizer gel in particular is a superior product when used as is or mixed with other magnesium based oils/products. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is very good as a soap or spray cleaner. When other soaps fail, this will clean it. ..  In the laundry it breaks down commercial laundry soaps so they rinse out. Without this I could not use other laundry detergents.  One of the better dish or car soaps you can find since it rinses off with without a trace of film.  Its probably been 2 years since I bought a gallon, its just now running out. You really do not need much to do what it takes a half bottle of toxic cleaners to do.  Also a good spray for plants.  Well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Miracle II Regular Soap is Great!!!!! cleans the best of any soap on the market. concentrated so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This soap is the bomb, antibacterial, great degreaser, excellent for dishes, but will want to dilute, it&#x27;s VERY concentrated, cleaning cupboards, sinks, getting out stains, washing clothes, cleaning up after pet accidents--leaves no odor.  I put water in a 32 oz spray bottle with 4 tbs Miracle 2 for light duty cleaning..windows, mirrors, counters, and have another bottle with twice as much of the soap for heavier cleaning where you may need a little more suds, bathroom toilets, sink, carpet and furniture cleaner, vertical and horizontal blinds.  I even put a drop on my toothbrush, it foams up real good and I don&#x27;t have to call Poison Control if I swallow any.  A gallon lasts a long time because it&#x27;s concentrated, only use it full strength for stain removal or for toothbrush.  Works great in a foamer bottle, very light, fresh scent, I get mine at missdaisyshealth, is definately an amazing product.  There&#x27;s quite a story behind the Miracle 2, thats why it mentions prayer, the maker of it wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a quality product so he was giving it away to friends and relatives and they were all coming back for more and said he should sell it--it&#x27;s that good, also its a great bug killer, spray it on spiders, ants, earwigs, etc, most are killed on spot or sometimes it slows them down enough so you can get-em! Wash your pets with it, its mild and kills fleas.  My kids are in their 20&#x27;s, and when theres a spill, or the cats have an accident, the kids run and get the Miracle 2 soap, because IT WORKS, and there you have it. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> We use this for everything. It removes pine tar, cleans every surface, even the humans!! It never causes any adverse reactions and has no odor. Breaks up grease and oil and leaves every surface clean.</li>
            <li> once you use Miracle 2, your skin takes to it in a sovereign way,&lt;br /&gt;what I mean is this, the skin will reject any other product. Try it. . .&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll see, there is no going back.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything, especially bathing.  Have been using it for over 10 years.  I add my own oil to it for extra moisture.  My skin is silky and soft and not dry at all.  I love this product and am grateful to Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use for my body and I love it!</li>
            <li> this is THE best &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; for dry skin.  i use this and i NEVER get itchy!</li>
            <li> I dilute it and put it in the kitchen soap container.  No citric so it is good for granite.  great stuff</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this soap for over ten years!  We use it for everything - cleaning carpets, washing the dog, wash the dishes, laundry, ourselves, the vehicles; as shampoo, toothpaste, hair spray, etc.  NO harsh chemicals or strong perfumey stink and cleans, cleans, cleans.  Comes concentrated so you can dilute it as you wish.  Excellent product and great buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used Miracle II for several years when it was recommended by a friend. .  We dilute it 1-3 for hand soap in the kitchen &amp; bathroom. .  It&#x27;s great for washing fruits &amp; vegetables, cleaning bird feeders &amp; pet dishes; anything that is not dishwasher safe. .  It has no toxic ingredients in it.  It has many other uses also.  Read them on their web-site. It&#x27;s a great product &amp; I was happy to find it on Amazon. Miracle II also has several other great products available.</li>
            <li> Just a drop of this in a spray bottle is a wonderful window, counter top, shower cleanser. Apply neat for wounds and cuts as well as shampoo and soap. No odor. No skin or scalp inflammation. True to its word.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Last my family of 5 for one year. I dilute in spray bottle &amp; it&#x27;s great all over my house cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is great to have one product that works from your head to your toes.  No more need for four bottles of products in the shower!  Buying this by the gallon is great as it gets costly when you have to purchase it in smaller portions.</li>
            <li> Anything natural and chemical free is tops for me.  I am a long time user.  I recommend it with experience.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years, but was unable to find it locally anymore.  Nice to be able to use it for cleaning around the house and also for bath soap.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. The other reviewers list the wonderful qualities of the product and I agree but this batch was not what I usually find. It seemed greatly watered down. I will give it another try from another company, perhaps the original sellers and if it is the same will probably stop using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using this for over a year now as body soap, dish soap, hand soap, cleaning soap, etc.--that&#x27;s why I buy it by the gallon.  I love it because it&#x27;s non-toxic &amp; doesn&#x27;t harm the environment.  I&#x27;ve heard that when ingested, it has healed people from all sorts of things although I have not tried that; howeveLr, I may do that in the future.  I&#x27;ve had a skin rash &amp; it was soothing to use on my skin.  I love it &amp; would recommend it to everyone.  I also prefer liquid soaps &amp; this one does not leave any film or residue.</li>
            <li> This is all natural and healing. Use it for everything as a soap, shampoo, handwash, dog wash... keeps skin from getting dry to.</li>
            <li> I love this companies soap, but when I purchased this size online, it was like i got the same soap i love but watered down 50%.  It&#x27;s soo runny it hardly doesn&#x27;t soap up at all.  (I understand being a natural type soap it&#x27;s going to have less suds because it doesn&#x27;t have some of the suds forming bad chemicals your typical soap or shampoo has.)  I&#x27;ve had to use more than twice as much every time I shower or use it for anything.  I&#x27;ve been buying the same brand at my local health food store, so I was bummed that I couldn&#x27;t get the same quality product in bulk online.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for years, cuz I love it so much.  Has no toxins and is good for me.  Has minerals and a great Ph.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a bit to see if there was a cheaper soap that would do as well as Miracle II. I swear to you my skin seemed to get more sunspots, freckles, and just didn&#x27;t have the same look as it does when I use this soap to wash my hair, and since I started to use it again my hair is not as frizzy as it was when I wasn&#x27;t using this soap! Also when my teeth are feeling inflamed I use this soap to brush my teeth, and my gums feel so much better after brushing with it. Wonderful soap. I just love it, and have been using it for 5 years or so!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Been using it for a couple of years.  I tell all my friends about it.  OK</li>
            <li> Using a product that actually cleans your skin and hair without adding any chemicals or preservatives is truly a miracle</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the moisturizing soap because that is what is pictured and that is what I received  but the description says regular soap. I wasn&#x27;t worried either way because I had the moisturizing lotion to add to the bottle of regular soap and I didn&#x27;t see the gallon of moisturizing soap. But I got what I wanted anyway so I&#x27;m happy. This soap leaves no soap scum in the shower and in fact cleans as it goes down the drain and of course it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.I have used it for many years. I am so glad to be able to purchase it on amazon with free shipping</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a shampoo and body wash, dog wash, cleaning product and more!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin and hair soft!&lt;br /&gt;It relieved my dogs itchy dry skin and left her soft and smelling nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, and it still holds up to what it says it can do. I use it for everything.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some controversy surrounding this soap, but all I know is that it works great for us.  It&#x27;s extremely gentle, mild, unscented and versatile.  Concentrated so we dilute it for hand soap, dish soap and use just a tiny bit on a washcloth in the shower.  We&#x27;ve watched the price creep up over the years but stay with it because we&#x27;ve yet to find a soap that we like more.  Because it is so concentrated this gallon goes a long way.  Friends who&#x27;ve visited have all commented on how much they like this soap because it is so gentle on the skin.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Dilute and clean everything, you, your house and IT REALY CLEAN GLASS!!</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile. I use it for everything. Laundry, cleaning, pets, and me too!!!</li>
            <li> I had suffered with many health issues because of mercury poisoning. In 2010 I started soaking in the Miracle II soap. For awhile after each bath, there was a slit gray film on the bottom of the tub. It finally pulled all the heavy metals out of my body. I still soak in it to this day. It&#x27;s an amazing detox product.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It is so sudsy, leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing what it seems. I don&#x27;t know why people are so fooled maybe because of the strength and the effectiveness of this product. Yes it is a very strong soap and will clean anything you want, and make it shine, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s glorified dish soap. It feels like dish soap, it smells like it, and it tastes like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients from the website: (should have checked this before, whoever made the listing on Amazon is crooks.)&lt;br /&gt;Prayer, electrically engineered energized oxygenated water, ash of dedecyl solution, dehydrabiethylamine, calcium, potassium, magnesium, foaming agent, and the Anointing of God. The most complex mixture of natural minerals and organics that has ever been blended together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to retype all that because the copy and paste doesn&#x27;t work on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, prayer? Really? Really? Really.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, and they make up something new to science:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;electrically engineered energized \\&quot; never heard of that before. I have heard of oxygenated water.&lt;br /&gt;Then you have a couple of synthetic poisons.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;ash of dedecyl solution\\&quot; is really \\&quot;sodium dedecyl sulfate\\&quot; or SDS.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;dehydrabiethylamine\\&quot; is not even a real word in chemistry. Miracle 2 coined the term to sound scientific.&lt;br /&gt;And they crookedly use the word \\&quot;foaming agent\\&quot; instead of what it really is, \\&quot;Sodium laureth sulfate\\&quot; which I know is poison because I have done all the research in skin care products and know to avoid anything with that.&lt;br /&gt;And the most silliest thing in the world, \\&quot;Anointing of God\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what I bet they would probably tell me it&#x27;s ok to drink, for detox purposes. And then I would probably end up in the emergency room getting my stomach pumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again anyone who mistakenly believes the ingredients on this product page are the correct ingredients and descriptions of the agents, are mistakenly fooled! There is no coconut oil in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way this post is a repost, but I have to warn the people who are like me and don&#x27;t want to be fooled.</li>
            <li> A daily cleanser in this household</li>
            <li> We really like the versatility of this soap from bathing the dog to cleaning the floor or taking a very cleansing, relaxing bath.  Because it is highly concentrated, a gallon will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It arrived in a timely manner and was intact. I recommend this liquid soap to anyone for shower &amp; shampoo. Lasts forever because it is concentrated; I only need a few drops.</li>
