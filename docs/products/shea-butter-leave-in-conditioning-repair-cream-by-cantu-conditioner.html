            <li>I have to add a shine serum when blow drying because this product isn&#x27;t going to add any kind of shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>According to the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org), this product contains chemicals that are highly hazardous to health including causing developmental problems, reproductive organ issues, and neurotoxicity.</li>
            <li>AQ-4100 Deluxe Shower Water Filter System with Adjustable Showerhead]]</li>
            <li>i really  like the way smell wonderful  </li>
            <li>REALLY like is that it&#x27;s a superb detangler.</li>
            <li>but it does condition so its nice</li>
            <li>It also, smells nice as well..</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair with a nice sheen,</li>
            <li>This products smells nice and I like the concept of anything Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Shea butter is great for hair, so i was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Cantu Shea Butter works great on my hair when it was relaxed and still works great on my natural hair!</li>
            <li>The feel was amazing and it just looked better.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>amazing buy, glad i invented my money it in</li>
            <li>I honestly for the life of me cannot understand why so many people say it flakes in their hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with how it moisturizes our hair and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I must say after 2 weeks of use and three washes the product is great and affordable, depending on the seller ;)</li>
            <li>Originally when I started using this product, like most others, I loved it.</li>
            <li>It does smell divine and has a very light feel to it, but it did not work out for me.    </li>
            <li>Very good purchase for someone with natural hair.</li>
            <li>We will get more.</li>
            <li>my favorite product for my kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair had more volume.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>this should be a white lady best kept secret......and was until now.</li>
            <li>Worked much better.     </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>but I love the waves.</li>
            <li>BETTER</li>
            <li>you have many textures.</li>
            <li>Every 3 days is better.</li>
            <li>Every 3 days is better.</li>
            <li>so I did even more research on the product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake either, which can happen with so many leave ins.</li>
            <li>Favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I recommend the argon oil version of it.&lt;br /&gt;Still love it and still recommend.</li>
            <li>(this doesn&#x27;t) so be sure to check.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than the Knot</li>
            <li>For that reason, I sometimes run some Cantu Hair Milk spray through on top of the cream.</li>
            <li>I totally love this, the smell and every thing, I use it on my hair and my kid hair.</li>
            <li>And to top it off I still had frizz.</li>
            <li>Two stars because it smells okay.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>my  daughter hair look more healthy  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product !</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I fingered through them and got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love both.</li>
            <li>The leave in by itself and the leave in mixed with the serum as a sealer are the best.</li>
            <li>and I love how my hair feels in the morning when I take the braids out.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Even if your hair is healthy...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get better results if you use this with leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost a year (or more) and I haven&#x27;t had to buy another one yet.</li>
            <li>It looks SO much better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, getting off topic, I have been using Cantu Shea Butter for years, mostly while relaxed, saw a youtube user review it, and gave it a shot, and immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and moisturized again, and of course smells amazing.</li>
            <li>if I thought I might use gel on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love Cantu Shea butter</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>That means I massage it into damp hair until I can&#x27;t see the cream any more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Since this is a cream, do make sure to apply it on damp hair, your hair will retain the cream more so because the water locks it in.</li>
            <li>I just love the Shea Butter leave in conditioner repair cream.</li>
            <li>I love how this feels in my hair.</li>
            <li>and i felt it frizzed up my hair more.  </li>
            <li>and i would probably get better results.</li>
            <li>That stuff is really moisturizing and feels great.</li>
            <li>- makes rubbing it in even more of a challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that now that I&#x27;m relaxed my hair appreciates this product even more and when I do rollersets with this and \\&quot;Chi Silk</li>
            <li>Best of all it smells great and actually makes my hair soft after use.</li>
            <li>They stuff smells pretty good and does work well.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I LOVE that it detangles my hair so easily.</li>
            <li>really liked the product because it didn&#x27;t take much to use on my hair to give it a nice feel.</li>
            <li>lol Overall nice job.</li>
            <li>Keep my hair soft, its very light weight, keeps my hair very nicely moisturized</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products, and really like Organic Root Stimulator, the Olive oil one...in case anyone&#x27;s comparing the two or looking for a good product.  </li>
            <li>The Cantu leave in conditioner is great for moisture and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I alternate between the two, as they are both incredible.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, it made my hair feel soft</li>
            <li>After trying many, many hair products to find what is good for my natural hair, I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR HAIR SMELL SOO GOOD AND LEAVES IT INCREDIBLY SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>Cantu Shea butter helped me detangle easily, and kept me detangled.</li>
            <li>Even if this product has a good amount of Canola oil in it and makes my hair soft, I like my oils better.</li>
            <li>First of all it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I tried it with Infusium 23 and it worked fine</li>
            <li>Why change something that was working just fine?</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick with my Prime subscription and arrived safely.</li>
            <li>However, this little jar is wonderful.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have very, very ,very thirsty hair!!</li>
            <li>My hair feels much softer, it&#x27;s nice and shiny</li>
            <li>In products as they leave my hair feeling light, shiny and silky; but the beauty supply store in my area didn&#x27;t carry it and I was pressed for time.</li>
            <li>For styling, I use it to smooth my frizzy edges.</li>
            <li>but I have to use about three tablespoons of it each time to get the frizzy hairs to smooth.</li>
            <li>This is such a great leave in.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>I avoid the clumping and flakes that others complain about by making sure the Cantu is thoroughly absorbed into my hair before I add my gel.</li>
            <li>it was cheap or else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product twice because I&#x27;ve heard such great reviews about Cantu Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly very slightly coconut \\&quot;y\\&quot;, best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the bang for the buck!,,,,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I hoped for and more.</li>
            <li>good thing about this is that it is very cheap and can be found in Wal-Mart, Target, and at the BX/PX on military installations.</li>
            <li>Excellent on natural hair or curly hair for extra conditioning.  </li>
            <li>This cream was great for my son&#x27;s close cropped dry hair.    </li>
            <li>I co-washed my hair, then used this in place of my normal conditioner, then loved it so much I used it as my leave in too.</li>
            <li>Soft and had a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>After this I make a mixture of Cantu(two fingers worth)natural Jojoba oil(That I get from Nature with Love)(a cap full), Meadfoam seed oil(half a cap full of),</li>
            <li>Cantu doesn&#x27;t flake in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell like fish or anything else,It keeps my hair hydrated and nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Cantu doesn&#x27;t flake in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell like fish or anything else,It keeps my hair hydrated and nice and soft.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning and rinse it out my 4a/b hair is full of life.</li>
            <li>Granted this smells good, but I supposed this is for hair types that are very coarse as my hair is not.</li>
            <li>My hair has been treated with blonde highlights for three months now, and fairly often.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it just works better for some than others, I would be very upset</li>
            <li>I absolute love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner so much.</li>
            <li>We love this conditioner so much</li>
            <li>She has this beautiful black hair and this made it so manageable after washes.</li>
            <li>Instead I used it after washing with the mild splash of tea tree oil and the cantu alone to twist.</li>
            <li>I not only love how this calms my hair, but I love the smell and feel of my hair afterward.  </li>
            <li>It dries out really quickly on my 3b hair texture</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get this stuff to (quickly) rub into my hair.</li>
            <li>when I apply this to my hair it makes my hair soft ,easy to detangle and makes it easy for me to style.</li>
            <li>My new growth is much more manageable after using this.</li>
            <li>but I guess not as strong because that one really works for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice amount</li>
            <li>this prevents breakage and puts more moister in your hair and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I also happen to like the results far better than Salerm 21 Leave In.</li>
            <li>It does leave it smooth and more manageable the next day.</li>
            <li>This is one of the BEST conditioners there is especially for coarse, thick hair, but it&#x27;s great for any type of hair.  </li>
            <li>She has a more courly kinky natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Now pink oil products cannot be mixed, but this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely had tangles since I began using this.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, but seems to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>but my friend was right</li>
            <li>right before you take them lose.</li>
            <li>Just not the right product for me.</li>
            <li>she was right</li>
            <li>I have learned the lesson of finding the right product for your hair.</li>
            <li>one of my other daughter&#x27;s hair, and mine, this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and easy to condition and style.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>But this is a good daily leave-in for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have very short hair (about an inch all around my head) from by big chop and Cantu is great for moisturizing it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this product very much and will not purchase it again but will smell it once in a while.</li>
            <li>I have found SheaMoisture to be a huge improvement for my natural hair needs.</li>
            <li>First of all I was told about this product by a friend of color.</li>
            <li>Decided most it can do is make my hair greasy and I can use extra shampoo or two and wash it out.</li>
            <li>but it sure made this blonde hair &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use to put tea tree oil in my hair first after a wash to keep it moist while I was twisting it, and then put both an olive oil creme and the cantu butter for moisture.</li>
            <li>In mine, my sides are wavy, my top is 4b(spiral ramen noodle like) and my back is (kitchen)(yes I said KITCHEN)</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;d add coconut oil on it and wrap it wet, the next morning, it fell beautifully.</li>
            <li>So looking for a better leave in conditioner I found this at my local drug store.</li>
            <li>great for thick hair</li>
            <li>Cantu is fantastic and completely repairs split ends.</li>
            <li>Makes hair look pretty  and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product around May 2011.</li>
            <li>not  flakes, exactly, but</li>
            <li>The leave - in is moisturize my hair on the first try.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s way too greasy to leave in your hair and go to bed with.</li>
            <li>However, i do think when I am in further in my loc journey I will use it more often.</li>
            <li>Glad only paid 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 years or so now and when i first got it</li>
            <li>I love using Cantu, it is not my first time using it and would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a deep conditioning that you can leave in for days.</li>
            <li>I love this product and want to try the entire line.</li>
            <li>I love Cantu products personally.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m not a fan of this conditioner, I have found one that works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>Thats the fun of having natural hair!!!</li>
            <li>Some of their other products don&#x27;t have as nice ingredients as this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a good product... especially at a relatively inexpensive price!</li>
            <li>I started transitioning to natural and this seemed to be the most mentioned leave-in conditioner on all the natural hair blogs.  </li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner on the reccommendation of three websites--which reccommended a good moisturizer for African American course hair (like mine).  </li>
            <li>I leave my 3b/3a hair  super soft and manageable and the jar lasts forever!</li>
            <li>However, when I used it during my transition from relaxed to natural hair, it broke the relaxed ends off and did not go well with heat of any kind like blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Great job at moisturizing my dry, frizzy, long hair!</li>
            <li>I love this product it turned my dry hair from being out in the sun to replenished moistured hair.</li>
            <li>Despite the nice,creamy texture and pleasant smell (pros) ,this product was sub par to say the least.</li>
            <li>I kept a strict regimen of certain conditioners and shampoos now.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get a few more in this week!</li>
            <li>I try not to add too much because it can weigh hair down very easily.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really frizzy when its humid but</li>
            <li>YET THE WHOLE LINE OF CANTU PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>It really is important that I point out I sleep with a slik scarf and the day after the next day when I shower</li>
            <li>It really is important that I point out I sleep with a slik scarf and the day after the next day when I shower</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo and conditioner that much.  </li>
            <li>I really dont do shampoo anyways -</li>
            <li>Nothing that really amazes me though.</li>
            <li>My hair felt repaired and ready</li>
            <li>Hopefully this hasn&#x27;t messed my hair up too much.</li>
            <li>When used with the cantu shea butter coconut curling cream that really brings out curls, it improves the bounciness.</li>
            <li>I also tried a twist out with those three products and this leave in conditioner really gave it moisture that lasts.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a shine and if you use too much it can give you a residue feeling.</li>
            <li>as a note, if you&#x27;re like me and you find a product that works really well with your hair</li>
            <li>I realized how greasy this stuff really was.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about this product in YouTube videos.  </li>
            <li>I am still testing how much to use in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a not so well promoted line of hair products that is reasonably priced in Walmart, on Amazon but not in CVS.</li>
            <li>It moisturized my hair very well.</li>
            <li>It smells really yummy too(which</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Actually it is more that expected.  </li>
            <li>i really did like it and still loves the smell too...</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>, it really does work with any texture of hair.</li>
            <li>Another thing I really like is that when I use it to set my hair with rods/rollers, my curls come out super soft and bouncy - not hard and crunchy like gels and setting lotions.  </li>
            <li>This product was a pleasant surprise, as I normally use  Advantage Brazilian Hair Repair to roller set my thick relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>But the Cream it self is wonderful, I have thick 4a/b hair, and it is very porous due to over processing and coloring for years....</li>
            <li>My hair is long and strong and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The next day took the twists out and my hair was sooooooooo beautiful, soft the twisted curls were so cute.</li>
            <li>More so than all the other products I have purchased</li>
            <li>I had to do the big chop as a result when I had a nice, long length.</li>
            <li>I will try one more time with less product on my hair but after that if it doesn&#x27;t work straight in garbage.</li>
            <li>I actually got the product cheaper from amazon including shipping, it shipped super fast, and it was well packed.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m finally finding that to be true.</li>
            <li>Cantu helps boost hair growth by keeping your hair moisturized and full of the necessary ingredients that your hair needs to grow.</li>
            <li>I started taking vitamins and using shampoo a lot less and my conditioners more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not labeled as a detangler, but my comb glides easily through my wet hair when I apply this product.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Cantu for my roller sets and the results were always fairly decent, but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy from the conditioner, but it really truly looks twice as healthy as it did before the treatment.  </li>
            <li>Mind you, the most I use on my entire head is about 3 dime sized amounts before rollersetting and a couple spritzs daily, so you definetly don&#x27;t need a lot to do the job.</li>
            <li>Right side, Kitchen I work through with the shower running through , when all my hair is detangled, with biolage still in, I run my comb through with the shower running through my whole head combing forward and around my face letting the comb and water rinse, Then I flip my hair back and rinse the hairline.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommended this for naturals.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve since learned that my hair doesn&#x27;t like a lot of products with high protein.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d watched a plethora of YouTube videos and read a ton of high star reviews on this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, truly does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend</li>
            <li>Admittedly this is a pretty heavy product so if you have fine or oily hair</li>
            <li>Even though the product doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s for curls, it enhanced my natural curls really well and gave definition and shine.</li>
            <li>Using it, plus co-washing my hair worked very well and my hair has gotten considerably longer since I started using it a year ago.</li>
            <li>I just started this natural journey and I honesty can&#x27;t say much about what it does to your hair.</li>
            <li>make sure you get the cantu everyday moister cream to put on your braids</li>
            <li>The cream has a thick consitancy and also smells nice.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream itself is thick and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I simply wash well mostly condition, apply the cream, air dry and go.</li>
            <li>I also tried using this product to do a braid out on dry hair and noticed a ton of breakage (I estimate more than 200 short strands of hair)and</li>
            <li>It left the ends completely frizzy and tangled after blow-drying, making my hair more susceptible to heat damage when I tried to flat iron.</li>
            <li>I get it locally at either cvs or walgreens because it&#x27;s right up the street.</li>
            <li>your hair is free of other products.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use much, this pretty decent sized tub, lasts me for months, and I use it every single day, minimum, maybe twice in one day if I need to redo my hair for an event or something.</li>
            <li>When I tried the Cantu I was careful not to use more than necessary as it is in a jar and not portioned out with a pump.</li>
            <li>After a few uses this product begins to make your hair incredibly soft, not to mention healthy.</li>
            <li>, it really did nothing, I find the best way to use Cantu is as a base to my hair mixture.</li>
            <li>, it really did nothing, I find the best way to use Cantu is as a base to my hair mixture.</li>
            <li>It keeps my 4b/c hair very soft.</li>
            <li>and it let my curls so moisturizer and soft!</li>
            <li>THIS IS A NATURAL HAIR PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>When I combed my hair, there was more shedding than usual.</li>
            <li>Definitely would buy again;)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really absorb into my hair, just sat on top like a heavy styling product, and left a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I only use this for special occassions or when I know my hair is going to be extra frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My new growth doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li>I did find that the first time that I used this product on freshly washed damp hair, I noticed the softness that everybody rants about after my hair was fully air dried.</li>
            <li>Now I used it by itself, on dry hair and wet hair when I first Big Chopped in 2009, and it was OK</li>
            <li>Now I used it by itself, on dry hair and wet hair when I first Big Chopped in 2009, and it was OK</li>
            <li>Whether I used this leave-in on wet or dry hair, it would just sit on top of my hair and not do any moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use, it made combing the hair easier and tame.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smells good, but I had trouble getting it to soak in to my hair no matter how much or little I put in it.  </li>
            <li>It does not play well with gels, so for naturals you absolutely cannot have any gel in  your hair before or after adding Cantu, it will most definitely pop out in little white balls...</li>
            <li>Then I put it up on curlers and went to clean the house and do some odd and end jobs in the home.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Your face is not greasy, but feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept nearly all of my growth.</li>
            <li>I say nearly because I do trim it.</li>
            <li>if you are natural or going natural this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>If you are a natural, you&#x27;ve heard of it.  </li>
            <li>My hair always feels soft after I wash,condition, moisturize and seal my hair but after using this product I must say I&#x27;m upset.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair incredibly soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner makes my hair feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>: this conditioner should not be used on straightened hair because it will cause it to revert to the hair&#x27;s natural pattern, causing frizz.)</li>
            <li>but we all have natural hair.</li>
            <li>Making it so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It makes our hair soft and easier to comb.</li>
            <li>continue to use this on our hair (except the young&#x27;un).</li>
            <li>I am a natural with wavy/curly that presser her hair.</li>
            <li>I have about 4b hair and it makes my hair so soft and manageable for styling after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>have been continuing my hunt and experimenting with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>so with managing frizz but the soft manageability it gives my hair outweighs all of that for</li>
            <li>I used to leave this in my l.o.c method but after 6months of being natural</li>
            <li>I applied this after washing my hair &amp; this leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I tell you and makes hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>my friends who were going natural were talking about it.</li>
            <li>It worked well when I had completely relaxed hair and did roller sets to style my hair.</li>
            <li>I started using it on my natural hair without heat, but I noticed it did not moisturize like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>It was a complete disaster.</li>
            <li>I would say it is a product that doesn&#x27;t agree with my natural hair, but might work for someone else&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I really want to go back to being a brunette, but I need to repair my hair.  </li>
            <li>I just started to use this product and it made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair isn&#x27;t soft and silky yet.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Why pay so much for it on here when it&#x27;s only $5.97 at Walmart?</li>
            <li>However it made my hair too soft</li>
            <li>and i think its time to give it up and try their natural hair line leave in.</li>
            <li>every since I went natural</li>
            <li>and it detangles and makes it soft.</li>
            <li>my hair texture is soft when I awake.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m completely natural with a mixture of 4A and 4B hair;</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My mother who is all natural stole the jar and uses it as a styling cream every morning and puts it in her hair before she goes to sleep.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in, sometimes overnight and wash it in the morning and it stays soft for days (even after i went swimming in chlorine)</li>
            <li>If you want soft hair, this is the stuff to buy.</li>
            <li>It takes some coaxing for it to completely disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; my hair comes out soft, silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This may or may not have been made for hair other than fine and blonde</li>
            <li>It softened my hair right back up with no residue or white flakes.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a really wavy curl pattern to hair natural 2b hair, I noticed that it made her hair soft but dry.</li>
            <li>This is in the ethnic aisle, I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;black hair\\&quot; but more coarse, mixed ethnicity type hair.  </li>
            <li>I left it in for a good hour, and I spent some time outside, so it did get a little sun-warmed under the plastic cap.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that it is very hard to find and local stores don&#x27;t do a good job keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li>What I love is that the set is so firm but so soft at the same time, giving your style extra staying power.</li>
            <li>I heard so many great reviews for this product, especially on YouTube, but I must say that  this product is absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li>came sooner than expected and does exactly what I thought it does... detangle?</li>
            <li>Not a cheap product ,true to its word.</li>
            <li>All Natural Leave in Conditioner Detangler( which you find at growafrohairlong.com)(eye measure about two fingers worth or a little</li>
            <li>I thought I put on too much the first time so on the second day, I tried using less</li>
            <li>It is so extremely moisturizing and really makes your hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use it when I want to air dry my hair for a natural curl usually for the first 2 months after a fresh perm.  </li>
            <li>I comb thru in the shower every morning, gently squeeze out to dry, then apply this cream with my fingers from roots to ends.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft initially, but give it about an hour or two</li>
            <li>It works pretty well though but doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products.</li>
            <li>I applied this in my hair today due to the hot weather in the 90\\&quot;s.....</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way as the first time I applied it I put way too much in which it caused flaking.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it&#x27;s so cheap($9 for 25oz at your local beauty/weave supply shop) and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The reviewer who said that the product left lots of flakes in her hair probably did get an old batch.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (finger width ringlets), but when I was younger I got caught up in the relaxing trend.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very creamy and not very greasy mixture.</li>
            <li>However, I like to wear wigs for periods of times and when I came back to this product I must have bought an old bottle</li>
            <li>I have been using this as a moisturizer while experimenting with doing braid outs on my naturally curly/african american hair</li>
            <li>I would have really been upset that I spent my money on this.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair one week and the next week my hair still felt soft.</li>
            <li>For years I was using another conditioner that left my hair feeling soft, and helped it grow.</li>
            <li>That entire week my hair felt like soft cotton candy floating in butter.</li>
            <li>nearly 4 years ago at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>After letting some time pass, I bought this AGAIN ; nonetheless, it still failed to perform as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>They say your hair grows at least an half of a inch a month, sometimes more if you live in warmer climates.</li>
            <li>I add this to my hair and blow dry my hair and leaves my hair with a shine and not dull looking.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural 4b/c hair and this product works well.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t coarse, its fine but oddly enough as its growing out its quite thick.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Cantu, it was last summer and my hair was a mess.</li>
            <li>I then saturate my hair with Biolage Matrix Conditioning Balm, after which I detangle my hair, with a conair wide tooth shower comb, starting at the ends, working up, I don&#x27;t really section but Left side,</li>
            <li>My hair is so sensitive to products and when my hair is dry</li>
            <li>My hair (4B/C) was dry and tangled after use, but I assumed that was the struggle of having natural hair.</li>
            <li>I was expected a very soft feel, but that&#x27;s not what I get when using this product.  </li>
            <li>I use Cantu about every single day when I style my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, at first when I tried it I didn&#x27;t like it because I thought it was too thick for my fine strands for everyday use, but then I got the idea to put it in a spray bottle and dilute it with water, adding a few drops of various oils I had laying around and WOW!</li>
            <li>My natural hair was very very dry.</li>

            <li> It also have an amazing scent, a fresh-clean scent.</li>
            <li> I have to add a shine serum when blow drying because this product isn&#x27;t going to add any kind of shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li> According to the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org), this product contains chemicals that are highly hazardous to health including causing developmental problems, reproductive organ issues, and neurotoxicity.</li>
            <li> AQ-4100 Deluxe Shower Water Filter System with Adjustable Showerhead]]</li>
            <li> i really  like the way smell wonderful  </li>
            <li> REALLY like is that it&#x27;s a superb detangler.</li>
            <li> but it does condition so its nice</li>
            <li> It also, smells nice as well..</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair with a nice sheen,</li>
            <li> This products smells nice and I like the concept of anything Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Shea butter is great for hair, so i was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Cantu Shea Butter works great on my hair when it was relaxed and still works great on my natural hair!</li>
            <li> The feel was amazing and it just looked better.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> amazing buy, glad i invented my money it in</li>
            <li> I honestly for the life of me cannot understand why so many people say it flakes in their hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with how it moisturizes our hair and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I must say after 2 weeks of use and three washes the product is great and affordable, depending on the seller ;)</li>
            <li> Originally when I started using this product, like most others, I loved it.</li>
            <li> It does smell divine and has a very light feel to it, but it did not work out for me.    </li>
            <li> Very good purchase for someone with natural hair.</li>
            <li> We will get more.</li>
            <li> my favorite product for my kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair had more volume.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> this should be a white lady best kept secret......and was until now.</li>
            <li> Worked much better.     </li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> but I love the waves.</li>
            <li> BETTER</li>
            <li> you have many textures.</li>
            <li> Every 3 days is better.</li>
            <li> Every 3 days is better.</li>
            <li> so I did even more research on the product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake either, which can happen with so many leave ins.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> I recommend the argon oil version of it.&lt;br /&gt;Still love it and still recommend.</li>
            <li> (this doesn&#x27;t) so be sure to check.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I like it much better than the Knot</li>
            <li> For that reason, I sometimes run some Cantu Hair Milk spray through on top of the cream.</li>
            <li> I totally love this, the smell and every thing, I use it on my hair and my kid hair.</li>
            <li> And to top it off I still had frizz.</li>
            <li> Two stars because it smells okay.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> my  daughter hair look more healthy  </li>
            <li> Overall, great product !</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I fingered through them and got so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love both.</li>
            <li> The leave in by itself and the leave in mixed with the serum as a sealer are the best.</li>
            <li> and I love how my hair feels in the morning when I take the braids out.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Even if your hair is healthy...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get better results if you use this with leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year (or more) and I haven&#x27;t had to buy another one yet.</li>
            <li> It looks SO much better.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, getting off topic, I have been using Cantu Shea Butter for years, mostly while relaxed, saw a youtube user review it, and gave it a shot, and immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth and moisturized again, and of course smells amazing.</li>
            <li> if I thought I might use gel on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love Cantu Shea butter</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> That means I massage it into damp hair until I can&#x27;t see the cream any more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Since this is a cream, do make sure to apply it on damp hair, your hair will retain the cream more so because the water locks it in.</li>
            <li> I just love the Shea Butter leave in conditioner repair cream.</li>
            <li> I love how this feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> and i felt it frizzed up my hair more.  </li>
            <li> and i would probably get better results.</li>
            <li> That stuff is really moisturizing and feels great.</li>
            <li> - makes rubbing it in even more of a challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that now that I&#x27;m relaxed my hair appreciates this product even more and when I do rollersets with this and \\&quot;Chi Silk</li>
            <li> Best of all it smells great and actually makes my hair soft after use.</li>
            <li> They stuff smells pretty good and does work well.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I LOVE that it detangles my hair so easily.</li>
            <li> really liked the product because it didn&#x27;t take much to use on my hair to give it a nice feel.</li>
            <li> lol Overall nice job.</li>
            <li> Keep my hair soft, its very light weight, keeps my hair very nicely moisturized</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products, and really like Organic Root Stimulator, the Olive oil one...in case anyone&#x27;s comparing the two or looking for a good product.  </li>
            <li> The Cantu leave in conditioner is great for moisture and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I alternate between the two, as they are both incredible.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, it made my hair feel soft</li>
            <li> After trying many, many hair products to find what is good for my natural hair, I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR HAIR SMELL SOO GOOD AND LEAVES IT INCREDIBLY SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> Cantu Shea butter helped me detangle easily, and kept me detangled.</li>
            <li> Even if this product has a good amount of Canola oil in it and makes my hair soft, I like my oils better.</li>
            <li> First of all it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I tried it with Infusium 23 and it worked fine</li>
            <li> Why change something that was working just fine?</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick with my Prime subscription and arrived safely.</li>
            <li> However, this little jar is wonderful.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have very, very ,very thirsty hair!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels much softer, it&#x27;s nice and shiny</li>
            <li> In products as they leave my hair feeling light, shiny and silky; but the beauty supply store in my area didn&#x27;t carry it and I was pressed for time.</li>
            <li> For styling, I use it to smooth my frizzy edges.</li>
            <li> but I have to use about three tablespoons of it each time to get the frizzy hairs to smooth.</li>
            <li> This is such a great leave in.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> I avoid the clumping and flakes that others complain about by making sure the Cantu is thoroughly absorbed into my hair before I add my gel.</li>
            <li> it was cheap or else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product twice because I&#x27;ve heard such great reviews about Cantu Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly very slightly coconut \\&quot;y\\&quot;, best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the bang for the buck!,,,,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I hoped for and more.</li>
            <li> good thing about this is that it is very cheap and can be found in Wal-Mart, Target, and at the BX/PX on military installations.</li>
            <li> Excellent on natural hair or curly hair for extra conditioning.  </li>
            <li> This cream was great for my son&#x27;s close cropped dry hair.    </li>
            <li> I co-washed my hair, then used this in place of my normal conditioner, then loved it so much I used it as my leave in too.</li>
            <li> Soft and had a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li> After this I make a mixture of Cantu(two fingers worth)natural Jojoba oil(That I get from Nature with Love)(a cap full), Meadfoam seed oil(half a cap full of),</li>
            <li> Cantu doesn&#x27;t flake in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell like fish or anything else,It keeps my hair hydrated and nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Cantu doesn&#x27;t flake in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell like fish or anything else,It keeps my hair hydrated and nice and soft.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning and rinse it out my 4a/b hair is full of life.</li>
            <li> Granted this smells good, but I supposed this is for hair types that are very coarse as my hair is not.</li>
            <li> My hair has been treated with blonde highlights for three months now, and fairly often.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just works better for some than others, I would be very upset</li>
            <li> I absolute love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner so much.</li>
            <li> We love this conditioner so much</li>
            <li> She has this beautiful black hair and this made it so manageable after washes.</li>
            <li> Instead I used it after washing with the mild splash of tea tree oil and the cantu alone to twist.</li>
            <li> I not only love how this calms my hair, but I love the smell and feel of my hair afterward.  </li>
            <li> It dries out really quickly on my 3b hair texture</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this stuff to (quickly) rub into my hair.</li>
            <li> when I apply this to my hair it makes my hair soft ,easy to detangle and makes it easy for me to style.</li>
            <li> My new growth is much more manageable after using this.</li>
            <li> but I guess not as strong because that one really works for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice amount</li>
            <li> this prevents breakage and puts more moister in your hair and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I also happen to like the results far better than Salerm 21 Leave In.</li>
            <li> It does leave it smooth and more manageable the next day.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST conditioners there is especially for coarse, thick hair, but it&#x27;s great for any type of hair.  </li>
            <li> She has a more courly kinky natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Now pink oil products cannot be mixed, but this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely had tangles since I began using this.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, but seems to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> but my friend was right</li>
            <li> right before you take them lose.</li>
            <li> Just not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> she was right</li>
            <li> I have learned the lesson of finding the right product for your hair.</li>
            <li> one of my other daughter&#x27;s hair, and mine, this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and easy to condition and style.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> But this is a good daily leave-in for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair (about an inch all around my head) from by big chop and Cantu is great for moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product very much and will not purchase it again but will smell it once in a while.</li>
            <li> I have found SheaMoisture to be a huge improvement for my natural hair needs.</li>
            <li> First of all I was told about this product by a friend of color.</li>
            <li> Decided most it can do is make my hair greasy and I can use extra shampoo or two and wash it out.</li>
            <li> but it sure made this blonde hair &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use to put tea tree oil in my hair first after a wash to keep it moist while I was twisting it, and then put both an olive oil creme and the cantu butter for moisture.</li>
            <li> In mine, my sides are wavy, my top is 4b(spiral ramen noodle like) and my back is (kitchen)(yes I said KITCHEN)</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;d add coconut oil on it and wrap it wet, the next morning, it fell beautifully.</li>
            <li> So looking for a better leave in conditioner I found this at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> great for thick hair</li>
            <li> Cantu is fantastic and completely repairs split ends.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look pretty  and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product around May 2011.</li>
            <li> not  flakes, exactly, but</li>
            <li> The leave - in is moisturize my hair on the first try.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s way too greasy to leave in your hair and go to bed with.</li>
            <li> However, i do think when I am in further in my loc journey I will use it more often.</li>
            <li> Glad only paid 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years or so now and when i first got it</li>
            <li> I love using Cantu, it is not my first time using it and would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a deep conditioning that you can leave in for days.</li>
            <li> I love this product and want to try the entire line.</li>
            <li> I love Cantu products personally.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not a fan of this conditioner, I have found one that works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> Thats the fun of having natural hair!!!</li>
            <li> Some of their other products don&#x27;t have as nice ingredients as this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a good product... especially at a relatively inexpensive price!</li>
            <li> I started transitioning to natural and this seemed to be the most mentioned leave-in conditioner on all the natural hair blogs.  </li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner on the reccommendation of three websites--which reccommended a good moisturizer for African American course hair (like mine).  </li>
            <li> I leave my 3b/3a hair  super soft and manageable and the jar lasts forever!</li>
            <li> However, when I used it during my transition from relaxed to natural hair, it broke the relaxed ends off and did not go well with heat of any kind like blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Great job at moisturizing my dry, frizzy, long hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product it turned my dry hair from being out in the sun to replenished moistured hair.</li>
            <li> Despite the nice,creamy texture and pleasant smell (pros) ,this product was sub par to say the least.</li>
            <li> I kept a strict regimen of certain conditioners and shampoos now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get a few more in this week!</li>
            <li> I try not to add too much because it can weigh hair down very easily.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really frizzy when its humid but</li>
            <li> YET THE WHOLE LINE OF CANTU PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> It really is important that I point out I sleep with a slik scarf and the day after the next day when I shower</li>
            <li> It really is important that I point out I sleep with a slik scarf and the day after the next day when I shower</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo and conditioner that much.  </li>
            <li> I really dont do shampoo anyways -</li>
            <li> Nothing that really amazes me though.</li>
            <li> My hair felt repaired and ready</li>
            <li> Hopefully this hasn&#x27;t messed my hair up too much.</li>
            <li> When used with the cantu shea butter coconut curling cream that really brings out curls, it improves the bounciness.</li>
            <li> I also tried a twist out with those three products and this leave in conditioner really gave it moisture that lasts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a shine and if you use too much it can give you a residue feeling.</li>
            <li> as a note, if you&#x27;re like me and you find a product that works really well with your hair</li>
            <li> I realized how greasy this stuff really was.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about this product in YouTube videos.  </li>
            <li> I am still testing how much to use in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a not so well promoted line of hair products that is reasonably priced in Walmart, on Amazon but not in CVS.</li>
            <li> It moisturized my hair very well.</li>
            <li> It smells really yummy too(which</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Actually it is more that expected.  </li>
            <li> i really did like it and still loves the smell too...</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> , it really does work with any texture of hair.</li>
            <li> Another thing I really like is that when I use it to set my hair with rods/rollers, my curls come out super soft and bouncy - not hard and crunchy like gels and setting lotions.  </li>
            <li> This product was a pleasant surprise, as I normally use  Advantage Brazilian Hair Repair to roller set my thick relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> But the Cream it self is wonderful, I have thick 4a/b hair, and it is very porous due to over processing and coloring for years....</li>
            <li> My hair is long and strong and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The next day took the twists out and my hair was sooooooooo beautiful, soft the twisted curls were so cute.</li>
            <li> More so than all the other products I have purchased</li>
            <li> I had to do the big chop as a result when I had a nice, long length.</li>
            <li> I will try one more time with less product on my hair but after that if it doesn&#x27;t work straight in garbage.</li>
            <li> I actually got the product cheaper from amazon including shipping, it shipped super fast, and it was well packed.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m finally finding that to be true.</li>
            <li> Cantu helps boost hair growth by keeping your hair moisturized and full of the necessary ingredients that your hair needs to grow.</li>
            <li> I started taking vitamins and using shampoo a lot less and my conditioners more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not labeled as a detangler, but my comb glides easily through my wet hair when I apply this product.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Cantu for my roller sets and the results were always fairly decent, but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy from the conditioner, but it really truly looks twice as healthy as it did before the treatment.  </li>
            <li> Mind you, the most I use on my entire head is about 3 dime sized amounts before rollersetting and a couple spritzs daily, so you definetly don&#x27;t need a lot to do the job.</li>
            <li> Right side, Kitchen I work through with the shower running through , when all my hair is detangled, with biolage still in, I run my comb through with the shower running through my whole head combing forward and around my face letting the comb and water rinse, Then I flip my hair back and rinse the hairline.</li>
            <li> so i highly recommended this for naturals.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since learned that my hair doesn&#x27;t like a lot of products with high protein.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d watched a plethora of YouTube videos and read a ton of high star reviews on this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, truly does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend</li>
            <li> Admittedly this is a pretty heavy product so if you have fine or oily hair</li>
            <li> Even though the product doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s for curls, it enhanced my natural curls really well and gave definition and shine.</li>
            <li> Using it, plus co-washing my hair worked very well and my hair has gotten considerably longer since I started using it a year ago.</li>
            <li> I just started this natural journey and I honesty can&#x27;t say much about what it does to your hair.</li>
            <li> make sure you get the cantu everyday moister cream to put on your braids</li>
            <li> The cream has a thick consitancy and also smells nice.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream itself is thick and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I simply wash well mostly condition, apply the cream, air dry and go.</li>
            <li> I also tried using this product to do a braid out on dry hair and noticed a ton of breakage (I estimate more than 200 short strands of hair)and</li>
            <li> It left the ends completely frizzy and tangled after blow-drying, making my hair more susceptible to heat damage when I tried to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I get it locally at either cvs or walgreens because it&#x27;s right up the street.</li>
            <li> your hair is free of other products.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use much, this pretty decent sized tub, lasts me for months, and I use it every single day, minimum, maybe twice in one day if I need to redo my hair for an event or something.</li>
            <li> When I tried the Cantu I was careful not to use more than necessary as it is in a jar and not portioned out with a pump.</li>
            <li> After a few uses this product begins to make your hair incredibly soft, not to mention healthy.</li>
            <li> , it really did nothing, I find the best way to use Cantu is as a base to my hair mixture.</li>
            <li> , it really did nothing, I find the best way to use Cantu is as a base to my hair mixture.</li>
            <li> It keeps my 4b/c hair very soft.</li>
            <li> and it let my curls so moisturizer and soft!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A NATURAL HAIR PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> When I combed my hair, there was more shedding than usual.</li>
            <li> Definitely would buy again;)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really absorb into my hair, just sat on top like a heavy styling product, and left a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I only use this for special occassions or when I know my hair is going to be extra frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My new growth doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li> I did find that the first time that I used this product on freshly washed damp hair, I noticed the softness that everybody rants about after my hair was fully air dried.</li>
            <li> Now I used it by itself, on dry hair and wet hair when I first Big Chopped in 2009, and it was OK</li>
            <li> Now I used it by itself, on dry hair and wet hair when I first Big Chopped in 2009, and it was OK</li>
            <li> Whether I used this leave-in on wet or dry hair, it would just sit on top of my hair and not do any moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, it made combing the hair easier and tame.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smells good, but I had trouble getting it to soak in to my hair no matter how much or little I put in it.  </li>
            <li> It does not play well with gels, so for naturals you absolutely cannot have any gel in  your hair before or after adding Cantu, it will most definitely pop out in little white balls...</li>
            <li> Then I put it up on curlers and went to clean the house and do some odd and end jobs in the home.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Your face is not greasy, but feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept nearly all of my growth.</li>
            <li> I say nearly because I do trim it.</li>
            <li> if you are natural or going natural this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> If you are a natural, you&#x27;ve heard of it.  </li>
            <li> My hair always feels soft after I wash,condition, moisturize and seal my hair but after using this product I must say I&#x27;m upset.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair incredibly soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner makes my hair feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> : this conditioner should not be used on straightened hair because it will cause it to revert to the hair&#x27;s natural pattern, causing frizz.)</li>
            <li> but we all have natural hair.</li>
            <li> Making it so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It makes our hair soft and easier to comb.</li>
            <li> continue to use this on our hair (except the young&#x27;un).</li>
            <li> I am a natural with wavy/curly that presser her hair.</li>
            <li> I have about 4b hair and it makes my hair so soft and manageable for styling after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> have been continuing my hunt and experimenting with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> so with managing frizz but the soft manageability it gives my hair outweighs all of that for</li>
            <li> I used to leave this in my l.o.c method but after 6months of being natural</li>
            <li> I applied this after washing my hair &amp; this leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I tell you and makes hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> my friends who were going natural were talking about it.</li>
            <li> It worked well when I had completely relaxed hair and did roller sets to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my natural hair without heat, but I noticed it did not moisturize like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It was a complete disaster.</li>
            <li> I would say it is a product that doesn&#x27;t agree with my natural hair, but might work for someone else&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I really want to go back to being a brunette, but I need to repair my hair.  </li>
            <li> I just started to use this product and it made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair isn&#x27;t soft and silky yet.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Why pay so much for it on here when it&#x27;s only $5.97 at Walmart?</li>
            <li> However it made my hair too soft</li>
            <li> and i think its time to give it up and try their natural hair line leave in.</li>
            <li> every since I went natural</li>
            <li> and it detangles and makes it soft.</li>
            <li> my hair texture is soft when I awake.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m completely natural with a mixture of 4A and 4B hair;</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My mother who is all natural stole the jar and uses it as a styling cream every morning and puts it in her hair before she goes to sleep.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in, sometimes overnight and wash it in the morning and it stays soft for days (even after i went swimming in chlorine)</li>
            <li> If you want soft hair, this is the stuff to buy.</li>
            <li> It takes some coaxing for it to completely disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; my hair comes out soft, silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This may or may not have been made for hair other than fine and blonde</li>
            <li> It softened my hair right back up with no residue or white flakes.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a really wavy curl pattern to hair natural 2b hair, I noticed that it made her hair soft but dry.</li>
            <li> This is in the ethnic aisle, I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;black hair\\&quot; but more coarse, mixed ethnicity type hair.  </li>
            <li> I left it in for a good hour, and I spent some time outside, so it did get a little sun-warmed under the plastic cap.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that it is very hard to find and local stores don&#x27;t do a good job keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> What I love is that the set is so firm but so soft at the same time, giving your style extra staying power.</li>
            <li> I heard so many great reviews for this product, especially on YouTube, but I must say that  this product is absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> came sooner than expected and does exactly what I thought it does... detangle?</li>
            <li> Not a cheap product ,true to its word.</li>
            <li> All Natural Leave in Conditioner Detangler( which you find at growafrohairlong.com)(eye measure about two fingers worth or a little</li>
            <li> I thought I put on too much the first time so on the second day, I tried using less</li>
            <li> It is so extremely moisturizing and really makes your hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use it when I want to air dry my hair for a natural curl usually for the first 2 months after a fresh perm.  </li>
            <li> I comb thru in the shower every morning, gently squeeze out to dry, then apply this cream with my fingers from roots to ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft initially, but give it about an hour or two</li>
            <li> It works pretty well though but doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products.</li>
            <li> I applied this in my hair today due to the hot weather in the 90\\&quot;s.....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as the first time I applied it I put way too much in which it caused flaking.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it&#x27;s so cheap($9 for 25oz at your local beauty/weave supply shop) and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The reviewer who said that the product left lots of flakes in her hair probably did get an old batch.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (finger width ringlets), but when I was younger I got caught up in the relaxing trend.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very creamy and not very greasy mixture.</li>
            <li> However, I like to wear wigs for periods of times and when I came back to this product I must have bought an old bottle</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a moisturizer while experimenting with doing braid outs on my naturally curly/african american hair</li>
            <li> I would have really been upset that I spent my money on this.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair one week and the next week my hair still felt soft.</li>
            <li> For years I was using another conditioner that left my hair feeling soft, and helped it grow.</li>
            <li> That entire week my hair felt like soft cotton candy floating in butter.</li>
            <li> nearly 4 years ago at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> After letting some time pass, I bought this AGAIN ; nonetheless, it still failed to perform as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> They say your hair grows at least an half of a inch a month, sometimes more if you live in warmer climates.</li>
            <li> I add this to my hair and blow dry my hair and leaves my hair with a shine and not dull looking.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4b/c hair and this product works well.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t coarse, its fine but oddly enough as its growing out its quite thick.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Cantu, it was last summer and my hair was a mess.</li>
            <li> I then saturate my hair with Biolage Matrix Conditioning Balm, after which I detangle my hair, with a conair wide tooth shower comb, starting at the ends, working up, I don&#x27;t really section but Left side,</li>
            <li> My hair is so sensitive to products and when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> My hair (4B/C) was dry and tangled after use, but I assumed that was the struggle of having natural hair.</li>
            <li> I was expected a very soft feel, but that&#x27;s not what I get when using this product.  </li>
            <li> I use Cantu about every single day when I style my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, at first when I tried it I didn&#x27;t like it because I thought it was too thick for my fine strands for everyday use, but then I got the idea to put it in a spray bottle and dilute it with water, adding a few drops of various oils I had laying around and WOW!</li>
            <li> My natural hair was very very dry.</li>
            <li> I do not like the weighed down feeling this product leaves on my hair and am currently in the process of looking for a clarifying shampoo to get this out of my hair and go somewhere to get my Garnier leave in conditioner that I normally use.</li>
            <li> In July, I made the mistake of using it then blowing out and flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to add anything else to your hair except for coconut oil to seal in the moisture if you are styling a twist-out, braid-out or flat twist!</li>
            <li> I tried it and it left my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I only use this on the tips of my hair when they are dry and on my damp hair all over when I am curling it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, moisturized, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I can be out in the humidity here in the South, hair gets a bit frizzed up, and dry, use this as a leave in at night, the next morning</li>
            <li> more)and two drops of Patchouli Essential oil(good for scent and itchy scalp) in a empty jar and put the lid on and shake till well mixed.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for people who have my hair type which is type 2b - wavy, frizzy, difficult to style, medium and fine strands, dense amount when measuring ponytail circumference (wikipedia).</li>
            <li> However, if you could careless about the potentially detrimental effects to your well-being and are only interested in the superficial aspects of the product such as \\&quot;does it make my hair soft\\&quot;, than this product if definitely for you.</li>
            <li> First off, I am African American and Relaxed, secondly, I transitioned for about a year and a half before giving in to the \\&quot;creamy crack\\&quot;, because my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair is seriously thick...alot of work.</li>
            <li> I have used other expensive products that I was satisfied with so all I have to say</li>
            <li> its soft and helps detangle it a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to try long term relationship by herbal essence.</li>
            <li> my hair is long.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time..</li>
            <li> I have a long hair and it gets too sticky after using it.</li>
            <li> wish I would have known about this product a long time ago....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time coming on my hair journey.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it dried  my hair out within a few hours, my hair flaked a bit and the ends of my hair were dryer than ever.</li>
            <li> Before that my hair was really dry and the ends were kinky and hard to comb, but after using this it is very manageable.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes a while to dry and you have to be careful about using too much.</li>
            <li> It did NOT make my hair feel soft or conditioned, it felt stiff like glue on my hands</li>
            <li> My hair was short, thick and tangly and it dried up very fast bt</li>
            <li> This product is extremely drying and the texture of my hair is left feeling dryer than ever after i use it.</li>
            <li> It was sticky, filmy, and left little white clump balls in her hair.  </li>
            <li> but that is not worth it if I have big giant white flakes and product in my black hair.</li>
            <li> This product is so bad, I really just want to laugh.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I let it air dry to define curls.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and it felt as if there was still product in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product did not leave my hair flaky or dry.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> On dry hair it works wonders too.</li>
            <li> If you have dry ends, split ends, damaged hair...</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and brittle but as soon as I applied it my hair</li>
            <li> sooooooooooo, I bought this product because I have starter locs and my hair is soooo dry.</li>
            <li> If you apply while your hair is dry, your hair will have a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; look to it, as if you don&#x27;t moisturize it.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry to my dismay.</li>
            <li> I used as directed and this has left my hair feeling heavy, greasy, and gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rocking my hair in its natural state for the past 4 years now</li>
            <li> About two hours later took my hair down to go to an appointment</li>
            <li> and I notice that the top right side of my hair has broken off really bad.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is not high up on the ingredient list, guess what is??  </li>
            <li> only real negative I have is that some jars haven&#x27;t been whipped very well.</li>
            <li> I have used it on both wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> I like this product as a conditioner ive put this on wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> I was super dissapointed and angry.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is very thick so take care not to put too much on your hair or it will weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Still in the shower( can get a little messy),I apply my mixture to the all sides, taking a fingerful at a time, combing it through with my fingers, last</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use just a tiny amount (and I do mean tiny) on dry hair to freshen up the smell of my hair and protect against the humidity.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and very thirsty.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t whip it you might notice that it&#x27;s harder to spread throughout your hair and it might leave little white flakes in your hair instead of dissolving fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also smells like play dough and seems cheap and artificial.</li>
            <li> but my hair sucks it up until there is just enough left to leave some softness.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m extremely careful about using that</li>
            <li> , I wet with room temp water from my shower</li>
            <li> My hair at the time was relaxed and when I would apply it to my wet hair, it made it easier to manage and comb.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> When with eco styler gel, my twist out lasted longer which was expected.</li>
            <li> (I use a wide tooth comb).</li>
            <li> I experience minimal buildup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like pink lotion but a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after carefully reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing, stopped using it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> All my daughters and sons have natural hair and this did wonders for my baby with the thick kinky hair.</li>
            <li> We both have thick natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not rinse this mixture out, That to me is product down the drain, I do not comb or touch my hair, for at least 3days, I do let my hair naturally air dry.</li>
            <li> , That to me is product down the drain, I do not comb or touch my hair, for at least 3days, I do let my hair naturally air dry.</li>
            <li> It works plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I have found that this leave in conditioner may have issues building up but not much at all when used with other cantu products.</li>
            <li> A lot comes in the bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I finally did try this on my relaxed hair and my thirteen-year- old daughters natural 2b hair, I was not impressed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer Trini who said the product doesn&#x27;t work with other products.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work with any other creme products.</li>
            <li> However, I have learned that you can&#x27;t mix it with other products.</li>
            <li> I also use other products from this line.  </li>
            <li> I see from other posts that this product cannot be used with other products.  </li>
            <li> However, as other products during the week are added to my hair, the build up became a bit flaky and i didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> I do not experience any build up or flakiness unless I mix with any other sort of cream or gel.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews and watched some YouTube videos regarding the product and learned that the ingredients changed and that it has mineral oil in it now.</li>
            <li> But I would like to try other products now so that I can compare.</li>
            <li> I do use this product with other products.</li>
            <li> I mix this product all the time with other products and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> Before using this I had to add other products so that my curls were defined.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read some of the other reviews before using this product.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s very thick and has little movement then it hasn&#x27;t been whipped very well.</li>
            <li> but I used a diffuser instead of letting my hair air dry and then finished with a little bit of hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of things from factories after finding out Acne Products only make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> My flat twist lasted for a few days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to judge because while I have about 4 inches of new growth, the product reacts a little differently on my relaxed ends (still have 5 inches of relaxed hair).  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good for natural black hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was very short (ear length) and hard to manage until I started using CANTU.</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions and ensure (at least with the initial use)that</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> over the years my hair has broken alot, but I can contribute that to my indecisiveness with chemical vs natural.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that had a slimy over an oily feel that was thick enough to coat my hair and allow the curls to drink the moisture.</li>
            <li> or it was tampered because it was not the stuff that i remembered it turned white and flaked on my hair and wasnt that thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this product, but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>
            <li> your hair will feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> Luck must have been shining down on me the day I learned about this conditioner online.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick enough to help define curls and weigh down a little</li>
            <li> Hazelnut Oil(little less than half a cap full),Taiykel</li>
            <li> I typically use Garnier Leave</li>
            <li> So I bought it for less than 4 dollars, took it home conditioned my hair and while dampish/wet sectioned my hair and slathered this stuff on each section, rattooth combed it out</li>
            <li> and it was less sticky but still greasy.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair thin and curly, but seems thick and nappy when dry.</li>
            <li> Not knowing how to care for it, my curls became a frizzy damaged mess.  </li>
            <li> This product is a little cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave in conditioner followed by a little bit of herbal oil to seal the moisture in (people who complain that this isnt moisturizing probably dont use a little olive/herbal oil to seal the moisture).  </li>
            <li> But my hair loves moisture and soaks up everything like a sponge so even that feeling goes away, given a little time.</li>
            <li> It even defines curls a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewers are talking about.</li>
            <li> I personally have really weak hair and this treatment helped me to strengthen it within the four months of my using it.</li>
            <li> my youngest daughter, who has the more wavy, loose curl type hair, this stuff was horrible.  </li>
            <li> Well I washed my hair, towel dried and applied about a quarter size in my hand.</li>
            <li> My reason for leaving off a star is because I feel I am missing some shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy as god knows what</li>
            <li> It is really heavy and conditions my 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li> it feels like conditioner and it feels heavy</li>
            <li> My curls are limp and frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li> My beef is that I could have achieved the same results with some of my other leave in conditioning treatments without the weird warnings.</li>
            <li> beats the heck out of the stiff hair gel I used for years...</li>
            <li> is tight curls and all over is very,very thick and shrinks a lot..</li>
            <li> And by quickly I mean less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Hair is moisturized and curly, but a little dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after my first try.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy but it made my hair too soft to hold any style twist out/braid out</li>
            <li> No more of that.</li>
            <li> Looked like the lid wasn&#x27;t even on it or wasn&#x27;t twisted on hard enough.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is prone to frizz and has damaged ends from a bad highlighting job.</li>
            <li> but least I use 3 pumps of ISO BouncyCre&#x27;me Curl Texturizer fingering it through my sides and ends.</li>
            <li> I also am on prescribed meds and color my hair twice a year, I take vitamins,women&#x27;s every day,iron,fish oil and hair/skin, B-12 complex and biotin.</li>

            <li> After trying deep conditioning treatments, I end up cutting off the beyond damaged hair.</li>
            <li> this product is meant for women with corse thick hair.</li>

            <li> Not cute!</li>
            <li> But if your hair&#x27;s thick and needs some serious moisture I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Half the stuff in it is in the expensive night creams.</li>
            <li> I have a serious problem with this and am looking for another product to use instead.</li>
            <li> Was not good to my hair, i heard a lot about ot, but i did not see any resulte with my hair, maybe could be helpful for others</li>
            <li> But me, it made these disgusting white balls in my natural hair that was difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely shocked by the results and can&#x27;t believe how long my hair is now.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ve got frizz and dryness issues and lately my usual conditioning regimen isn&#x27;t doing the trick as well as it used to.</li>
            <li> I say at least once ever 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I used it in combination with another styling product that I regularly use, and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was very dull and for the life of me wouldn&#x27;t stop breaking.</li>
            <li> I absolutely don&#x27;t recommend this product, not to a friend or even my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> and I have never experienced the wonders that this cream has worked on every root,strand, and ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> It feels thin</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t half bad.</li>
            <li> But I noticed that it would get a weird nauseating petroleum like smell from the mixture.</li>
            <li> Wrong move.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> I disappointed I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dryness which is the root my evil.</li>
            <li> This morning, I unwrapped my hair and OMG I&#x27; was disgusted.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> The worst part was the build up</li>
            <li> It just sits and coats my strands, making me feel disgusting.</li>
            <li> It is HORRIBLE, and I don&#x27;t use that word liberally.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a little cheaper in stores. It works pretty well though but doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products.</li>
            <li> We will get more. All my daughters and sons have natural hair and this did wonders for my baby with the thick kinky hair. She has this beautiful black hair and this made it so manageable after washes.</li>
            <li> my favorite product for my kinky curly hair.  Detangles and smooths.  Use it as soon as I get out of shower and wrap hair in tshirt.  Pleasant smell and great  texture</li>
            <li> Items were received on time and in order. Was a bit of a problem with the condition of the box and on e of the bottles was slightly open but no fault of theirs and was fault of courier delivering the product. All in all a wonderful experience. Am I going to shop with them again... MOST DEFINATELY!!  like it when people make me feel like a cherished client!</li>
            <li> This is a great product because it smells absolutely wonderful.  I use it when I want to air dry my hair for a natural curl usually for the first 2 months after a fresh perm.  It leaves my hair smelling so great!  I use a lot of heat on my hair otherwise so I use this product after a shampoo to protect.  I have to add a shine serum when blow drying because this product isn&#x27;t going to add any kind of shine to my hair.  Sometimes I use just a tiny amount (and I do mean tiny) on dry hair to freshen up the smell of my hair and protect against the humidity.  My hair gets really frizzy when its humid but not when I have Cantu in it.  It&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, smells great and I love it. First of all I was told about this product by a friend of color. She told me that this should be a &amp;#34;white lady best kept secret&amp;#34;. Well I tried it. Decided most it can do is make my hair greasy and I can use extra shampoo or two and wash it out. Well I washed my hair, towel dried and applied about a quarter size in my hand. Rubbed it together and applied to my hair. First of all it smells nice. Then I decided to blow dry my hair. It looked great. Soft and had a nice feel to it. Then I put it up on curlers and went to clean the house and do some odd and end jobs in the home. About two hours later took my hair down to go to an appointment and wow. My hair had more volume. The feel was amazing and it just looked better. This may or may not have been made for hair other than fine and blonde but it sure made this blonde hair &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO NEXT after reading whats in it I thought why couldn&#x27;t you use it on your face as a night cream. Half the stuff in it is in the expensive night creams. So I tried that. Well it works. Your face is not greasy, but feels soft and hydrated. Walla! I get this stuff at Walmart. $3.36 for a bottle. Get it in the section for ethnic hair and you kill two birds with one stone. Hair and face. I am 59. My hair looks better than it has in years. My face looks and feels great and I am not using 35.00 face cream any longer. It works plain and simple. I may be white but my friend was right this should be a white lady best kept secret......and was until now.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer Trini who said the product doesn&#x27;t work with other products. You must follow the directions and ensure (at least with the initial use)that your hair is free of other products. I tried it with Infusium 23 and it worked fine but it doesn&#x27;t work with any other creme products. Even though the product doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s for curls, it enhanced my natural curls really well and gave definition and shine. The product didn&#x27;t leave flakes in my hair like Ms. Jessie&#x27;s did (after 3 days).  The reviewer who said that the product left lots of flakes in her hair probably did get an old batch. I must say after 2 weeks of use and three washes the product is great and affordable, depending on the seller ;)</li>
            <li> Very good product for your hair.  Makes hair soft and easy to condition and style.</li>
            <li> Originally when I started using this product, like most others, I loved it. Using it, plus co-washing my hair worked very well and my hair has gotten considerably longer since I started using it a year ago. It keeps my 4b/c hair very soft. However, I have learned that you can&#x27;t mix it with other products. I use to put tea tree oil in my hair first after a wash to keep it moist while I was twisting it, and then put both an olive oil creme and the cantu butter for moisture. But I noticed that it would get a weird nauseating petroleum like smell from the mixture. Instead I used it after washing with the mild splash of tea tree oil and the cantu alone to twist. Worked much better.     I also had concerns about the chemicals in the leave in. According to the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org), this product contains chemicals that are highly hazardous to health including causing developmental problems, reproductive organ issues, and neurotoxicity. I have a serious problem with this and am looking for another product to use instead. However, if you could careless about the potentially detrimental effects to your well-being and are only interested in the superficial aspects of the product such as \\&quot;does it make my hair soft\\&quot;, than this product if definitely for you.</li>
            <li> Product leaves my hair silky. I have 4B hair. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with going from permed to naural, ughhhh. My hair isn&#x27;t coarse, its fine but oddly enough as its growing out its quite thick. I&#x27;ve had problems with dryness which is the root my evil. over the years my hair has broken alot, but I can contribute that to my indecisiveness with chemical vs natural. It&#x27;s taken years but my hair and I have finally come to terms. I do texturize my hair, only to loosen the curl but for MY hair I wait 5-6 weeks between retouches(jus works for me). I kept a strict regimen of certain conditioners and shampoos now. When I first started using Cantu, it was last summer and my hair was a mess. It was very dull and for the life of me wouldn&#x27;t stop breaking. I started taking vitamins and using shampoo a lot less and my conditioners more. Occassionally using a clarifying shampoo but I&#x27;m extremely careful about using that too(it dries my hair out). My hair is so sensitive to products and when my hair is dry it&#x27;s EXTREMELY dry. My hair was very short (ear length) and hard to manage until I started using CANTU. They say your hair grows at least an half of a inch a month, sometimes more if you live in warmer climates. Well I&#x27;m finally finding that to be true. I&#x27;ve kept nearly all of my growth. I say nearly because I do trim it. Its growing out so silky and wavey. I have beautiful wispy curls almost to my shoulders and I can run my fingers through it and no greasey feel. Yes ladies I said, \\&quot;Run my fingers through it.\\&quot; Its amazing. I don&#x27;t straighten hair though, but I suppose I could but I love the waves. Sometimes I let it air dry to define curls. I&#x27;m constantly being ask how do I get my hair to do this. I simply wash well mostly condition, apply the cream, air dry and go. I&#x27;m absolutely shocked by the results and can&#x27;t believe how long my hair is now. But I WOULD NEVER PAY 10 BUCKS when you can go to walmart and get for FIVE FOR THE SAME SIZE JAR!</li>
            <li> This product was great! It&#x27;s such a nice amount and it let my curls so moisturizer and soft! I&#x27;m very happy with this product :)</li>
            <li> if you are natural or going natural this is the product for you. this product is meant for women with corse thick hair. if you are relaxed then i suggest you find something else because you are not going to get the same effect. your hair will feel weighed down. with naturals you need all the moister you can get lol! so i highly recommended this for naturals. also if you are going to do a braid or twist out make sure you get the cantu everyday moister cream to put on your braids right before you take them lose. this prevents breakage and puts more moister in your hair and leaves it soft and shiny. againg THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH RELAXED HAIR. BETTER YET THE WHOLE LINE OF CANTU PRODUCTS. THIS IS A NATURAL HAIR PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> You have to understand in one head of hair you have many textures. In mine, my sides are wavy, my top is 4b(spiral ramen noodle like) and my back is (kitchen)(yes I said KITCHEN) is tight curls and all over is very,very thick and shrinks a lot..I have mid upper back length. That being said I use this product this way: I have a [[ASIN:B0016BS9T6 Aquasana AQ-4100 Deluxe Shower Water Filter System with Adjustable Showerhead]] softener filter on my shower head, I wet with room temp water from my shower I DO NOT poo(shampoo)at all, I haven&#x27;t done so since March 2009! Looking in the fog less[[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]] mirror(I bought on Amazon) I then saturate my hair with Biolage Matrix Conditioning Balm, after which I detangle my hair, with a conair wide tooth shower comb, starting at the ends, working up, I don&#x27;t really section but Left side, Right side, Kitchen I work through with the shower running through , when all my hair is detangled, with biolage still in, I run my comb through with the shower running through my whole head combing forward and around my face letting the comb and water rinse, Then I flip my hair back and rinse the hairline. After this I make a mixture of Cantu(two fingers worth)natural Jojoba oil(That I get from Nature with Love)(a cap full), Meadfoam seed oil(half a cap full of), Hazelnut Oil(little less than half a cap full),Taiykel All Natural Leave in Conditioner Detangler( which you find at growafrohairlong.com)(eye measure about two fingers worth or a little more)and two drops of Patchouli Essential oil(good for scent and itchy scalp) in a empty jar and put the lid on and shake till well mixed. Still in the shower( can get a little messy),I apply my mixture to the all sides, taking a fingerful at a time, combing it through with my fingers, last but least I use 3 pumps of ISO BouncyCre&#x27;me Curl Texturizer fingering it through my sides and ends.I do not rinse this mixture out, That to me is product down the drain, I do not comb or touch my hair, for at least 3days, I do let my hair naturally air dry. It takes about 30min for this process and I do it hours before I have to go anywhere.  I do this about every 3-5 days. Every 3 days is better. Cantu doesn&#x27;t flake in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell like fish or anything else,It keeps my hair hydrated and nice and soft. Now I used it by itself, on dry hair and wet hair when I first Big Chopped in 2009, and it was OK, it really did nothing, I find the best way to use Cantu is as a base to my hair mixture. My hair stays moist and hydrated for 3 days. It really is important that I point out I sleep with a slik scarf and the day after the next day when I shower I just rinse my hair in room temp water no product needed(I do this till I detangle again), shake my hair and go, I do not use Cantu every day, and I only use it in this mixture. I also am on prescribed meds and color my hair twice a year, I take vitamins,women&#x27;s every day,iron,fish oil and hair/skin, B-12 complex and biotin. I drink lots of water, and don&#x27;t care about shrinkage. Cantu is a good product you just have to play around with it, and if doesn&#x27;t work for you, it&#x27;s not the end of the World.not rinse this mixture out, That to me is product down the drain, I do not comb or touch my hair, for at least 3days, I do let my hair naturally air dry.

            <li> this product is greattttt especially for the price. Best of all it smells great and actually makes my hair soft after use.</li>
            <li> If you are a natural, you&#x27;ve heard of it.  I kept hearing about it so I had to get it.  I tried it and it left my hair dry.  Tried it again and again, all different ways but my hair just didn&#x27;t like it.  It smells good but I would find that walking around and smelling it made me feel nauseas.  This is a protein product and I&#x27;ve since learned that my hair doesn&#x27;t like a lot of products with high protein.  Profectiv Mega Growth is also protein but I guess not as strong because that one really works for my hair.</li>
            <li> Review based on product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the product because it didn&#x27;t take much to use on my hair to give it a nice feel. My hair at the time was relaxed and when I would apply it to my wet hair, it made it easier to manage and comb. After I&#x27;d add coconut oil on it and wrap it wet, the next morning, it fell beautifully. The only thing is that it is very thick so take care not to put too much on your hair or it will weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This product is so bad, I really just want to laugh. This product is extremely drying and the texture of my hair is left feeling dryer than ever after i use it. I bought this product last week at my local Walgreens. I heard so many great reviews for this product, especially on YouTube, but I must say that  this product is absolutely disgusting. The first time I used it, it dried  my hair out within a few hours, my hair flaked a bit and the ends of my hair were dryer than ever. I was so disappointed so I did even more research on the product and I found out that this product is made with animal parts and it actually does contain alcohol. Even with that I decided to give it another try. Last night I did my regular weekly wash and as a leave in conditioner I decided to use this and boy am I disappointed I did. My hair always feels soft after I wash,condition, moisturize and seal my hair but after using this product I must say I&#x27;m upset. This morning, I unwrapped my hair and OMG I&#x27; was disgusted. My hair was dry and it felt as if there was still product in my hair. When I combed my hair, there was more shedding than usual. I absolutely don&#x27;t recommend this product, not to a friend or even my worst enemy. LOL, this product has to be a joke. I threw this out this morning. I&#x27;m looking to try long term relationship by herbal essence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, curly, heat styled, bleached and colored hair. Needless to say I&#x27;ve got frizz and dryness issues and lately my usual conditioning regimen isn&#x27;t doing the trick as well as it used to. So looking for a better leave in conditioner I found this at my local drug store. I&#x27;ve only used it once but so far it&#x27;s awesome! My hair feels much softer, it&#x27;s nice and shiny and I&#x27;ve got defined curls without gel! I used a generous amount like it said but I used a diffuser instead of letting my hair air dry and then finished with a little bit of hairspray. Admittedly this is a pretty heavy product so if you have fine or oily hair it&#x27;s probably not for you. But if your hair&#x27;s thick and needs some serious moisture I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product was a pleasant surprise, as I normally use  Advantage Brazilian Hair Repair to roller set my thick relaxed hair. It leaves the hair incredibly soft, shiny and bouncy. What I love is that the set is so firm but so soft at the same time, giving your style extra staying power. It doesn&#x27;t flake either, which can happen with so many leave ins. I alternate between the two, as they are both incredible. I also happen to like the results far better than Salerm 21 Leave In.</li>
            <li> I saw the Cantu Shea Butter at Walmart for $5 and change. I decided to buy from Amazon because I had credit and could wait on shipping. I actually got the product cheaper from amazon including shipping, it shipped super fast, and it was well packed. Definitely would buy again;)</li>
            <li> Excellent on natural hair or curly hair for extra conditioning.  It also has an amazing smell too.  I&#x27;ve been buying this for years for me and my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Was not good to my hair, i heard a lot about ot, but i did not see any resulte with my hair, maybe could be helpful for others</li>
            <li> Beauty in a jar. Wash your hair and then put this leave-on conditioner on your hair and feel the silkyness and view the shine.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner makes my hair feel soft and moisturized. It instantly brought life back to my second and third day curls. Its great to use as \\&quot;underwear for your hair\\&quot; under a curling gel/cream and works great for twists and braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: this conditioner should not be used on straightened hair because it will cause it to revert to the hair&#x27;s natural pattern, causing frizz.)</li>
            <li> I use this as a overnight treatment mixed with an egg and some coconut oil.  When I wake up in the morning and rinse it out my 4a/b hair is full of life.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (finger width ringlets), but when I was younger I got caught up in the relaxing trend.  Not knowing how to care for it, my curls became a frizzy damaged mess.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 3 years and it is literally hair crack.  My hair is long and strong and shiny.  I use this as a leave in conditioner followed by a little bit of herbal oil to seal the moisture in (people who complain that this isnt moisturizing probably dont use a little olive/herbal oil to seal the moisture).  I also use other products from this line.  The hair silk stuff works well when youre straightening it.  I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo and conditioner that much.  I really dont do shampoo anyways - i cowash.</li>
            <li> I did not buy the from this buyer but from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells good, but I had trouble getting it to soak in to my hair no matter how much or little I put in it.  I would not recommend it to anyone at all. The smell is great, it made my hair feel soft but that is not worth it if I have big giant white flakes and product in my black hair. Not cute!</li>
            <li> Works great on my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my hair and on my girls&#x27; hair.  We all have different hair textures but we all have natural hair. This product seems to do differently for each of us as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one of my daughter&#x27;s hair this Conditioner does wonders.  Making it so soft and manageable.  Great Detangler.  Her hair seems to stay moisturized for a couple days at least. She has the thickest, coarsest, kinkiest hair of us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one of my other daughter&#x27;s hair, and mine, this stuff is pretty good. It makes our hair soft and easier to comb. Nothing that really amazes me though. We both have thick natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my youngest daughter, who has the more wavy, loose curl type hair, this stuff was horrible.  It was sticky, filmy, and left little white clump balls in her hair.  It was awful. Did not use again on her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this on our hair (except the young&#x27;un). Overall I am happy with how it moisturizes our hair and it smells great. I bought this from Walmart, not on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this conditioner. I applied this in my hair today due to the hot weather in the 90\\&quot;s..... My hair felt repaired and ready once I applied the cream. The cream has a thick consitancy and also smells nice. I love this product it turned my dry hair from being out in the sun to replenished moistured hair. A lot comes in the bottle and a little goes a long way. Well worth the bang for the buck!,,,,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m what you would call a product junkie when it comes to my hair. I&#x27;d watched a plethora of YouTube videos and read a ton of high star reviews on this product so I decided to try it. When I finally did try this on my relaxed hair and my thirteen-year- old daughters natural 2b hair, I was not impressed to say the least. I had to give this product two stars for the smell alone though.    I did find that the first time that I used this product on freshly washed damp hair, I noticed the softness that everybody rants about after my hair was fully air dried. My beef is that I could have achieved the same results with some of my other leave in conditioning treatments without the weird warnings. I also tried using this product to do a braid out on dry hair and noticed a ton of breakage (I estimate more than 200 short strands of hair)and my hair is long. My daughter has a really wavy curl pattern to hair natural 2b hair, I noticed that it made her hair soft but dry. I don&#x27;t like this product very much and will not purchase it again but will smell it once in a while.</li>
            <li> I am a natural with wavy/curly that presser her hair. I typically use Garnier Leave In products as they leave my hair feeling light, shiny and silky; but the beauty supply store in my area didn&#x27;t carry it and I was pressed for time. I had a choice btwn this and cream of nature leave in and opted for this. Wrong move. I used as directed and this has left my hair feeling heavy, greasy, and gross. Granted this smells good, but I supposed this is for hair types that are very coarse as my hair is not. I do not like the weighed down feeling this product leaves on my hair and am currently in the process of looking for a clarifying shampoo to get this out of my hair and go somewhere to get my Garnier leave in conditioner that I normally use. Hopefully this hasn&#x27;t messed my hair up too much.</li>
            <li> This cream was great for my son&#x27;s close cropped dry hair.    But me, it made these disgusting white balls in my natural hair that was difficult to wash out.  I see from other posts that this product cannot be used with other products.  Wish I read this before I made this purchase.    It does smell divine and has a very light feel to it, but it did not work out for me.    I used the rest of the jar on my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very creamy and not very greasy mixture. I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell of this product. A little goes a long way. I have about 4b hair and it makes my hair so soft and manageable for styling after washing my hair. However, as other products during the week are added to my hair, the build up became a bit flaky and i didn&#x27;t like that so be careful. It is a great products still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been continuing my hunt and experimenting with my natural hair. I have found that this leave in conditioner may have issues building up but not much at all when used with other cantu products. It works great on damp hair. When used with the cantu shea butter coconut curling cream that really brings out curls, it improves the bounciness. I also tried a twist out with those three products and this leave in conditioner really gave it moisture that lasts. When with eco styler gel, my twist out lasted longer which was expected. I also found that this leave in conditioner works great with eco styler gel and does not flake with build up. I recommend the argon oil version of it.&lt;br /&gt;Still love it and still recommend. If you find any issues just give it a chance and play with it. Thats the fun of having natural hair!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into hair typing I have relaxed 4b/4c hair. I use this as a daily moisturizer. I get it locally at either cvs or walgreens because it&#x27;s right up the street. I&#x27;ve seen it in walmart and even some dollar stores. It makes my hair so soft and easy to detangle. It has become one of my staples. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a shine and if you use too much it can give you a residue feeling. But my hair loves moisture and soaks up everything like a sponge so even that feeling goes away, given a little time. Also it&#x27;s only so-so with managing frizz but the soft manageability it gives my hair outweighs all of that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative I have is that some jars haven&#x27;t been whipped very well. You&#x27;ll notice it as soon as you open the jar. If it&#x27;s very thick and has little movement then it hasn&#x27;t been whipped very well. You&#x27;ll have to whip it yourself (I use a wide tooth comb). If you don&#x27;t whip it you might notice that it&#x27;s harder to spread throughout your hair and it might leave little white flakes in your hair instead of dissolving fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as a note, if you&#x27;re like me and you find a product that works really well with your hair then you invest in the line. Some of their other products don&#x27;t have as nice ingredients as this product. Some have mineral oil in them (this doesn&#x27;t) so be sure to check.</li>
            <li> came sooner than expected and does exactly what I thought it does... detangle? shine? I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> After trying many, many hair products to find what is good for my natural hair, I stumbled upon this product.  I love it.  It defines my curls and has a terrific smell.  I like it much better than the Knot Today leave-in.  This product did not leave my hair flaky or dry.  Combing through my hair was a breeze, and at only $6 at my local Family Dollar store, this was a steal!</li>
            <li> It is the best I&#x27;ve found for my mixed-race 3b curly hair. My hair is very thick and very thirsty. I comb thru in the shower every morning, gently squeeze out to dry, then apply this cream with my fingers from roots to ends. I let it air dry and that&#x27;s it. This cream is thick enough to help define curls and weigh down a little but my hair sucks it up until there is just enough left to leave some softness. I do not experience any build up or flakiness unless I mix with any other sort of cream or gel. My reason for leaving off a star is because I feel I am missing some shine. Hair is moisturized and curly, but a little dull. For that reason, I sometimes run some Cantu Hair Milk spray through on top of the cream. It works well.</li>
            <li> I totally love this, the smell and every thing, I use it on my hair and my kid hair. its soft and helps detangle it a little. great for thick hair</li>
            <li> Cantu is fantastic and completely repairs split ends. It is unlike any product I&#x27;ve tried for end repair. My only complaint is that it takes a while to dry and you have to be careful about using too much. Use it from mid-hair to end and be sparse.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is prone to frizz and has damaged ends from a bad highlighting job. I decided to try this Cantu instead of the Macadamia Oil leave-in product. When I tried the Cantu I was careful not to use more than necessary as it is in a jar and not portioned out with a pump. All I can say is: YUCK. It didn&#x27;t really absorb into my hair, just sat on top like a heavy styling product, and left a sticky residue. And to top it off I still had frizz. My hair felt gross all day, I ended up putting it in a bun and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash this stuff out. Two stars because it smells okay. Just not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> My hair was short, thick and tangly and it dried up very fast bt this conditioner helps growth and moisture. It didn&#x27;t changed the texture or anything but my hair feels silky and manageable when I put braids in or keep it wrapped up. I love this conditioner. Plus it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner even if your hair is not damaged. Makes hair look pretty  and manageable.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more. Great price.</li>
            <li> Despite the nice,creamy texture and pleasant smell (pros) ,this product was sub par to say the least.Whether I used this leave-in on wet or dry hair, it would just sit on top of my hair and not do any moisturizing.The worst part was the build up I would experience. After letting some time pass, I bought this AGAIN ; nonetheless, it still failed to perform as I would&#x27;ve liked. I do not recommend this product for those reasons.</li>
            <li> amazing product  i really  like the way smell wonderful  my  daughter hair look more healthy  sense i been  using this  products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cantu Repair Cream &amp; Conditioner for about three years. I ran out and used another product. However, as soon as I&#x27;d used all of that, I re-ordered the Cantu. I noticed that it was slightly different. I read some other reviews and watched some YouTube videos regarding the product and learned that the ingredients changed and that it has mineral oil in it now. That&#x27;s not good for natural black hair. So, I will no longer be ordering this product. I&#x27;m disappointed. Why change something that was working just fine? It even smells different, but that could just be my nose.</li>
            <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair. This cream is gross. It just sits and coats my strands, making me feel disgusting. It also smells like play dough and seems cheap and artificial. It is a protein and my hair does not like protein anything, especially protein leave ins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my experience and it was a negative one.</li>
            <li> I used to leave this in my l.o.c method but after 6months of being natural I realized how greasy this stuff really was. My face used to be oiled up and my pillow would be soaked in grease.  I have thick and curly 3c4a  hair and I often used this in my twist out, and now thats it has been 11 months, I&#x27;m just going to say no.</li>
            <li> I use this on my relaxed hair &amp; this is a MIRACLE for it. I applied this after washing my hair &amp; this leaves my hair so soft. My new growth is much more manageable after using this. On dry hair it works wonders too. I&#x27;ll recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I still have it and its been almost two years since i got it. lasts a long time.. I tell you and makes hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rocking my hair in its natural state for the past 4 years now and I have never experienced the wonders that this cream has worked on every root,strand, and ends of my hair. It has this amazing smell that even had my boyfriend praising. My hair stays moisturizer. I experience minimal buildup. My hair feels stronger and healthier. AMAZING PRODUCT. #NaturalHairCrack</li>
            <li> I just started this natural journey and I honesty can&#x27;t say much about what it does to your hair. The texture of the cream itself is thick and it smells nice. I do use it all the time. More so than all the other products I have purchased so I guess that says something.</li>
            <li> smells amazing! great leave in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person that likes products that moisturize my hair and do that well. I&#x27;m not a big fan of things from factories after finding out Acne Products only make my acne worse. However, this little jar is wonderful. It&#x27;s heavy as god knows what and it isn&#x27;t half bad. However, it is a tad thinner than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s almost like pink lotion but a bit thicker.I brought this at my beauty supply store for 5.99.(Can also get it from CVS for 6.49) So I was happy. The only reason why It doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair like my Canola/grapeseed oil mix. Even if this product has a good amount of Canola oil in it and makes my hair soft, I like my oils better. It&#x27;s great for bontus and twist outs. It didn&#x27;t define my hair at all btw, Eco Styler Gel does that job. lol Overall nice job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stuff smells amazing and works! I saw a suggestion for it on YouTube and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. So happy I did.</li>
            <li> First time I try this product and have to say, I&#x27;m very happy I bought it. Very good</li>
            <li> I use this as a styling product and as a leave in conditioner. For styling, I use it to smooth my frizzy edges. It works well but I have to use about three tablespoons of it each time to get the frizzy hairs to smooth. I use it also sometimes as a leave in conditioner after shampooing. It works well for this purpose also but I have to use about 10 - 12 tablespoons  to get my hair thoroughly saturated (it is elbow length). It does leave it smooth and more manageable the next day. I recommend it for people who have my hair type which is type 2b - wavy, frizzy, difficult to style, medium and fine strands, dense amount when measuring ponytail circumference (wikipedia).</li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR HAIR SMELL SOO GOOD AND LEAVES IT INCREDIBLY SOFT!!! amazing buy, glad i invented my money it in</li>
            <li> Overall, great product ! It defines your curls but doesn&#x27;t give any shine or enough moisture. You can get the same product cheaper at cvs.</li>
            <li> This is such a great leave in. It helps to keep my hair from breaking. It&#x27;s a good moisture agent. It smells great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product before all the hype about it and I love it. I have natural hair thin and curly, but seems thick and nappy when dry. I was looking for a product that had a slimy over an oily feel that was thick enough to coat my hair and allow the curls to drink the moisture. I was opening all of these leave in jars and bottles when I came upon this Cantu. When I opened it, it reminded me of what Miss Jessies curl pudding would look like. I never tried it because of the price but my friends who were going natural were talking about it. So I bought it for less than 4 dollars, took it home conditioned my hair and while dampish/wet sectioned my hair and slathered this stuff on each section, rattooth combed it out so it was on every strand and did twists. The next day took the twists out and my hair was sooooooooo beautiful, soft the twisted curls were so cute. I fingered through them and got so many compliments. So this has been my product of choice since. However, I like to wear wigs for periods of times and when I came back to this product I must have bought an old bottle or it was tampered because it was not the stuff that i remembered it turned white and flaked on my hair and wasnt that thick. So I threw that bottle away went to a different store opened it before I bought it and yes it was the consistency i remembered. I also bought the serum to do a hand mix just in case it turned my hair white still and I have had no problems. I love both. The leave in by itself and the leave in mixed with the serum as a sealer are the best. All of my friends thank me for putting them on! And it smells great. I dont know about that fish comment below....there is no fish product in it.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about this product in YouTube videos.  It is really heavy and conditions my 3c/4a hair.  I am still testing how much to use in my hair.  I may be using to much on the ends because I notice a few flakes after a couple days of applicable.  Overall, I think this is a good product... especially at a relatively inexpensive price!</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my natural hair; great size and great price. The delivery was quick with my Prime subscription and arrived safely. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I only use this on the tips of my hair when they are dry and on my damp hair all over when I am curling it. They stuff smells pretty good and does work well.  I try not to add too much because it can weigh hair down very easily. Good stuff though.</li>
            <li> Cantu is a great product. Leaves my hair soft, moisturized, and less frizzy. Very affordable and smells amazing. But I don&#x27;t like the silicone in it. I have to use a clarifier to get it out. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> (I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought it from my local beauty supply store) I have been using this as a moisturizer while experimenting with doing braid outs on my naturally curly/african american hair (this is my second week).  This stuff is awesome!  It feels thin but it truly moisturizes.  I have used it on both wet and dry hair and I love how my hair feels in the morning when I take the braids out.  I always seal my hair after using this with organic coconut oil and I never have any flakes or residue from mixing the two products together.  I highly recommend this product, truly does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> It came to me open and all over the box. I was super dissapointed and angry. Not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> I bought this Product because a colleague said she uses it for her daughter after she removes her braids and her hair never frizzed up!so I did the same.and she was right my hair does not break off anymore after I remove my braids!I just go get my ends trimmed and wrap my hair at night and continue with my day!no more worries!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I now have renewed faith in this product after trying another one that didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I had been using Cantu for my roller sets and the results were always fairly decent, but nothing to rave about. I decided to graduate to a curl-specific product (Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie) and my hair didn&#x27;t like that product at all. From now on, it&#x27;s Cantu leave-in conditioner for me and my curls!  I first bought this product around May 2011. I started transitioning to natural and this seemed to be the most mentioned leave-in conditioner on all the natural hair blogs.  I don&#x27;t love this product, but I don&#x27;t hate it either. It&#x27;s difficult to judge because while I have about 4 inches of new growth, the product reacts a little differently on my relaxed ends (still have 5 inches of relaxed hair).  My new growth doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as I&#x27;d like it to once my hair dries. I was expected a very soft feel, but that&#x27;s not what I get when using this product.  The one thing I do REALLY like is that it&#x27;s a superb detangler. It&#x27;s not labeled as a detangler, but my comb glides easily through my wet hair when I apply this product.  Another thing I really like is that when I use it to set my hair with rods/rollers, my curls come out super soft and bouncy - not hard and crunchy like gels and setting lotions.  Will I buy it again? Maybe. Like I said, I LOVE that it detangles my hair so easily. But I would like to try other products now so that I can compare.</li>
            <li> I am african american with type 4a/4b hair that is about arm pit length. My natural hair was very very dry. This conditioner has put back the moisture in my hair it needed. I love it. A little goes a long way as the first time I applied it I put way too much in which it caused flaking. But this is a good daily leave-in for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product!!!! It is so extremely moisturizing and really makes your hair very soft and manageable. If you have dry ends, split ends, damaged hair... this is for you. Even if your hair is healthy...it is a great leave-in maintenance conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have bi-racial hair.  You&#x27;ll get better results if you use this with leave-in conditioner.  Has a great aroma that isn&#x27;t overpowering (I actually get compliments on the smell on days that I use this).  I only use this for special occassions or when I know my hair is going to be extra frizzy.  It&#x27;s been almost a year (or more) and I haven&#x27;t had to buy another one yet.</li>
            <li> I used this product in three different phases of my hair journey over the span of ten years. It worked well when I had completely relaxed hair and did roller sets to style my hair. It kept my hair moisturized and voluminous. However, when I used it during my transition from relaxed to natural hair, it broke the relaxed ends off and did not go well with heat of any kind like blow drying and flat ironing. I had to do the big chop as a result when I had a nice, long length. I brushed it off as a sign it was time to liberate myself from the relaxed hair and heat. I started using it on my natural hair without heat, but I noticed it did not moisturize like I thought it would. My hair (4B/C) was dry and tangled after use, but I assumed that was the struggle of having natural hair. I continued using it because of my familiarity with the product. In July, I made the mistake of using it then blowing out and flat ironing my hair. It was a complete disaster. It left the ends completely frizzy and tangled after blow-drying, making my hair more susceptible to heat damage when I tried to flat iron. After trying deep conditioning treatments, I end up cutting off the beyond damaged hair. I have learned the lesson of finding the right product for your hair. I would say it is a product that doesn&#x27;t agree with my natural hair, but might work for someone else&#x27;s. I have found SheaMoisture to be a huge improvement for my natural hair needs.</li>
            <li> My hair has been treated with blonde highlights for three months now, and fairly often.  I really want to go back to being a brunette, but I need to repair my hair.  A stylist friend of mine said if I dyed it, it would look like cotton candy.  She also said I could repair it with deep conditioning three times a week.  I picked this Cantu up because it was inexpensive and I wanted to start immediately.  I left it in for a good hour, and I spent some time outside, so it did get a little sun-warmed under the plastic cap.  It looks SO much better.  It&#x27;s heavy from the conditioner, but it really truly looks twice as healthy as it did before the treatment.  I can&#x27;t wait to get a few more in this week!</li>
            <li> I was recently introduced to Cantu products by a family member. It is a not so well promoted line of hair products that is reasonably priced in Walmart, on Amazon but not in CVS. It smells great and delivers. Use sparingly and not in  big dollops.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner on the reccommendation of three websites--which reccommended a good moisturizer for African American course hair (like mine).  A friend also reccommended it to me.  However, I was very disappointed bc it did not moisturize my hair--at all.  I highly reccommend She Moisture Leave in conditioner.  It moisturized my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Softens my hair, has a beautiful scent, its beautiful!</li>
            <li> Use this product ALONE! And DON&#x27;T over do it! It you do it will lead to a residue. But this product works! I leave my 3b/3a hair  super soft and manageable and the jar lasts forever! I will say that this is a PROTEIN BASED product and contains silicon for heat protection so it will lead to build up on your hair after a while so you will need to wash your hair regularly. I say at least once ever 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST conditioners there is especially for coarse, thick hair, but it&#x27;s great for any type of hair.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product and it made my hair feel so soft. Before that my hair was really dry and the ends were kinky and hard to comb, but after using this it is very manageable. It smells really yummy too(which my boyfriend loves!). I plan to buy this again and use it as my regular styling cream.</li>
            <li> And yes I had to yell it...lol..I honestly for the life of me cannot understand why so many people say it flakes in their hair. First off, I am African American and Relaxed, secondly, I transitioned for about a year and a half before giving in to the \\&quot;creamy crack\\&quot;, because my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair is seriously thick...alot of work. Anyway, getting off topic, I have been using Cantu Shea Butter for years, mostly while relaxed, saw a youtube user review it, and gave it a shot, and immediately fell in love. The smell is heavenly very slightly coconut \\&quot;y\\&quot;, best way I can describe it. But the Cream it self is wonderful, I have thick 4a/b hair, and it is very porous due to over processing and coloring for years....I can be out in the humidity here in the South, hair gets a bit frizzed up, and dry, use this as a leave in at night, the next morning it&#x27;s smooth and moisturized again, and of course smells amazing. It does not play well with gels, so for naturals you absolutely cannot have any gel in  your hair before or after adding Cantu, it will most definitely pop out in little white balls... not  flakes, exactly, but they don&#x27;t mix. when I was transitioning, I had to switch to another leave in if I thought I might use gel on top of it. This stuff is definitely for Relaxed hair! It&#x27;s so light and I don&#x27;t use much, this pretty decent sized tub, lasts me for months, and I use it every single day, minimum, maybe twice in one day if I need to redo my hair for an event or something. Maybe it just works better for some than others, I would be very upset if it was ever discontinued, maybe start a picket line where they manufacture it, lol.. I say give it a shot, and maybe give it too someone who likes it if you don&#x27;t...like me! haha. :o)</li>
            <li> I love Cantu Shea butter but if its any cheaper at your local Wal-Mart go buy it there</li>
            <li> This product was great. It&#x27;s exactly what I hoped for and more. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and great for overnight deep conditioning treatment and  gives my hair great slip. The leave - in is moisturize my hair on the first try. My hair is dry and brittle but as soon as I applied it my hair my hair felt restored and my curls popped. It didn&#x27;t leave any white residue or flakes. AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product as a conditioner ive put this on wet and dry hair it feels like conditioner and it feels heavy but it does condition so its nice I only put it on the tips but I do wish it was lighter.</li>
            <li> This product was good on my daughter hair.  She has a more courly kinky natural hair.  This product was easy to use, it made combing the hair easier and tame.  It also, smells nice as well..</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair or begin to style it I add this to my hair and blow dry my hair and leaves my hair with a shine and not dull looking. I don&#x27;t have to add any oils to my hair to make it shine.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and luv it in my hair oh yes! I will definitely keep this around for my 4c hair! lol</li>
            <li> Seeing that I have to put a lot of smelly stuff in my hair now to start growth again, this product has a pleasant smell and works wonders. So, yes I would recommend this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came on time and does what it claims....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...</li>
            <li> Actually it is more that expected.  I definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Trying another option as this doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize as well as I thought it would. It goes on nicely, but seems to dry out quickly. It does have a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after carefully reading the reviews. I was disappointed after my first try. First of all, it&#x27;s way too greasy to leave in your hair and go to bed with. I have a long hair and it gets too sticky after using it. I had to wash my hair off to get rid of the stickiness. I thought I put on too much the first time so on the second day, I tried using less and it was less sticky but still greasy. So far, my hair isn&#x27;t soft and silky yet. I have used other expensive products that I was satisfied with so all I have to say is you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> sooooooooooo, I bought this product because I have starter locs and my hair is soooo dry. I dont reccommend it for starter locs ( I dont think you are supposed to use conditioner in those stages anyway) However, i do think when I am in further in my loc journey I will use it more often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing, stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I use Cantu about every single day when I style my natural hair. I have very short hair (about an inch all around my head) from by big chop and Cantu is great for moisturizing it. Its the only moisturizer I use, and I have no complaints. I love the way it smells. It even defines curls a little. But I still stick to my Fantasia Ic Gel for ultra definition. YES! I do use this product with other products. I avoid the clumping and flakes that others complain about by making sure the Cantu is thoroughly absorbed into my hair before I add my gel. That means I massage it into damp hair until I can&#x27;t see the cream any more. If you do that, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about clumps. Overall, I would and have recommended this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4a hair and this product made it like a straw broom every time. I tried several times to use it but my hair just doesn&#x27;t like it. My daughter has 4a/3c hair and it&#x27;s the same thing. Good thing it was cheap or else I would have really been upset that I spent my money on this.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily! I use it when making my bantu knots to just regularly moisturizing my hair. Very good purchase for someone with natural hair.</li>
            <li> This product broke off my hair.  I am in the process of transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.  I have been using this product for about two months and I notice that the top right side of my hair has broken off really bad.  I would not suggest anyone with permed hair to use this product.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner for my hair for log time and I don&#x27;t see any problem&lt;br /&gt;shea butter is good for hair</li>
            <li> This product work wonders.  I have 4/a hair type and this product does it for me.  Why pay so much for it on here when it&#x27;s only $5.97 at Walmart?</li>
            <li> After a few uses this product begins to make your hair incredibly soft, not to mention healthy. It leaves your hair with a nice sheen,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product twice because I&#x27;ve heard such great reviews about Cantu Shea Butter. However it made my hair too soft I know this sounds crazy but it made my hair too soft to hold any style twist out/braid out nothing will hold. My curls are limp and frizzy at the ends. Glad only paid 5 bucks. I will try one more time with less product on my hair but after that if it doesn&#x27;t work straight in garbage.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CONDITIONER! I now purchase it from WALMART!</li>
            <li> Cantu Shea Butter works great on my hair when it was relaxed and still works great on my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I have thick and course hair-- I do not have to use a lot--and there are no build-ups on my hair after use.  Very good!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. I mix this product all the time with other products and have had no problems. Now pink oil products cannot be mixed, but this stuff is wonderful. I can use it alone or with gel depending on how I want to wear my hair. My only problem is that it is very hard to find and local stores don&#x27;t do a good job keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this is my go too product! I apply it every time I wash my hair and it leave my curls hydrated and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great job at moisturizing my dry, frizzy, long hair! I not only love how this calms my hair, but I love the smell and feel of my hair afterward.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product  is amazing I absolute love this product. when I apply this to my hair it makes my hair soft ,easy to detangle and makes it easy for me to style.</li>
            <li> I didnt get this stuff from this site I actually purchased it at Walmart but I cannot stop raving about this stuff! Keep my hair soft, its very light weight, keeps my hair very nicely moisturized &amp; I have very, very ,very thirsty hair!! I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> My packet came and when i opened it,  the product was all over the box.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years or so now and when i first got it i really did like it and still loves the smell too...but after a while i started to notice something..It moisturizes when my hair is wet but the next day its as if i never used anything. It dries out really quickly on my 3b hair texture and i think its time to give it up and try their natural hair line leave in. It may work for you but i am on my last jar and probably will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to product every since I went natural and I still love it!</li>
            <li> I love using Cantu, it is not my first time using it and would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a deep conditioning that you can leave in for days. I personally have really weak hair and this treatment helped me to strengthen it within the four months of my using it. It also helps with detangling and softening your hair. Cantu helps boost hair growth by keeping your hair moisturized and full of the necessary ingredients that your hair needs to grow. Since this is a cream, do make sure to apply it on damp hair, your hair will retain the cream more so because the water locks it in. If you apply while your hair is dry, your hair will have a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; look to it, as if you don&#x27;t moisturize it.</li>
            <li> I just love the Shea Butter leave in conditioner repair cream. I washed my hair one week and the next week my hair still felt soft. It also have a pleasant smell where it keeps your hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> I love this product! You don&#x27;t need to add anything else to your hair except for coconut oil to seal in the moisture if you are styling a twist-out, braid-out or flat twist! My flat twist lasted for a few days! Can&#x27;t wait to buy again!</li>
            <li> I love how this feels in my hair. I have really curly hair and it detangles and makes it soft. I gave it 3 stars not because of the product itself but how I got it in the mail. When I received it, it was spilt all in the box. Looked like the lid wasn&#x27;t even on it or wasn&#x27;t twisted on hard enough.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4b/c hair and this product works well. I use it after shampooing and conditioning as a leave in before I apply oils, then this leave in and then the butter based sealant, and wala my hair texture is soft when I awake.</li>
            <li> This products smells nice and I like the concept of anything Shea Butter but it did nothing for me. I might give it away.</li>
            <li> This is in the ethnic aisle, I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;black hair\\&quot; but more coarse, mixed ethnicity type hair.  My hair is frizzy, puffy, and wavy.  Shea butter is great for hair, so i was excited to try this product.  It is HORRIBLE, and I don&#x27;t use that word liberally.  It did NOT make my hair feel soft or conditioned, it felt stiff like glue on my hands and i felt it frizzed up my hair more.  STAY AWAY!!!! Shea butter is not high up on the ingredient list, guess what is??  CANOLA OIL!  I might as well use the canola oil from my kitchen and i would probably get better results. I have tried so many products, and really like Organic Root Stimulator, the Olive oil one...in case anyone&#x27;s comparing the two or looking for a good product.  That stuff is really moisturizing and feels great.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner is amazing, it moistens and keeps the hair moist. I use it weekly and I have no complaints. It also have an amazing scent, a fresh-clean scent.</li>
            <li> Luck must have been shining down on me the day I learned about this conditioner online. For years I was using another conditioner that left my hair feeling soft, and helped it grow. Then one day I saw a blog post about Cantu, and I decided to try something different. The conditioner arrived within days. I co-washed my hair, then used this in place of my normal conditioner, then loved it so much I used it as my leave in too. That entire week my hair felt like soft cotton candy floating in butter. And I didn&#x27;t have any tangles or kinks the entire week. I &#x27;m completely natural with a mixture of 4A and 4B hair; and I have a tendency to get tangles if I get lax with my routine. Cantu Shea butter helped me detangle easily, and kept me detangled. I&#x27;ve rarely had tangles since I began using this. Also my curls are popping. Before using this I had to add other products so that my curls were defined. No more of that. I love this product and want to try the entire line.</li>
            <li> wish I would have known about this product a long time ago.... beats the heck out of the stiff hair gel I used for years... GREAT STUFF !!</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair</li>
            <li> I wish I had read some of the other reviews before using this product. I used it in combination with another styling product that I regularly use, and was disappointed. My hair was dry to my dismay. It softens my hair when used alone though, which was great.</li>
            <li> I love Cantu products personally. Just what I needed. A good amount and moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner so much. my hair is relaxed and I used it for my split ends because i used to dye my hair a lot before i put a relaxer in it. . It keeps my hair so soft and shiny. My mother who is all natural stole the jar and uses it as a styling cream every morning and puts it in her hair before she goes to sleep. I use it as a leave in, sometimes overnight and wash it in the morning and it stays soft for days (even after i went swimming in chlorine) We love this conditioner so much, it really does work with any texture of hair. If you want soft hair, this is the stuff to buy. Not a cheap product ,true to its word.</li>
            <li> This leave-in is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. I can&#x27;t get this stuff to (quickly) rub into my hair. And by quickly I mean less than 5 minutes. It takes some coaxing for it to completely disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B. Don&#x27;t even think about trying to use this on damp hair - makes rubbing it in even more of a challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. My hair is very soft initially, but give it about an hour or two and my hair feels like it hasn&#x27;t been moisturized for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Oh yeah, don&#x27;t mix this with ANYTHING ELSE. It will leave flakes and tiny clumps in your hair no matter what you mix it with. I&#x27;ve done this a couple times and the remedy is to just wash your hair and try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good thing about this is that it is very cheap and can be found in Wal-Mart, Target, and at the BX/PX on military installations. Overall I&#x27;m not a fan of this conditioner, I have found one that works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time coming on my hair journey. I bought the salon-sized tub(25oz) nearly 4 years ago at my local beauty supply store. I have been using it on and off until recently when I relaxed my hair. I noticed that now that I&#x27;m relaxed my hair appreciates this product even more and when I do rollersets with this and \\&quot;Chi Silk Infusion\\&quot; my hair comes out soft, silky and moisturized. I also use this as a daily leave-in. I&#x27;ll admit, at first when I tried it I didn&#x27;t like it because I thought it was too thick for my fine strands for everyday use, but then I got the idea to put it in a spray bottle and dilute it with water, adding a few drops of various oils I had laying around and WOW! It softened my hair right back up with no residue or white flakes. Mind you, the most I use on my entire head is about 3 dime sized amounts before rollersetting and a couple spritzs daily, so you definetly don&#x27;t need a lot to do the job. I really like this product because it&#x27;s so cheap($9 for 25oz at your local beauty/weave supply shop) and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Left white flakes in my hair.  Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products in the cantu line. This is a very good leave in. The Cantu leave in conditioner is great for moisture and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
