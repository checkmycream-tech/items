            <li>and I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>and I liked it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>conditioner kind of...lathers?  </li>
            <li>I also make my own spray leave in conditioner with it.  </li>
            <li>Love love LOVE!!</li>
            <li>Best natural conditioner i&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>If i use this product after using the Giovanni Tea Tree conditioner my hair is left moist with wonderful curl definition.</li>
            <li>then I started to notice I had to use more and more oils and butter-y products after the shower to make my hair manageable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I like this brand better.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>All of my family and friends love it when i let them use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try one more time</li>
            <li>One of the best conditioners for dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Hair feels and looks soft and healthy, very effective hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now it would be wonderful to have a 32 ounce special at the same price...</li>
            <li>Very good for dry hair, mine is also curly.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>I admit avocados are not the most familiar thing in the world to me, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re supposed to be more moisturizing than this is to my hair right now.  </li>
            <li>By far the best cruelty free/vegan product I have discovered so far.</li>
            <li>I had to switch to a familiar, super-greasy soy-based conditioner and start doing olive oil overnight hair treatments</li>
            <li>hair is happy and full of shine and luster feels nice and soft and has body definitely going to be getting this from now on</li>
            <li>Its great for defining your natural curls, but i don&#x27;t find it very moisturizing unless its used after another conditioner.</li>
            <li>cause i love the curl definition it adds to my natural non chemical treated hair :)</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner, leaves hair soft and without a lot of residue.</li>
            <li>sure enough, my hair feels like it is clean and moist.  </li>
            <li>and hopefully it will be the right product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair very soft and easy to manager.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find that Amazon carries a larger ounce</li>
            <li>so it really makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>it really does leave you hair moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li>I expected the conditioner to be a bit more hydrating (I have bleached hair).</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to you as much of this product as you do Wen</li>
            <li>This conditioner is much heavier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Paired with the deep conditioning mask and your hair is smooth and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been a fan of giovanni products for 3 years and this has been my fav so far!</li>
            <li>Seriously this is better than what I have paid 3 times as much for.</li>
            <li>Its pricy but worth it if you have hair that tends to get knotty and dry</li>
            <li>This very smooth, shiny and thick.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Makes my frizzy hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than at our local Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>Was actually pretty surprised at how &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; it seemed to be, so tried it several times, with the same effect each time.</li>
            <li>I have very long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in North Pole AK which is very always very dry - especially in the winter with the wood burner going.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t all hair product bottles be in large quantities like this 32 oz, I love that this will last for a while, and not for mere weeks like the 8 oz.</li>
            <li>I have chin length colored and highlighted hair and this totally untangles it and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>Giovanni shampoo/conditioner is very similar to Wen as far as how it makes my hair feel and look after the wash</li>
            <li>Leaves my thick wavy hair frizz free and shiny.</li>
            <li>but my friends with thick, straight hair really like it.</li>
            <li>And completely disappears by the time my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>May be a little heavy for people with fine hair</li>
            <li>Is it possible this conditioner uses not the avocado oil but the whole fruit, in effect having less actual avocado oil?  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ordered this product previously and it worked well with my 4b African American natural hair.</li>
            <li> Avocado+Olive Oil Ultra-Moist Conditioner, my twists feels very soft with less snags when re-twisting my hair.</li>
            <li> and it has been soft, lots of lift, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair....</li>
            <li> Extremely Moisturizing deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this hair care product was for dry hair until after I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel dry</li>
            <li> so i have thick coarse hair naturally</li>
            <li> The product is what I expected, It moisturize my hair even on a rainy day.</li>
            <li> I usually add EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) to it while its in my hand before putting it on my wet hair and i have found that&#x27;s helps also.</li>
            <li> I previously had picked up a small tube of this at my local store.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I tried this product I lost large amounts of hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and latino</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice until a few weeks later and it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and moderately coarse hair, but I think that people with finer hair might want a lighter conditioner.</li>
            <li> But it as my only conditioner doesn&#x27;t work sadly.</li>
            <li> Either option was not appealing.</li>
            <li> I usually have combination hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, must give it 3 stars because last time I received the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair actually got so bad</li>
            <li> The pump, however, was broken and not fixable when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Was rather disappointed that a conditioner which described itself as being &amp;#34;ultra moist,&amp;#34;  seemed to leave my hair feeling dry.  </li>

            <li> I previously had picked up a small tube of this at my local store. Wow. Seriously this is better than what I have paid 3 times as much for. I have chin length colored and highlighted hair and this totally untangles it and leaves it soft. My teenager who has waist length ombred hair also uses it now. By far the best cruelty free/vegan product I have discovered so far.</li>
            <li> Makes my frizzy hair soft and manageable. Paired with the deep conditioning mask and your hair is smooth and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Great service! great product! My hair loves this product too</li>
            <li> it really does leave you hair moisturized and manageable. i use both the shampoo and conditioner and they work really great together! i&#x27;ve been a fan of giovanni products for 3 years and this has been my fav so far! i love it.</li>
            <li> Its great for defining your natural curls, but i don&#x27;t find it very moisturizing unless its used after another conditioner. I have 4b &amp; 4c hair texture so my hair requires lots of moisture. If i use this product after using the Giovanni Tea Tree conditioner my hair is left moist with wonderful curl definition. Or i use it after i have done a hair mask. But it as my only conditioner doesn&#x27;t work sadly. I usually add EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) to it while its in my hand before putting it on my wet hair and i have found that&#x27;s helps also. I will probably buy it again cause i love the curl definition it adds to my natural non chemical treated hair :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to try as my twice a week deep condition. I have been on a wash once a week schedule. Unfortunately when I tried this product I lost large amounts of hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Was rather disappointed that a conditioner which described itself as being &amp;#34;ultra moist,&amp;#34;  seemed to leave my hair feeling dry.  Was actually pretty surprised at how &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; it seemed to be, so tried it several times, with the same effect each time.</li>
            <li> I bought this at another online retailer (dermst*re) and I liked it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface this by saying I have BLEACHED hair. Like platinum. WHITE. The ends are practically plasticized before I get a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this did alright for about two months for me.  Fairly moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;But then I started to notice I had to use more and more oils and butter-y products after the shower to make my hair manageable.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner kind of...lathers?  And completely disappears by the time my hair is dry. It&#x27;s very strange to me. I admit avocados are not the most familiar thing in the world to me, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re supposed to be more moisturizing than this is to my hair right now.  Is it possible this conditioner uses not the avocado oil but the whole fruit, in effect having less actual avocado oil?  My hair actually got so bad I had to switch to a familiar, super-greasy soy-based conditioner and start doing olive oil overnight hair treatments (literally just dousing my hair in olive oil, applying saran wrap, then shampooing in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is in manageable condition (no chemical treatments, no curl, no damage) you could probably use this for the next 3 years and have no problems. It is moisturizing. But if you&#x27;re a bleach blonde, don&#x27;t bet your life on this one, it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for you.  Would not recommend to 4c hair types either, if it can&#x27;t moisturize my thinner hair strands when they&#x27;re bleached after 2 months I doubt it could give 4c hair the moisture it needs to be its healthiest.</li>
            <li> This very smooth, shiny and thick. Love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner, leaves hair soft and without a lot of residue. Why can&#x27;t all hair product bottles be in large quantities like this 32 oz, I love that this will last for a while, and not for mere weeks like the 8 oz.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable. The conditioner is truly moisturizing and its a bargain buying it wholesale at 24 oz</li>
            <li> I preferred this brand&#x27;s shampoo over the conditioner. I expected the conditioner to be a bit more hydrating (I have bleached hair). It smells wonderful though!</li>
            <li> Leaves my thick wavy hair frizz free and shiny. Hair feels and looks soft and healthy, very effective hair moisturizer. The combination of Olive and avocado oil are great for hair.</li>
            <li> hair is happy and full of shine and luster feels nice and soft and has body definitely going to be getting this from now on</li>
            <li> Great product for hair! Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best natural conditioner i&#x27;ve found! Its pricy but worth it if you have hair that tends to get knotty and dry, this product is moisturizing and terrific. Been using this shampoo and conditioner duo for a year now.</li>
            <li> I have shiny, silky hair.  This, and the conditioner are the reason.</li>
            <li> After co-washing with Giovanni 2chic Avocado+Olive Oil Ultra-Moist Conditioner, my twists feels very soft with less snags when re-twisting my hair. I was so glad to find that Amazon carries a larger ounce and it last me for a month. Now it would be wonderful to have a 32 ounce special at the same price...</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Very good for dry hair, mine is also curly.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is GREAT.  The pump, however, was broken and not fixable when it arrived.  My only choice was to pay to send it back and purchase it again, or dump it into a different container.  Either option was not appealing.</li>
            <li> I got it earlier than I thought. The product is what I expected, It moisturize my hair even on a rainy day.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and the size of the bottle.  It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than at our local Wal-Mart.  The conditioner makes my hair very soft and easy to manager.  I have very long, straight hair.  Before switching to this product I used Wen Hair care products and I like this brand better.  Giovanni shampoo/conditioner is very similar to Wen as far as how it makes my hair feel and look after the wash and you don&#x27;t have to you as much of this product as you do Wen so it really makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product, with great results every time. Extremely Moisturizing deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> MY favorite hair product! All of my family and friends love it when i let them use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. It leaves your hair very soft. I&#x27;m half black and latino so i have thick coarse hair naturally but my friends with thick, straight hair really like it. May be a little heavy for people with fine hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and I LOVE this product!  I have tried so many combinations of products and this along with the Shampoo work great!  I leave the conditioner in my hair while I wash my body and it makes my hair super soft.  I also make my own spray leave in conditioner with it.  Love love LOVE!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is much heavier than I thought it would be. I have very thick and moderately coarse hair, but I think that people with finer hair might want a lighter conditioner.</li>
            <li> I usually have combination hair.  I didn&#x27;t realize this hair care product was for dry hair until after I bought it.  I tried it anyway and sure enough, my hair feels like it is clean and moist.  It isn&#x27;t overly moist and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has a bunch of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a lot of allergies to include lotions and cleansers. I live in North Pole AK which is very always very dry - especially in the winter with the wood burner going.  As you can imagine it royally dries our your hair. This shampoo and conditioner has been a LIFE SAVER! My hair is baby fine and it has been soft, lots of lift, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.... and it smells really good. I definitely recommend to people.</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners for dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent conditioner, I&#x27;ve ordered it twice. Unfortunately, must give it 3 stars because last time I received the shampoo. I didn&#x27;t notice until a few weeks later and it was too late to return. I&#x27;ll try one more time and hopefully it will be the right product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product previously and it worked well with my 4b African American natural hair. Smells really good and it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel dry</li>
