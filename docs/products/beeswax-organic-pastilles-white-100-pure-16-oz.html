            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of the product, and would have given it 5 stars, but I wish this had not been described as &amp;#34;bright white&amp;#34; beeswax.</li>

            <li>Melted beautifully both times over a double boiler.</li>
            <li>These beeswax pellets melt down for my homemade projects perfectly.</li>
            <li>melts fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for at home use for me, but I was going to give these to friends and family members for Easter.  </li>
            <li>The product looked fine, but had a smell to it that was not the honey smell.</li>
            <li>This makes using beeswax so much easier I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen how these are either really nice or really gross.&lt;br /&gt;Acrid.</li>
            <li>Clean with no fragrance,  the pastilles melted easily.</li>
            <li>They are Extremely Light in Color..</li>
            <li>Smooth and smell just like the oils I used in them.</li>
            <li>It is essential in a great lotion.</li>
            <li>These pastilles are fantastic.</li>
            <li>But the product itself is good and natural</li>
            <li>These arrived pretty quickly and they are nice quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products from Dr. Adorable though, that I have been happy with.</li>
            <li>good page,  nice amount,  haven&#x27;t put it together with the other ingredients yet</li>
            <li>They were very easy to measure since they are small pellets, and they melted beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The pastilles melt quickly and don&#x27;t stick together so they are easy to measure</li>
            <li>These are great, love the pure white coloring and they&#x27;re working well for my lip balms.</li>
            <li>I cannot smell any of my doTERRA Essential Oils with this and considering I used a good 40ish drops and they were strong oils</li>
            <li>Rejecting chemical laden products for cleaning the house- and myself- is not only fun but great for the environment.</li>
            <li>Very easy to measure and melt, I can see buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>It says on the label it has a &#x27;naturally mild sweet aroma&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It arrived really quickly and I like what I got for the price.</li>
            <li>Item just as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I got it in order to experiment with making my own lip balm thanks to having recently found a great organic shea butter (by Wise Owl Organics) &amp; having read that simply melting those 2 ingredients along with coconut oil can make a great lip balm to which one can also add other beneficial ingredients such as cocoa butter or flavoring as desired.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so relieved when I got it to find no unpleasant smell or appearance &amp; it is in fact a pleasant soft white which seems ideal in every way including because of the resealable bag &amp; the small size of the pastilles making it super easy to just measure out the desired quantity vs. needing to grate or cut blocks of beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, does come much more yellow than the first picture would make you think, still smells pretty strongly of beeswax, but i used it for making home made lip balm and once the other ingredients were in it didnt smell too strongly</li>
            <li>The resulting lotion bars were smooth and they set very well in the molds.  </li>
            <li>I overall liked the product!&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to begin making some of my own skincare products, especially for lip care.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make their own natural skin care.</li>
            <li>Nice white color.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as describe, and was quickly shipped to me.</li>
            <li>Price was right and was shipped as scheduled will buy again</li>
            <li>then it takes some time to melt and get the right consistency</li>
            <li>These are very easy to work with, especially in measuring the amount needed.  </li>
            <li>They are very light (white) in color and the bag does say organic.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using beeswax</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering this beeswax again when I make more lotion bars.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was hoping for....</li>
            <li>I bought this for my first foray into making stuff with beeswax-</li>
            <li>I made my first batch of body lotion using this beeswax.</li>
            <li>However as those comments seemed to be posted on every organic beeswax pastilles I looked at, I decided to give the one by Dr. Adorable a try as several reviewers specifically mentioned this</li>
            <li>said it actually works way better.</li>
            <li>They arrived in 2 days and were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>a were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>So far these have been fantastic and I have used them to make lip balms and creams.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made these bars before, but this is the first time I have used these.  </li>
            <li>Love the white</li>
            <li>It was a hot day when it came and they hadn&#x27;t done anything to protect this type of product from heat and in a mylar bag...</li>
            <li>Since this was my first experience using beeswax, I can&#x27;t compare this one to another brand or type.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Worked exactly as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>It worked exactly as the recipe called for.  </li>
            <li>Texture and color is consistent</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i needed to make salves with.</li>
            <li>First time working with beeswax.</li>
            <li>Certainly NOT like any kind of smoke.</li>
            <li>The color from the filtering process is clean and natural.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from pure beeswax.</li>
            <li>I love that they are so small and easy to melt.</li>
            <li>I do not know what it is, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is 100% pure beeswax.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t lose that much weight when it&#x27;s  for business.</li>
            <li>The pastilles is so much easier than grating a bar of beeswax.</li>
            <li>Product melts really well and makes it much easier to work with in making lip balms and soaps.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>They are so much easier to use than the bars.</li>
            <li>I would not buy again from this seller and would not suggest anyone that wants to make lip balm With this beeswax.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very please with these.</li>
            <li>I have used yellow beeswax pellets before (I think a different brand) and they smelled nice, like honey.</li>
            <li>any other shoppers might also have concerns as to which type of organic beeswax makes the most sense to try out.  </li>
            <li>*really* wanted to be lucky and get the actual beeswax pastilles to make some lotions and salves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a huge amount of product for my uses, so it will be a long time before I have to reorder, but I would order again without reservations.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results and will be purchasing much more in the future and would recommend anyone making solid perfume to use the beeswax</li>
            <li>I love the little pellets because they melt so fast.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell super waxy/honey like the yellow wax.  </li>
            <li>as high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Consistently pure and clear.  </li>
            <li>Beeswax was creamy white and right size for melting quickly, just what I wanted for lotions &amp; salves, Organic was what I wanted for my personal products.</li>
            <li>it is hard for me to believe that they would be as powerful, or beeswax strong, but maybe they are.  </li>
            <li>This beeswax works fine in the lotion I made but stinks and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; nice smell of well made beeswax.</li>
            <li>Color is a light yellow, not quite white.</li>
            <li>I still need a few more items to buy to make the products I want to make as natural skin care.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I had just enough of my older yellow beeswax pellets left, otherwise I would not have been able to make the Christmas gifts I planned because this would have ruined the product.</li>
            <li>They melt more rapidly since they are small.  </li>
            <li>As a chemically sensitive person who is super sensitive to any petroleum-based product as well as toxins &amp; scents that most people don&#x27;t notice, I was very scared to try this out given some scary reviews re toxic smell etc.  </li>
            <li>For me this is white paraffin (from petroleum) not natural organic beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge difference in the smell, and this is smelling paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>1 part wax 3 parts oil- heat until uniform clear then continue to stir as it cools-</li>
            <li>Contributed to clear, uniform hand salves with no added odor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a stickler for wanting to stay clear of pesticides then you may want to look for another batch that comes with the &amp;#34;USDA organic&amp;#34; seal emblazoned on the package.</li>
            <li>Should last a whole year.</li>
            <li>so they were kinda soft and stuck together in clumps...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no messy chopping or grating blocks of wax.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have any smell that I could detect and I am really sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>No smell and mixes well with natural oils.</li>
            <li>Ordered the white pastilles, pretty sure I received yellow as the color was not just slightly yellowed, they were very deeply yellow in color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised there are only 4 1 stars reviews because my experience is the exact same as theirs.</li>
            <li>I purchased the beeswax to make me some solid perfume with essential oil my first time</li>
            <li>It is high quality beeswax with a white color.</li>
            <li>No funny odor, always a consistent texture.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned that the pastilles did not completely melt as I wanted them to, but in the end the body butter I made came out fine.</li>
            <li>smell was a little different than I expected, but was not horrible.</li>
            <li>For such tiny little beads of beeswax they seem to take forever to melt but they melt cleanly.  </li>
            <li>No strange smell like some reviews say.</li>
            <li>these beeswax pastilles were so much easier to use than the beeswax bars i previously bought.  </li>
            <li>These little pills melt much faster when I&#x27;m making my homemade concoctions.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of the product, and would have given it 5 stars, but I wish this had not been described as &amp;#34;bright white&amp;#34; beeswax.</li>

            <li> I also plan on experimenting using the beeswax as an alternative to WD-40 as an outstanding contractor</li>

            <li> Melted beautifully both times over a double boiler.</li>
            <li> These beeswax pellets melt down for my homemade projects perfectly.</li>
            <li> melts fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for at home use for me, but I was going to give these to friends and family members for Easter.  </li>
            <li> The product looked fine, but had a smell to it that was not the honey smell.</li>
            <li> This makes using beeswax so much easier I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen how these are either really nice or really gross.&lt;br /&gt;Acrid.</li>
            <li> Clean with no fragrance,  the pastilles melted easily.</li>
            <li> They are Extremely Light in Color..</li>
            <li> Smooth and smell just like the oils I used in them.</li>
            <li> It is essential in a great lotion.</li>
            <li> These pastilles are fantastic.</li>
            <li> But the product itself is good and natural</li>
            <li> These arrived pretty quickly and they are nice quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products from Dr. Adorable though, that I have been happy with.</li>
            <li> good page,  nice amount,  haven&#x27;t put it together with the other ingredients yet</li>
            <li> They were very easy to measure since they are small pellets, and they melted beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The pastilles melt quickly and don&#x27;t stick together so they are easy to measure</li>
            <li> These are great, love the pure white coloring and they&#x27;re working well for my lip balms.</li>
            <li> I cannot smell any of my doTERRA Essential Oils with this and considering I used a good 40ish drops and they were strong oils</li>
            <li> Rejecting chemical laden products for cleaning the house- and myself- is not only fun but great for the environment.</li>
            <li> Very easy to measure and melt, I can see buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> It says on the label it has a &#x27;naturally mild sweet aroma&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It arrived really quickly and I like what I got for the price.</li>
            <li> Item just as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I got it in order to experiment with making my own lip balm thanks to having recently found a great organic shea butter (by Wise Owl Organics) &amp; having read that simply melting those 2 ingredients along with coconut oil can make a great lip balm to which one can also add other beneficial ingredients such as cocoa butter or flavoring as desired.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so relieved when I got it to find no unpleasant smell or appearance &amp; it is in fact a pleasant soft white which seems ideal in every way including because of the resealable bag &amp; the small size of the pastilles making it super easy to just measure out the desired quantity vs. needing to grate or cut blocks of beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, does come much more yellow than the first picture would make you think, still smells pretty strongly of beeswax, but i used it for making home made lip balm and once the other ingredients were in it didnt smell too strongly</li>
            <li> The resulting lotion bars were smooth and they set very well in the molds.  </li>
            <li> I overall liked the product!&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to begin making some of my own skincare products, especially for lip care.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make their own natural skin care.</li>
            <li> Nice white color.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as describe, and was quickly shipped to me.</li>
            <li> Price was right and was shipped as scheduled will buy again</li>
            <li> then it takes some time to melt and get the right consistency</li>
            <li> These are very easy to work with, especially in measuring the amount needed.  </li>
            <li> They are very light (white) in color and the bag does say organic.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using beeswax</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this beeswax again when I make more lotion bars.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was hoping for....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my first foray into making stuff with beeswax-</li>
            <li> I made my first batch of body lotion using this beeswax.</li>
            <li> However as those comments seemed to be posted on every organic beeswax pastilles I looked at, I decided to give the one by Dr. Adorable a try as several reviewers specifically mentioned this</li>
            <li> said it actually works way better.</li>
            <li> They arrived in 2 days and were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> a were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> So far these have been fantastic and I have used them to make lip balms and creams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made these bars before, but this is the first time I have used these.  </li>
            <li> Love the white</li>
            <li> It was a hot day when it came and they hadn&#x27;t done anything to protect this type of product from heat and in a mylar bag...</li>
            <li> Since this was my first experience using beeswax, I can&#x27;t compare this one to another brand or type.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Worked exactly as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> It worked exactly as the recipe called for.  </li>
            <li> Texture and color is consistent</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i needed to make salves with.</li>
            <li> First time working with beeswax.</li>
            <li> Certainly NOT like any kind of smoke.</li>
            <li> The color from the filtering process is clean and natural.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from pure beeswax.</li>
            <li> I love that they are so small and easy to melt.</li>
            <li> I do not know what it is, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is 100% pure beeswax.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t lose that much weight when it&#x27;s  for business.</li>
            <li> The pastilles is so much easier than grating a bar of beeswax.</li>
            <li> Product melts really well and makes it much easier to work with in making lip balms and soaps.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> They are so much easier to use than the bars.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again from this seller and would not suggest anyone that wants to make lip balm With this beeswax.</li>
            <li> Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very please with these.</li>
            <li> I have used yellow beeswax pellets before (I think a different brand) and they smelled nice, like honey.</li>
            <li> any other shoppers might also have concerns as to which type of organic beeswax makes the most sense to try out.  </li>
            <li> *really* wanted to be lucky and get the actual beeswax pastilles to make some lotions and salves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a huge amount of product for my uses, so it will be a long time before I have to reorder, but I would order again without reservations.</li>
            <li> and I really like the results and will be purchasing much more in the future and would recommend anyone making solid perfume to use the beeswax</li>
            <li> I love the little pellets because they melt so fast.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell super waxy/honey like the yellow wax.  </li>
            <li> as high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Consistently pure and clear.  </li>
            <li> Beeswax was creamy white and right size for melting quickly, just what I wanted for lotions &amp; salves, Organic was what I wanted for my personal products.</li>
            <li> it is hard for me to believe that they would be as powerful, or beeswax strong, but maybe they are.  </li>
            <li> This beeswax works fine in the lotion I made but stinks and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; nice smell of well made beeswax.</li>
            <li> Color is a light yellow, not quite white.</li>
            <li> I still need a few more items to buy to make the products I want to make as natural skin care.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I had just enough of my older yellow beeswax pellets left, otherwise I would not have been able to make the Christmas gifts I planned because this would have ruined the product.</li>
            <li> They melt more rapidly since they are small.  </li>
            <li> As a chemically sensitive person who is super sensitive to any petroleum-based product as well as toxins &amp; scents that most people don&#x27;t notice, I was very scared to try this out given some scary reviews re toxic smell etc.  </li>
            <li> For me this is white paraffin (from petroleum) not natural organic beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge difference in the smell, and this is smelling paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> 1 part wax 3 parts oil- heat until uniform clear then continue to stir as it cools-</li>
            <li> Contributed to clear, uniform hand salves with no added odor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a stickler for wanting to stay clear of pesticides then you may want to look for another batch that comes with the &amp;#34;USDA organic&amp;#34; seal emblazoned on the package.</li>
            <li> Should last a whole year.</li>
            <li> so they were kinda soft and stuck together in clumps...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no messy chopping or grating blocks of wax.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any smell that I could detect and I am really sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> No smell and mixes well with natural oils.</li>
            <li> Ordered the white pastilles, pretty sure I received yellow as the color was not just slightly yellowed, they were very deeply yellow in color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there are only 4 1 stars reviews because my experience is the exact same as theirs.</li>
            <li> I purchased the beeswax to make me some solid perfume with essential oil my first time</li>
            <li> It is high quality beeswax with a white color.</li>
            <li> No funny odor, always a consistent texture.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that the pastilles did not completely melt as I wanted them to, but in the end the body butter I made came out fine.</li>
            <li> smell was a little different than I expected, but was not horrible.</li>
            <li> For such tiny little beads of beeswax they seem to take forever to melt but they melt cleanly.  </li>
            <li> No strange smell like some reviews say.</li>
            <li> these beeswax pastilles were so much easier to use than the beeswax bars i previously bought.  </li>
            <li> These little pills melt much faster when I&#x27;m making my homemade concoctions.</li>
            <li> I love the white, it leaves less behind on your clothing.</li>
            <li> No yellow tint and no wild smell.</li>
            <li> Less odor than the natural color.  </li>
            <li> you just want a good base for some salve or emollient - then do consider buying these.</li>
            <li> The beeswax had to be melted with olive or coconut oil and several other ingredients.</li>
            <li> One thing though, unlike other reviewers  mine ARE white not yellow like I saw in other reviews</li>
            <li> It does smell different than other beeswax I&#x27;ve used in</li>
            <li> no odors other than a tiny bit of, well, beeswax, which I guess is to be expected.</li>
            <li> When I added the pastilles to my double boiler, they took forever to begin melting down.  </li>
            <li> I previously used only bars of beeswax.</li>
            <li> and I had to add loads of essential oils to it to try and cover some of the odd smell of the beeswax.</li>
            <li> Only a little is needed.</li>
            <li> However, they are not white-- or at least not as white as the photo shows.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly...and product is as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a lot, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other than the odor, the product appears to have worked as it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I made a batch of lip balm, I had to pitch the, due to the smell and</li>
            <li> Absolutely no &amp;#34;floaties&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> and it melts faster than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> It smelled AWFUL, such a strong chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t even stand to have it in the same room.  </li>
            <li> So I plan on using a glass container to put my desired ingredients into &amp; then placing that in a pan of water that I slowly heat up until it all melts to enable proper mixing while liquid.  </li>
            <li> I hate that so many products use petroleum jelly to so call &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; your skin when in fact, it dries it out.  </li>
            <li> It boils down to money being and lost and not saved.</li>
            <li> I melt these down and add them to my lotions and balms.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they use a chemical to whiten it or why it smells so bad, but it seems based on several of the positive reviews that mentioned no smell, there is a problem with consistency and quality control.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a little odor came through from the plastic bag the pastilles were contained in.</li>
            <li> By purposely putting everything into my desired storage container, I&#x27;m hoping to avoid the messy clean-up a helpful Amazon reviewer warned of when working with beeswax.  </li>
            <li> I have made a few batches of foot cream with this product.  </li>
            <li> Since they are already in small pieces you don&#x27;t have to struggle to cut the wax like you have to when it is in bar form.</li>
            <li> Put leftover lipstick in a small glass jar with a bit of these.  </li>
            <li> This has the most horrible smell!!!</li>
            <li> As soon as I received them, I cut the bag open and smelled something burning--I wish I listened to a few of the reviews that said there was a bad, burnt smell.</li>
            <li> they are a bit off white in color but not to the point of disappointment by any means.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well in my recipeand less expensive than others</li>
            <li> well, these bad boys are getting returned, and I&#x27;ll try to find something local.</li>
            <li> So annoyed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it smelled bad.</li>
            <li> I read one reviewer that thought this smelled bad - mine</li>
            <li> and this is a base.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about the horrible smell, I pulled out my bag and smelled it.</li>
            <li> Smell absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> It smells like horrible, rancid oil!</li>
            <li> and some that got terrible reviews.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen how these are either really nice or really gross.&lt;br /&gt;Acrid. Chemical. Smell. Like &amp;#34;hurts my nose to breathe it in more than once or twice&amp;#34; acrid.&lt;br /&gt;Darnit, I *really* wanted to be lucky and get the actual beeswax pastilles to make some lotions and salves.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, these bad boys are getting returned, and I&#x27;ll try to find something local.</li>
            <li> Great service and product</li>
            <li> Have been using these to make my own cosmetic products (lip balm,deodorant, lotion bars). They are good quality, melt well and smell nice. Color is a light yellow, not quite white.</li>
            <li> So far...so good.  Used a bit for homemade beauty products.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> These are just as advertised... I would give 5 stars if the packaging was a bit better.  While opening, the bag split and a bunch spilled.  Otherwise I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Works great in my DIY emulsifying wax blend, along with borax and soy lecithin.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using beeswax so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. After reading reviews about the horrible smell, I pulled out my bag and smelled it. I can&#x27;t say it smelled bad. Certainly NOT like any kind of smoke. It was more &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; if anything. Perhaps a little odor came through from the plastic bag the pastilles were contained in. Other than the odor, the product appears to have worked as it was supposed to. I was a little concerned that the pastilles did not completely melt as I wanted them to, but in the end the body butter I made came out fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to make lotion bars and they worked great!  They were very easy to measure since they are small pellets, and they melted beautifully.  This beeswax wasn&#x27;t gritty or smelly at all.  The resulting lotion bars were smooth and they set very well in the molds.  I will definitely be ordering this beeswax again when I make more lotion bars.</li>
            <li> These arrived pretty quickly and they are nice quality. However, they are not white-- or at least not as white as the photo shows. They&#x27;re definitely yellow, like in the second and third photos. I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of the product, and would have given it 5 stars, but I wish this had not been described as &amp;#34;bright white&amp;#34; beeswax.</li>
            <li> Great product, does come much more yellow than the first picture would make you think, still smells pretty strongly of beeswax, but i used it for making home made lip balm and once the other ingredients were in it didnt smell too strongly</li>
            <li> Melts well. Great for my homemade salves.</li>
            <li> Says 16 oz but you only received 15.6 oz... I  returned. I can&#x27;t lose that much weight when it&#x27;s  for business. It boils down to money being and lost and not saved.</li>
            <li> If you need beeswax...........this is the only way to go!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use these for making  lip balm. They are perfect size and so easy to use!</li>
            <li> n0 issues  pleased with product</li>
            <li> Smelled like burnt hair. Was not a fan of this product. I do not think that I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, good quality. Should be great for many projects.</li>
            <li> these are nice to make lotions, candles, etc.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was hoping for....they worked great in my homemade lip balm!</li>
            <li> Great product and service.  Will order more soon.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. I also like that it was white, so that it didn&#x27;t color everything yellow. I use it in my homemade organic lip balms!</li>
            <li> The beeswax melts easy, no smell and works great if you plan on making your own lotions. A little goes a long way. The pastilles is so much easier than grating a bar of beeswax. Time and work saver.</li>
            <li> Clean with no fragrance,  the pastilles melted easily. I can see these as an improvement over my former brand. excellent!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my first foray into making stuff with beeswax- actually I just wanted to make furniture sealer with beeswax and olive oil.  1 part wax 3 parts oil- heat until uniform clear then continue to stir as it cools- voila.  Anyway, the wax pellets look great and easy to use/measure/etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into making some homemade cosmetic supplies requiring beeswax. Only a little is needed. I know I&#x27;m not getting any chemicals.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from pure beeswax. No detectable odor, good melting pointâ€¦this stuff was a pleasure to work with.</li>
            <li> I use them to make my homemade skin cream. They melt easily.  Since they are already in small pieces you don&#x27;t have to struggle to cut the wax like you have to when it is in bar form.</li>
            <li> No yellow tint and no wild smell. I love this stuff. Great for making hand and nail cream. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> perfect for lots of homemade lotions, lip balms, etc.</li>
            <li> I previously used only bars of beeswax. These little pills melt much faster when I&#x27;m making my homemade concoctions. Good quality too.</li>
            <li> Product melts really well and makes it much easier to work with in making lip balms and soaps.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li> It would have received 5 stars but there was no information stating it was organic.  There was no certification backing it up.</li>
            <li> I love the little pellets because they melt so fast.  I would buy them again</li>
            <li> I made my first batch of body lotion using this beeswax. The beeswax had to be melted with olive or coconut oil and several other ingredients. Product easily melted. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These are great and were shipped quickly and packaged well. Easy to work with and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> These beeswax pellets melt down for my homemade projects perfectly. No complaints. White, no color. They come in a resealable bag.</li>
            <li> As a chemically sensitive person who is super sensitive to any petroleum-based product as well as toxins &amp; scents that most people don&#x27;t notice, I was very scared to try this out given some scary reviews re toxic smell etc.  However as those comments seemed to be posted on every organic beeswax pastilles I looked at, I decided to give the one by Dr. Adorable a try as several reviewers specifically mentioned this as high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so relieved when I got it to find no unpleasant smell or appearance &amp; it is in fact a pleasant soft white which seems ideal in every way including because of the resealable bag &amp; the small size of the pastilles making it super easy to just measure out the desired quantity vs. needing to grate or cut blocks of beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet used it as it only just arrived but I didn&#x27;t want to delay posting this review in case any other shoppers might also have concerns as to which type of organic beeswax makes the most sense to try out.  I got it in order to experiment with making my own lip balm thanks to having recently found a great organic shea butter (by Wise Owl Organics) &amp; having read that simply melting those 2 ingredients along with coconut oil can make a great lip balm to which one can also add other beneficial ingredients such as cocoa butter or flavoring as desired.  An Amazon reviewer said that microwaving in 30 seconds rounds until it&#x27;s fully melted works well but I purposely don&#x27;t have a microwave (given some indications that the cells of any food &amp; possibly even containers placed in the microwave do get lastingly altered with implications for our long-term health that may not yet be sufficiently understood).  So I plan on using a glass container to put my desired ingredients into &amp; then placing that in a pan of water that I slowly heat up until it all melts to enable proper mixing while liquid.  By purposely putting everything into my desired storage container, I&#x27;m hoping to avoid the messy clean-up a helpful Amazon reviewer warned of when working with beeswax.  I also plan on experimenting using the beeswax as an alternative to WD-40 as an outstanding contractor said it actually works way better.arned of when working with beeswax.  I also plan on experimenting using the beeswax as an alternative to WD-40 as an outstanding contractor said it actually works way better.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as describe, and was quickly shipped to me.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to work with, especially in measuring the amount needed.  They melt more rapidly since they are small.  I like them for making lip balm.</li>
            <li> These beeswax pastilles are great. They are so easy to use, after using and shredding blocks of beeswax. They melt very smoothly and evenly and have a nice texture. They arrived in 2 days and were exactly as advertised. I have confidence in the seller, Orange Casa. I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> good page,  nice amount,  haven&#x27;t put it together with the other ingredients yet</li>
            <li> I loved these beewax pastilles!! They are Extremely Light in Color.. They have no odor I could tell of, and the salves I used them in came out beautifully. Smooth and smell just like the oils I used in them. 5 Star I would buy these over and over again!</li>
            <li> Perfect for making candles and lotion bars.</li>
            <li> These beeswax pastille a were exactly what I was looking for.  I used them to make lip balm and they were perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used for making Chapstick. My chopsticks turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> excellent quality (not that I am a beeswax expert).  it does what it says.  melts fine.  no odors other than a tiny bit of, well, beeswax, which I guess is to be expected. easy to melt.</li>
            <li> So far these have been fantastic and I have used them to make lip balms and creams.  Love the product!</li>
            <li> When I added the pastilles to my double boiler, they took forever to begin melting down.  When I added my shea butter and coconut oil to make lotion bars, the pastilles began to reform.  I continued to stir them until it seemed that they had melted.  Once I stopped stirring, they began reforming.  I&#x27;ve made these bars before, but this is the first time I have used these.  I think that I will finish what I have but then continue ordering the bricks of beeswax.  I thought this would save me some time, but it doesn&#x27;t in the end.  In the end, I had chunks of beeswax that wouldn&#x27;t melt and ended up, in chunks, in my lotion bars.  It&#x27;s fine for at home use for me, but I was going to give these to friends and family members for Easter.  I won&#x27;t be doing that now.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it when making lotion bars! Priced well. Should last a whole year.I reccomend giving it a chance.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the one thing I&#x27;ve used them for so far!  I made vapor rub and it has held up well without a ton of melting.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using more for chapstick and sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Melts evenly and colorless. The beads are a nice size for mixing into my lotion recipe. They don&#x27;t clump together when stored.</li>
            <li> Not for body products, ment for candles!</li>
            <li> These are great, love the pure white coloring and they&#x27;re working well for my lip balms.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for homemade deodorant. I love the white, it leaves less behind on your clothing.</li>
            <li> This was delivers on time and mine were white, not remotely yellow.  I only wish they were in a resealable bag.  I just put it into a quart size resealable one, but it would have been easier for it to already be there.I made a salve with it, and it melted beautifully.</li>
            <li> Beeswax was creamy white and right size for melting quickly, just what I wanted for lotions &amp; salves, Organic was what I wanted for my personal products. Price was right and was shipped as scheduled will buy again</li>
            <li> Ordered the white pastilles, pretty sure I received yellow as the color was not just slightly yellowed, they were very deeply yellow in color.  The pastilles were easy to measure, easy to use.  Much better for melting than a bar of beeswax.  Would have given it 5 stars if the color were correct.</li>
            <li> There is No smell to the product, it was easy to use (used it to make cream). I overall liked the product!&lt;br /&gt;There is no usda organic label though.</li>
            <li> Love the white so it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my soap. Easy to measure</li>
            <li> Works for DIY lipstick and lip gloss and more.  Put leftover lipstick in a small glass jar with a bit of these.  Melt in microwave.  Voila!</li>
            <li> I intend to make my own chap sticks and healing balms.  Since everything else is organic it makes sense to use organize beeswax.  The pastilles melt quicker at a low heat.</li>
            <li> This beeswax works fine in the lotion I made but stinks and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; nice smell of well made beeswax.</li>
            <li> Used it for making lotion bars along with equal parts of shea butter, coconut oil, mango butter, and cocoa butter, and it works great! It is high quality beeswax with a white color.</li>
            <li> Very nice packaging and great quality wax. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It was a hot day when it came and they hadn&#x27;t done anything to protect this type of product from heat and in a mylar bag... so they were kinda soft and stuck together in clumps...It&#x27;s a good product anyway, but that should be a consideration for this type of product. One thing though, unlike other reviewers  mine ARE white not yellow like I saw in other reviews</li>
            <li> These pellets are wonderful and I received them quickly!</li>
            <li> I used it to make lotion bars.  They turned out fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;The smell was a little different than I expected, but was not horrible.</li>
            <li> My husband bought these.  They are white, as described.  They melt well.</li>
            <li> Always great quality. No funny odor, always a consistent texture. I use a lot of wax and this is the best wax I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> For me this is white paraffin (from petroleum) not natural organic beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge difference in the smell, and this is smelling paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;And not organic logo or any logo anywhere !!!&lt;br /&gt;Can you even sell something without giving the country of origin and the ingredients on the packaging???</li>
            <li> These pastilles are the perfect size for quick and easy melting. There&#x27;s no messy chopping or grating blocks of wax. The color from the filtering process is clean and natural. I will definitely purchase these again!</li>
            <li> Excellent for many uses, and is great quality.</li>
            <li> Smell absolutely terrible. As soon as I received them, I cut the bag open and smelled something burning--I wish I listened to a few of the reviews that said there was a bad, burnt smell. They are very light (white) in color and the bag does say organic. I purchased the beeswax to make lotion, aka something that smells lovely, and this beeswax would have ruined it!</li>
            <li> I used this beeswax to make lotion bars and lip balm, and it worked great! Since this was my first experience using beeswax, I can&#x27;t compare this one to another brand or type. But I found these pastilles to be very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good quality, would purchase again</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to begin making some of my own skincare products, especially for lip care.  I hate that so many products use petroleum jelly to so call &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; your skin when in fact, it dries it out.  I still need a few more items to buy to make the products I want to make as natural skin care.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make their own natural skin care.</li>
            <li> Made my first magnesium lotion successfully with this pastilles. I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> product intact, shipping ok.</li>
            <li> Great pellet size, makes measuring by weight or by liquid measurement easy. The color is lovely and it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li> I am so into making my own &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; these days. Rejecting chemical laden products for cleaning the house- and myself- is not only fun but great for the environment. I made furniture polish, and lip balm. Smells wonderful. Thank you, Bees!</li>
            <li> I love the pellets. They are so much easier to use than the bars.</li>
            <li> The product looked fine, but had a smell to it that was not the honey smell. I did make 2 candles from it and I had to add loads of essential oils to it to try and cover some of the odd smell of the beeswax. I made a batch of lip balm, I had to pitch the, due to the smell and the essentials were over powered by the beeswax smell. I ordered 16 oz. but I got 15 oz. in the bag. It would be nice to get the amount that I paid for. I would not buy again from this seller and would not suggest anyone that wants to make lip balm With this beeswax.</li>
            <li> I melt these down and add them to my lotions and balms.</li>
            <li> Melt easily and can add beet powder for color</li>
            <li> Came double bagged!  Thanks!  Evenly melting pastilles.  Less odor than the natural color.  Makes it easier to &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; your lip balm or scent your body butter!  Absolutely no &amp;#34;floaties&amp;#34;!  Very clean.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This beeswax is great for making bath products. It does smell different than other beeswax I&#x27;ve used in it&#x27;s solid form, but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell once it was melted.</li>
            <li> I use these to make my own lip balm and such and they&#x27;re great. Good quality, no scent, and they melt very smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday.  Worked exactly as I thought it would.  I read one reviewer that thought this smelled bad - mine didn&#x27;t have any smell that I could detect and I am really sensitive to smells.  It is a huge amount of product for my uses, so it will be a long time before I have to reorder, but I would order again without reservations.</li>
            <li> This makes using beeswax so much easier I love it!</li>
            <li> perfect.  I USE TO MAKE BUTT PASTE AND LOTIONS</li>
            <li> Works great for what I am using it for</li>
            <li> Melts quickly and mixes nicely into my day lotion concoction. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great price and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Used this to make a hand balm. Nice result.</li>
            <li> For such tiny little beads of beeswax they seem to take forever to melt but they melt cleanly.  The pastilles blended very easily in with the butters and oils that I added.</li>
            <li> prefect product for our use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great quality. I used it to make organic deodorants and they came out great.</li>
            <li> Consistently pure and clear.  Contributed to clear, uniform hand salves with no added odor.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use in the pastilles. I make my own lotion and this is a base. It is essential in a great lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there are only 4 1 stars reviews because my experience is the exact same as theirs. It smells like horrible, rancid oil! It says on the label it has a &#x27;naturally mild sweet aroma&#x27;. Couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth! I have used yellow beeswax pellets before (I think a different brand) and they smelled nice, like honey. I am not sure if they use a chemical to whiten it or why it smells so bad, but it seems based on several of the positive reviews that mentioned no smell, there is a problem with consistency and quality control. Thankfully I had just enough of my older yellow beeswax pellets left, otherwise I would not have been able to make the Christmas gifts I planned because this would have ruined the product. I&#x27;ve used other products from Dr. Adorable though, that I have been happy with.</li>
            <li> Just made some lotion with this and loved it! Easy to manage and it is perfect in lotions!</li>
            <li> I need these for an ointment recipe I had.  It worked exactly as the recipe called for.  It is easy to measure for the recipe I used it in.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making salves.</li>
            <li> No strange smell like some reviews say. It arrived really quickly and I like what I got for the price. Would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use in lotions</li>
            <li> Quality  seems very good to us.  Texture and color is consistent</li>
            <li> So handy and easy to measure!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Perfect for making lotions</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for WHITE pastilles, then pass on these--they are yellow. Like corn yellow--my daughter saw the bag &amp; thought it was a bag of corn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want a good base for some salve or emollient - then do consider buying these. They worked great for me. I melted once with oils &amp; then remelted the same batch again when it didn&#x27;t turn out just the way I wanted it to. Melted beautifully both times over a double boiler. Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official organic seal on these so you&#x27;ll just have to cross those fingers &amp; trust that they&#x27;re organic. The seal does make one a bit more confident in a product&#x27;s true organic nature. If you&#x27;re a stickler for wanting to stay clear of pesticides then you may want to look for another batch that comes with the &amp;#34;USDA organic&amp;#34; seal emblazoned on the package.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly...and product is as expected.</li>
            <li> The bag I received was labeled as &#x27;HansiOrganics.com Beeswax&#x27; and did NOT have a USDA certified organic seal on the bag anywhere.  It smelled AWFUL, such a strong chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t even stand to have it in the same room.  I returned it immediately, guess I&#x27;ll have to find another source for my beeswax.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a lot, a little goes a long way. The shipping was fast, the seller is great. I will order from here again. This has become a staple for me.</li>
            <li> This has the most horrible smell!!! I do not know what it is, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is 100% pure beeswax. I cannot smell any of my doTERRA Essential Oils with this and considering I used a good 40ish drops and they were strong oils it&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> I have made a few batches of foot cream with this product.  Other then it takes some time to melt and get the right consistency so it isn&#x27;t too solid I like the product.  No smell and mixes well with natural oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make lotions with my essential oils. It has worked beautifully. No problems at all. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the beeswax to make me some solid perfume with essential oil my first time and I made some and I really like the results and will be purchasing much more in the future and would recommend anyone making solid perfume to use the beeswax</li>
            <li> My beeswax pellets were clean and in perfect shape. I made lip balm with them and it turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> These pastilles are fantastic. I use them for my lip balm and lotion balm. Keeps my lips softer longer and had done wonder for my legs.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it was a great consistency and I love the color of the bees wax. Thank you</li>
            <li> So annoyed. I researched these because I saw there were some providers who got great reviews (dr. Adorable) and some that got terrible reviews. This product arrived and even though It says it&#x27;s from Dr. Adorable, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s from HansiOrganics. It smells overwhelmingly chemical. I took some out and chewed them to see if it might be the packaging (plastic bag), but it tastes chemically as well. This is simply not organic beeswax. Also, no organic sticker on it or country of origin. I don&#x27; know what to say.</li>
            <li> This is perfect, perfect price, perfect quality, perfect consistency, melts easy, keep it in a big mason jar and measure out as I need it  -- not a  complaint at all!</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these to make lotion. I love that they are so small and easy to melt. My husband makes waxes for fly tying materials and was envious of the ease it took to melt these. I ended up agreeing to share :)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i needed to make salves with. I wanted white just for the color. It has blended well and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very please with these. I needed them for making lip balm and wanted white beeswax since I tinted the lip balm. The pastilles melt quickly and don&#x27;t stick together so they are easy to measure</li>
            <li> I bought this to make beeswax candles and it was great - successful the first try.  Very easy to measure and melt, I can see buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> these beeswax pastilles were so much easier to use than the beeswax bars i previously bought.  it is hard for me to believe that they would be as powerful, or beeswax strong, but maybe they are.  i will probably buy them again for their ease of use.</li>
            <li> It works well in my recipeand less expensive than others</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used these yet but the got here with in 48 hours and they seem to be as described by the seller. they are a bit off white in color but not to the point of disappointment by any means.&lt;br /&gt;would love to continue to do business with this seller for sure</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell super waxy/honey like the yellow wax.  A great Buy!</li>
            <li> good quality, melt quickly</li>
            <li> Excellent  product, as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my Salve I make and it is nice and very easy to use. Great price too!</li>
            <li> First time working with beeswax. Used it to make my own lip-cuticle balm. Arrived on time, was nicely packaged and is easy to use. Only thing I would like to see is a resealable package. But the product itself is good and natural</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Nice white color. I use it to make lip and hand balms.</li>
            <li> Loved it, have made lots with it and it works great!</li>
            <li> Melts easily into homemade lotions and balms.</li>
            <li> I love this organic beeswax.  I use it mostly to make my own sunscreen and it melts faster than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> very nice product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Easy to work with when making my lotion bars and also lip balm. Item just as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I am not a beeswax expert but this product had no smell and worked well in the cosmetic I incorporated it into.</li>
