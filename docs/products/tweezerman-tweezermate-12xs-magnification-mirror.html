            <li>Be sure to read description</li>
            <li>One I&#x27;ve had for more than 6 years.  </li>
            <li>This magnification 12x mirror is just perfect for tweezing eyebrows and putting on makeup, especially around the eye area, and lips</li>
            <li>Has prevented me from looking like a unicorn on more than one occasion.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they used to be better.  </li>
            <li>This a great mirror, you can really see everything that you have on your face.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I paid more for what I thought was going to be a better quality brand.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, prefect for eye make up and to groom, you can see everything.</li>
            <li>This mirror was a replacement for one I&#x27;d had for many, many years</li>
            <li>It more than fills the bill.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>how many words to write.</li>
            <li>why do you need so many statements</li>
            <li>have to hold it in order to get the right angle to have a good view and focus.  </li>
            <li>smaller than you expect but very good mirror-</li>
            <li>Most drugstore mirrors are cheaply made and have a lot of distortion.</li>
            <li>does the trick and easy to pack</li>
            <li>I can easily tweezers my eyebrows using this.</li>
            <li>The 15x is STRONG.</li>
            <li>fantastic for a travel mirror for those over 40 eyes</li>
            <li>Great size and magnification.is terrific.</li>
            <li>most of these bathroom mirrors top out around 5x, but this at 12x really shows that you have hairs where you don&#x27;t want them.    </li>
            <li>It is a little too powerful for makeup application, but perfect for tweezing.</li>
            <li>The 12X magnification of this mirror is perfect for all those hard to see places on your face, without your eye glasses.</li>
            <li>A lot of stuff from China looks just like the original product with a quick superficial inspection but often the quality materials and workmanship are not there.</li>
            <li>When your close up vision starts to go (and it will), this makes a HUGE difference in being able to see the eyebrows that you wouldn&#x27;t normally see - but others do.  </li>
            <li>Prepare to be surprised to see what your own skin looks like.</li>
            <li>While the magnification is great, this mirror is not very useful if mounted on a surface.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do have a bigger mirror to see my whole face, for eye makeup this one works great.</li>
            <li>, anything is a lot easier and more precise if you have the help of this handy little mirror.</li>
            <li>I agree, you can only really use this mirror one eye at a time,but it works and I love it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is attached to the corner of our medicine cabinet mirror and comes in quite handy without blocking the mirror for general use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, it falls off frequently and one too many falls dislodged the mirror from the plastic</li>
            <li>The smaller size is perfect to find a stray eyelash or other debris that may get in your eyes.</li>
            <li>and it is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to find the right spot to see well.</li>
            <li>She has tried several different magnifying mirrors, but she said this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I saw one at a friends and the first thought I had was, amazon will have this.</li>
            <li>But since I have that problem with pretty much all suction-cup devices, it is most likely the operator who is at fault.</li>
            <li>and so I was initially dubious about whether it would become part of my routine in the same good way.</li>
            <li>Hardly worth the high price----total junk.</li>
            <li>I was extremely please with this item, the mirror can be moved to be used anywhere, I placed it on my current lighted makeup mirror and it works great..</li>
            <li>This little mirror is phenomenal!  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>The 12x&#x27;s magnification makes it very unclear to see what you are looking at.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is really magnified...</li>
            <li>Fits anywhere without taking much space.</li>
            <li>And this is after being placed on a smooth surface and left there.....not relocated at all.</li>
            <li>so I really needed this.  </li>
            <li>I know that I absolutely did not want a mirror this size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so small and light that you can easily carry in your cosmetic case.</li>
            <li>Magnification is SCARY good though!</li>
            <li>Really couldn&#x27;t live without this &amp; my Tweezerman Slanted Tip Tweezers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to hold it a little farther away from the subject, however, and it performs incredibly.</li>
            <li>There is considerable distortion around the edges which is clearly evident when it is held at at arm&#x27;s length.  </li>
            <li>its only about the size of a woman&#x27;s palm so its great to throw into a big purse but not quite big enough for a bathroom mirror if you ask me.</li>
            <li>My makeup is better than ever, and so are the little hairs..</li>
            <li>Its about as useful as a 5X mirror with a larger diameter.</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T LIVE without this mirror .I</li>
            <li>one I buy a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which is why I am ordering a new one.  </li>
            <li>so I can tilt it different directions when applying eye makeup, and the third one is suctioned to my vanity stand-alone mirror to keep my hands free when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it - ever.</li>
            <li>I have another mirror of the exact same size and shape sold by Zadro which is optically correct and has no discernable distortion.  </li>
            <li>so I am replacing it with the exact same item.</li>
            <li>:) Only thing is now I see all my little imperfections</li>
            <li>The larger mirrors have too much distortion.  </li>
            <li>I too had cataract surgery after being myopic and then losing that near vision.</li>
            <li>I do plan to make a soft pouch out of fabric to protect it.</li>
            <li>This might be a fine product as far as mirror quality goes, however, it is way too small to be of any practical use.  </li>
            <li>It took a little time to get used to, because this one is different from the one I was using which I dropped and broke, but actually this one is a better size and quality</li>
            <li>This is a small but mighty makeup/shaving mirror.</li>
            <li>It is only 3\\&quot; diameter - good for travel but a bit small for everyday home use -</li>
            <li>What I got was a $14 mirror that has a completely warped reflection that makes it near useless, and to top it off, the suction cups flattened out and wouldn&#x27;t hold anymore.</li>
            <li>Makes your live much easier by tweezing faster and without missing one spot.</li>
            <li>I am keeping this mirror, but I&#x27;m not ready to throw away my extra large 10x mirror.</li>
            <li>I saw the same mirror at a large well known store for half what this one cost.</li>
            <li>There is clear focus in the center, but distortion at the edges.</li>

            <li> I saw the same mirror at a large well known store for half what this one cost.</li>
            <li> There is clear focus in the center, but distortion at the edges.</li>
            <li> It is a real insult to charge that price for such a small mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is hard to get focused in and the cups on the back that stick it to a flat surface do not hold very well.</li>
            <li> I find it just a little bit hard to get the focus right</li>
            <li> Unfortunately her first one broke whilst traveling so this is her second.</li>
            <li> Warning: makes little facial flaws look like that river</li>
            <li> The magnification may be 12X but its not much use on a mirror with a diameter of just 4 inches.</li>
            <li> It arrived quicker then expected as well.</li>
            <li> Works like it should not much to say about this item??</li>
            <li> mirror has two small suction cups on the back and they lose their suction after just a few months of use, they get stretched out and flat and no longer have suction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned a few magnifying mirrors of various sizes and truly believe that I ordered a 6\\&quot; diameter mirror, not a 3 3/8\\&quot; diameter.</li>

            <li> Now that my eyesite is going (over 40) I need that little &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; to see what I can&#x27;t see anymore. :) Only thing is now I see all my little imperfections and I&#x27;m constantly looking in it. I have one for home and one for travel.</li>
            <li> You will not miss a hair with this mirror.  Beware, however, that the image can be quite frightening!  Approach the exercise with self-confidence, however, and you will be pleased with the results.  My only complaint is that the suction cups do not hold well, I have never gotten them to work properly.  But since I have that problem with pretty much all suction-cup devices, it is most likely the operator who is at fault.</li>
            <li> The magnification may be 12X but its not much use on a mirror with a diameter of just 4 inches. The entire purpose is defeated since you have to hold the mirror at some distance to get the magnification effect. the product description should mention the size of the mirror as well. Its about as useful as a 5X mirror with a larger diameter.</li>
            <li> This might be a fine product as far as mirror quality goes, however, it is way too small to be of any practical use.  I&#x27;m sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely please with this item, the mirror can be moved to be used anywhere, I placed it on my current lighted makeup mirror and it works great..I actually forget that my glasses are not on.  I agree, you can only really use this mirror one eye at a time,but it works and I love it!! My makeup is better than ever, and so are the little hairs..thanks.</li>
            <li> not good optically. difficult and annoying to use.    page would not let me click ONE STAR</li>
            <li> Almost too small. Be sure to read description</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;12x magnification is marvelous&lt;br /&gt;compact size is great for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when I purchased this.  I was expecting salad plate size, but what I got was coffee cup size.  The 12x magnification makes a big difference.  I am keeping this mirror, but I&#x27;m not ready to throw away my extra large 10x mirror.</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews and bought this mirror. I find it hard to use. I&#x27;m looking for a mirror to use in applying eye makeup. This mirror works to some degree, but it takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> What can I say ? I had not seen my eyebrows since I was 65. I can also put on eye make-up again with no jabs to the whites of my eyes. Just great!</li>
            <li> This 12x&#x27;s magnification mirror is only 4 inches in diameter.  The 12x&#x27;s magnification makes it very unclear to see what you are looking at.  This one was a return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> The mirror is hard to get focused in and the cups on the back that stick it to a flat surface do not hold very well.</li>
            <li> My 40-something eyes just can&#x27;t see up close anymore. I got this for tweezing and applying makeup. The 15x is STRONG. It is a little too powerful for makeup application, but perfect for tweezing. You&#x27;ll see flaws in your skin you never knew you had! It is nice that I can now see details and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the suction cups not sticking. It hasn&#x27;t budged!</li>
            <li> This little mirror is a must have in every bathroom mirror. It has suction cups and you place it according to your convinience. Removing a lost eyelash from your eye, plucking out stuborn ingrown hair, removing blackheads... you name it, anything is a lot easier and more precise if you have the help of this handy little mirror. It&#x27;s so small and light that you can easily carry in your cosmetic case. Check on my custom&#x27;s image above to see what I&#x27;m talking about. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This little mirror is phenomenal!  I used to buy them at a bed and bath store but they switched from Tweezerman to an no name knock-off at the same price and the image quality can&#x27;t begin to compare with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get in close so i can tweeze hairs or check out my skin.  This mirror is really magnified... most of these bathroom mirrors top out around 5x, but this at 12x really shows that you have hairs where you don&#x27;t want them.    Prepare to be surprised to see what your own skin looks like.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just so so; good for the price, though.  Magification is there but you have to be extremely close.  There is clear focus in the center, but distortion at the edges. It is only 3\\&quot; diameter - good for travel but a bit small for everyday home use - I wish they offered a mirror with similar magnification that had a 1\\&quot; to 2\\&quot; larger diameter.</li>
            <li> I like the 12-power over the 10-power magnification mirror because&lt;br /&gt;it makes my whispy little mustache look like the one Tom Selleck has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great little mirror. Warning: makes little facial flaws look like that river&lt;br /&gt;goin&#x27; through The Grand Canyon!</li>
            <li> I own three of these mirrors. One I&#x27;ve had for more than 6 years.  They are perfect for seeing hairs and blemishes before everyone else can see them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my friends run away if I offer it to them to see what they&#x27;ve been missing (literally)!  So it&#x27;s not for the faint of heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, one for travel, purse, etc.  One not attached to anything so I can tilt it different directions when applying eye makeup, and the third one is suctioned to my vanity stand-alone mirror to keep my hands free when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it - ever.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for eye make up and it is just the right size. An amazing tool. I do have a bigger mirror to see my whole face, for eye makeup this one works great.</li>
            <li> This magnification 12x mirror is just perfect for tweezing eyebrows and putting on makeup, especially around the eye area, and lips</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T LIVE without this mirror .I can&#x27;t tweeze my eyebrows if I missplace my little mirrow.Fits anywhere without taking much space.Makes your live much easier by tweezing faster and without missing one spot.All lady&#x27;s must carry or have one of these if, they want to look there best.Have recommened to all my sisters and friends.</li>
            <li> Did NOT have the size in the ad.   When it came, was apalled it was only about     2 1/2\\&quot;  in  diamater........too SMALL to be of use...</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  I bought one for my bathroom, 1 for my office and one for my purse.  And one for my best friend.  When your close up vision starts to go (and it will), this makes a HUGE difference in being able to see the eyebrows that you wouldn&#x27;t normally see - but others do.  Has prevented me from looking like a unicorn on more than one occasion.  Really couldn&#x27;t live without this &amp; my Tweezerman Slanted Tip Tweezers!</li>
            <li> smaller than you expect but very good mirror- its only about the size of a woman&#x27;s palm so its great to throw into a big purse but not quite big enough for a bathroom mirror if you ask me. Magnification is SCARY good though!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!! Just got this mirror, and in the picture, it looks big. It&#x27;s way too small, and going back where it came from</li>
            <li> Great size! Does the job! Purse size, sturdy, great reflective and magnifying properties. I am planning on purchasing a couple more!</li>
            <li> Crazy magnification, almost too much, or at least more than I had expected. I&#x27;ve learned to hold it a little farther away from the subject, however, and it performs incredibly.</li>
            <li> The 12X magnification of this mirror is perfect for all those hard to see places on your face, without your eye glasses. I can find nothing wrong with this product. I would rate it 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> The larger mirrors have too much distortion.  It takes forever to find the right spot to see well. The smaller size is perfect to find a stray eyelash or other debris that may get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Handy for tweezing on the go.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well to the mirror, too small to hold close to one&#x27;s face. Basically useless.</li>
            <li> This mirror is advertised as optically correct but it is NOT.  There is considerable distortion around the edges which is clearly evident when it is held at at arm&#x27;s length.  I have another mirror of the exact same size and shape sold by Zadro which is optically correct and has no discernable distortion.  I noticed the Tweezerman is made in China.  Maybe they used to be better.  A lot of stuff from China looks just like the original product with a quick superficial inspection but often the quality materials and workmanship are not there.</li>
            <li> fantastic for a travel mirror for those over 40 eyes</li>
            <li> I needed the 12X magnification but it is too small. You do not put the size any where on your page. It is a real insult to charge that price for such a small mirror.</li>
            <li> Unless you are using this for the magnification of a very specific area, i.e. eyebrows, the view will be distorted.  That said, the quality is great and since I bought it for plucking eyebrows, it is perfect. If however, you need it for viewing the entire face, look for a bigger mirror.</li>
            <li> While the magnification is great, this mirror is not very useful if mounted on a surface.&lt;br /&gt;I have to hold it in order to get the right angle to have a good view and focus.  The size is perfect for travel or keeping in my purse.</li>
            <li> This a great mirror, you can really see everything that you have on your face.</li>
            <li> This product appeared much larger in the picture. It is very small &amp; hard to use. Also was overpriced. I saw the same mirror at a large well known store for half what this one cost.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and great magnification! My vision is not what it once was. I just love it.  It arrived quicker then expected as well.</li>
            <li> it just fell from the window where it was suctioned and shattered between my feet after 3 short days.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I paid more for what I thought was going to be a better quality brand. What I got was a $14 mirror that has a completely warped reflection that makes it near useless, and to top it off, the suction cups flattened out and wouldn&#x27;t hold anymore. And this is after being placed on a smooth surface and left there.....not relocated at all. It just fell off one day and refused to hold. Hardly worth the high price----total junk.</li>
            <li> Great for applying make up and contact lenses</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, prefect for eye make up and to groom, you can see everything. This is my 4th , every time I broke or miss place one I buy a new one. I have one at work and one home. You cannot go wrong with it . It&#x27;s small fits on the palm of you hands so it&#x27;s great to take along.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to get used to, because this one is different from the one I was using which I dropped and broke, but actually this one is a better size and quality and I&#x27;m happy that I found it.</li>
            <li> If you need reading glasses, you need this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is attached to the corner of our medicine cabinet mirror and comes in quite handy without blocking the mirror for general use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror has two small suction cups on the back and they lose their suction after just a few months of use, they get stretched out and flat and no longer have suction.  Therefore, it falls off frequently and one too many falls dislodged the mirror from the plastic backing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I am ordering a new one.  I like the functionality and the size so I am replacing it with the exact same item.</li>
            <li> Picked it up for my mum and she doesn&#x27;t travel without it. She has tried several different magnifying mirrors, but she said this is by far the best. Unfortunately her first one broke whilst traveling so this is her second. She is quite the traveller!</li>
            <li> Perfectly happy with this mirror</li>
            <li> Great size and magnification.is terrific. This mirror was a replacement for one I&#x27;d had for many, many years and so I was initially dubious about whether it would become part of my routine in the same good way. It more than fills the bill.</li>
            <li> This mirror is such a blessing.  I am about blind (old age sucks) so I really needed this.  I saw one at a friends and the first thought I had was, amazon will have this.</li>
            <li> So tired of taking bulky mirrors on trips just for the magnification.&lt;br /&gt;This does the trick and easy to pack</li>
            <li> This is a small but mighty makeup/shaving mirror. It has great magnification and is the highest quality available. Most drugstore mirrors are cheaply made and have a lot of distortion. This one is excellent. I only wish they still made them with 3 suction cups on the back rather than 2.</li>
            <li> I just read a few negative reviews about this product and the ordering process and I agree with those customers disappointment. I can&#x27;t say for sure but I feel that I was somehow fooled somehow by the ordering process of this mirror. I&#x27;ve previously owned a few magnifying mirrors of various sizes and truly believe that I ordered a 6\\&quot; diameter mirror, not a 3 3/8\\&quot; diameter. I know that I absolutely did not want a mirror this size. These small ones are sold all over the internet for 1/3 the price I paid and do not serve my needs. It seems that the product description was changed after I ordered it. I just don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve never had a problem over many years of ordering from Amazon VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
            <li> what can anyone say it is a MIRROR you have no right to demand  how many words to write. because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of that demand i usually wont write anything why do you need so many statements ITS GOOD SHOULD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE FINE</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews. I too had cataract surgery after being myopic and then losing that near vision. I can easily tweezers my eyebrows using this. It came packed in a bubble wrap pouch which is great to protect it while it&#x27;s in my purse. I do plan to make a soft pouch out of fabric to protect it.</li>
            <li> Works like it should not much to say about this item??</li>
            <li> I find it just a little bit hard to get the focus right but otherwise it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12X is quite a bit of magnification but I guess you are focusing on one small area at a time so it is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made.</li>
    </ol>
