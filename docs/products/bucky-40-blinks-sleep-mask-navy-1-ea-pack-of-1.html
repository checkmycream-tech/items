            <li>Bucky 40 Blinks Sleep Mask is superior to all others.  </li>
            <li>They have been washed many times and are in great shape.</li>
            <li>I love this sleep mask!</li>
            <li>feels good on face and blocks out most light.</li>
            <li>very light.</li>
            <li>I have tried many sleep masks</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>This mask is my favorite - I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>Holds up for years of nightly use :)</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable eye mask ever!</li>
            <li>No complaints : )</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever be able to sleep without it.</li>
            <li>I love these Bucky masks.</li>
            <li>My husband is enjoying the mask quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased one for all my friends and they love them too.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the better sleep</li>
            <li>but now I have found the ultimate perfect mask ----SleepMask by Tempurpedic</li>
            <li>I Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Also, the part that goes over your eyes is elevated, leaving room for you to blink without your lashes touching the mask.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mask -- works great,  </li>
            <li>super comfortable, even better than the plush version!</li>
            <li>It looks like a bikini top, which is kind of funny.</li>
            <li>I ended up trimming them around the nose notch to fit better.</li>
            <li>I love that it does not cover my nose, but it blocks all the light.</li>
            <li>The adjustable strap makes finding the perfect fit easy, and the design is such that light does not sneak in.  </li>
            <li>these tend to wear out after about 6 months, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>Blocks the light,</li>
            <li>These things are fantastic.</li>
            <li>so it was important to get rid of light in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Not too comfortable to sleep.  </li>
            <li>Blocks 99% of light for me.</li>
            <li>So comfortable and stays on well.</li>
            <li>It blocks out ALL light.</li>
            <li>Worked great on a long flight to Australia!  </li>
            <li>They work better than most because the way they are designed they don&#x27;t touch your eyes and you can blink with no trouble.</li>
            <li>Still... it&#x27;s not a bad mask if you consider the price and treat it as disposable.</li>
            <li>The most comfortable and complete eyemask that I have used.</li>
            <li>I loved them at first but after traveling and stuffing them in my bag a fold appeared from the strap to the middle.</li>
            <li>it is comfortable and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is light weight and very well made.  </li>
            <li>Very comfy and blocks all light.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;eye bubbles&amp;#34; let me still open my eyes and blink easily, but all light is blocked out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable mask if you sleep on your back, but it tends to shift a bit (and leak light around the nose area) if you sleep on your side.</li>
            <li>The adjustable soft strap is so easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve had many eye masks over the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>thanks as I can&#x27;t seem to find these anywhere else!</li>
            <li>I have bought many masks over the years, but these are the only ones that stay put all night.</li>
            <li>Better for a back sleeper.</li>
            <li>These do the trick without pressing on your eyelids, and the strap is not tight so they are comfortable all around.</li>
            <li>They could have easily designed the strap to meet on the side of the back of your head.  </li>
            <li>Have always loved my Bucky sleep masks, but this version felt cheap and was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>However, has to go straight over your ears instead of above to feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, wear daily.  </li>
            <li>Also, unless I had a tiny button nose, theres no way these would ever fit me.</li>
            <li>And they totally block out 100% of light.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s found that the cloth mask he has had for years doesn&#x27;t let his eyes &#x27;breathe&#x27; as much as they should.</li>
            <li>These sleep work very well...</li>
            <li>Light gets in in several places.</li>
            <li>They are better than normal; but the strap meets together in the middle of the back of your head.  </li>
            <li>--- some let light in, some are too tight  or too loose (if they don&#x27;t have adjustable straps), and many press on your eyelids or eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>then get my face on pillow and if you move the mask will get off center and let some light in.</li>
            <li>To me, the effort of sewing to prevent delamination is worth it because of the overall comfort and design of the mask.</li>
            <li>These are also awesome during labour to help mama block out visual stimuli that may be irritating or distracting to her during this private time.</li>
            <li>Received in new condition as promised, work well.</li>
            <li>elastic on this tends to stretch fairly easy so don&#x27;t expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li>My husband took my first one and my daughter took my second one.</li>
            <li>I love that I can open my eyes and still it is completely dark.</li>
            <li>There can be a little light leakage at the sides until they work in a bit.</li>
            <li>The headband is a good combination of strong but not so thick as to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend frequent laundering as they will not hold up well over time if such is done.</li>

            <li> No light leaks.  </li>
            <li> even washing once a week or so, it&#x27;s still got all sorts of dead skin, makeup, etc... that eventually gets trapped in it.</li>
            <li> No bleeding of colors, very little relaxation of the elastic over time.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about the masks not holding up in the wash, I hand sewed a small whip stitch around the edges of the masks and wash them a lingerie bag.</li>
            <li> Others that I have tried in the past have fallen apart after a couple months of nightly use.</li>
            <li> Look No More!</li>

            <li> Comfortable, wear daily.  Could be just a bit smaller for me.</li>
            <li> I loved them at first but after traveling and stuffing them in my bag a fold appeared from the strap to the middle. Now this pokes me in the eye and I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these as gifts a year or so ago and everyone raves about them.  I finally bought one for myself.  I have tried many sleep masks --- some let light in, some are too tight  or too loose (if they don&#x27;t have adjustable straps), and many press on your eyelids or eyelashes.  This is the BEST eye mask --- so lightweight and it is shaped so it doesn&#x27;t press on your eyelids or lashes. The adjustable strap makes finding the perfect fit easy, and the design is such that light does not sneak in.  It looks like a bikini top, which is kind of funny. Highly recommend this mask -- works great,  it is comfortable and reasonably priced. Will definitely buy more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have two Bucky 40 Blinks Sleep Masks. After reading reviews about the masks not holding up in the wash, I hand sewed a small whip stitch around the edges of the masks and wash them a lingerie bag. They have been washed many times and are in great shape. I have tried several other types of masks and this is the only one I use. To me, the effort of sewing to prevent delamination is worth it because of the overall comfort and design of the mask.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better. I must sleep on my side because of an issue with my back, and these don&#x27;t do so well for a side sleeper. Also, unless I had a tiny button nose, theres no way these would ever fit me. I ended up trimming them around the nose notch to fit better.</li>
            <li> Look No More! THIS IS the Eye Mask You Are Looking For!  Blocks the light, adjustable, well made. STOP Your Hunt NOW.  Iâ€™ve had many eye masks over the last 20 years. This one is TOPS! â€¦and No, I am not getting paid to type this!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Took it on a 16 hour flight - great product!</li>
            <li> As you can tell from the picture, the parts that cover your eyes are bubble shaped so they do not rest against your eyelids.  The headband is a good combination of strong but not so thick as to be uncomfortable. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was that I sleep on my side and switch sides a lot and when I switched sides I often had to adjust it.  This might not have been the situation if I&#x27;d had it tighter, but I didn&#x27;t want it so tight I&#x27;d wake up with a sore head. Design improvement idea:  have the blue portion extend around the sides by 2 inches, then the strap start.</li>
            <li> These things are fantastic. No pressure.  No light leaks.  Brilliant</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is light weight and very well made.  I like the space between the mask and my eyes.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected....thanks as I can&#x27;t seem to find these anywhere else!</li>
            <li> This mask is my favorite - I&#x27;ve tried many. Very comfy and blocks all light. Holds up for years of nightly use :)</li>
            <li> feels good on face and blocks out most light. great for sleeping of red-eye flights</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable eye mask ever! It has a Velcro adjustable band for a perfect fit and the &#x27;fly-eyes&#x27; design gives your long eyelashes plenty of room to move while not messing up any of your eye make up during your power nap. These are also awesome during labour to help mama block out visual stimuli that may be irritating or distracting to her during this private time. They are &#x27;doula-approved&#x27;!!!!</li>
            <li> these tend to wear out after about 6 months, which is fine with me. even washing once a week or so, it&#x27;s still got all sorts of dead skin, makeup, etc... that eventually gets trapped in it. the &amp;#34;eye bubbles&amp;#34; let me still open my eyes and blink easily, but all light is blocked out. i now can&#x27;t sleep without one.</li>
            <li> Worked great on a long flight to Australia!  I&#x27;m a fussy sleeper so it was important to get rid of light in my eyes.  These do the trick without pressing on your eyelids, and the strap is not tight so they are comfortable all around.</li>
            <li> Received in new condition as promised, work well.</li>
            <li> Best sleep mask in the market.</li>

No bleeding of colors, very little relaxation of the elastic over time. Others that I have tried in the past have fallen apart after a couple months of nightly use.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it! No complaints : )</li>
            <li> They are better than normal; but the strap meets together in the middle of the back of your head.  Not too comfortable to sleep.  They could have easily designed the strap to meet on the side of the back of your head.  It would have made me happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the plushy Bucky sleep mask for years, but my brother took that one when he went off to college. I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I LOVE IT. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever be able to sleep without it. super comfortable, even better than the plush version! I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> very light. Blocks 99% of light for me. Good product.  Eyelashes do not touch the mask at all.</li>
            <li> Have always loved my Bucky sleep masks, but this version felt cheap and was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I love these Bucky masks. I have bought many masks over the years, but these are the only ones that stay put all night. And they totally block out 100% of light.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying the mask quite a bit. He&#x27;s found that the cloth mask he has had for years doesn&#x27;t let his eyes &#x27;breathe&#x27; as much as they should. With this mask, it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t touch the eyelids.</li>
            <li> Awesome eye mask. So comfortable and stays on well.</li>
            <li> The best sleep mask ever.  I&#x27;ve purchased one for all my friends and they love them too.</li>
            <li> Very nice design on the cupped eye. However, has to go straight over your ears instead of above to feel comfortable. Better for a back sleeper. Side sleeper I have to hold the mask then get my face on pillow and if you move the mask will get off center and let some light in. I really enjoyed the better sleep but now I have found the ultimate perfect mask ----SleepMask by Tempurpedic</li>
            <li> These sleep work very well...with no actual weight or pressure on the eyeballs.  You may choose to look at the various shades and colors offered on Amazon as they vary in price.  I ordered a different color the next time.  I do not recommend frequent laundering as they will not hold up well over time if such is done.</li>
            <li> This mask is actually too big for my face. Light gets in in several places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comfortable mask if you sleep on your back, but it tends to shift a bit (and leak light around the nose area) if you sleep on your side. Also, if you sleep on your stomach this mask just feels uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic on this tends to stretch fairly easy so don&#x27;t expect it to last a long time. Still... it&#x27;s not a bad mask if you consider the price and treat it as disposable.</li>
            <li> They worked on our 13+ hour flight in crowded economy seats. My daughter also uses them as a camp counselor. They work better than most because the way they are designed they don&#x27;t touch your eyes and you can blink with no trouble.</li>
            <li> I Love this thing. I love that it does not cover my nose, but it blocks all the light. I love that I can open my eyes and still it is completely dark. The strap does not both my head at all.</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask! It blocks out ALL light. Also, the part that goes over your eyes is elevated, leaving room for you to blink without your lashes touching the mask. The Velcro makes it adjustable. This is my 3rd mask. My husband took my first one and my daughter took my second one. I am keeping this one for me!</li>
            <li> Bucky 40 Blinks Sleep Mask is superior to all others.  The adjustable soft strap is so easy to adjust.  I have purchased the rest and this brand is the BEST.  Don&#x27;t spend your money on any other sleep mask.  You will be sorry.</li>
