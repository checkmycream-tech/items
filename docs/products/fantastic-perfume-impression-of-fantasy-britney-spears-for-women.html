            <li>This has more of a baby powder smell to it.</li>
            <li>I love all of my preferred fragrances.</li>
            <li>and I love that perfume.</li>
            <li>However, I would order the product again since the fragrance is good, the reseller is quick, and otherwise the packaging is fine.</li>
            <li>First it smell good like cotton candy but soon smelled like cherry medicine.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and wonderful quality and it smells almost exactly like the real perfume.</li>

            <li>Big bottle, great price and smells just like the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the original.</li>
            <li>the original.</li>
            <li>But any bottle can, right?!</li>
            <li>Much better value than the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Something about this one is overly sweet.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad scent, but something comes out of it that makes me feel queasy.</li>
            <li>it is the strong musky smell when first spraying it on.</li>
            <li>it fades quickly though.</li>
            <li>The perfume bottle is just as pretty as the original bottle, but the perfume smells kind of strong, like a strong alcohol smell only if you put too much on.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this perfume, except, the bottle easily broke.</li>
            <li>This is strange because I love fruity and sweet smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li>this was my first time buying a perfume</li>
            <li>It is almost exactly like Fantasy.</li>
            <li>It is sweet but just sweet enough to not make me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li>came in fast to</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I just have to point out though that these are only three fifty at big lots and Rainbow stores in most malls.</li>
            <li>I have an entire collection &amp; they all smell like the real thing and come in pretty bottles and  boxes that look very similar to their original counterparts.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I little goes a long way:)</li>
            <li>This was the first online perfume purchase that I was going to make, so I was a little hesitant.</li>
