            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite perfumes since 2005 &amp; I always buy replacement bottles when I run out.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite perfume when I was in highschool.</li>
            <li>It was just ok nothing to recommend or talk about.</li>
            <li>love this scent..will purchase again</li>
            <li>This was a great price and it is absolutely the smell I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think - just buy it :)</li>
            <li>Out of all of her perfumes, this one is her favorite one to wear.</li>
            <li>Decided to try to locate it online and was glad to find it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Just love its light fresh scent!!!</li>
            <li>so this would be a nice gift for your wife, girlfriend or special friend</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, light &amp; feminine but not to fru-fru, and have gotten many compliments because of it.  </li>
            <li>However, this bottle did not smell as strong as the 1 oz.  </li>
            <li>its fresh, clean, and warm.</li>
            <li>QUICK!</li>
            <li>There is a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>Light scent.</li>
            <li>IF YOU LOVE HER MUSIC AND FRESH POWDERY</li>
            <li>gift!&lt;br /&gt;daily use or special</li>
            <li>but I donno who the gift was really for since I love when she wears it</li>
            <li>It has really sweet floral fragrance that lasts for days.</li>
            <li>This is a nice scent, I think, for professional and night time.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet or flowery.</li>
            <li>I liked equally as well.  </li>
            <li>SUPER fast shipping and came just as described.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic; even my husband commented on how good it smells, and that&#x27;s nothing short of a minor miracle.  </li>
            <li>The pentagon-shape glass bottle is so pretty</li>
            <li>I will do the same when she needs more.</li>
            <li>I was first given this as a gift and just had to reorder it when I ran out.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase some more for her.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not the first time when i order it...</li>
            <li>I got this for my girlfriend because she ran out of her first bottle.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with &#x27;Belong&amp;#34; by Celine Dion some time ago but after buying ever bottle I could find locally changed to another</li>
            <li>It is her favorite perfume, but will send it back for a replacement.</li>
            <li>One day I remembered how much I missed it and decided to search here on Amazon and</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>Now I can order as much as I like.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really like the lighter and fresher scent</li>
            <li>and it suits me, as I do not care for real floral or musk type perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Ordering this larger size was a nice surprise as I didn&#x27;t realize it was a larger of the one I had.</li>
            <li>I love Celine Dion&#x27;s Belong, I get a ton of compliments from guys and other ladies asking me what is that gorgous perfume...</li>
            <li>I tend to wear specific fragrances according to season, but this is one of the few that I can wear year-round because it&#x27;s light &amp; not overpowering, but also doesn&#x27;t disappear in 10 minutes like so many others.</li>
            <li>scent is soft &amp; feminine, with the slightest touch of warmth &amp; peppery spiciness that I love (maybe that&#x27;s the tonka bean note?).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not lasting and the scent dies quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Celine Dion Belong to all the women out there to at least try it once, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a scent that I would be willing to wear; I am EXTREMELY picky about perfumes.  </li>
            <li>When she opened it the top of the bottle was broken.</li>
            <li>The only minus is that it  evaporates fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to every get over powering even if you get a little to much!</li>
            <li>I FIRST GOT A LITTLE BOTTLE OF THIS PERFUME FROM MY BESTIE</li>
            <li>Subtle but pretty, long lasting, highly recommend!</li>

            <li> I would not recommend this for anyone who is looking for a long lasting perfume.  </li>
            <li> The scent did not last as long as it usually did.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was as expected and delivery was on time.  </li>
            <li> The edges were very sharp, and she could have been cut.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or invasive.</li>
            <li> If you want a scent that is subtly and becoming try &amp;#34;Celine Dion Belong&amp;#34; by Celine Dion For Women, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Definitely not memorable.</li>
            <li> I was given a small bottle of this years ago.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to invest in a bigger bottle and I am really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have never grown tired of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I thought that it might of been fake</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Celine Dion&#x27;s Belong, I get a ton of compliments from guys and other ladies asking me what is that gorgous perfume... I highly recommend it.  This is my favorite and its so affordable too. Love it!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it so if she loved, it must be great ;-) ... I like it on her aswell so this would be a nice gift for your wife, girlfriend or special friend ;-) huh!!!!      -micky-</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product at a Big Lot&#x27;s of all places and was instantly hooked.  It has a great light scent that i get a lot of compliments on.  I am glad to be able to find it again here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I had just run out of this perfume and about to run to the mall when I decided to look this up online.  So glad I did.  Amazon had it, and I was thrilled at the size and the price.  I receive so many nice comments on this perfume whenever I wear it.  It&#x27;s my favorite.  And now I catch my teenager putting it on too!  Great price, great front-door service, and great scent.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for its price. Light scent. The only minus is that it  evaporates fast.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite perfumes since 2005 &amp; I always buy replacement bottles when I run out. The pentagon-shape glass bottle is so pretty I wish they made it refillable so I could reuse it - it&#x27;s such a shame to have to throw it away when empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft &amp; feminine, with the slightest touch of warmth &amp; peppery spiciness that I love (maybe that&#x27;s the tonka bean note?). I have never grown tired of this perfume. I tend to wear specific fragrances according to season, but this is one of the few that I can wear year-round because it&#x27;s light &amp; not overpowering, but also doesn&#x27;t disappear in 10 minutes like so many others. It has lingering, close-to-the-skin staying power.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Celine Dion-Belong in the past, but this order did not have the same lasting fragrance my first one had.</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing Celine Dion Belong for years (probably 5+ years now) and I get compliments on this scent all the time. Subtle but pretty, long lasting, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I made a prior purchase of this identical Celine Dion Item from Amazon -  I received the same great item in record time and, of course, Wifie is happy as can be, one more time......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Celine Dion for a great product and Amazon, for your speedy service.</li>
            <li> I Bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loved it. We received in great condition and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Love it! This was my favorite perfume when I was in highschool. I recieved it as a gift back then. When I finished the bottle I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE and was so upset. One day I remembered how much I missed it and decided to search here on Amazon and woo hoo! I found it!! Smells just like I remember it when I wore it 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> this was a good buy for the size bottle I purchased.  the service was sxcellent</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for wife!  Saved me a lot of time and gas to buy on line.  I will do the same when she needs more.</li>
            <li> Definitely not memorable. It was just ok nothing to recommend or talk about. It&#x27;s not lasting and the scent dies quickly.</li>
            <li> love this scent..will purchase again</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 8 yrs. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Just love its light fresh scent!!! Doesn&#x27;t seem to every get over powering even if you get a little to much!</li>

I ENDED UP USING ALL OF IT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND MY MOM GOT ME THE BIGGEST BOTTLE FOR MY BIRTHDAY!!! I AM GOING SLIM ON IT SO I DONT RUN OUT QUICK! BUT IF I DO, I CAN ALWAYS BUY MORE OFF AMAZON!!! IF YOU LOVE HER MUSIC AND FRESH POWDERY SMELLS YOU WILL LOVE THIS PERFUME! ITS A LONG LASTING PERFUME! MY SCARVES STILL SMELL OF IT AND I HAVENT WORN A SCARF SINCE JANUARY!! EXCELLENT PERFUME!!!1</li>
            <li> What a fragrance ? This is by far the best fragrance I have ever used. Very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it could last longer and they make it as a perfume (which is stronger). You need to spray every two to three hours for a whloe day effect unless you are in a breezy envoirment. But no complains at this price at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love It ! Don&#x27;t think - just buy it :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend because she ran out of her first bottle. Out of all of her perfumes, this one is her favorite one to wear.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with &#x27;Belong&amp;#34; by Celine Dion some time ago but after buying ever bottle I could find locally changed to another I liked equally as well.  I had forgotten about it when I stumbled on it while searching for another item.  Now I can order as much as I like.  I love the fragrance, light &amp; feminine but not to fru-fru, and have gotten many compliments because of it.  If you want a scent that is subtly and becoming try &amp;#34;Celine Dion Belong&amp;#34; by Celine Dion For Women, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday. When she opened it the top of the bottle was broken. The edges were very sharp, and she could have been cut. It is her favorite perfume, but will send it back for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I received this 1 oz bottle for my birthday and absolutely loved it.  So, I decided to invest in a bigger bottle and I am really disappointed.  The packaging was as expected and delivery was on time.  However, this bottle did not smell as strong as the 1 oz.  It may be that the 1 oz bottle was from Macy&#x27;s (a trustworthy department store/business in my opinion) but it was not the same.  The scent did not last as long as it usually did.  I do realize that this is a Toilette spray as opposed to a Parfum.  There is a HUGE difference.  I would not recommend this for anyone who is looking for a long lasting perfume.  It does have a pleasant smell (a nice floral scent).</li>
            <li> loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks</li>
            <li> I have always liked the scent of this perfume and was happy to see that I could still get it.</li>
            <li> I was given a small bottle of this years ago. Decided to try to locate it online and was glad to find it. Ordering this larger size was a nice surprise as I didn&#x27;t realize it was a larger of the one I had. Love it. Really like the lighter and fresher scent and it suits me, as I do not care for real floral or musk type perfumes.  This is a nice scent, I think, for professional and night time. Not too sweet or flowery.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone!!! it smells sooooo great!&lt;br /&gt;Great gift!&lt;br /&gt;daily use or special occasion!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
