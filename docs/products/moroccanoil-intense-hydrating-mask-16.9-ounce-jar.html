            <li>Was also very impressed at how easy it was to order and how quickly I recieved the product.</li>
            <li>Her new stylist recommended this to try to salvage her hair and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>As did I.  Great product, smells so lovely- and makes your hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Very Good Didn&#x27;t assist too much with untangling For some reasn</li>
            <li>Product smells wonderful and leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards my hair is so soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the original Moroccan oil, so decided to try it in mask form.  </li>
            <li>It was a good product specially if you use moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I tried this product, it&#x27;s pretty good, makes my hair real smooth.</li>
            <li>i love how it makes my hair very smooth since i have wavy hair ..</li>
            <li>Much better than kerastase.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is the latest line of products being offered and recommended at the salon I go to.  </li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>For these reasons - I tend to wear it in a pony-tail MOST of time.  </li>
            <li>I would get much better results</li>
            <li>I tend to keep the product on for more than the recommended time.</li>
            <li>It was not terribly damaged, but just from routine coloring.</li>
            <li>Need more conditioning?</li>
            <li>Take a close look at the top of the jar.</li>
            <li>and i love how it makes my hair feel it feels</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky, smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li>and when I got out of the shower and combed my hair, I could already notice that it had more of a shine to it...</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many products</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair mask at the moment.</li>
            <li>Favorite hair care product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also use Maroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner and love it too.</li>
            <li>and I love this product I would order it again.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It is better.  </li>
            <li>A pump bottle would be outstanding.</li>
            <li>Each time I use it my hair looks fabulous and I get compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>I love love love them.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li>I have another hair mask by the body shop that works much better than this one.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this hydrating mask-</li>
            <li>this is my favorite jair care company-</li>
            <li>I have bought this before and love it, had to have it again.</li>
            <li>This way, I save time :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Makes me want to buy more Moroccan Oil products.  </li>
            <li>Buy more time with you</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will buy Moroccan Oil again, as I love the product but not from this vendor.</li>
            <li>I also like that Moroccanoil does not test on animals! :)</li>
            <li>The product is great and made my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This, however, is magic.  </li>
            <li>Magic for your hair.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccaoil products</li>
            <li>When you rinse your hair, it is super soft and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Now I have not taken their oil and heated it for a hot oil treatment so it may be good for that use, but as a shine product I prefer micro misting shiners.  </li>
            <li>It is a very nice mask, makes hair feel very soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I use to use Strong Sexy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an excellent conditioner for dry and/or colored hair.</li>
            <li>Love Moroccan Oil, but have since moved on to Light Argan Oils.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves the hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good service.</li>
            <li>Really nice quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and am ready to order more!</li>
            <li>Great product, I received my shipment a lil late because the first one was damaged but customer service was awesome</li>
            <li>Love this product does a great job of conditioning love all of the Moroccan Oil products have used the for a long time.</li>
            <li>[...]  you can easily see the difference.</li>
            <li>not only do it smell good, but it does wonder for my hair which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I used this product today and it left my hair silky, manageable, shiny and just beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a difference but convinced myself that it was fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine overprocessed hair.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, it&#x27;s great for people with dry scalp.</li>
            <li>very nice hair mask, it is worty to get it , the price is fair and it works very well for dry nd damage hair</li>
            <li>The cheap price also doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m overall happy with the result.</li>
            <li>Overall, happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shine and smooth.</li>
            <li>By using this product just once a week my hair is silky, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>$35 is quite pricey for a hydrating mask, however it has done such a great job I have changed my mind</li>
            <li>Great conditioner for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and is a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>It makes my hair nice and smooth, since I have really curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The real Moroccanoil Hydrating Mask is awesome, I wish Amazon would back their products, offer a return, give a customer service phone number</li>
            <li>a O.This product has such great ratings I was excited to use it but found out it belongs in the garbage where it is now.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>the original stuff is awesome, Amazon is selling black market junk.....stay away!</li>
            <li>very light and easy to use on hair, and leave the hair as you had a very scrumptious salon work on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I just returned home for the holidays, used my original and OMG</li>
            <li>Probably great if you have ultra dry hair.  </li>
            <li>They work great together, my scalp and hair is no longer dry.</li>
            <li>this product needs no comment, and the store sent me right in appropriate containers at the right time.&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li>I love the whole moroccanoil line.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a really good product that even multiple visits to the saloon for hair</li>
            <li>My concern was that the jar didn&#x27;t seem to be full.</li>
            <li>If you have thick corse hair, this product would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>This product is however only one of two in the line that I really loved.  </li>
            <li>Seller provided good service and arrived earlier than anticipated</li>
            <li>minutes(which is not bad to do with a mask)</li>
            <li>Ok, let&#x27;s face it, unless you are very lucky, most of us over 60, have dry, chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I recently tried a popular cheap brand of tub conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair after using was not oily at all which is the main flaw in most oil products.</li>
            <li>Love this product normally, but what got delivered to me was sub par.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair and I can peacefully coexist!  </li>
            <li>First tried it at a hair salon!  </li>
            <li>Thanks a million!!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair (like me) get ready to use some volumizer.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, straight and medium thickness.  </li>
            <li>, perhaps it would work best with very thick hair.</li>
            <li>I tend to leave it in to calm my curls...</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is sooooo soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Okay Ladies, we&#x27;ve all tried the Professional Salon hair treatment.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I buy this at a professional store and love it.  </li>
            <li>This hydrating mask makes my hair extremely soft and silky - healthy looking - with no crazy flyaways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li>It does make my hair smell good, so it&#x27;s not bad, but just not worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and kind of thin, my sister has the exact opposite hair type and the mask from the body shop worked great for her as well.</li>
            <li>But more importantly, it seems to be just right for my hair which is short</li>
            <li>This is NOT the original Moroccan oil and comes straight from China.</li>
            <li>I never had my hair so nice looking without having to use a flat iron or blow-dry.</li>
            <li>Tried this mask at a friends house once and felt the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression it is for fine to normal hair</li>
            <li>This stuff is great without a heavy, or greasy feel!</li>
            <li>The correct product arrived fairly quickly &amp; was packed very well.  </li>
            <li>boyfriend even noticed the difference and has complimented my hair, saying that my hair was too dry and flying everywhere before ,now it is nice, silky and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Imagine the mess my hair can be if I don&#x27;t take good care of it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use it too frequent with fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Moroccanoil hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But we have to be aware of the brand we buy and use.</li>
            <li>My hair is relatively healthy but the straightening chemicals have definitely taken a toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great if you have thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the 16.9 ounce jar because it was a better deal than the smaller one.  </li>
            <li>You want to put this conditioner on first and then something like Herbal Essence Hello Hydration (use quite a bit) and leave on for 30-45 mins.</li>
            <li>I have had the real tub of Moroccan oil mask and this is not it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you do not have to use weekly or daily.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd and last time I order any kind of hair product from Amazon!</li>
            <li>Its just natural looking, feels smooth and under control.</li>
            <li>ever morning- this product makes my hair feel soft and fabulous.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and have to order another!</li>
            <li>Be aware before purchasing.</li>
            <li>and I became a regular user of many of their products.</li>
            <li>However, a friend recommended keeping a jar in my snorkel gear bag and using it whenever I enjoy a day in the ocean, which is fairly frequently.</li>
            <li>leaves hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It keeps hair smooth, shiny, soft.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the intense moisturizing properties and it truly does help repair like none other I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>I call it my special occasion conditioner, because my natural curls truly shine with this product!</li>
            <li>I will definitely use this product consistently; the positive reviews that I read before buying this were all accurate.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my dry hair</li>
            <li>Amaizing smell, the hair was super soft and glossy after use.</li>
            <li>With a bit of age it has become fragile and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>the large size.</li>
            <li>It worked great when I left it on for half an hour under the dryer.</li>
            <li>Good product for deep conditioning dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Every decent person who cares about the wellness of their hair should try this!</li>
            <li>It is expensive but totally worth it!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very thick and oily mask that helps to nourish the hair and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Best product for my very thick, coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely made a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Works but is very pricey.  </li>
            <li>This mask really hydrates my superdry hair and leaves it silky, manageable, supersoft, and easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think this is repairing my hair.</li>
            <li>compare it with real products like for example this one I found  </li>
            <li>My hair is much softer, doesn&#x27;t break AS much, and it&#x27;s not as poofy.</li>
            <li>really fried it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s may a really visable difference on my over-processed blond hair.  </li>
            <li>It really hydrates your hair.</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>The Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask solves these seemingly contradictory problems.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it lasts for quite a while as one doesn&#x27;t need much per application...</li>
            <li>Accomplished the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li>Ships fast as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my hair dresser for recommending this product to me.</li>
            <li>This product really moisturizes your hair.</li>
            <li>have really curly hair and it needs lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>and this mask works very well too.</li>
            <li>It doesnt require much at all, leave it in for 10 mins, rinse it out.</li>
            <li>This mask works very well as a conditioner and as a hair treatment.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the efficiency and honesty.</li>
            <li>how can I know that it&#x27;s the real thing?</li>
            <li>and shipped fast</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my hair to grow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li>my whole family absolutely loves this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to step out of the shower.</li>
            <li>After I use it everything seem ok, till later during the day my hair did a 180 and is now all puff and frizzy and completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and definitely brought my hair back to life after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>First time it was used on my hair, by my hair dresser, I could not believe how my hair came alive!  </li>
            <li>I order this one to take with me and left my original at my home in the USA.</li>
            <li>Originally my hairdresser recommended this for my platinum bleach blonde hair, to condition and moisturize.</li>
            <li>1st time application following by the Moroccanoil treatment,&lt;br /&gt;i can feel big improvement on the texture, coz it feels more like real hair again,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 12/26/13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it more regularly and found it does actually hydrate my hair very well.</li>
            <li>bought as a new but came to me as used product in a very suspicious package, dissapointment</li>
            <li>It was ery easy to place the order and it arrived in the expected time frame.</li>
            <li>was a bit skeptical about the effect until i really tried&lt;br /&gt;and experienced the effect of this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was definitely skeptical that this product would do anything for my hair but after using it just once I am more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a better result with this more expensive brand than I did with the argon</li>
            <li>I love this moroccan oil brand, the next thing I want to get is the actual oil!!</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that calms the frizzies, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product to anyone ..</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe AMAZON is selling this stuff, it must come directly from CHINA!!  </li>
            <li>Wow this product really works.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it is nice and thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s obviously an investment, but SO well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I love it, and will continue to use it (as long as I can afford it).</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and I rarely have split ends.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I have highlights which have dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li>There is a long time I wanted to buy this product, but its so expensive in Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in one week and the smelling is perfect!</li>
            <li>Really leaves my tangles hair soft and smooth, so much easier to handle once it is dried.  </li>
            <li>It is helping my hair get over the shock and damage and my stylist says that by summers&#x27; end, I will have a new head of hair...</li>
            <li>My husband loves the new hair as well.    </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t live without it anymore</li>
            <li>This mask leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I usually have extremely healthy hair, but I had a lot of hair breakage after I bleached it for an ombre.</li>
            <li>It is lovely and I will continue using it, but am not sure about breakage results just yet.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t verify it actually contained 16.9 ounces, but it only seemed three quarters full.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous hair masque for dry, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I also use Dermorganics oil right before a blow dry with defuser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously my fine and colour damaged hair felt like dried twigs,&lt;br /&gt;upon</li>
            <li>Less than the 50 bucks at my local area beauty stores for this very large jar (2 cups + worth of mask</li>
            <li>I have used the hydrating mask, along with the styling creme, three times now and WOW, what a difference it has made.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and is managable.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, wavy hair and the bleach</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>and I always went to the Salon for a profession hair treatment, but this actually works and it saves me SO MUCH MONEY.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product although it really is pricey.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shine...complements fr lots of people.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable but....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any chemicals in my hair and my hair is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>It would leave my hair incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am a level 10 platinum and I don&#x27;t use glaze just bleach (level 6 natural)</li>
            <li>Shampoo strips your curls of their natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard all of the rave reviews, but I really don&#x27;t feel anything different with this.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the jar is kind of a pain in the shower (opening it, getting the product out, and closing it again so that no water gets in).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that every expensive product is good.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean better.</li>
            <li>It has the same soft, clean, scent as the other Moroccan Oil products.   </li>
            <li>The key is to actually use it consistently.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky like no other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d highly recommend it, especially if you&#x27;ve got damaged hair.</li>
            <li>After a month of treatment, it is almost 100% back to normal.</li>
            <li>It definitely needs moisture but is also easily over-cared for, and then usually has no body and needs to be washed too frequently.</li>
            <li>I live at altitude which is hell on hair, espeially Blonde.  </li>
            <li>At the urging of my stylist, I bought this conditioner and have used it religiously in order to rescue and manage my new color.  </li>
            <li>Then because I live several months out of the year in another country</li>
            <li>I purchased the Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask to treat my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>The hydrating mask which I have in rotation with my alter ego deep conditioner the only thing is when using this mask I had to pour some Moroccanoil in it to really hydrate my hair.</li>
            <li>Actually with the Sally&#x27;s brand I had more slip and ease when it came to detangling my thick tresses and my hair felt like silk afterwards.</li>
            <li>Thick cream goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>This instantly detangles my salty hair and restores a very soft feel.</li>
            <li>If your hair is very dry, splurge on a large jar and you&#x27;ll see results by the time its gone.</li>
            <li>and I just hope my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to it after a while...because I plan on using this mask for as long as I live!</li>
            <li>And typically I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t really see a whole lot of results in various hair care products.  </li>
            <li>Same old, same old!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I also want to say that although this tub is quite pricey I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a long time, since I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it to condition my hair, I do have wavy hair</li>
            <li>Use just a teeny bit in my hair, work it through well, barely rinse</li>
            <li>Not sure if I got old product or product that was damaged, but it just wasn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>As you see in some of the comments, buyers complained that this product is not the original Moroccanoil mask.  </li>
            <li>I  will have to buy on other one very soon</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, almost like African American hair and thus it is always dry.  </li>
            <li>My Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture Daily Treatment and Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger</li>
            <li>I do like their conditioner very much but not for everyday use as it is a heavier conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I found you can put just a little tiny coating on your hands and coat your hair ever so lightly while wet, and don&#x27;t rinse out.  </li>
            <li>I have been using moroccan oil products for a few years now and the masks were among my first purchases from this brand.</li>
            <li>It really tames down your hair.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down or make it look oily (and my husband absolutely loves the scent).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy, but goes a long way and is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair,which turns dry all the time.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist, who also has dry naturally curly hair, recommended this product.</li>
            <li>Unlike the  deep conditioners that are protein based, this does not dry out my hair if I use it every week.  </li>
            <li>this a good product a little bit too expensive if you ask me</li>

            <li> Was also very impressed at how easy it was to order and how quickly I recieved the product.</li>
            <li> Her new stylist recommended this to try to salvage her hair and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> As did I.  Great product, smells so lovely- and makes your hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Very Good Didn&#x27;t assist too much with untangling For some reasn</li>
            <li> Product smells wonderful and leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards my hair is so soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the original Moroccan oil, so decided to try it in mask form.  </li>
            <li> It was a good product specially if you use moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, it&#x27;s pretty good, makes my hair real smooth.</li>
            <li> i love how it makes my hair very smooth since i have wavy hair ..</li>
            <li> Much better than kerastase.</li>
            <li> It smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is the latest line of products being offered and recommended at the salon I go to.  </li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> For these reasons - I tend to wear it in a pony-tail MOST of time.  </li>
            <li> I would get much better results</li>
            <li> I tend to keep the product on for more than the recommended time.</li>
            <li> It was not terribly damaged, but just from routine coloring.</li>
            <li> Need more conditioning?</li>
            <li> Take a close look at the top of the jar.</li>
            <li> and i love how it makes my hair feel it feels</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky, smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li> and when I got out of the shower and combed my hair, I could already notice that it had more of a shine to it...</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many products</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair mask at the moment.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair care product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I also use Maroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner and love it too.</li>
            <li> and I love this product I would order it again.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It is better.  </li>
            <li> A pump bottle would be outstanding.</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li> I have another hair mask by the body shop that works much better than this one.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this hydrating mask-</li>
            <li> this is my favorite jair care company-</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and love it, had to have it again.</li>
            <li> This way, I save time :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Makes me want to buy more Moroccan Oil products.  </li>
            <li> Buy more time with you</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will buy Moroccan Oil again, as I love the product but not from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I also like that Moroccanoil does not test on animals! :)</li>
            <li> The product is great and made my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This, however, is magic.  </li>
            <li> Magic for your hair.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccaoil products</li>
            <li> When you rinse your hair, it is super soft and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Now I have not taken their oil and heated it for a hot oil treatment so it may be good for that use, but as a shine product I prefer micro misting shiners.  </li>
            <li> It is a very nice mask, makes hair feel very soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I use to use Strong Sexy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an excellent conditioner for dry and/or colored hair.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccan Oil, but have since moved on to Light Argan Oils.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves the hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good service.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and am ready to order more!</li>
            <li> Great product, I received my shipment a lil late because the first one was damaged but customer service was awesome</li>
            <li> Love this product does a great job of conditioning love all of the Moroccan Oil products have used the for a long time.</li>
            <li> [...]  you can easily see the difference.</li>
            <li> not only do it smell good, but it does wonder for my hair which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this product today and it left my hair silky, manageable, shiny and just beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a difference but convinced myself that it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine overprocessed hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it&#x27;s great for people with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> very nice hair mask, it is worty to get it , the price is fair and it works very well for dry nd damage hair</li>
            <li> The cheap price also doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m overall happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Overall, happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and smooth.</li>
            <li> By using this product just once a week my hair is silky, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> $35 is quite pricey for a hydrating mask, however it has done such a great job I have changed my mind</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and is a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> It makes my hair nice and smooth, since I have really curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The real Moroccanoil Hydrating Mask is awesome, I wish Amazon would back their products, offer a return, give a customer service phone number</li>
            <li> a O.This product has such great ratings I was excited to use it but found out it belongs in the garbage where it is now.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> the original stuff is awesome, Amazon is selling black market junk.....stay away!</li>
            <li> very light and easy to use on hair, and leave the hair as you had a very scrumptious salon work on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I just returned home for the holidays, used my original and OMG</li>
            <li> Probably great if you have ultra dry hair.  </li>
            <li> They work great together, my scalp and hair is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> this product needs no comment, and the store sent me right in appropriate containers at the right time.&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li> I love the whole moroccanoil line.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a really good product that even multiple visits to the saloon for hair</li>
            <li> My concern was that the jar didn&#x27;t seem to be full.</li>
            <li> If you have thick corse hair, this product would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> This product is however only one of two in the line that I really loved.  </li>
            <li> Seller provided good service and arrived earlier than anticipated</li>
            <li> minutes(which is not bad to do with a mask)</li>
            <li> Ok, let&#x27;s face it, unless you are very lucky, most of us over 60, have dry, chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a popular cheap brand of tub conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair after using was not oily at all which is the main flaw in most oil products.</li>
            <li> Love this product normally, but what got delivered to me was sub par.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair and I can peacefully coexist!  </li>
            <li> First tried it at a hair salon!  </li>
            <li> Thanks a million!!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair (like me) get ready to use some volumizer.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, straight and medium thickness.  </li>
            <li> , perhaps it would work best with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I tend to leave it in to calm my curls...</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is sooooo soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Okay Ladies, we&#x27;ve all tried the Professional Salon hair treatment.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I buy this at a professional store and love it.  </li>
            <li> This hydrating mask makes my hair extremely soft and silky - healthy looking - with no crazy flyaways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hair smell good, so it&#x27;s not bad, but just not worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and kind of thin, my sister has the exact opposite hair type and the mask from the body shop worked great for her as well.</li>
            <li> But more importantly, it seems to be just right for my hair which is short</li>
            <li> This is NOT the original Moroccan oil and comes straight from China.</li>
            <li> I never had my hair so nice looking without having to use a flat iron or blow-dry.</li>
            <li> Tried this mask at a friends house once and felt the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression it is for fine to normal hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is great without a heavy, or greasy feel!</li>
            <li> The correct product arrived fairly quickly &amp; was packed very well.  </li>
            <li> boyfriend even noticed the difference and has complimented my hair, saying that my hair was too dry and flying everywhere before ,now it is nice, silky and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Imagine the mess my hair can be if I don&#x27;t take good care of it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use it too frequent with fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Moroccanoil hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But we have to be aware of the brand we buy and use.</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively healthy but the straightening chemicals have definitely taken a toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great if you have thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the 16.9 ounce jar because it was a better deal than the smaller one.  </li>
            <li> You want to put this conditioner on first and then something like Herbal Essence Hello Hydration (use quite a bit) and leave on for 30-45 mins.</li>
            <li> I have had the real tub of Moroccan oil mask and this is not it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you do not have to use weekly or daily.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd and last time I order any kind of hair product from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Its just natural looking, feels smooth and under control.</li>
            <li> ever morning- this product makes my hair feel soft and fabulous.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and have to order another!</li>
            <li> Be aware before purchasing.</li>
            <li> and I became a regular user of many of their products.</li>
            <li> However, a friend recommended keeping a jar in my snorkel gear bag and using it whenever I enjoy a day in the ocean, which is fairly frequently.</li>
            <li> leaves hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair smooth, shiny, soft.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the intense moisturizing properties and it truly does help repair like none other I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> I call it my special occasion conditioner, because my natural curls truly shine with this product!</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this product consistently; the positive reviews that I read before buying this were all accurate.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry hair</li>
            <li> Amaizing smell, the hair was super soft and glossy after use.</li>
            <li> With a bit of age it has become fragile and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> the large size.</li>
            <li> It worked great when I left it on for half an hour under the dryer.</li>
            <li> Good product for deep conditioning dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Every decent person who cares about the wellness of their hair should try this!</li>
            <li> It is expensive but totally worth it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very thick and oily mask that helps to nourish the hair and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Best product for my very thick, coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely made a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Works but is very pricey.  </li>
            <li> This mask really hydrates my superdry hair and leaves it silky, manageable, supersoft, and easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really think this is repairing my hair.</li>
            <li> compare it with real products like for example this one I found  </li>
            <li> My hair is much softer, doesn&#x27;t break AS much, and it&#x27;s not as poofy.</li>
            <li> really fried it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s may a really visable difference on my over-processed blond hair.  </li>
            <li> It really hydrates your hair.</li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> The Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask solves these seemingly contradictory problems.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it lasts for quite a while as one doesn&#x27;t need much per application...</li>
            <li> Accomplished the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> Ships fast as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my hair dresser for recommending this product to me.</li>
            <li> This product really moisturizes your hair.</li>
            <li> have really curly hair and it needs lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> and this mask works very well too.</li>
            <li> It doesnt require much at all, leave it in for 10 mins, rinse it out.</li>
            <li> This mask works very well as a conditioner and as a hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the efficiency and honesty.</li>
            <li> how can I know that it&#x27;s the real thing?</li>
            <li> and shipped fast</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> my whole family absolutely loves this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> After I use it everything seem ok, till later during the day my hair did a 180 and is now all puff and frizzy and completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and definitely brought my hair back to life after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> First time it was used on my hair, by my hair dresser, I could not believe how my hair came alive!  </li>
            <li> I order this one to take with me and left my original at my home in the USA.</li>
            <li> Originally my hairdresser recommended this for my platinum bleach blonde hair, to condition and moisturize.</li>
            <li> 1st time application following by the Moroccanoil treatment,&lt;br /&gt;i can feel big improvement on the texture, coz it feels more like real hair again,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 12/26/13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it more regularly and found it does actually hydrate my hair very well.</li>
            <li> bought as a new but came to me as used product in a very suspicious package, dissapointment</li>
            <li> It was ery easy to place the order and it arrived in the expected time frame.</li>
            <li> was a bit skeptical about the effect until i really tried&lt;br /&gt;and experienced the effect of this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical that this product would do anything for my hair but after using it just once I am more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a better result with this more expensive brand than I did with the argon</li>
            <li> I love this moroccan oil brand, the next thing I want to get is the actual oil!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that calms the frizzies, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product to anyone ..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe AMAZON is selling this stuff, it must come directly from CHINA!!  </li>
            <li> Wow this product really works.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it is nice and thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s obviously an investment, but SO well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I love it, and will continue to use it (as long as I can afford it).</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and I rarely have split ends.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I have highlights which have dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> There is a long time I wanted to buy this product, but its so expensive in Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in one week and the smelling is perfect!</li>
            <li> Really leaves my tangles hair soft and smooth, so much easier to handle once it is dried.  </li>
            <li> It is helping my hair get over the shock and damage and my stylist says that by summers&#x27; end, I will have a new head of hair...</li>
            <li> My husband loves the new hair as well.    </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t live without it anymore</li>
            <li> This mask leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> I usually have extremely healthy hair, but I had a lot of hair breakage after I bleached it for an ombre.</li>
            <li> It is lovely and I will continue using it, but am not sure about breakage results just yet.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t verify it actually contained 16.9 ounces, but it only seemed three quarters full.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous hair masque for dry, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I also use Dermorganics oil right before a blow dry with defuser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously my fine and colour damaged hair felt like dried twigs,&lt;br /&gt;upon</li>
            <li> Less than the 50 bucks at my local area beauty stores for this very large jar (2 cups + worth of mask</li>
            <li> I have used the hydrating mask, along with the styling creme, three times now and WOW, what a difference it has made.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and is managable.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, wavy hair and the bleach</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> and I always went to the Salon for a profession hair treatment, but this actually works and it saves me SO MUCH MONEY.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product although it really is pricey.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shine...complements fr lots of people.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable but....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any chemicals in my hair and my hair is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> It would leave my hair incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am a level 10 platinum and I don&#x27;t use glaze just bleach (level 6 natural)</li>
            <li> Shampoo strips your curls of their natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard all of the rave reviews, but I really don&#x27;t feel anything different with this.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the jar is kind of a pain in the shower (opening it, getting the product out, and closing it again so that no water gets in).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that every expensive product is good.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean better.</li>
            <li> It has the same soft, clean, scent as the other Moroccan Oil products.   </li>
            <li> The key is to actually use it consistently.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky like no other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d highly recommend it, especially if you&#x27;ve got damaged hair.</li>
            <li> After a month of treatment, it is almost 100% back to normal.</li>
            <li> It definitely needs moisture but is also easily over-cared for, and then usually has no body and needs to be washed too frequently.</li>
            <li> I live at altitude which is hell on hair, espeially Blonde.  </li>
            <li> At the urging of my stylist, I bought this conditioner and have used it religiously in order to rescue and manage my new color.  </li>
            <li> Then because I live several months out of the year in another country</li>
            <li> I purchased the Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask to treat my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The hydrating mask which I have in rotation with my alter ego deep conditioner the only thing is when using this mask I had to pour some Moroccanoil in it to really hydrate my hair.</li>
            <li> Actually with the Sally&#x27;s brand I had more slip and ease when it came to detangling my thick tresses and my hair felt like silk afterwards.</li>
            <li> Thick cream goes on easy.  </li>
            <li> This instantly detangles my salty hair and restores a very soft feel.</li>
            <li> If your hair is very dry, splurge on a large jar and you&#x27;ll see results by the time its gone.</li>
            <li> and I just hope my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to it after a while...because I plan on using this mask for as long as I live!</li>
            <li> And typically I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t really see a whole lot of results in various hair care products.  </li>
            <li> Same old, same old!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I also want to say that although this tub is quite pricey I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a long time, since I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it to condition my hair, I do have wavy hair</li>
            <li> Use just a teeny bit in my hair, work it through well, barely rinse</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got old product or product that was damaged, but it just wasn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li> As you see in some of the comments, buyers complained that this product is not the original Moroccanoil mask.  </li>
            <li> I  will have to buy on other one very soon</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, almost like African American hair and thus it is always dry.  </li>
            <li> My Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture Daily Treatment and Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger</li>
            <li> I do like their conditioner very much but not for everyday use as it is a heavier conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I found you can put just a little tiny coating on your hands and coat your hair ever so lightly while wet, and don&#x27;t rinse out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using moroccan oil products for a few years now and the masks were among my first purchases from this brand.</li>
            <li> It really tames down your hair.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down or make it look oily (and my husband absolutely loves the scent).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but goes a long way and is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair,which turns dry all the time.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist, who also has dry naturally curly hair, recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Unlike the  deep conditioners that are protein based, this does not dry out my hair if I use it every week.  </li>
            <li> this a good product a little bit too expensive if you ask me</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and moisturized, but not greasy or weighed down, which is something my hair is prone to with deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> I love argon oil products and I have been wanting to try the infamous Moroccanoil brand for so long and wish listed it until I felt I could splurge to purchase it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m off to go, the 3rd day I do touch up a bit with my ghd flat iron but still at this point I don&#x27;t need need any additional product!!</li>
            <li> will pay the same price for actually having the WHOLe bottle which i ve used already at least 4 times(i</li>
            <li> I live on the beach, surf everyday.</li>
            <li> It could leave your hair very flat.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to make that jar last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re only supposed to use this once or twice a week, but ever since I started coloring my hair, it&#x27;s been really dry.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is dry or coloured like mine it brings your hair back to life!</li>
            <li> it gets really dry because of all I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and very dry, and I recently moved to a dry, western state.</li>
            <li> Heaven forbid if it&#x27;s damp, windy, or humid - my hair just becomes a big old mess - no matter what it looks like before I leave the house!  </li>
            <li> , rinse then use the moroccon oil styling cream, nothing else, I then blow dry my hair and flat iron, my hair feels silky and shiny and even healthier!</li>
            <li> I just recently colored my hair totally blonde from dark brown in two salon appointments.  </li>
            <li> A jar goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so soft.i have long hair and it dosnt take alot at all, just a tablespoon.holds me over a month between uses.i</li>

            <li> I have long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Now I am careful not to over use it and just use it as a deep conditioner once a month.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and the ends looked lifeless.</li>
            <li> I have a fine and thin hair, so I was worried this product would make my hair too greasy or weigh it down etc, but that never happened!</li>
            <li> I use about a quarter sized amount and scrunch through.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of other tips, dont use shampoo, wash your hair with conditioner only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products for dry hair</li>
            <li> I use this and the oil when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> and  highlighted and dry.</li>
            <li> shoulder length dry hair.  </li>
            <li> How an oil can feel \\&quot;dry\\&quot; is a mystery, but argan oil feels dry and disappears.  </li>
            <li> After clarifying shampoo, hair is extremely dry and brittle feeling.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair and blow dry it</li>
            <li> After a hair smoothening treatment,  the ends of my hair were kinda dry because of the chemical treatment.</li>
            <li> I did not like Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask due to it made my hair hard.  </li>
            <li> However, what I didn&#x27;t like was that the container was not sealed in any way &amp; the cover was loose.  </li>
            <li> The only down side was that after 2 years of using it, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy, extremely dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> For all the Long hair girls that have religiously went to the Salon for your either 2 week or once a month visit, and always thought there was something missing..</li>
            <li> my hair was over-processed and very dry.  </li>
            <li> It became very dry.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s anything negative to say, it would be that it almost made my hair too soft!  </li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s thin and I have color and hilites, so my hair tends to get very frizzy and dry, but this product makes my hair feel like a 100 bucks!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry (due to thyroid condition), frizz-prone, super-curly hair.</li>
            <li> My local beauty shop owner recommended this a few months ago, and I was put off by the price.</li>
            <li> After I used the oil I expected this to work wonders</li>
            <li> even while it was wet.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> It will Last me a few months.</li>
            <li> I use this after clarifying shampoo once a week for my daughter she is constantly in the pool which makes the hair brittle and green.</li>
            <li> It took a few uses, but this conditioner has vastly improved the health and strength of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It nourishes my hair and gives it much needed moisture, but on the other hand has none of the negative effects other masks and conditioners tend to have which eventually weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Been going natural for about a year now &amp; had to switch to this one per my beautician due to my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Like the oil treatment, a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t be discouraged by the price.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and dry naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I have been getting it Japanese straightened for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I would have no problems recommending this to other people.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me that I might get product build-up from using this along with all the other stuff every day, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I recomend this product to other shoppers . .</li>
            <li> Other times I&#x27;ve put it on damp hair and put a cap on overnight and rinse in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Now if you have thick hair or long hair or think long hair use this and another conditioner together.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this Imitation product</li>
            <li> Put this in your hair for about five minutes and your hair is silky and soft for at least a week!</li>
            <li> Once a week I use this in my hair frizzy, thick &amp; wavy  hair along with daily use of Moroccanoil shampoo, conditioner, oil serum &amp; glimmer shine spray.</li>
            <li> I use this several times a month under a shower cap for at least a half an hour.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work well for someone else with a different hair texture.</li>
            <li> I will typically use this on my hair when I do not have to fix it that day.</li>
            <li> First let me say, yes, it is expensive!  </li>
            <li> Ladies, life got a little easier.  </li>
            <li> (though it&#x27;s still a little frizzier than it used to be).  </li>
            <li> I straigten my hair everyday - but depending on the weather conditions - it will pouf out, get wavy, or just frizz out.  </li>
            <li> and I felt I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> but I was impatient with summer coming up.  </li>
            <li> Downfall, the mask is somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times...</li>
            <li> I also use the masque overnight &amp; rinse in the morning for a heavy duty treatment.</li>
            <li> oily/ wet/ greasy/ heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> After washing, I leave it in for about 7 minutes, rinse, and style using a round brush while blow drying.  </li>
            <li> so I use this as my everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, very heavy, and long.  </li>
            <li> Because of the price, I use the mask only on my ends with a less expensive conditioner on the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to leave in conditioner and have found it&#x27;s gotta be thick to weigh down the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything really bad to say about this brand just save your money more expensive</li>
            <li> After a few months I remembered why I need to buy expensive stuff and went back to this.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you have weak hair.</li>
            <li> It is pretty awful; every time I would brush my hair, I&#x27;d be completely covered in little bits of broken ends.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> i notice that my hair does not feel heavy or doesn&#x27;t feel like I have product build up!</li>
            <li> and I usually workout 3-5 days a week, so</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of the mask as a conditioner every time i wash my hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It had stopped my breakage and excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> Not like it usually is.  </li>
            <li> use Moroccan oil products for the past year and this conditioner works well.</li>
            <li> After a bad experience at a new hair salon</li>
            <li> My hubby has thick gray hair and when used on him his hair was once again manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> as the instructions says, wash hair, apply treatment, and comb your hair, I usually tie it in a pony tail, wait 10 min while washing body and what not, and BOOM!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, but lots of it, about three inches or so past my shoulders, and color-treated.  </li>
            <li> My hair is NOT curly, but wavy and thin, which makes hard to keep in place.</li>
            <li> Not wise</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my already dry and frizzy hair was and is in desperate shape.  </li>
            <li> Now I have decreased my use to once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the by far the worst conditioner I have ever used on my relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I cant believe I wasted money on this crap.</li>
            <li> Expensive though.</li>
            <li> Well she wasnt wrong, my hair feels so silky.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took over a month to ship to me</li>
            <li> I hate having split ends and ever since i started using this - no more.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t terrible and did make my hair a little softer.</li>
            <li> but it made my hair crazy frizzy</li>
            <li> Although this is very expensive, I use this mask as a conditioner 3 to 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I retouch every 2-3 weeks, which makes my hair very vulnerable.</li>
            <li> Too bad this stuff is so expensive!  </li>
            <li> After I washed it out it wasn&#x27;t quite as bad.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair was badly damaged in a salon by improper coloring and this hydrating mask with the repair shampoo</li>
            <li> Grrrr Makes me so mad!</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I get broken packing!!!</li>
            <li> Bad BAD BAD!!!!</li>
            <li> Holy crap, what the crap is in this stuff???</li>
            <li> But the packing from Rerfumesworld was terrible.</li>
            <li> Made my hair worst.</li>
            <li> the tangles were horrible</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely awful in my opinion</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The quality y is the he best. Much better than kerastase. But the packing from Rerfumesworld was terrible. I get broken packing!!! I will reccomend this product but not the seller</li>
            <li> THIS MASK HAS WORKED MIRACLES WITH MY HAIR. It now has its bounce back! It smells fabulous! This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
            <li> Wow this product really works.  I highlighted my hair and it burned my hair.  My hair was frizzy, extremely dry and rough.  I used this product today and it left my hair silky, manageable, shiny and just beautiful.  I also bought the oil and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> First let me say, yes, it is expensive!  This is the latest line of products being offered and recommended at the salon I go to.  Of course I wanted to check the reviews and prices on Amazon before I made any purchase.  After talking myself into spending the money - I AM SO GLAD I DID!  I have thin hair, but lots of it, about three inches or so past my shoulders, and color-treated.  My hair is coarse, wavy/curly, and tends to be frizzy.  I straigten my hair everyday - but depending on the weather conditions - it will pouf out, get wavy, or just frizz out.  For these reasons - I tend to wear it in a pony-tail MOST of time.  Heaven forbid if it&#x27;s damp, windy, or humid - my hair just becomes a big old mess - no matter what it looks like before I leave the house!  I have used the hydrating mask, along with the styling creme, three times now and WOW, what a difference it has made.  My hair is sooooo soft and smooth!  I cannot believe it!  At this price, it&#x27;s obviously an investment, but SO well worth it.  I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on the price!</li>
            <li> Works but is very pricey.  I would get much better results I&#x27;ll bet if it left it on for an hour instead of the 3-5 minutes they say you need to.  It&#x27;s good, but not for the money.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is absolutely wonderful.  I love the whole moroccanoil line.  It makes my hair nice and smooth, since I have really curly hair.  My hair feels nourished and is easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Help moisturize the hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! The smell is not overwhelming. I tend to keep the product on for more than the recommended time. My hair feels so soft and is managable. Styling is a breeze! I do use the shampoo and conditionar as well.</li>
            <li> I like all products of Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter in law, she loved it.  As did I.  Great product, smells so lovely- and makes your hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Moroccanoil hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical about the effect until i really tried&lt;br /&gt;and experienced the effect of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Previously my fine and colour damaged hair felt like dried twigs,&lt;br /&gt;upon 1st time application following by the Moroccanoil treatment,&lt;br /&gt;i can feel big improvement on the texture, coz it feels more like real hair again,&lt;br /&gt;and now after several weeks usage,&lt;br /&gt;my hair is not so frizzy and i can actually see shines on my hair,&lt;br /&gt;which has not been there for several years til now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a really good product that even multiple visits to the saloon for hair&lt;br /&gt;treatments also cannot compare. And best part is, it does real repair that last,&lt;br /&gt;not temporary effects like from those so-called hair treatment products that are purchased off the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;Every decent person who cares about the wellness of their hair should try this!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry (due to thyroid condition), frizz-prone, super-curly hair. I use intensive conditioners, always. My local beauty shop owner recommended this a few months ago, and I was put off by the price. A couple weeks ago, though, I smelled it, was enraptured by the scent (think of a seductive harem or sacred anointing oil, cause it has that frankincensey-myrrhy sort of smell that reminds me of both, funnily enough). I bought it. I tried it. I&#x27;m sold! It&#x27;s not just hype. This mask really hydrates my superdry hair and leaves it silky, manageable, supersoft, and easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, oh, the scent. I&#x27;m gonna get the shampoo and regular conditioner. Today I bought the oil, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, and this seller has a good price. Less than the 50 bucks at my local area beauty stores for this very large jar (2 cups + worth of mask creme.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
            <li> I really think this is repairing my hair. It was not terribly damaged, but just from routine coloring. I had commented about a friend&#x27;s hair, and she told me this is what she was using. I have only been using it about 3 weeks, and I hope my hair continues to heal. It leaves your hair like silk! If you have fine hair (like me) get ready to use some volumizer. I will typically use this on my hair when I do not have to fix it that day. I have never used conditioner along with this mask, I don&#x27;t feel it is necessary. It could leave your hair very flat. Overall I love it, and will continue to use it (as long as I can afford it). A jar goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Like Moroccan Oil? Need more conditioning? This product is a &#x27;must&#x27; for you!   It has the same soft, clean, scent as the other Moroccan Oil products.   Like the oil treatment, a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t be discouraged by the price. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> As you see in some of the comments, buyers complained that this product is not the original Moroccanoil mask.  Take a close look at the top of the jar. compare it with real products like for example this one I found  [...]  you can easily see the difference. The cheap price also doesn&#x27;t make sense. I&#x27;m not saying that every expensive product is good. NO.  But we have to be aware of the brand we buy and use. I bought Moroccanoil mask 8.5 Ounce before. See here   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N5MKMG/ref&#x3D;gno_cart_title_3  It was a good product specially if you use moroccan oil. Bottom line, DON&#x27;T LET THEM FOOL YOU. DON&#x27;T BUY FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> I usually have extremely healthy hair, but I had a lot of hair breakage after I bleached it for an ombre. It is pretty awful; every time I would brush my hair, I&#x27;d be completely covered in little bits of broken ends. I&#x27;ve been using this every time I wash my hair (about 2x a week) and leave it in from anywhere from 10-30 minutes. It&#x27;s definitely made a huge improvement. My hair is much softer, doesn&#x27;t break AS much, and it&#x27;s not as poofy. I have naturally curly, wavy hair and the bleach really fried it. This is making a big difference for me and I&#x27;d highly recommend it, especially if you&#x27;ve got damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo, conditioner and hydrating treatment and it&#x27;s may a really visable difference on my over-processed blond hair.  The oil is great too.  The vendor also shipped it pronto</li>
            <li> I do like the mask and it works well on my curly hair.  Because of the price, I use the mask only on my ends with a less expensive conditioner on the rest of my hair.  I think the biggest selling point is the fragrance, which is heavenly.  However, the price makes me stingy with usage and I&#x27;m going to make that jar last a very long time.  Good product for deep conditioning dry, brittle hair.  If your hair is very dry, splurge on a large jar and you&#x27;ll see results by the time its gone.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel like silk!!</li>
            <li> Best product ive ever used.I ride a motorcycle and dont tie back my hair so i get wind damage and dryed ends,its great for dyed hair and split ends and i love how it makes my hair feel it feels so soft.i have long hair and it dosnt take alot at all, just a tablespoon.holds me over a month between uses.i swear by it.the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> After I used the oil I expected this to work wonders but it made my hair crazy frizzy and I felt I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I live at altitude which is hell on hair, espeially Blonde.  It makes my hair silky, smooth and shiny!  Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and very dry, and I recently moved to a dry, western state. Although this is very expensive, I use this mask as a conditioner 3 to 4 times a week. It makes my hair very soft and moisturized, but not greasy or weighed down, which is something my hair is prone to with deep conditioners. I&#x27;m really happy with it and will purchase again when I run out, which I pray is no time soon.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment. Just as described. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.  I have naturally curly hair and I have been getting it Japanese straightened for the past 3 years.  My hair is relatively healthy but the straightening chemicals have definitely taken a toll on my hair.  I used the mask after using the Moroccanoil shampoo.  As soon as I applied the mask to my hair it immediately felt softer. I left it on for about 5 minutes and when I got out of the shower and combed my hair, I could already notice that it had more of a shine to it...even while it was wet.  I was definitely skeptical that this product would do anything for my hair but after using it just once I am more than satisfied.  If there&#x27;s anything negative to say, it would be that it almost made my hair too soft!  I will definitely use this product consistently; the positive reviews that I read before buying this were all accurate.</li>
            <li> Love it.. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products for dry hair and this is the one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  First time it was used on my hair, by my hair dresser, I could not believe how my hair came alive!  I was so taken by this produce that I shared with family and friends with nothing but possitve feedback. My daughter even used it on her dog (Yorkshire Terrier/Silky) with amazing results.  My hubby has thick gray hair and when used on him his hair was once again manageable.  Was also very impressed at how easy it was to order and how quickly I recieved the product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair worst. I have natural curly hair,which turns dry all the time. So I brought this. After I use it everything seem ok, till later during the day my hair did a 180 and is now all puff and frizzy and completely unmanageable. Can&#x27;t believe I can&#x27;t get my money back. 30 dollars in the garbage. I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that works.</li>
            <li> This is the by far the worst conditioner I have ever used on my relaxed hair I could not comb through my hair the tangles were horrible I had to rewash my hair and use a different conditioner and still my hair gave me hell it felt like it coated the strands I cant believe I wasted money on this crap.I rate it a O.This product has such great ratings I was excited to use it but found out it belongs in the garbage where it is now. My Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture Daily Treatment and Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Intensive Treatment blows Moroccanoil  mask out of the water literally for me.</li>
            <li> Okay Ladies, we&#x27;ve all tried the Professional Salon hair treatment.  For all the Long hair girls that have religiously went to the Salon for your either 2 week or once a month visit, and always thought there was something missing.. You need to try this.  Just do as the instructions says, wash hair, apply treatment, and comb your hair, I usually tie it in a pony tail, wait 10 min while washing body and what not, and BOOM! Rinse, and you can feel the difference. I use this and the oil when I blow dry.  Its so perfect, I wish I knew about it sooner.  I&#x27;ve tried SO many products and I always went to the Salon for a profession hair treatment, but this actually works and it saves me SO MUCH MONEY. Ladies, life got a little easier.  Thank you Moroccanoil!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It really hydrates your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice mask, makes hair feel very soft and healthy.  It did not perform any miracles on my hair, but I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair mask at the moment. My hair stylist had introduced me to Moroccan Oil (the actual hair oil) and so I decided to also give the mask a try and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of, it smells wonderfully and I could almost use it just for that. But more importantly, it seems to be just right for my hair which is short and  highlighted and dry. It definitely needs moisture but is also easily over-cared for, and then usually has no body and needs to be washed too frequently. The Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask solves these seemingly contradictory problems. It nourishes my hair and gives it much needed moisture, but on the other hand has none of the negative effects other masks and conditioners tend to have which eventually weigh down my hair. I have been using the mask once a week, sometimes even twice a week and am still extremely happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product although it really is pricey. Thankfully it lasts for quite a while as one doesn&#x27;t need much per application...</li>
            <li> Product smells wonderful and leaves hair soft.  Shipping was faster than expected. My concern was that the jar didn&#x27;t seem to be full. I couldn&#x27;t verify it actually contained 16.9 ounces, but it only seemed three quarters full.  Not having bought the larger size elsewhere, I had no comparison.  Perhaps the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t fill it all the way.</li>
            <li> I just recently colored my hair totally blonde from dark brown in two salon appointments.  Not wise, I know but I was impatient with summer coming up.  Needless to say, my already dry and frizzy hair was and is in desperate shape.  At the urging of my stylist, I bought this conditioner and have used it religiously in order to rescue and manage my new color.  I am very pleased with the intense moisturizing properties and it truly does help repair like none other I&#x27;ve seen.  It is helping my hair get over the shock and damage and my stylist says that by summers&#x27; end, I will have a new head of hair... given that I moisturize with this as much as possible.  I bought the shampoo, shower moisturizer, hydrating cream and of course, the oil as well.</li>
            <li> Great product and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have found for my over processed hair! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, the packaging isn&#x27;t the same packaging as when I have purchased it in store, so that is a tad off putting, makes me think it is a knock off.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair care product. I bleach my hair all the time. The Moroccanoil is a life saver. Always good price on Anazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is soft and shine...complements fr lots of people.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and am ready to order more!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and dry naturally curly hair. Using this product has, over time, improved the condition of my hair. My hair stylist, who also has dry naturally curly hair, recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Best product for my very thick, coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love argon oil products and I have been wanting to try the infamous Moroccanoil brand for so long and wish listed it until I felt I could splurge to purchase it. It smells nice and I&#x27;m overall happy with the result. My hair is soft and manageable but....I didn&#x27;t have a better result with this more expensive brand than I did with the argon one n only brand sold at Sally&#x27;s for $10. Actually with the Sally&#x27;s brand I had more slip and ease when it came to detangling my thick tresses and my hair felt like silk afterwards. I don&#x27;t have anything really bad to say about this brand just save your money more expensive doesn&#x27;t mean better.</li>
            <li> Great product if you tring to grow your hair! Fast shipping and good service. I also use Maroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner and love it too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask to treat my dry and damaged hair. This product did not work for me. I purchased it thinking that it would be as good a quality product as the  Moroccan Oil but it is not. I was very unhappy with this purchase and so I contacted the vendor to request a refund. The vendor informed me that they would not give me a refund for the product. I am stuck with a product that costed almost $40,00 and did not work.</li>
            <li> After a bad experience at a new hair salon my hair was over-processed and very dry.  I used the hydrating mask and oil to restore its former condition.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product a while ago. Mask lasted a long time. Overall, happy with the purchase. Downfall, the mask is somewhat heavy. Wouldn&#x27;t use it too frequent with fine hair. Love Moroccan Oil, but have since moved on to Light Argan Oils. If you have thick corse hair, this product would be perfect for you. If you have fine hair, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great if you have thick and frizzy hair. It really tames down your hair. I love it because it is nice and thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am f/b 57 yrs. shoulder length dry hair.  Superb product!  Will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Deserves 10 stars!</li>
            <li> Too bad this stuff is so expensive!  Or, this would be the ONLY conditioner I use..I call it my special occasion conditioner, because my natural curls truly shine with this product!</li>
            <li> Thick cream goes on easy.  Leave on for 5-10 minutes.  When you rinse your hair, it is super soft and smells wonderful.  I only use this product once a week and I feel like it is helping with my split ends.</li>
            <li> Great product, I received my shipment a lil late because the first one was damaged but customer service was awesome and I love this product I would order it again.  Well when I run out!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner before and it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love how it leaves the hair smooth and silky.  I bought the 16.9 ounce jar because it was a better deal than the smaller one.  You can use it every day, or once a week if you can&#x27;t afford to use it every day.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice products works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times... it was suggested by my hair dresser. After only a couple uses I have noticed improvement.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! It is expensive but totally worth it!!!!! Makes my hair shine and smooth. One time u go to a salon 4 a. Deep conditioning u will pay the same price for actually having the WHOLe bottle which i ve used already at least 4 times(i do have long hair) and still have of the bottle</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes my hair soft and silky like no other product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Accomplished the purpose of the product. Moroccanoil says by itself.  The top preferred hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for your great job with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Fabulous hair masque for dry, coarse hair. I use it every 3 days as a conditioner &amp; it does the trick !!!! I also use the masque overnight &amp; rinse in the morning for a heavy duty treatment.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I use perms so I&#x27;m really big on conditioning and hydrating my hair. This brand is great with keeping the hair moisturized without it looking oily/ wet/ greasy/ heavy.  I also use the oil treatment and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world. Enjoy this refreshing drink for your hair!!!</li>
            <li> I did not like Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask due to it made my hair hard.  I don&#x27;t have any chemicals in my hair and my hair is naturally curly.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work well for someone else with a different hair texture.</li>
            <li> The best hydrating mask I&#x27;ve tried that tames and decreases frizz</li>
            <li> Goog product I have been use for 2 years and also I did refer to my co-work</li>
            <li> I just started using this the last 2 weeks, I deep condition once a week, rinse then use the moroccon oil styling cream, nothing else, I then blow dry my hair and flat iron, my hair feels silky and shiny and even healthier! i notice that my hair does not feel heavy or doesn&#x27;t feel like I have product build up! I can go 3 days without washing it and I usually workout 3-5 days a week, so the sweat and daily wear doesn&#x27;t change the way my hair feels!! all I do is brush it the second day and I&#x27;m off to go, the 3rd day I do touch up a bit with my ghd flat iron but still at this point I don&#x27;t need need any additional product!! I love this moroccan oil brand, the next thing I want to get is the actual oil!! I also want to say that although this tub is quite pricey I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a long time, since I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it to condition my hair, I do have wavy hair,it&#x27;s thin and I have color and hilites, so my hair tends to get very frizzy and dry, but this product makes my hair feel like a 100 bucks!</li>
            <li> this product needs no comment, and the store sent me right in appropriate containers at the right time.&lt;br /&gt;hair look great with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back. I just received my order of 2...the large size. The best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome. Now if you have thick hair or long hair or think long hair use this and another conditioner together. You want to put this conditioner on first and then something like Herbal Essence Hello Hydration (use quite a bit) and leave on for 30-45 mins. Your hair will love it. I use this back and forth with Redkin or Macadamian mask (do not use a lot use same method as above)</li>
            <li> bought as a new but came to me as used product in a very suspicious package, dissapointment</li>
            <li> I leave this in my hair overnight and wash it out in the morning and my hair comes out beautifully. I love this product for my dry hair it works amazingly well. I would have no problems recommending this to other people. Ships fast as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my hair dresser for recommending this product to me. I absolutely love it. I like to recommend this product to others for it&#x27;s quality. Your hair is going to appreciate it. Don&#x27;t hesitate, just get one to try. Once you try this product you will stay with it. Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has a life of it&#x27;s own, separate from mine.  I tried Moroccanoil products after reading the reviews.  Thank goodness I did!  Now my hair and I can peacefully coexist!  My hair is thick, very heavy, and long.  It tends to curl, wave and frizz in every possible direction, except where I want it to, depending on it&#x27;s mood.   By using this product just once a week my hair is silky, shiny and smooth.  I love it!  I even wake up mornings able to run my fingers thru my hair, without risk of broken fingers!  My husband loves the new hair as well.    Now that I&#x27;ve found something that works so well for me.....I will never give up my Moroccanoil!  My hairdresser even started using it after he saw the results I was getting!</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and I rarely have split ends. It smells great too. Also great for co-washing your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome product.  You got to try it to know how Good it is.  Worth every penny, the smell is so nice.  It will Last me a few months.</li>
            <li> Thick/curly hair essential!</li>
            <li> I buy this at a professional store and love it.  I use to use Strong Sexy but they discontinued their deep conditioner so I tried this.  It is better.  I have very curly hair, almost like African American hair and thus it is always dry.  Some days I feel like my hair looks like Tina Turner&#x27;s in Beyond Thunderdome.  I use this several times a month under a shower cap for at least a half an hour.  It keeps my hair moisturized and under control.  Unlike the  deep conditioners that are protein based, this does not dry out my hair if I use it every week.  This product is however only one of two in the line that I really loved.  Tried the oil, shampoo, and a styling cream too and was not fond of them.  I do like their conditioner very much but not for everyday use as it is a heavier conditioner.  Probably great if you have ultra dry hair.  Now I have not taken their oil and heated it for a hot oil treatment so it may be good for that use, but as a shine product I prefer micro misting shiners.  I do buy their oil for my Mom&#x27;s hair and it keeps it glossy without weight or feeling greasy.  How an oil can feel \\&quot;dry\\&quot; is a mystery, but argan oil feels dry and disappears.  Argan oil is a remarkable product.  That and shea butter oils are terrific for multiple uses.  Shea butter oil cured my Mom&#x27;s rash that she has had for years and had multiple steroidal Rx product that never helped.</li>
            <li> This product really moisturizes your hair.</li>
            <li> Great weekly conditioning treatment, even for colored hair. I use this after clarifying shampoo once a week for my daughter she is constantly in the pool which makes the hair brittle and green. After clarifying shampoo, hair is extremely dry and brittle feeling.  Put this in your hair for about five minutes and your hair is silky and soft for at least a week! This stuff is great without a heavy, or greasy feel! Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> awesome, best hair product ive ever used!</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re only supposed to use this once or twice a week, but ever since I started coloring my hair, it&#x27;s been really dry.  So I use this mask every morning.  I also use a leave-in conditioner, frizz-ease, and a hair balm.  Between those four products, my hair finally feels like it did before I started coloring it (though it&#x27;s still a little frizzier than it used to be).  My stylist told me that I might get product build-up from using this along with all the other stuff every day, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now with no problems.  I highly recommend it.  My only complaint is that the jar is kind of a pain in the shower (opening it, getting the product out, and closing it again so that no water gets in).  A pump bottle would be outstanding.</li>
            <li> Once a week I use this in my hair frizzy, thick &amp; wavy  hair along with daily use of Moroccanoil shampoo, conditioner, oil serum &amp; glimmer shine spray. I  this product!</li>
            <li> Amaizing smell, the hair was super soft and glossy after use. i would buy this again with no hesitation. also a good price. ( you recieve what you pay for)</li>
            <li> This mask leaves my hair very soft.  I have long wavy hair.  On top of that, I have highlights which have dried out my hair.  This conditioner is pricey, but it works.</li>
            <li> It took a few uses, but this conditioner has vastly improved the health and strength of my hair.  It is a mainstay in my haircare routine.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used on my hair. I use it as my conditioner and every couple of weeks as a mask for about 10 mins. I have skin that breaks out with otber conditioners and this product does not affect my skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have had the real tub of Moroccan oil mask and this is not it! I am not kidding you, after letting it sit on my hair for 30+ minutes(which is not bad to do with a mask), I swear I thought I was losing all of my hair. My hair kept coming out and coming out. Holy crap, what the crap is in this stuff??? This is NOT the original Moroccan oil and comes straight from China. Bad BAD BAD!!!!</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick and curly hair. (caucasian and 1/2 Jewish).  I have to leave in conditioner and have found it&#x27;s gotta be thick to weigh down the frizz. So I leave this stuff in, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great to wash out too (as the instructions recommend).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now. I recently tried a popular cheap brand of tub conditioner.  After a few months I remembered why I need to buy expensive stuff and went back to this.  The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Great shopping experience from the time I placed the order to the time I received the item.  It was ery easy to place the order and it arrived in the expected time frame.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe AMAZON is selling this stuff, it must come directly from CHINA!!  Smells different, has a different color, and it suds up my hair.  The real Moroccanoil Hydrating Mask is awesome, I wish Amazon would back their products, offer a return, give a customer service phone number etc.  If I could rate this Imitation product zero starts I would.  Again this is an impostor, the original stuff is awesome, Amazon is selling black market junk.....stay away!</li>
            <li> Although this product is pricey, it definitely does the job! If your hair is dry or coloured like mine it brings your hair back to life! Each time I use it my hair looks fabulous and I get compliments on my hair! I owe it all to this conditioner! Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Use it all the time.  Great outcome on your hair!</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;I have really curly hair and it needs lots of moisture. I tend to leave it in to calm my curls...</li>
            <li> I have been using moroccan oil products for a few years now and the masks were among my first purchases from this brand. I love love love them. I use a small amount of the mask as a conditioner every time i wash my hair and it works wonders. I hate having split ends and ever since i started using this - no more. My hair is shiny and healthy. It&#x27;s also a great detangled. Love it! PS: it lasts for ever!</li>
            <li> this a good product a little bit too expensive if you ask me</li>
            <li> First tried it at a hair salon!  DIY is a cheaper version!  It is the best conditioner I have tried.  Really leaves my tangles hair soft and smooth, so much easier to handle once it is dried.  Retains its softness even when you apply heat to your hair is drying or straightening tongs!  Expensive though.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and very, very good.With a delicious scent, was the best for my hair, i realy like it, and when it finish i will buy it again.  Becouse i don&#x27;t live without it anymore</li>
            <li> Great product.   It made my hair softer.  I recommend it !!!!!!!!!!!!!  :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Same old, same old! Great brand, great mask. Did not performed miracles for my hair though.</li>
            <li> Help moisturize my hair,I bought two of them.The price dropped 2 dollars of each one with free shipping after my purchase.not happy about it!</li>
            <li> Perfect!! My wife liked it.</li>
            <li> It was as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep your hair hydrated.  I&#x27;m sure you do not have to use weekly or daily.  The moroccaniol products are great for the any type of hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely awful in my opinion (12/26/13: changed my mind about this after using often). After I washed it out it wasn&#x27;t quite as bad. I have another hair mask by the body shop that works much better than this one. My hair is very fine and kind of thin, my sister has the exact opposite hair type and the mask from the body shop worked great for her as well. I&#x27;m going to have her try this mask out though, perhaps it would work best with very thick hair. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again but it wasn&#x27;t terrible and did make my hair a little softer. I would keep looking for another product or try a smaller/cheaper jar of this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/26/13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it more regularly and found it does actually hydrate my hair very well. The key is to actually use it consistently. $35 is quite pricey for a hydrating mask, however it has done such a great job I have changed my mind and I WOULD buy this again. It will be something I always keep stocked in my bathroom. I had a coworker ask if I had my hair done after using it because it had made such a difference. :) Changed from 3 to 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The correct product arrived fairly quickly &amp; was packed very well.  However, what I didn&#x27;t like was that the container was not sealed in any way &amp; the cover was loose.  I&#x27;ve used this product before;  it&#x27;s an excellent conditioner for dry and/or colored hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hydrating mask- this is my favorite jair care company- and this mask works very well too. I really great price for a lot of cream!</li>
            <li> I use this after I treat my hair with the Nexus Emergency Reconstructor. They work great together, my scalp and hair is no longer dry. I must say this product provides a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> great product, excellent. I have bought this before and love it, had to have it again. totally recommend it. excellent service too.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing!!! Grrrr Makes me so mad! I had one that I purchase in a salon and it worked wonderful. Then because I live several months out of the year in another country I order this one to take with me and left my original at my home in the USA. When I opened it I was already out of the USA. I did notice a difference but convinced myself that it was fine. I just returned home for the holidays, used my original and OMG what a difference!!!! Same thing just happened with a CHI silk infusion that I just purchased last week!! This is the 3rd and last time I order any kind of hair product from Amazon! Very, very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I live on the beach, surf everyday. Do japanese straightening on my hair every six months and color. Last week I just decided to highlight it as well. Imagine the mess my hair can be if I don&#x27;t take good care of it. My hair is NOT curly, but wavy and thin, which makes hard to keep in place. it gets really dry because of all I mentioned above. Tried this mask at a friends house once and felt the difference right away. Now I use it twice a week and its like a miracle... I never had my hair so nice looking without having to use a flat iron or blow-dry. Its just natural looking, feels smooth and under control. It smells amazing and I just hope my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to it after a while...because I plan on using this mask for as long as I live!</li>
            <li> I have a fine and thin hair, so I was worried this product would make my hair too greasy or weigh it down etc, but that never happened! After 2 weeks of use (twice per week), my hair is softer, shiny and healthy looking! Now I have decreased my use to once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend even noticed the difference and has complimented my hair, saying that my hair was too dry and flying everywhere before ,now it is nice, silky and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: I wash my hair and squeeze out all the water. Then I apply desired amount to my hair, tie it up and cover it up with those plastic shower cap thing. Then I continue to shower, and after enough time has passed I just take the cap off and rinse. This way, I save time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product will be especially great for thick/curly/dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> There is a long time I wanted to buy this product, but its so expensive in Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in one week and the smelling is perfect!</li>
            <li> This was recommened by Ree Drummond- The Pioneer Woman on her blog- she said it repaired your hair and made it feel like a million bucks. Well she wasnt wrong, my hair feels so silky. It doesnt require much at all, leave it in for 10 mins, rinse it out. I color my hair and blow dry it ever morning- this product makes my hair feel soft and fabulous. Incredible product.</li>
            <li> Very Good Didn&#x27;t assist too much with untangling For some reasn I was under the impression it is for fine to normal hair It is a good product. Seller provided good service and arrived earlier than anticipated</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This mask works very well as a conditioner and as a hair treatment. It makes my hair smooth and shiny, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and have to order another! This stuff is wonderful and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the moisture I receive from it!! Thanks a million!!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing!  Makes me want to buy more Moroccan Oil products.  My hair after using was not oily at all which is the main flaw in most oil products.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and recommend it to everyone. Thanks for the efficiency and honesty. Buy more time with you</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner. I used to use it every thursday night and leave it in until my Friday or Saturday hair appointment. It had stopped my breakage and excessive shedding. It would leave my hair incredibly soft and manageable. The only down side was that after 2 years of using it, it stopped working. My hair felt like I had not conditioned it at all.  Maybe my hair was over conditioned. So I switched conditioners for a while and from time to time I would try this again. Eventually it started to work. Now I am careful not to over use it and just use it as a deep conditioner once a month.</li>
            <li> the content of this jar is different than what I just found in an actual salon I was at. Same jar, same writings but different product inside!!! Be aware before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Love this product normally, but what got delivered to me was sub par.  Product that I got is clumpy and not spreadable.  Not like it usually is.  Texture is off.  Not sure if I got old product or product that was damaged, but it just wasn&#x27;t right.  I will buy Moroccan Oil again, as I love the product but not from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Perfect hair product.</li>
            <li> Love this product does a great job of conditioning love all of the Moroccan Oil products have used the for a long time.</li>
            <li> Ok, let&#x27;s face it, unless you are very lucky, most of us over 60, have dry, chemically damaged hair. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that calms the frizzies, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft.  I can once again have shoulder length hair that doesn&#x27;t look like I put my finger in an electrical socket.  After washing, I leave it in for about 7 minutes, rinse, and style using a round brush while blow drying.  It&#x27;s a little pricy, but goes a long way and is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I was my hair daily.  It became very dry.  I tried this product a year ago and I became a regular user of many of their products.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I like it very much. I recomend this product to other shoppers . .</li>
            <li> Originally my hairdresser recommended this for my platinum bleach blonde hair, to condition and moisturize. However, a friend recommended keeping a jar in my snorkel gear bag and using it whenever I enjoy a day in the ocean, which is fairly frequently. This instantly detangles my salty hair and restores a very soft feel. Even the guys use it to make their hair manageable after exposure to saltwater. I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Comprei essa mÃ¡scara para minha mÃ£e que Ã© apaixonada por ela. Por isso mesmo ela quis o tamanho maior, para durar mais. Chegou perfeito.</li>
            <li> I have fine overprocessed hair. I am a level 10 platinum and I don&#x27;t use glaze just bleach (level 6 natural) I retouch every 2-3 weeks, which makes my hair very vulnerable. This product puts life back into it and it smells heavenly... the smell lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It&#x27;s a great product for the hair and it smells amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to get my next one.</li>
            <li> I have very thick dry curly hair.  I have been using this as a leave in conditioner for about 2 years with excellent results.  My hair is just above my shoulders. I use about a quarter sized amount and scrunch through.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of other tips, dont use shampoo, wash your hair with conditioner only. Shampoo strips your curls of their natural oils.  I also use Dermorganics oil right before a blow dry with defuser.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, straight and medium thickness.  With a bit of age it has become fragile and breaks easily.  This hydrating mask makes my hair extremely soft and silky - healthy looking - with no crazy flyaways. It does not weigh my hair down or make it look oily (and my husband absolutely loves the scent).  I have been doing 2 treatments per week for a month.  It is lovely and I will continue using it, but am not sure about breakage results just yet.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair so I use this as my everyday conditioner. It smells SO GOOD! It is really hydrating and not too heavy. I also like that Moroccanoil does not test on animals! :)</li>
            <li> I tried this product, it&#x27;s pretty good, makes my hair real smooth. The only concern I have is that the product came not sealed in any way...how can I know that it&#x27;s the real thing?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard all of the rave reviews, but I really don&#x27;t feel anything different with this. It does make my hair smell good, so it&#x27;s not bad, but just not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it works great with fine hair, i could tell a good difference after using it about 3 times</li>
            <li> This is one of my preferred hair products. Moisturizes and gives my hair shine. Maintaining the treatment once week is the key.</li>
            <li> I found you can put just a little tiny coating on your hands and coat your hair ever so lightly while wet, and don&#x27;t rinse out.  My hair is color treated and rather coarse.  This makes it manageable and doing it this way it lasts a LOONG time.  This is my must-use haircare product.  Get it if your hair is coarse!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She loves israeli product. Me too. Really nice quality and worth the price. Recomended.</li>
            <li> The price was the best deal that I saw. The product is great and made my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Moroccan oil products for the past year and this conditioner works well. The product arrived on time and is a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the original Moroccan oil, so decided to try it in mask form.  It&#x27;s so wonderful and indulgent.  Sometimes I use this as directed and leave it on for 10 minutes while I&#x27;m in the shower.  Other times I&#x27;ve put it on damp hair and put a cap on overnight and rinse in the morning.  Afterwards my hair is so soft and beautiful! And typically I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t really see a whole lot of results in various hair care products.  This, however, is magic.  It&#x27;s worth the splurge.  I will be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li> My hair just look amazing using this mask. I  will have to buy on other one very soon</li>
            <li> Love it, the best mask I ever used</li>
            <li> Works great!!! and shipped fast</li>
            <li> This is a very thick and oily mask that helps to nourish the hair and it does a great job. My wife&#x27;s hair was badly damaged in a salon by improper coloring and this hydrating mask with the repair shampoo was the only thing that brought her hair back to life. After a month of treatment, it is almost 100% back to normal. Her new stylist recommended this to try to salvage her hair and it worked perfectly. Expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it&#x27;s great for people with dry scalp. This product has really helped my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> Magic for your hair. Be careful if you have weak hair. But, leave it on for hours and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I love it!! It smells so nice and definitely brought my hair back to life after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> After a hair smoothening treatment,  the ends of my hair were kinda dry because of the chemical treatment. I have really long hair and the ends looked lifeless. I started using this mask and it was magic! I use it every time I wash my hair in place of the conditioner and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother in law. She says this mask is very good for her hair, but she prefers the restorative mask. She has curly hair and uses it straightened.</li>
            <li> this hair mask is super excellent .. i love how it makes my hair very smooth since i have wavy hair .. i highly recommend this product to anyone ..</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product.  Unfortunately it took over a month to ship to me which was a bummer.  BUT the product itself is amazing and should be in everyones shower!</li>
            <li> my whole family absolutely loves this conditioner. its pricey but it just works. leaves hair feeling soft and smooth. amazon has the best pricing on this.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  Been going natural for about a year now &amp; had to switch to this one per my beautician due to my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I bought to my girlfriend, and on her works: &amp;#34;the best I have already used&amp;#34;. So I think itÂ´s excellent.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Product was as described.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> Best hydrating mask for any type of hair, works perfectly with the oil hair treatment.</li>
            <li> very light and easy to use on hair, and leave the hair as you had a very scrumptious salon work on it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I recommend this product as a great way to keep your hair healthy. Love it!</li>
            <li> Use just a teeny bit in my hair, work it through well, barely rinse and I&#x27;m ready to step out of the shower. It keeps hair smooth, shiny, soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccaoil products not only do it smell good, but it does wonder for my hair which is amazing. The hydrating mask which I have in rotation with my alter ego deep conditioner the only thing is when using this mask I had to pour some Moroccanoil in it to really hydrate my hair. It worked great when I left it on for half an hour under the dryer.</li>
            <li> very nice hair mask, it is worty to get it , the price is fair and it works very well for dry nd damage hair</li>
