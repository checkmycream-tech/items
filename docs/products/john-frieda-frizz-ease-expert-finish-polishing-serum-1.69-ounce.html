    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The John Frieda line has always impressed me, and this product was no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best frizz hair control I have ever used</li>
            <li>Excellent item, and</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>But this is a great tool to have in your hair-styling arsenal.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, i put it onevery morning on my damp hair.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I got this because i use heat irons and blow dryers and i need something to protect my hair from heat and to be honest</li>
            <li>helps with frizz, love this product, good price too.</li>
            <li>(I know, I don&#x27;t love to do all this work either.)</li>
            <li>I love this product, and don&#x27;t get results like this from anything else.</li>
            <li>this is, the more I applied, the more flyaway my ends became.  </li>
            <li>but i feel like my hair needs more protection</li>
            <li>I love this product in the summer time.</li>
            <li>And I haven&#x27;t found any product that tames the frizz better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I quit and started using a Redken product... which was great at first, but quickly built up on my hair.</li>
            <li>This serum is great, it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>I started using the original serum 14 years ago and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s puffy, frizzy, and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>After washing my hair I squirted about 3/4 pump full of the product onto my palm, and massaged it into my semi-damp hair, without touching my scalp.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new good serum which had thermal protection.</li>
            <li>But for normal-dry hair, even processed (my hair is dyed), it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>With the serum, it&#x27;s smooth, glassy, and well-behaved.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>this one was the best for my straight, fine, limp, bleached hair.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used this product once since I bought it, and maybe continuous use is required to achieve the desired result.  </li>
            <li>but they would get super frizzy when blow drying or if the humidity increased a bit.</li>
            <li>This really does work really well and has a nice mild scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering or cloying.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample from another retailer, and was hooked after the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hair protecting product I&#x27;ve tried before ironing my hair, and it does seem to work well!</li>
            <li>Other than that the seller was great, fast communication &amp; speed!</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s really worth trying it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a buy.</li>
            <li>and I want what I do have to look as nice as possible</li>
            <li>I applied prior to blow-drying as directed but found that once my hair was dry I needed more... and more... and more.  </li>
            <li>It is light, and it makes your color darker and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>This is a good serum that really does stop frizz even when I blow dry my curly hair.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine for me(oily, wavy, soft hair type).</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>Wife says it is only ok.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend it :)</li>
            <li>and I can feel the soft, frizz free difference when I use this to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>The result is frizz free naturally curly hair for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I tend to overdo it with the hot iron so this helps to protect my hair.</li>
            <li>It works, I have no split ends and people always comment on how healthy my LONG hair looks.  </li>
            <li>Silky, sexy long hair.</li>
            <li>It really helps on hot humid days.  </li>
            <li>I tried to save money by switching to this product, but I guess I&#x27;m back to the more expensive, yet effective, TIGI Shine Serum and Paul Mitchell Gloss Drops that I love.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to some one who has straight not damaged hair, darker hair, and needs thermal protection but does not like to layer hair products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this much.</li>
            <li>This serum isn&#x27;t really a conditioner, so I try to use both.</li>
            <li>I have been using Pantene&#x27;s Ice Shine shampoo, and that works very well as a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is what really made my hair shine.</li>
            <li>My hair is really oily and I need to wash it once every 2 days.</li>
            <li>Works much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They also manufacture a much stronger hold and it&#x27;s a bit too much for my hair</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen any heat damage signs on my hair thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I also walked in the rain the other day and my hair stayed straight even after that(it used to curl up super rapidly even if I walked through a fog!!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found other stuff I like more.</li>
            <li>It made my hair look naturally healthy, very manageable, and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>Then squirt a single pump of the serum into your palm, rub palms together, then lightly work it through the pony tail of your hair.</li>
            <li>Read a review on this product and it was highly praised for effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li>I make sure to cover my hair with UV screens while going to the beach nearly everyday in the summer.</li>
            <li>love this product use it everyday</li>
            <li>She said the trick is this:&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing and using normal rinse-out conditioner or detangler, wrap your hair in a towel turban to remove as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>I have always had soft curly hair</li>
            <li>and you can also use it when blow drying straight to keep hair from curling back up.</li>
            <li>i saw a bit of a difference but not much my hair was left soft and smooth</li>
            <li>My hair was instantly softer and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>Expert Finish!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to order frequently - as my hair is Very Thick and Mane like ....AND gets out of control easily!</li>
            <li>It is hard for my hair to survive the summer without becoming a gigantic frizz-ball.</li>
            <li>Even when I use enough for adequate coverage, my hair is still dry and frizzy (especially on the ends) and not shiny at all.</li>
            <li>It left my dry hair silky and smooth so if dry hair is a problem, definitely try this.</li>
            <li>I simply squished a small amount into the palms of my hands and lightly applied to my severely over-processed hair.  </li>
            <li>I barely used much when it was wet.</li>
            <li>Immediately upon squirting the serum in my hand, I could tell the watery solution was not slick enough to do the trick on my coarse, highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other thermal protection products-but I can feel the difference between my blow-dried hair when this product is used and it is not used.</li>
            <li>However, be sure to use small amounts cause it does cause it can little build-up.</li>
            <li>put a small amount, maybe quarter size, in my hands, rub them together, and then run my hands through my hair right after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The recommended amount on the bottle is no where near enough for long hair.</li>
            <li>There are a few positive things I can say about this product-one is the UV and Thermal Protection.</li>

            <li> There are a few positive things I can say about this product-one is the UV and Thermal Protection.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the past two years to help with my dry damaged hair, and this is one of the products I tried that did very to little help my hair.</li>
            <li> Just use VERY little, because it is an oil and could flatten your hair if too much gets on your brush.</li>
            <li> The serum seems to protect my hair from as much flat iron damage as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result:</li>
            <li> wavy to curly, dry damaged ends, greasy roots (occasionally), lightened (blonde), long</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how much I needed for my hair.  </li>
            <li> After I blow dry with a brush, I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s really protecting my hair from the heat</li>
            <li> Then I read a review by a woman with long hair like mine.</li>
            <li> dry with a brush.</li>
            <li> the curls dry frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I put it on after showers or on dry hair when the humidity decides to give me a crappy makeover.</li>
            <li> I bought this product only a couple of weeks back and used it a few times.</li>
            <li> In the middle of the day, a little bit revives your hair.  </li>
            <li> I apply it in my wet curly hair and</li>
            <li> I have long hair and just one pump works to keep the fly-aways down.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair nearly everyday</li>
            <li> and this does make my hair less dry and crunchy when applied before heading out.</li>
            <li> No way is that enough for thick or long hair.  </li>
            <li> I divide my hair into two sections, and squirt a little less than a quarter sized amount of serum in my palm for each section, working it through my hair (especially the ends).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Additionally-this product does not mix well with other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the other Frieda serums-</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not as thick or \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; as the extra-strength formula, so if you have very dry or coarse hair, you should try that one, and use something separate to protect from heat-styling.  </li>
            <li> If I only used the serum, I&#x27;d have a hard time combing through my wet</li>
            <li> A little dab when dry, a few pumps when wet.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> IT keeps the frizz down to a minimum every day.  </li>
            <li> it weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Seems to weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> However-these effects are very small and very short lived.   </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use one, my hair starts to get really flat and loses all shine.</li>
            <li> This does tend to build in undesired areas and leave a slight residue in my hair which makes it appear darker.  </li>
            <li> My daughter likes this product a lot, uses on her slightly damaged by dye ends.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very long, thick and curly, and this serum tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have long hair - usually 4-6 inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I tried this serum months ago, but after a few days it seemed too oily and heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> Use this everyday.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or dull.</li>
            <li> I am sometimes forced into the sun a lot</li>
            <li> Very thin consistency, expected thicker.</li>
            <li> This was the replacement for their sleek &amp; glosses, unfortunately it its!</li>
            <li> I had REALLY bad frizzing with my eurasian hair.</li>
            <li> I used this bad boy twice, didnt have a problem again.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s really protecting my hair from the heat but I like the texture it gives to my hair. For the price it&#x27;s really worth trying it.</li>
            <li> I started using the original serum 14 years ago and fell in love.  I switched to this Thermal Protection formula a couple years ago because I was blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair on a regular basis.  The John Frieda line has always impressed me, and this product was no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not as thick or \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; as the extra-strength formula, so if you have very dry or coarse hair, you should try that one, and use something separate to protect from heat-styling.  But for normal-dry hair, even processed (my hair is dyed), it&#x27;s just fine.  I have long hair - usually 4-6 inches past my shoulders.  I divide my hair into two sections, and squirt a little less than a quarter sized amount of serum in my palm for each section, working it through my hair (especially the ends).  Then I do my hair.  When I forget to use this before blowing out my hair, the difference is enormous - it&#x27;s puffy, frizzy, and tangles easily.  With the serum, it&#x27;s smooth, glassy, and well-behaved. I often get compliments on my hair - from stylists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to remember: the \\&quot;dime-sized\\&quot; amount the bottle says to use - that&#x27;s for men, I think.  No way is that enough for thick or long hair.  It took me a few tries to figure out how much I needed for my hair.  But this is a great tool to have in your hair-styling arsenal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best frizz hair control I have ever used so I gave it a 5 star</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the past two years to help with my dry damaged hair, and this is one of the products I tried that did very to little help my hair. The recommended amount on the bottle is no where near enough for long hair. Even when I use enough for adequate coverage, my hair is still dry and frizzy (especially on the ends) and not shiny at all. This does tend to build in undesired areas and leave a slight residue in my hair which makes it appear darker.  Additionally-this product does not mix well with other products. I tried using this pureology (leave in conditioner), nexus split end mend, and pequi oil and this serum did not cover my hair when used over these products, and my hair did not absorb any of these products when I tried to use them over this Frizz-Ease UV.   There are a few positive things I can say about this product-one is the UV and Thermal Protection. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other thermal protection products-but I can feel the difference between my blow-dried hair when this product is used and it is not used. I am sometimes forced into the sun a lot and this does make my hair less dry and crunchy when applied before heading out. However-these effects are very small and very short lived.   I would recommend this to some one who has straight not damaged hair, darker hair, and needs thermal protection but does not like to layer hair products.  Hair type: wavy to curly, dry damaged ends, greasy roots (occasionally), lightened (blonde), long</li>
            <li> I use this product just on the ends of my hair to protect from split ends.  It works, I have no split ends and people always comment on how healthy my LONG hair looks.  Just use VERY little, because it is an oil and could flatten your hair if too much gets on your brush.</li>
            <li> I tried this serum months ago, but after a few days it seemed too oily and heavy for my hair. So I quit and started using a Redken product... which was great at first, but quickly built up on my hair. Then I read a review by a woman with long hair like mine. She said the trick is this:&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing and using normal rinse-out conditioner or detangler, wrap your hair in a towel turban to remove as much moisture as possible. Remove towel, detangle hair with fingers then a brush (to avoid breakage). Then squirt a single pump of the serum into your palm, rub palms together, then lightly work it through the pony tail of your hair. Do NOT apply it to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow dry with a brush. The brush works the serum through all of your hair. After I blow dry with a brush, I use a flat iron. (I know, I don&#x27;t love to do all this work either.) The serum seems to protect my hair from as much flat iron damage as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Silky, sexy long hair. I love this product, and don&#x27;t get results like this from anything else. Good luck!</li>
            <li> It really helps on hot humid days.  IT keeps the frizz down to a minimum every day.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy</li>
            <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used this product once since I bought it, and maybe continuous use is required to achieve the desired result.  Immediately upon squirting the serum in my hand, I could tell the watery solution was not slick enough to do the trick on my coarse, highlighted hair.  I applied prior to blow-drying as directed but found that once my hair was dry I needed more... and more... and more.  Funny this is, the more I applied, the more flyaway my ends became.  Even if this product did protect my hair from the heat of the blowdryer (a function that can&#x27;t be evaluated after one use), it is also supossed to fight frizz.  I tried to save money by switching to this product, but I guess I&#x27;m back to the more expensive, yet effective, TIGI Shine Serum and Paul Mitchell Gloss Drops that I love.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, and I will continue to use it. It left my dry hair silky and smooth so if dry hair is a problem, definitely try this.</li>
            <li> This was the replacement for their sleek &amp; glosses, unfortunately it its! I still&lt;br /&gt;have frizze hair &amp; it weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new good serum which had thermal protection. This is a good serum that really does stop frizz even when I blow dry my curly hair. I have always had soft curly hair but they would get super frizzy when blow drying or if the humidity increased a bit. This really does work really well and has a nice mild scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering or cloying. Definitely worth a buy. However, be sure to use small amounts cause it does cause it can little build-up.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I apply it in my wet curly hair and the curls dry frizz-free. It helps the curl maintain its form and you can also use it when blow drying straight to keep hair from curling back up. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Wife says it is only ok. Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this much. I&#x27;ve found other stuff I like more. Seems to weigh my hair down and I have to wash it sooner, but does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I got this because i use heat irons and blow dryers and i need something to protect my hair from heat and to be honest i saw a bit of a difference but not much my hair was left soft and smooth but i feel like my hair needs more protection so probably that was the only con. Other than that the seller was great, fast communication &amp; speed! Totally recommend it :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product in the summer time. It is hard for my hair to survive the summer without becoming a gigantic frizz-ball. And I haven&#x27;t found any product that tames the frizz better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a small amount, maybe quarter size, in my hands, rub them together, and then run my hands through my hair right after I get out of the shower. I also spray it with a leave-in conditioner before I comb. This serum isn&#x27;t really a conditioner, so I try to use both. If I only used the serum, I&#x27;d have a hard time combing through my wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used this product or another silicone-based product before, I&#x27;d encourage you to also buy a clarifying shampoo and use it once a week or so. The silicone builds up on your hair, and so every now and then you need a clarifying shampoo to remove the build-up. If I don&#x27;t use one, my hair starts to get really flat and loses all shine. I have been using Pantene&#x27;s Ice Shine shampoo, and that works very well as a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> This serum is great, it&#x27;s not heavy and I can feel the soft, frizz free difference when I use this to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I got a free sample from another retailer, and was hooked after the first use.  I simply squished a small amount into the palms of my hands and lightly applied to my severely over-processed hair.  There is no product buildup at all.  My hair was instantly softer and very manageable.  It didn&#x27;t provide a lot of gloss-I wasn&#x27;t looking for that.  It made my hair look naturally healthy, very manageable, and not weighed down.  It&#x27;s everything I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Bleached blonde hair in the sun and sea all the time. I make sure to cover my hair with UV screens while going to the beach nearly everyday in the summer. Hats and conditioners work- but this stuff is what really made my hair shine. I put it on after showers or on dry hair when the humidity decides to give me a crappy makeover. A little dab when dry, a few pumps when wet. focus on the ends and then brush. So impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the other Frieda serums- this one was the best for my straight, fine, limp, bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product only a couple of weeks back and used it a few times. This is the first hair protecting product I&#x27;ve tried before ironing my hair, and it does seem to work well! My hair is really oily and I need to wash it once every 2 days. After washing my hair I squirted about 3/4 pump full of the product onto my palm, and massaged it into my semi-damp hair, without touching my scalp. Then I finger combed my hair and ironed it. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or dull. I also walked in the rain the other day and my hair stayed straight even after that(it used to curl up super rapidly even if I walked through a fog!!). I like this product and it seems to work fine for me(oily, wavy, soft hair type). If it works the same way, then I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> helps with frizz, love this product, good price too. I can recommend it to anyone who has this problem with hair</li>
            <li> love this product use it everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This product is great, i put it onevery morning on my damp hair. The result is frizz free naturally curly hair for the rest of the day. Yeay</li>
            <li> Does what it promissed to do. My daughter likes this product a lot, uses on her slightly damaged by dye ends. Her hair is very long, thick and curly, and this serum tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  It is light, and it makes your color darker and vibrant.  In the middle of the day, a little bit revives your hair.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Read a review on this product and it was highly praised for effectiveness and price. Works much better than I expected. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and I want what I do have to look as nice as possible and this is just the product. Simple to use and very effective. They also manufacture a much stronger hold and it&#x27;s a bit too much for my hair but it works well in much smaller amounts. Use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Very thin consistency, expected thicker. Didn&#x27;t add shine. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Helps keep me from burning my hair. I like it. I tend to overdo it with the hot iron so this helps to protect my hair. I recommend this product. Cheaper than chi products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works so well on my frizzy, puffy hair. I keep it on my sink and use it daily. I have long hair and just one pump works to keep the fly-aways down. Love it!</li>
            <li> this product worked well.  I didnt realize that I needed something to give me volume AND shine and protection.  So the product worked well.</li>
            <li> Cannot be happier with John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz-Ease - especially Expert Finish!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to order frequently - as my hair is Very Thick and Mane like ....AND gets out of control easily! Nothing works like John Frieda Frizz-Ease Expert Finish Polishing! Nothing works like John Frieda Frizz-Ease!!!!</li>
            <li> It protects my hair from the heat, like it says. I flat iron my hair nearly everyday and I haven&#x27;t seen any heat damage signs on my hair thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I had REALLY bad frizzing with my eurasian hair. I used this bad boy twice, didnt have a problem again. Staple product from now on to control frizz. A little goes a long way. I barely used much when it was wet.</li>
