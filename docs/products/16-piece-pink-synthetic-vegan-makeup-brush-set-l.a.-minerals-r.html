            <li>Could not imagine finding ones I loved more nor</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re cute &amp; decent for the price but not the best.  </li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t get over them and their adorable too</li>
            <li>so when I read a review that someone thought they were barbie brushes I thought that was HILARIOUS</li>
            <li>Great buy and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I love these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the feel of these brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has all the basic brushes and nothing more, so it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>These are cute brushes.</li>

            <li>I was hoping to find vegan brushes and these are absolutely wonderful and they&#x27;re pink which I love.</li>
            <li>Thank you to the other reviewers for taking the time to write your reviews and convincing me to buy this great set!</li>
            <li>Loved them so much I ordered another set for myself.</li>
            <li>One downside for me was that they did not come with a case, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>they must be used to those huge paint brushes</li>
            <li>They spread the makeup evenly and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty and make putting on your makeup even more fun!  </li>
            <li>I have also found that they wash  beautifully if I just shampoo them once or twice a week and let them air dry</li>
            <li>I love to take pride in my makeup and these brushes certainly help.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to spend $60.00 on makeup brushes, but these were just too cute for me to pass up.</li>
            <li>Not only are they very cute</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the brushes are very soft and there are so many options to cover any application need.</li>
            <li>Plus it comes with a cute little pink bag that makes this set awesome for travelling.</li>
            <li>For a little more than buying my 2 or 3 brushes individually I was able to get this whole set, it&#x27;s a really great deal.</li>
            <li>The texture is so soft and I love the fact that they are a vegan product.</li>
            <li>and I love that they are \\&quot;Vegan\\&quot; but still feel like natural hair.</li>
            <li>There are so many different ones and they are full size</li>
            <li>My main concern was how soft they would be since most of the brushes I have hurt my face when I use them.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I&#x27;ve worked for many \\&quot;high end\\&quot; department store cosmetic companies.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty though.</li>
            <li>This set is so pretty</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about ordering these brushes for my sister-but they are amazing.</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>This will also make them much easier to clean, so they will last longer.</li>
            <li>Been using them now for some time and for the most part the shedding is minimal and they are very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>A well balanced, soft, sturdy and a pretty all-inclusive set.</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>I wanted a whole new matching set</li>
            <li>The flat top powder brush is like very tiny.</li>
            <li>I loved that they were pink and vegan, because a lot of other brushes test and harm animals.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else has said, they are very soft.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re also very soft and pick up the makeup quite well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft.</li>
            <li>They are SO soft!  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so unbelievably soft!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m Ecstatic with my purchase [...]</li>
            <li>They are so soft and functional.</li>
            <li>They really are so soft just like the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great even though it seemed like it took forever (only because I wanted them so bad) but they arrived 3 days before the estimated date</li>
            <li>only problem is brushes get dirty easy foundation nd concealer dnt really wash out well really soft</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used an Amazon gift card to purchase these brushes for myself for my birthday and I am so happy with them!  They are SO soft!  They have not shed a bit and they look great too. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use the mascara spoolie but I know I&#x27;ll use the rest of the brushes.  I&#x27;ve already used most of them and love them.  They are very pretty and make putting on your makeup even more fun!  There is a great assortment of brush types and sizes- one for every need!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so very small I thought I had the wrong order at first. They look like barbie toy brushes. They are soft but too small so I did not even use them. The flat top powder brush is like very tiny. The bristles of all the brushes are not dense. The color is pretty though. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its really great I love it and it makes such a difference in my make up. It goes on smoother does not shed. Anyone who is a perfectionist about their looks and makeup should get a great set of brushes. I love to take pride in my makeup and these brushes certainly help. They spread the makeup evenly and smooth.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail. My main concern was how soft they would be since most of the brushes I have hurt my face when I use them. I took the chance anyway, and I am so happy I did[...]  These brushes are so unbelievably soft! I can&#x27;t get over them and their adorable too, they look so great on my vanity[...]    Shipping was great even though it seemed like it took forever (only because I wanted them so bad) but they arrived 3 days before the estimated date so I was very happy with that.    The packaging even came with a guide showing which brush is which, and how to wash them.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wash them yet but as soon as I do I&#x27;ll leave another review on that.  So far I&#x27;m Ecstatic with my purchase [...]</li>
            <li> These brushes look so great on my desk, there fun to use as well. The only downside is all the eyeshadow brushes are not very good for blending because they all have flat heads, like a concealer brush.</li>
            <li> I actually just got these in the mail today. I was very hesitant to spend $60.00 on makeup brushes, but these were just too cute for me to pass up. Like everyone else has said, they are very soft. They come with a paper telling you which brush is which, which can be helpful for people who don&#x27;t know the difference between the different brushes yet. One downside for me was that they did not come with a case, but that&#x27;s fine. The quality of these are awesome, and they blend well. &#x3D;] Hope this helps anyone considering ordering them!</li>
            <li> These are the softest, most adorable set of brushes I have ever seen! Could not imagine finding ones I loved more nor did I ever think I could love makeup brushes! There are so many different ones and they are full size so when I read a review that someone thought they were barbie brushes I thought that was HILARIOUS bc they must be used to those huge paint brushes hahaha. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and would like to get a backup set in case they ever stop making them. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> great brushes got here fine with paper that shows what brush is for what. only problem is brushes get dirty easy foundation nd concealer dnt really wash out well really soft</li>
            <li> I purchased these because they were pink and affordable. They are so soft and functional. Great buy and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love these makeup brushes. Not only are they very cute but they&#x27;re also very soft and pick up the makeup quite well. I have also found that they wash  beautifully if I just shampoo them once or twice a week and let them air dry</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the feel of these brushes. The texture is so soft and I love the fact that they are a vegan product. The seller was great and everything came on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year and these still look beautiful.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and beautiful. I love them, and the price were not so bad. I loved that they were pink and vegan, because a lot of other brushes test and harm animals.</li>
            <li> I decided to pick this set ups rather than spend a ton of money on some of the other sets out there. For the price, these are awesome.  A well balanced, soft, sturdy and a pretty all-inclusive set.</li>
            <li> I had been looking to replace a couple of my makeup brushes and happened upon this set. For a little more than buying my 2 or 3 brushes individually I was able to get this whole set, it&#x27;s a really great deal. I was hoping to find vegan brushes and these are absolutely wonderful and they&#x27;re pink which I love. The quality of these are great, I think I use all of them except the mascara one. They really are so soft just like the other reviewers said. Thank you to the other reviewers for taking the time to write your reviews and convincing me to buy this great set!</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft and pretty. I only wish I had received some authenticity receipt stating that these brushes are, in fact, vegan. I wish the company had sent a case for the brushes. They&#x27;re just lying around in a pile getting dirty and no cleaning instructions were included. Great brushes, but I&#x27;d rather buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This set is so pretty I almost did not want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It has all the basic brushes and nothing more, so it&#x27;s perfect.  Plus it comes with a cute little pink bag that makes this set awesome for travelling.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets; one for a birthday gift and one for me. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the brushes are very soft and there are so many options to cover any application need. They seem to be well made and I love that they are \\&quot;Vegan\\&quot; but still feel like natural hair. This will also make them much easier to clean, so they will last longer. There&#x27;s a nice bag, made just for carrying brushes, that will protect them on the go, too! This is a very nice set and the vendor was very quick to deliver them. I would recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Me loves these! Great Quality. No Complaints. Been using them now for some time and for the most part the shedding is minimal and they are very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I&#x27;ve worked for many \\&quot;high end\\&quot; department store cosmetic companies. I was a little worried about ordering these brushes for my sister-but they are amazing. Everything you need for your every day makeup. Loved them so much I ordered another set for myself. They are the same size as average makeup brushes. You will not be disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> These are cute brushes. They work well too. They&#x27;re very soft. I haven&#x27;t had any of the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; fall out yet either (had them for a year &amp; still in great condition). Would recommend.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute &amp; decent for the price but not the best.  I wanted a whole new matching set but I&#x27;ve had better brushes and probably wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
