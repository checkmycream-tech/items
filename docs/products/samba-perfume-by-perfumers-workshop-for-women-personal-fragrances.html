            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>If sexy had a smell it would smell like Samba!</li>
            <li>Amazingly I found it on Amazon (who am I kidding-</li>
            <li>ALWAYS loved this parfume :-)</li>
            <li>But everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, hence, perfume can smell great on one person and not-so- great on another.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to be able to find whats left of this great scent (which suits my taste</li>
            <li>The price was very cheap.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite perfume when I was 16.</li>
            <li>I use to wear this year&#x27;s ago and this smells better than I remember and my family and friends think so too :-)</li>
            <li>it s OK</li>
            <li>I have not seen this fragrance in stores for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfume to wear.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t  beat the price on amazon, very inexpensive and leaves you smelling great.</li>
            <li>Anyways I&#x27;m glad with this product :)</li>
            <li>I just love the floral fragrance and it lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this based on all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Lasts longer than most perfumes...</li>
            <li>Perfume smells good after a while but smells strong when applied right away</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to get what I could find via Amazon.</li>
            <li>I still love the smell - not too strong, not too light.  </li>
            <li>I have loved Samba perfume since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I just received my order from Amazon, and it smells just like I remember from back then, a beautiful fruity floral.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it smells very cheap and like something a 13 year old would wear.</li>
            <li>For the price this is a huge bottle of fragrance.</li>
            <li>This perfume is cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li>so I was thrilled when I found it at Amazon.com - and for a decent price too.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;nothing special..</li>
            <li>I took a chance with this very reasonably-priced perfume, due to great customer reviews and the fact that I have several of the Perfumer&#x27;s Workshop Tea Rose fragrances (Rose, Jasmin, Amber) that I really enjoy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and and full of vibrance.</li>
            <li>seller was quick to send out my order</li>
            <li>Love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It is sweet and fresh at the same time, i just love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My nose is very sensitive but this scent is very light.</li>
            <li>Fun scent.</li>
            <li>, I am very pleased to have it back again, thanks!</li>
            <li>Not a scent I would wear today, but the purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li>It really smells very good is not a   strong scent.</li>
            <li>The best part was that the fragrance did not become rancid or odd-smelling due to age, and smelled the same as it always had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Amazon is okay about shipping it to YOU, but you can&#x27;t ship it back to THEM, because, all of a sudden, it&#x27;s hazardous to send it through the mail.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the perfume is very nice, but when I recieved the bottle the blue paint on the outside was chipped and fading.</li>
            <li>This perfume takes me back to my high school days when this first became popular.</li>
            <li>I found this perfume back in the 90&#x27;s and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>exactly like it did eons ago when i was a teenager.</li>
            <li>That being said I would not make a first impression with samba</li>
            <li>I could smell the good scent slightly in the background but the spoiled smell took over the whole scent.</li>
            <li>Very clean, maybe a little flowery &amp; light.</li>
            <li>this has no scent at all,is like an air spray it smells good for a while but doesn&#x27;t last long at all, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this particular Samba Eau de Toilette and was so sad to see my favorite &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; fragrance disappear.</li>
            <li>Arrived today and I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li>I wet my hand with water and tapped the area where perfume was applied to make it smell softer and it smells better.</li>
            <li>I own tons of perfumes but this is the only one i would use daily!</li>
            <li>and I found that it smells much better later than when sprayed on as I find it little strong.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised to receive it so fast!</li>
            <li>It is composed of a  light floral scent and it lasts for a very long time on the body.</li>
            <li>my teenage years and used to love it back then.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this purfume.</li>
            <li>but I threw it away after one spray because it wasn&#x27;t worth the shipping to send it back.</li>
            <li>Not the normal type of scent that I would have in my perfume collection.</li>
            <li>Ordered on Dec 9th and received it on the 11th very surprised BC estimated date to be received was from dec15 to the 18th...</li>
            <li>I have spent more on far worse fragrance than this one, in fact I put samba in my top 5 under 20 bucks which includes Brittney Spears believe, and curve kicks/curve wave.</li>
            <li>I had a small bottle back in junior high around 1990, and it was always one of my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I am the only person they know that carries a whole bottle of perfume in thier bag.</li>
            <li>The small brought back so many memories.</li>
            <li>While I prefer to be the only one that wears this scent, I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a clear bottle with blue paint on it.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s fine for casual use.</li>
            <li> I had this perfume for a long time ago</li>
            <li> A basic fruity scent, with not much else to it.  </li>
            <li> but this is a strangely floral musk with a touch of vanilla that is hidden but enhances the musk.  </li>
            <li> I think this particular bottle was possibly spoiled, it had a really bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> But not familiar with the scent I remember</li>
            <li> but I could not enjoy it because I lost it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells really awful</li>

            <li> One of the best perfumes I ever owned!!!</li>
            <li> My mother asked me to order this samba perfume for her. It really smells very good is not a   strong scent. The price was very cheap.</li>
            <li> It smells brilliantly very good</li>
            <li> I have loved Samba perfume since I was in high school. I still love the smell - not too strong, not too light.  It&#x27;s very hard to find so I was thrilled when I found it at Amazon.com - and for a decent price too.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this 20 years ago. I bought it for nostalgia...I forgot how great it smells! Fun scent.</li>
            <li> I had this perfume for a long time ago but I could not enjoy it because I lost it , I am very pleased to have it back again, thanks!</li>
            <li> this has no scent at all,is like an air spray it smells good for a while but doesn&#x27;t last long at all, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Granted, one shouldn&#x27;t buy perfume online without having tried it/smelled it on self or another person.  I took a chance with this very reasonably-priced perfume, due to great customer reviews and the fact that I have several of the Perfumer&#x27;s Workshop Tea Rose fragrances (Rose, Jasmin, Amber) that I really enjoy.  But everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, hence, perfume can smell great on one person and not-so- great on another.  This smells like a disinfectant cleaner on me - a combination of ammonia and citrus.  Not flattering.  But I couldn&#x27;t return it - for some reason, Amazon is okay about shipping it to YOU, but you can&#x27;t ship it back to THEM, because, all of a sudden, it&#x27;s hazardous to send it through the mail.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume is very nice, but when I recieved the bottle the blue paint on the outside was chipped and fading. The bottle is a clear bottle with blue paint on it. This perfume takes me back to my high school days when this first became popular. The smell is sweet and and full of vibrance. I like the perfume, just not the packaging.</li>
            <li> Arrived today and I really like this cologne. Thank you...</li>
            <li> I found this perfume back in the 90&#x27;s and fell in love with it.  Then...it disappeared.  Amazingly I found it on Amazon (who am I kidding- you can find everything on Amazon).  I cannot wear florals but this is a strangely floral musk with a touch of vanilla that is hidden but enhances the musk.  While I prefer to be the only one that wears this scent, I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS loved this parfume :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome, came packaged in all the original packaging, smells exactly like it did eons ago when i was a teenager. Love!</li>
            <li> This perfume is cheap for a reason.  It smells really awful but I threw it away after one spray because it wasn&#x27;t worth the shipping to send it back.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite perfume when I was 16. The small brought back so many memories. Not a scent I would wear today, but the purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great value. For less than $10, you get a 3.3 oz decent perfume for every day use. My wife uses this often and I found that it smells much better later than when sprayed on as I find it little strong.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this perfume but unfortunately I was disappointed. I remember this from the 90&#x27;s/my teenage years and used to love it back then. I think this particular bottle was possibly spoiled, it had a really bad smell to it. I could smell the good scent slightly in the background but the spoiled smell took over the whole scent. I am hoping that I can be refunded. I just learned today that perfumes can not be returned.</li>
            <li> I wish they did a handbag size of this... Cause i take mine everywhere... My friend joke I am the only person they know that carries a whole bottle of perfume in thier bag.</li>
            <li> I own tons of perfumes but this is the only one i would use daily! My nose is very sensitive but this scent is very light. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use to wear this year&#x27;s ago and this smells better than I remember and my family and friends think so too :-)</li>
            <li> it s OK&lt;br /&gt;nothing special..</li>
            <li> For the price this is a huge bottle of fragrance. It&#x27;s eau de toilette which is a step up from cologne. I use a lot of fragrance so to save money I use a cheaper one after I shower or just hanging around the house and I use my Michael Kors or Gucci to go out or for work. That being said I would not make a first impression with samba but it&#x27;s fine for casual use. I have spent more on far worse fragrance than this one, in fact I put samba in my top 5 under 20 bucks which includes Brittney Spears believe, and curve kicks/curve wave.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom.  She loves it and it is her go to daily perfume.</li>
            <li> I have not seen this fragrance in stores for many, many years.  I had a small bottle back in junior high around 1990, and it was always one of my favorite scent.  I just received my order from Amazon, and it smells just like I remember from back then, a beautiful fruity floral.  I didn&#x27;t even know this fragrance was still made!  I&#x27;m a very happy Amazon shopper right now.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It is sweet and fresh at the same time, i just love it!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> If sexy had a smell it would smell like Samba! My girl can wear it for work or hitting the town and she always gets a comment how good she smells!</li>
            <li> My wife bought 3 Samba perfumes and this is really a nice smelling perfume, and great value. They shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li> nice scent and a great price</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfume to wear. It is composed of a  light floral scent and it lasts for a very long time on the body. You can&#x27;t  beat the price on amazon, very inexpensive and leaves you smelling great. Every time I wear this perfume, I get a lot of compliments.  If you are looking for a perfume that smells great without breaking the bank, please give samba a try. I highly recommend this purfume.</li>

I&#x27;m so happy to be able to find whats left of this great scent (which suits my taste perfectly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if I can only find another discontinued fragrance that used to sell at bath and body... I&#x27;d be even happier!</li>
            <li> Ordered on Dec 9th and received it on the 11th very surprised BC estimated date to be received was from dec15 to the 18th... Perfume smells good after a while but smells strong when applied right away so I recommend just to spray a Lil bit . I wet my hand with water and tapped the area where perfume was applied to make it smell softer and it smells better. I can smell myself. But not familiar with the scent I remember when it 1st came out the smell to be like grapes...Anyways I&#x27;m glad with this product :)</li>
            <li> This is the only Samba fragrance I have ever used since it came out in 1987.  I just love the floral fragrance and it lasts for hours.  I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this based on all the great reviews.  Honestly, it smells very cheap and like something a 13 year old would wear. A basic fruity scent, with not much else to it.  It&#x27;s alright, but not something I would ever purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good Smell, will recommend and buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not what I had imagined at all. But having said that, I would compare this to an ocean breeze type scent. Very clean, maybe a little flowery &amp; light. Not the normal type of scent that I would have in my perfume collection. However, I like that its so different that any thing else I have. I would recommend this highly- especially considering the price on this item. Lasts longer than most perfumes... the scent tends to stay on for about 3 hours with just one or two squirts.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> A gift for a friend, and she loves it.</li>
