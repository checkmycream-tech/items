            <li>It smells nice,</li>
            <li>but the product is really good love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>The shampoo sudses nicely.</li>
            <li>More cost effective</li>
            <li>it lathers beautifully, and most importantly, it makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
            <li>This hair system is amazing for my fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I tried many sets but had no luck.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>it worked even better than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>what I love about this one is that it works well on all hair types.</li>
            <li>This is yet another product that I love.  </li>
            <li>It seems that the more you use this product, the better your hair feels and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>I have to spend about 10 minutes brushing it out because it almost seemed to make my hair more tangled.</li>
            <li>like I had more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was not quite sure why, but then I read about the strengthening effects of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I think you will fall in love with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>love it but with the price i have to consider buying again.</li>
            <li>Ok I can not begin to tell you what a life saver these products have been.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>interesting ingredients love packaging  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that it will get better the more I use it..</li>
            <li>originally gave the Komenuka hair care products five stars because they really are incredible.</li>
            <li>What I love about it the most is the light weight conditioner leaves your hair feeling silkly and conditioned.</li>
            <li>My hair was oily like it is when I use sulfate filled shampoos, and I kept getting too many tangles.</li>
            <li>and I have straight hair, but it doesn&#x27;t give a good detangler.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and healthy!!</li>
            <li>After trying a number of other products, they are all impressive.</li>
            <li>Also got my product very quick.</li>
            <li>and I think it is easy to manage, but there is one thing about my hair that has always bothered me.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it and my hair is soft and feels so healthy and clean!  </li>
            <li>but I have to glorify the benefits that my hair can enjoy now.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I did enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>The creams are very healing and the face washes are amazing.</li>
            <li>The best thing I loved about this shampoo &amp; conditioner was that they are so easy to rinse out; they are very light and don&#x27;t leave heavy film or weigh down the hair.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for more because it is a higher priced set.  </li>
            <li>I have thick bi-racial hair: my top hair is incredibly curly and frizzy that you would not even think of calling it curly.</li>
            <li>Super product- great conditioner for dry and frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>I have improved hair strength, silkiness, shine, and healthy scalp thanks to these products.</li>
            <li>Just remember to pay the full sticker price and order it from the Komenuka website until Amazon gets</li>
            <li>Like the results so far, and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>organics\\&quot;, \\&quot;Enjoy\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Matrix Biolage\\&quot; hair products that I am loyal to.</li>
            <li>From the first time that I have used the shampoo and conditioner my hair has literally made a huge transformation.</li>
            <li>If you have the budget for fancier hair care products, this one is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>For me this shampoo and conditioner is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this product leaves my hair soft and silky, it feels like it has more body.</li>
            <li>I love this brand because how natural and moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the conditioner is as moisturizing as some, but worth using products that don&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>but hopefully it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this set, and I love how may hair feels so much plumper once first washed and styled but later</li>
            <li>They are still the only products that I&#x27;m not sensitive to, and I love how good my hair looks when I use them.</li>
            <li>Very, very luxurious.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is by far the best hair care line besides \\&quot;Phyto</li>
            <li>The mild dandruff I had will become more exacerbated by the products, and the doctors&#x27; dandruff shampoos will make it more serious than it was.</li>
            <li>I went online and saw this product in Amazon when it was the first time it had come out with no reviews.</li>
            <li>I first learned about this line of products at Gavnier Aletier in Santa Monica 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>This makes it all the more a shame that the following is true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, for those who like to play it safe, this is information you&#x27;ll likely want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than any Western product-</li>
            <li>You will certainly want to come back for more.</li>
            <li>right now I would say that there are other products out there at this price range that perform much better..</li>
            <li>Body - especially if you have fine hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a clean wash and the hair keeps clean longer than any other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>both of these products are extremely gentle, very hydrating.</li>
            <li>This is not the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If this one didn&#x27;t work, I was ready to suffer forever.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>My hair also felt so much cleaner and silky as if there was no build up</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the hair the way other harsh shampoos do and I&#x27;m very impressed with the natural ingredients cleaning my hair so well.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high but so worth it for healthy hair transformation.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it always comes on time, sealed and is the exact same type from the last time I ordered</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, for those who haven&#x27;t purchased it, a full ingredients list is available on the parent company&#x27;s Japanese website, albeit in Japanese.</li>
            <li>Before trying Komenuka Bijin, I had tried every brand store shampoo/conditioner (from economical to high end: Loreal, Head and Shoulders, Herbal Essence, Nexus, Kerastase, Phyto, Pureology ), natural remedies and shampoos/conditioners there was.</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny and soft after the first wash.</li>
            <li>These products improved my hair&#x27;s texture and made it look much healthier, even with the fact that I live in a semi-arid environment.</li>
            <li>Most likely NOT the same ingredients it claims to have.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much of a change in my hair from this shampoo and condition when I got some samples in the mail, but I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>it made my hair nice and soft, it doesnt get curly, its not easy to keep buying at this price</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!I&#x27;ve used every shampoo that you have probaly tried and</li>
            <li>It pays off to pay a little more for your shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I took a break and tried a new one, but then came right back.</li>
            <li>As a test, I ordered a new bottle from the Komenuka website.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on the reviews, realizing some appeared to be fake, but many seemed genuine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in trying Komenuka, I would definitely suggest you do!</li>
            <li>The conditioner, I first used it on my roots when I first started using it since I needed deep conditioning; now I only need my ends.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on and off - experimenting with new hair products that come on the market - and so far, none of them can compete with Komenuka.</li>
            <li>I do admit that your hair needs to be thoroughly wet if you are the type to like more lather, although bubbles just mean you used more than enough for clarifying and cleansing.  </li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin, and it has completely relieved his dandruff.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but seeing that the Japanese are known for having gorgeous hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally very stringy, fine, dull.</li>
            <li>I have thin/fine hair and have never found a brand that works and makes my hair soft, yet not greasy.  </li>
            <li>the products have natural feeling and smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tsubaki brand of shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair incredibly soft and manageable, but..</li>
            <li>This ingredient was used extensively by cosmetics manufacturers, and particularly in shampoo because it helps it to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stylist applied it, and I could not believe the extend of transformation - my naturally blond, a little weak, European hair was smooth, silky and healthy.     </li>
            <li>While some natural remedies and shampoos would help (aloe, olive oil, avocado, emu, tea tree oil), this aid was only temporary.</li>
            <li>- I have been experimenting with different amounts and styling products as I really want to love this because its so expensive..</li>
            <li>The price is a little high, but a little does goes a long way and it has made my hair better than ever.</li>
            <li>The bottles are slightly different shades of pale yellow, and the true Komenuka bottle has very clear script on it while the knock of looks like an image that was probably scanned and is much less clear.</li>
            <li>actually does bother me is the apparent attempt to hide this ingredient by its distributors in the US.</li>
            <li>At first it was just a passing thought, but after a few weeks it became my suspicion that the products had changed somehow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all natural shampoos/conditioners before, and though there was no itch, my hair was always dry and had split ends.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the original shampoo &amp; conditioner for years and love it, however, this new shampoo is terrible!</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this!I&#x27;ve used every shampoo that you have probaly tried and</li>
            <li> It pays off to pay a little more for your shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I took a break and tried a new one, but then came right back.</li>
            <li> As a test, I ordered a new bottle from the Komenuka website.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews, realizing some appeared to be fake, but many seemed genuine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in trying Komenuka, I would definitely suggest you do!</li>
            <li> The conditioner, I first used it on my roots when I first started using it since I needed deep conditioning; now I only need my ends.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and off - experimenting with new hair products that come on the market - and so far, none of them can compete with Komenuka.</li>
            <li> I do admit that your hair needs to be thoroughly wet if you are the type to like more lather, although bubbles just mean you used more than enough for clarifying and cleansing.  </li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin, and it has completely relieved his dandruff.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but seeing that the Japanese are known for having gorgeous hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally very stringy, fine, dull.</li>
            <li> I have thin/fine hair and have never found a brand that works and makes my hair soft, yet not greasy.  </li>
            <li> the products have natural feeling and smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tsubaki brand of shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair incredibly soft and manageable, but..</li>
            <li> This ingredient was used extensively by cosmetics manufacturers, and particularly in shampoo because it helps it to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stylist applied it, and I could not believe the extend of transformation - my naturally blond, a little weak, European hair was smooth, silky and healthy.     </li>
            <li> While some natural remedies and shampoos would help (aloe, olive oil, avocado, emu, tea tree oil), this aid was only temporary.</li>
            <li> - I have been experimenting with different amounts and styling products as I really want to love this because its so expensive..</li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but a little does goes a long way and it has made my hair better than ever.</li>
            <li> The bottles are slightly different shades of pale yellow, and the true Komenuka bottle has very clear script on it while the knock of looks like an image that was probably scanned and is much less clear.</li>
            <li> actually does bother me is the apparent attempt to hide this ingredient by its distributors in the US.</li>
            <li> At first it was just a passing thought, but after a few weeks it became my suspicion that the products had changed somehow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all natural shampoos/conditioners before, and though there was no itch, my hair was always dry and had split ends.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the original shampoo &amp; conditioner for years and love it, however, this new shampoo is terrible!</li>
            <li> when I let down my hair after it was dry it felt so much thicker and almost</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain what makes a shampoo different than all the rest, but this one really is nicer than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shine and feel like new everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo and conditioner for the last month and it has done nothing but make my hair dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> , I expected the bottles to be larger than they are.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair</li>
            <li> On several sites selling the shampoo (Cocamide DEA is not in the treatment/conditioner), they do not accurately list the ingredient mentioned clearly as Cocamide DEA (コカミドＤＥＡ) but mere \\&quot;coconut oil derivatives\\&quot;, and those sound a hell of a lot less intimidating, don&#x27;t they?</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time yesterday and it was no better or worse then any other (much cheaper) shampoo/conditioner I have tried.</li>
            <li> If your hair is really dry and damaged, this will fix it.</li>
            <li> I do not use any products in my hair other than shampoo &amp; conditioner, and I do not blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, admittedly, the evidence is fairly thin at this point (hence \\&quot;possible\\&quot;), and I myself am not concerned enough to stop using my set early or anything like that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients in Shampoo: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in Conditioner: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb, Natural Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is relatively expensive, I may have to alternate it with other shampoos and conditioners, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> To see if anyone else felt the same way as I did, I read recent bad reviews and found one that warned that this is not the real product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very, very luxurious. A little expensive but for my needs well worth it. I am a post chemo patient and my hair was a wreck in every way imaginable. I tried many sets but had no luck. This product meets or exceeds it&#x27;s claim as a &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; set.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes your hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Smells good too. Also got my product very quick. I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> both of these products are extremely gentle, very hydrating. The best thing I loved about this shampoo &amp; conditioner was that they are so easy to rinse out; they are very light and don&#x27;t leave heavy film or weigh down the hair.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002DP5AA Komenuka Bijin Premium Hair Care Set: Moisturizing Hair Shampoo &amp; Hair Treatment / Conditioner]]  I used this shampoo/conditioner 10 years ago. It was the best shampoo and conditioner that I had ever used. I found it on Amazon and ordered it immediately. It makes your hair feel like silk. It is the BEST I have ever found.</li>
            <li> As a biracial Asian and African American woman it has been so difficult to find a line of hair care that can satisfy the needs of my hair. I have long, thick, curly/wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and I found this line at the local beauty store. I was skeptical at first but seeing that the Japanese are known for having gorgeous hair I figured it would work for me. Thank goodness it worked... it worked even better than I had anticipated. I am ECSTATIC about the shampoo and conditioner, and it has ended my search for \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and \\&quot;earth- friendly\\&quot; products. It has a nice scent and lather without those parabens and sulfates. From the first time that I have used the shampoo and conditioner my hair has literally made a huge transformation. I know it sounds corny and hyped up but I have to glorify the benefits that my hair can enjoy now. My hair has grown longer and dandruff has disappeared. My hair used to be shoulder length and now it has grown mid- back length. Seriously, this is by far the best hair care line besides \\&quot;Phyto organics\\&quot;, \\&quot;Enjoy\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Matrix Biolage\\&quot; hair products that I am loyal to. The price is a little high but so worth it for healthy hair transformation. I have improved hair strength, silkiness, shine, and healthy scalp thanks to these products. THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> I have Mediterranean type hair, which is often thick, curled...and frizzy. These products improved my hair&#x27;s texture and made it look much healthier, even with the fact that I live in a semi-arid environment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!I&#x27;ve used every shampoo that you have probaly tried and what I love about this one is that it works well on all hair types.My hair type is thick and wavy to my waist.What I love about it the most is the light weight conditioner leaves your hair feeling silkly and conditioned.</li>
            <li> *Updated Review*&lt;br /&gt;Beware! This is not the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave the Komenuka hair care products five stars because they really are incredible. They are still the only products that I&#x27;m not sensitive to, and I love how good my hair looks when I use them. However, I recently started feeling like I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results. My hair was oily like it is when I use sulfate filled shampoos, and I kept getting too many tangles. At first it was just a passing thought, but after a few weeks it became my suspicion that the products had changed somehow. To see if anyone else felt the same way as I did, I read recent bad reviews and found one that warned that this is not the real product! The reviewer had called Komenuka and learned that they can&#x27;t make it and sell it for less than the steep $28 per bottle price tag, so whatever is being sold at discounted prices isn&#x27;t their product. As a test, I ordered a new bottle from the Komenuka website. The differences are subtle, but there. The bottles are slightly different shades of pale yellow, and the true Komenuka bottle has very clear script on it while the knock of looks like an image that was probably scanned and is much less clear. Who knows where this is being made or what&#x27;s in it? Most likely NOT the same ingredients it claims to have. If you&#x27;re interested in trying Komenuka, I would definitely suggest you do! Just remember to pay the full sticker price and order it from the Komenuka website until Amazon gets this figured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Old Review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a price tag of $50, I expected the bottles to be larger than they are. Note that the shampoo is only 11 oz. and the conditioner is only 7.7 oz. That&#x27;s a little on the expensive side, but I decided to give the product a try anyway... and now I&#x27;m hooked! It&#x27;s hard to explain what makes a shampoo different than all the rest, but this one really is nicer than anything I have ever tried. It smells nice, it lathers beautifully, and most importantly, it makes my hair look fantastic. My husband picked it up in the shower and now he&#x27;s hooked, too! He has very sensitive skin, and it has completely relieved his dandruff. Regarding hair types, I have fine blonde hair that is often made flat and boring with conditioner, and he has corse, black hair that gets frizzy when dried out by shampoo. Komenuka works beautifully for the both of us. If you have the budget for fancier hair care products, this one is worth a shot. If you don&#x27;t have the budget, don&#x27;t even try it. You will certainly want to come back for more.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that has truly benefited my hair. I have thick bi-racial hair: my top hair is incredibly curly and frizzy that you would not even think of calling it curly. Midway, my hair is straight but suffers from frizz and poofiness. Even the hairdressers I go to always ask about this peculiarity, but, alas, nothing to do about the genes!    Before trying Komenuka Bijin, I had tried every brand store shampoo/conditioner (from economical to high end: Loreal, Head and Shoulders, Herbal Essence, Nexus, Kerastase, Phyto, Pureology ), natural remedies and shampoos/conditioners there was. I was tired of my hair: dry, frizzy, poofy. While some natural remedies and shampoos would help (aloe, olive oil, avocado, emu, tea tree oil), this aid was only temporary. The mild dandruff I had will become more exacerbated by the products, and the doctors&#x27; dandruff shampoos will make it more serious than it was. I went online and saw this product in Amazon when it was the first time it had come out with no reviews. If this one didn&#x27;t work, I was ready to suffer forever. However, I am here reviewing and thank you, rice bran and Komenuka Bijin! My hair was shiny and soft after the first wash. My dandruff receded dramatically. Six months after using it, my split ends were not as common as every two weeks.     For me this shampoo and conditioner is worth the price. Both last me six months as I only need a dime size to a quarter size depending on hair length. I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair every day since that will make my scalp itchier, so once every three days it works. I do admit that your hair needs to be thoroughly wet if you are the type to like more lather, although bubbles just mean you used more than enough for clarifying and cleansing.  The conditioner, I first used it on my roots when I first started using it since I needed deep conditioning; now I only need my ends. On a side note, I started using the keratin treatment a year ago for my bi-racial hair, and this shampoo and conditioner is perfect. No sulfates (or parabens), no need to buy after care keratin products. Komenuka Bijin Shampoo and Conditioner is a winner and keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that asian women have figured out the secret when it comes to skin care and hair products.  This is yet another product that I love.  I have thin/fine hair and have never found a brand that works and makes my hair soft, yet not greasy.  But the set instead of individually. More cost effective</li>
            <li> I thought the ad for this said it contained no fake perfumes or bad chemicals, but it smells like a chemical factory, both the shampoo and the conditioner.  See my review of the Komenuka Bijin NSK products if you want a Rice Bran shampoo and conditioner that are not chemical-laden.</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo and conditioner for the last month and it has done nothing but make my hair dry and unmanageable.  I have wavy hair that is now frizzy from this stuff.  I had hoped for more because it is a higher priced set.  However, it has let me down.  Since I cannot return it (because it was opened and used), I will not be \\&quot;trying out\\&quot; any other beauty products from this site.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews, realizing some appeared to be fake, but many seemed genuine. I have long, thick, course hair and am always searching for something to soften my hair. Tried this for the first time yesterday and it was no better or worse then any other (much cheaper) shampoo/conditioner I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very stringy, fine, dull. The slightest level of processing or styling causes breakage. I&#x27;ve found that this product leaves my hair soft and silky, it feels like it has more body. I noticed a difference immediately. It pays off to pay a little more for your shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> the products have natural feeling and smell.  Results are shanny and bouncy.  I really like them.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner gives the hair a clean wash and the hair keeps clean longer than any other products I have used.  The only complaint I have is the price, a bit pricy.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this line of products at Gavnier Aletier in Santa Monica 10 years ago. The stylist applied it, and I could not believe the extend of transformation - my naturally blond, a little weak, European hair was smooth, silky and healthy.     I have been using this product on and off - experimenting with new hair products that come on the market - and so far, none of them can compete with Komenuka. Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a genius hair stylist or anything. i just read the reviews and took a chance on buying it for my wife. i can definitely tell the difference, and will buy her a replacement when she runs out.</li>
            <li> If your hair is really dry and damaged, this will fix it. You can use it often and it leaves your hair silky.</li>
            <li> It is great.  For years, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that would give me this result. It seems that the more you use this product, the better your hair feels and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> The best product I ever tried. I love this brand because how natural and moisturizing it is. My hair loves it too!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner.  It makes my hair shine and feel like new everyday.  The only reason for four stars is because for my hair and I have straight hair, but it doesn&#x27;t give a good detangler. I have to spend about 10 minutes brushing it out because it almost seemed to make my hair more tangled. I am not good with cosmetic products so there may be something that I missing. Anyways, I did enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tsubaki brand of shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair incredibly soft and manageable, but..it made my head itch.  Which isn&#x27;t a surprise because almost all shampoo&#x27;s make my head itch (even Head &amp; Shoulders).  I tried this and wow! No itch!!  I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it and my hair is soft and feels so healthy and clean!  I&#x27;ve used all natural shampoos/conditioners before, and though there was no itch, my hair was always dry and had split ends.  Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> When I tried the shampoo and conditioner I had no idea that the next time I went to wash my hair, it would feel completely different. I had my hair up in a bun (I had put it up to workout) and when I let down my hair after it was dry it felt so much thicker and almost like I had more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not quite sure why, but then I read about the strengthening effects of this shampoo and conditioner. My hair also felt so much cleaner and silky as if there was no build up and I had washed my hair in mountain spring water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in Shampoo: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in Conditioner: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb, Natural Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is relatively expensive, I may have to alternate it with other shampoos and conditioners, but it definitely works. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the hair the way other harsh shampoos do and I&#x27;m very impressed with the natural ingredients cleaning my hair so well. If you have fine or oily hair you may be especially impressed. You also only have to shampoo once, which saves time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results after one use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoother Texture&lt;br /&gt;Stronger Hair&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner Hair&lt;br /&gt;More Body - especially if you have fine hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying all the products with rice bran. You can order a week&#x27;s supply of this product to try. I think you will fall in love with the shampoo and conditioner. After trying a number of other products, they are all impressive. The creams are very healing and the face washes are amazing. These are some of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I gave it to my hairdresser and she started using it for her clients.  Great ingredients equals great hair.  Great</li>
            <li> I love this product and it always comes on time, sealed and is the exact same type from the last time I ordered (sometimes there are sketchy practices with beauty products).</li>
            <li> BEWARE...the shampoo is &amp;#34;reformulated&amp;#34; and is not the mosturizing shampoo in the picture! I have been using the original shampoo &amp; conditioner for years and love it, however, this new shampoo is terrible! It has even damaged my hair to the point that my hair dresser also noticed. I do not use any products in my hair other than shampoo &amp; conditioner, and I do not blow dry my hair. I could tell this shampoo was not the same as soon as it came out of the bottle. It has a different texture, and worked very differently in my hair. The shampoo also has almost exclusively Japanese writing, unlike the shampoo in the picture. If you are buying this make sure are getting the &amp;#34;mosturizing shampoo.&amp;#34; Very disappointed by this switch!</li>
            <li> love it but with the price i have to consider buying again.</li>
            <li> This hair system is amazing for my fine, wavy hair. Lots of volume and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my scalp. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that performance-wise, this shampoo and conditioner really are great - probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. This makes it all the more a shame that the following is true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Komenuka Bijin&#x27;s shampoo - like a lot of Japanese shampoo - contains a coconut oil-derived ingredient called Cocamide DEA. On the back of your shampoo bottle, look for \\&quot;コカミドＤＥＡ\\&quot;. This ingredient was used extensively by cosmetics manufacturers, and particularly in shampoo because it helps it to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Cocamide DEA is classified as a \\&quot;possible carcinogen\\&quot; by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Due to this, California law now requires that products containing this ingredient be labeled with something like \\&quot;this product contains a chemical known to the state to cause cancer and/or reproductive harm\\&quot;. Not exactly what you want to read before smearing something on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, admittedly, the evidence is fairly thin at this point (hence \\&quot;possible\\&quot;), and I myself am not concerned enough to stop using my set early or anything like that. However, for those who like to play it safe, this is information you&#x27;ll likely want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What actually does bother me is the apparent attempt to hide this ingredient by its distributors in the US. On several sites selling the shampoo (Cocamide DEA is not in the treatment/conditioner), they do not accurately list the ingredient mentioned clearly as Cocamide DEA (コカミドＤＥＡ) but mere \\&quot;coconut oil derivatives\\&quot;, and those sound a hell of a lot less intimidating, don&#x27;t they? In other words, I can&#x27;t help but wonder whether these companies are being deliberately misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, for those who haven&#x27;t purchased it, a full ingredients list is available on the parent company&#x27;s Japanese website, albeit in Japanese. Just plug it into Google Translate and see for yourself. The parent company is called Nihon Sakari.</li>
            <li> Ok I can not begin to tell you what a life saver these products have been. I had Dermatitis on my scalp and it cured it. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and healthy!! I love it.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair and I have always gotten complements on it and I think it is easy to manage, but there is one thing about my hair that has always bothered me. It is a little too oily.  I wash my hair every morning but even so by the afternoon my hair starts to get a greasy feeling and I have to put it up or else I feel gross. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much of a change in my hair from this shampoo and condition when I got some samples in the mail, but I have been pleasantly surprised. My hair is smoother then before and best of all it doesn&#x27;t get greasy feeling during the day! The price is a little high, but a little does goes a long way and it has made my hair better than ever.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner. I took a break and tried a new one, but then came right back.</li>
            <li> Super product- great conditioner for dry and frizzy hair! Better than any Western product- interesting ingredients love packaging  you won&#x27;t regret buy</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this set, and I love how may hair feels so much plumper once first washed and styled but later in they day it looks dirty..does not add shine or body - I have been experimenting with different amounts and styling products as I really want to love this because its so expensive.. I am hoping that it will get better the more I use it.. right now I would say that there are other products out there at this price range that perform much better..</li>
            <li> it made my hair nice and soft, it doesnt get curly, its not easy to keep buying at this price but the product is really good love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Just tried the products today. The shampoo sudses nicely. And the conditioner removed tangles.  Like the results so far, and the scent is nice. I don&#x27;t think the conditioner is as moisturizing as some, but worth using products that don&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals. It&#x27;s costly but hopefully it&#x27;s worth it. The products are written in Japanese. Wish they&#x27;d be in English.</li>
