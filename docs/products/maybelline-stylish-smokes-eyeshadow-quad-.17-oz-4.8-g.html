            <li>Nice eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I find that this particular group of shades is perfect for creating a lovely purple smoky eye.</li>
            <li>Love this color, nice price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably my favorite eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>- I find it&#x27;s better at night</li>
            <li>love these shades</li>
            <li>I just love smokey eyes.</li>
            <li>There is a shimmer to all these shadows, which is lovely for evening use.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup pallete.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Still feel as its better for someone under 20</li>
            <li>love these shades...</li>
            <li>I wish the colors were more sparkly.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Very rich.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeshadow brand because they are so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and they are easy to put on.</li>
            <li>The applicators are not of high quality though, if I had better brush, I bet it&#x27;d feel much better  :)</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and lasts all day</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>so i went on here and got it great price and free shipping cant beat that got here on time and wasnt damaged at all which i was a little worried about</li>
            <li>This product is decent for drugstores brand, much better than its revlon competitor.</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented.</li>
            <li>And no,  maybeline did not pay me, i&#x27;m just am average amazon shopper who gives an honest opinion. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;You could possibly wear this during the day depending on your coloring but for me - I&#x27;m very fair with blue eyes and blondish hair</li>
            <li>Economical set of purple eyeshadow but not well pigmented.  </li>
            <li>My wife love it, big size (compact at the same time) and nice materials</li>
            <li>If you want a more subtle look, these powders will come in handy.</li>
            <li>While I do spend more on products like foundation and mascara, I am a big believer in &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; eye shadow.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can wear a vivid lip color with it because usually I avoid really vivid lipsticks as I think they kind of look &amp;#34;clownish&amp;#34; on me depending on the color and sometimes they sort of make me look</li>
            <li>so it didnt last long as I expected, but the colors were very beautiful!</li>
            <li>I use these so much.  </li>
            <li>Great color palette and gives you at least three different looks.</li>
            <li>Decent quality though.</li>
            <li>I graduated high school in the &#x27;80&#x27;s -</li>
            <li>Within the past year or so I have started buying more high end</li>
            <li>best if you do thick black eyeliner for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type that blows all my disposable income on MAC and other \\&quot;high end\\&quot; makeup, but after trying these eyeshadow quads from Maybelline, I feel like a fool.  </li>
            <li>- so I&#x27;m always a little leery about purple shades but this one is modern and beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t use the black shadow and find that the white as a base with the light purple on the lid and the dark purple in the crease is perfect.</li>

            <li> Strong, pigmented colors that (if you use a primer) will last all day and are comparable to expensive eyeshadow.  </li>

            <li> All four colors compliment each other very well and allow you to create casual looks, or build to a more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the little things that come with it to put it on because then it is too dark.</li>
            <li> I found they lasted pretty well too but using a base made specifically for your eyelids made them last longer with  no smearing or gradually ending up in the crease of my eyelid like shadows sometimes</li>
            <li> I skip the white base for a less done up look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>

            <li> Great color palette and gives you at least three different looks. Also...no creases!</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadow but, It is shimmery and I thought it was matte.  If you want shimmery it is a great eyeshadow for you.</li>
            <li> I use these so much.  They&#x27;re probably my favorite eyeshadows.  I&#x27;m the type that blows all my disposable income on MAC and other \\&quot;high end\\&quot; makeup, but after trying these eyeshadow quads from Maybelline, I feel like a fool.

You get good quality products for a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay for crap you&#x27;d buy at the mall or Sephora. It&#x27;s ridiculous.  Every smokey quad has gorgeous colors.  Just buy one already!</li>
            <li> The Amethyst Smokes quad set is very nice set of colors. Very rich. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the little things that come with it to put it on because then it is too dark. But the colors are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I wore this color for prom, and every one love it! This product is decent for drugstores brand, much better than its revlon competitor. I was satisfied with it. A must buy i say. And no,  maybeline did not pay me, i&#x27;m just am average amazon shopper who gives an honest opinion. :)</li>
            <li> I graduated high school in the &#x27;80&#x27;s - the era of big hair and purple eyeshadow - so I&#x27;m always a little leery about purple shades but this one is modern and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could possibly wear this during the day depending on your coloring but for me - I&#x27;m very fair with blue eyes and blondish hair - I find it&#x27;s better at night and I love that I can wear a vivid lip color with it because usually I avoid really vivid lipsticks as I think they kind of look &amp;#34;clownish&amp;#34; on me depending on the color and sometimes they sort of make me look even paler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these shades and they are easy to put on. I found they lasted pretty well too but using a base made specifically for your eyelids made them last longer with  no smearing or gradually ending up in the crease of my eyelid like shadows sometimes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Love this color, nice price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeshadow brand because they are so easy to apply. It tells you some basic steps on ways to apply it. I just love smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> It looks really good on darker skin. I skip the white base for a less done up look.</li>
            <li> Economical set of purple eyeshadow but not well pigmented.  The black liner is not dark enough, even with multiple layers of powder.  The 2 purples are also not well pigmented.  If you want a more subtle look, these powders will come in handy. There is a shimmer to all these shadows, which is lovely for evening use.  Since I have it, I will use it, but only to accent with shimmer, rather than for the colors themselves.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup pallete. I like the colors.</li>
            <li> Love this. If you follow the directions it looks great. I match it with purple mascara and i get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Still feel as its better for someone under 20</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use primer so it didnt last long as I expected, but the colors were very beautiful! The applicators are not of high quality though, if I had better brush, I bet it&#x27;d feel much better  :)</li>
            <li> While I do spend more on products like foundation and mascara, I am a big believer in &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; eye shadow. These Maybelline palettes are the best! I find that this particular group of shades is perfect for creating a lovely purple smoky eye. I usually don&#x27;t use the black shadow and find that the white as a base with the light purple on the lid and the dark purple in the crease is perfect.</li>
            <li> What I got was not what it has pictured. It&#x27;s the same colors, but instead just four squares, all colors the same amount. The colors are alright, but not quite what I was hoping for. Decent quality though.</li>
            <li> My wife love it, big size (compact at the same time) and nice materials&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time and in perfect conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend It</li>
            <li> The colors are great. Goes on smooth and stays on all day. I will definitely reorder this eye shadow in other colors.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Amethyst Smokes palette for about 3 years. The colors are super pigmented. I like that I don&#x27;t have to wear a primer with it and it lasts all day. Within the past year or so I have started buying more high end make up products, this eye shadow is still one of the best I own. All four colors compliment each other very well and allow you to create casual looks, or build to a more dramatic effect. This product is a gem.</li>
            <li> love these shades... did both my eyes and my roommates eyes yesterday, got numerous compliments. best if you do thick black eyeliner for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, a very nice item, according to the request, very good service, 100% satisfied customer, thank for your attention...</li>
            <li> ... because of the white base. I wish the colors were more sparkly. The darkest purple is on the gray side. Not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very sexy eyewear. It makes me feel like a diva. Thank u! \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\</li>
            <li> Love it I have all the colors...</li>
