            <li>Clean!</li>
            <li>It rinses off really easily in the shower instead of leaving residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>Rub off the surface salt and all is fine.</li>
            <li>Smells great just enough grit of salt to exfoliate</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it, which makes it great for both of us to use.</li>

            <li>Nice light scent, exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it available from amazon Marketplace for an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Makes getting ready for work at 4am more refreshing</li>
            <li>Love the smell, it smell clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love trying new soaps that are natural and smell great</li>
            <li>lightly abrasive, clean smell, long-lasting.</li>
            <li>this is the only soap we use now - it smells and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>First enjoyed this soap as a gift; and now don&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this soap at Anthropologies.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much, I purchased the candle!</li>
            <li>Uniquely clean smelling and feeling soap.</li>
            <li>Feels so clean.</li>
            <li>SO clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>The lather is smooth, but the surface of the soap is somewhat rough (from the sea salt?), so it&#x27;s great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>you feel squeeky clean when done.</li>
            <li>My husband made a special request for this soap.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best soap for really dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and clean scent - not overpowering.</li>
            <li>clean, fresh fragrance but not over powering.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this stuff - my skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin soft and it smells so clean too.</li>
            <li>One of the best no nonsense soaps with the natural additive of sea salt acting as a dermabrasive making your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh</li>
            <li>Buy it worth the price</li>
            <li>Fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing scent with a texture that exfoliates but does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has eczema and we have tried many natural soaps and body washes but this, in our experience, has exceeded them all.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It smells fresh</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is clean and fresh but more than that, it exfoliates at the same time it is softening my skin.</li>
            <li>The bar has cool texture from the large salt granules for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>As far as it is possible to love a soap, I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Not like scented soap, also this soap does not dry our skin out like most bar soaps.  </li>
            <li>and when I first smelled this one, I had to get it.  </li>
            <li>These last a pretty long time and have been great on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>, I prefer a clean soft, touchable result.</li>
            <li>I have ordered these several times from Amazon since then because I love the mild, fresh smell of these soaps and I enjoy the thick lather they produce.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am really hooked on this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a dream soap.</li>
            <li>so much.</li>
            <li>The whole family loves it</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>Received originally as a Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and the scrub is just enough to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit floral/grandma, but in a good, subtle way?</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; although not a huge bar, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Scent is not overpowering, my new default soap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used shower gel for a long time because of dry skin, not any more!</li>
            <li>The soap bar is pretty small for the price, so it is on the pricey side, but I don&#x27;t mind it because it makes you feel so clean and fresh after a shower.</li>
            <li>I am a red head with very pale sensitive skin and this works great.  </li>
            <li>I used two bars, wanted to make sure I tried it long enough but ended up giving the rest to my brother.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for a few years and LOVE to have it in all of my bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the sea salt to be in it&#x27;s original form, un-dissolved and rough.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap ever since I found it in a small shop while shopping on vacation.</li>
            <li>used alone, it is a mild exfoliant due to the presence of the sea salt.</li>
            <li>He really likes it, but hasn&#x27;t used up his last bar, yet.</li>
            <li>You only need to gently rub it over your skin.</li>
            <li>This exfoliates, yet keeps your skin soft and doesn&#x27;t&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>Arrived early and as described.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and does not drying out.</li>
            <li>I originally found it in a little boutique store while traveling and then realized I could buy it on Amazon in a 4-pack.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and easy to hold for my wife who has small hands.</li>
            <li>We have found that the bars last much longer with this method since you only need to give the soap a few passes over the scrubby to have more than enough lather to shower with.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I shall suds myself with no other.</li>
            <li>There are just the right amount of salt grains in the soap...not enough to make it uncomfortable and too exfoliating, but enough to where it gets the grime off. :)</li>
            <li>This soap may be a little more expensive (and smaller) than your typical bath soap, but the scent is amazing.</li>

            <li> Skin feels so smooth after shower.</li>
            <li> The salt crystals feel fabulous against my skin....</li>
            <li> fantastic soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with their fresh scent...</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap.  </li>
            <li> Nice light scent, exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find it available from amazon Marketplace for an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready for work at 4am more refreshing</li>
            <li> Love the smell, it smell clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I love trying new soaps that are natural and smell great</li>
            <li> lightly abrasive, clean smell, long-lasting.</li>
            <li> this is the only soap we use now - it smells and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> First enjoyed this soap as a gift; and now don&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this soap at Anthropologies.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much, I purchased the candle!</li>
            <li> Uniquely clean smelling and feeling soap.</li>
            <li> Feels so clean.</li>
            <li> SO clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> The lather is smooth, but the surface of the soap is somewhat rough (from the sea salt?), so it&#x27;s great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> you feel squeeky clean when done.</li>
            <li> My husband made a special request for this soap.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best soap for really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Fresh and clean scent - not overpowering.</li>
            <li> clean, fresh fragrance but not over powering.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff - my skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin soft and it smells so clean too.</li>
            <li> One of the best no nonsense soaps with the natural additive of sea salt acting as a dermabrasive making your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh</li>
            <li> Buy it worth the price</li>
            <li> Fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing scent with a texture that exfoliates but does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema and we have tried many natural soaps and body washes but this, in our experience, has exceeded them all.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It smells fresh</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is clean and fresh but more than that, it exfoliates at the same time it is softening my skin.</li>
            <li> The bar has cool texture from the large salt granules for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> As far as it is possible to love a soap, I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Not like scented soap, also this soap does not dry our skin out like most bar soaps.  </li>
            <li> and when I first smelled this one, I had to get it.  </li>
            <li> These last a pretty long time and have been great on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> , I prefer a clean soft, touchable result.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these several times from Amazon since then because I love the mild, fresh smell of these soaps and I enjoy the thick lather they produce.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am really hooked on this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a dream soap.</li>
            <li> so much.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves it</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after using this soap.  </li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li> Received originally as a Christmas present.  </li>
            <li> It smells clean and the scrub is just enough to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit floral/grandma, but in a good, subtle way?</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; although not a huge bar, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Scent is not overpowering, my new default soap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shower gel for a long time because of dry skin, not any more!</li>
            <li> The soap bar is pretty small for the price, so it is on the pricey side, but I don&#x27;t mind it because it makes you feel so clean and fresh after a shower.</li>
            <li> I am a red head with very pale sensitive skin and this works great.  </li>
            <li> I used two bars, wanted to make sure I tried it long enough but ended up giving the rest to my brother.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for a few years and LOVE to have it in all of my bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the sea salt to be in it&#x27;s original form, un-dissolved and rough.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap ever since I found it in a small shop while shopping on vacation.</li>
            <li> used alone, it is a mild exfoliant due to the presence of the sea salt.</li>
            <li> He really likes it, but hasn&#x27;t used up his last bar, yet.</li>
            <li> You only need to gently rub it over your skin.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates, yet keeps your skin soft and doesn&#x27;t&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and as described.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and does not drying out.</li>
            <li> I originally found it in a little boutique store while traveling and then realized I could buy it on Amazon in a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and easy to hold for my wife who has small hands.</li>
            <li> We have found that the bars last much longer with this method since you only need to give the soap a few passes over the scrubby to have more than enough lather to shower with.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I shall suds myself with no other.</li>
            <li> There are just the right amount of salt grains in the soap...not enough to make it uncomfortable and too exfoliating, but enough to where it gets the grime off. :)</li>
            <li> This soap may be a little more expensive (and smaller) than your typical bath soap, but the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> Now I can smell it all day long rather than only at shower time!</li>
            <li> oh and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time too.  </li>
            <li> If you use it for multiple hand washings and then a shower the salt can be a &#x27;little&#x27; abrasive.</li>
            <li> Product, service and shipping was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes your skin feel like you spent the day at the beach.</li>
            <li> Also use it for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> We found it at a local store and bought it as an impulse buy, then of course found it on Amazon for way less!  </li>
            <li> I will not use any other soap, leaves skin exfoliated and soft, thick lather doubles as shaving cream.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry when you receive this and try it for the first</li>
            <li> These little round soap transport you back to the time of sabres and swords and other words that begin with the letter S.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like every skin product, not right for everyone but</li>
            <li> The little salt crystals in it add a scrubbing sensation.  </li>
            <li> No more multitude of his &amp; her products in our small shower!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels weird in the shower and makes me itchy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how because it would be unfair to those who have not tried it.</li>

            <li> beautiful soap line. i recommend you try the swedish dream soap lines.</li>
            <li> This soap is so nice.  It smells so fresh and it has salt crystals inside the soap.  The soap bar is pretty small for the price, so it is on the pricey side, but I don&#x27;t mind it because it makes you feel so clean and fresh after a shower.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good and makes your skin feel very clean. I use it in the bath and shower. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> My husband made a special request for this soap. He really likes it, but hasn&#x27;t used up his last bar, yet.</li>

            <li> My wife and I love this soap!  We found it at a local store and bought it as an impulse buy, then of course found it on Amazon for way less!  Love the smell, it smell clean and fresh.  Not like scented soap, also this soap does not dry our skin out like most bar soaps.

            <li> So good ! U already have experienced this soap .</li>
            <li> Fresh smell.  Different from what is at the local grocery.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best soap I have ever used.  The wonderful sea salt makes for smoother skin and the scent is fresh and mild.  I think anybody would love this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is pricey, but once you try it you will understand why.  The salt is invigorating as you use it.</li>
            <li> As far as it is possible to love a soap, I love this soap.  Be prepared -- it is scratchy, which I find perfect since it provides some of the scrub.  Great clean smell, which my family says is unisex.  Great product, and I plan to stock up on it...</li>
            <li> I will not use any other soap, leaves skin exfoliated and soft, thick lather doubles as shaving cream. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  The little salt crystals in it add a scrubbing sensation.  It&#x27;s soap so it cleans and smells good.</li>
            <li> Product, service and shipping was exactly as expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> These little round soap transport you back to the time of sabres and swords and other words that begin with the letter S.  I shall suds myself with no other.</li>
            <li> I am really hooked on this soap. I like the sea salt in it, provides nice exfoliation.</li>
            <li> First enjoyed this soap as a gift; and now don&#x27;t want to use anything else. Refreshing scent with a texture that exfoliates but does not irritate my sensitive skin. Just love it!</li>
            <li> This soap is the best...smells so good, cleans well.  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> My favorite soap! Smells great &amp; although not a huge bar, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This exfoliates, yet keeps your skin soft and doesn&#x27;t&#x27;t leave a residue. So glad I was able to find it available from amazon Marketplace for an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My brother swears by this soap so I decided to try it. Feels weird in the shower and makes me itchy. I used two bars, wanted to make sure I tried it long enough but ended up giving the rest to my brother.  It&#x27;s just like every skin product, not right for everyone but judging by how happy everyone else is with it if you&#x27;re on the fence just try it.  It could be wonderful. My brother won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Works so-so. Great packaging.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap!!</li>
            <li> ADORE this soap.  Great scent, the salt is wonderful as an exfoliant, albeit mild.  I&#x27;ve used this soap for a few years and LOVE to have it in all of my bathrooms.  Lasts a very long time too.  Get it...smell like the sea mist...you&#x27;ll be delighted.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this soap and are so happy to have found it on Amazon. My husband has eczema and we have tried many natural soaps and body washes but this, in our experience, has exceeded them all.&lt;br /&gt;If used alone, it is a mild exfoliant due to the presence of the sea salt. It&#x27;s wonderful to have this option in the soap rather than having to rely on another source for exfoliation. When we just want the creamy and abundant suds it provides we use a nylon scrubby. We have found that the bars last much longer with this method since you only need to give the soap a few passes over the scrubby to have more than enough lather to shower with.&lt;br /&gt;As it says on the box it is great for shaving. The lather is so creamy! And the smell is divine!! It smells fresh, that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it, which makes it great for both of us to use. No more multitude of his &amp; her products in our small shower!!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great way to get clean, smell great and avoid the plethora of chemicals found in most shower/bath products give this a try. It also makes a great gift...I&#x27;m always tucking one in a gift bag for someone and then I hear &#x27;I love it...where can I buy it?&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It has a great smell, and the salt does a good job in refreshing and softening my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Skin feels so smooth after shower.</li>
            <li> One of the best no nonsense soaps with the natural additive of sea salt acting as a dermabrasive making your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My dad uses this for his dry,itchy skin. He loves this soap. I would recommend this brand of soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is really good soap. My wife bought it for me for Christmas because we both have anchor tattoos, and she liked the logo. I ended up LOVING the soap and bought a bunch of it. I like how it makes your skin feel like you spent the day at the beach. It rinses off really easily in the shower instead of leaving residue on your skin. There are just the right amount of salt grains in the soap...not enough to make it uncomfortable and too exfoliating, but enough to where it gets the grime off. :)</li>
            <li> Uniquely clean smelling and feeling soap. Also use for shaving soap. Definitely plan to reorder</li>
            <li> Best soap ever! Great for shaving!</li>
            <li> I love this Sea Salt Soap!  It makes your skin feel so wonderful and it works great as a shaving soap for your legs!</li>
            <li> Leave it to the Swedes to develop a great product, very refreshing, smells nice, lasts a long time. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This soap is so clean and refreshing!  I don&#x27;t think I want to use another soap!  I love trying new soaps that are natural and smell great and when I first smelled this one, I had to get it.  I use on my face with no irritation.  Clean! It&#x27;s really a dream soap.</li>
            <li> incredible! clean, fresh fragrance but not over powering. This has become my every day soap.</li>
            <li> This is nice soap but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the sea salt to be in it&#x27;s original form, un-dissolved and rough.  If you plan to use this as body soap I would recommend using it with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift for Christmas and I will not be without it now.  The fragrance is clean and fresh but more than that, it exfoliates at the same time it is softening my skin. The salt crystals feel fabulous against my skin....no washcloth is needed....the bar of soap does it all.  You will not be sorry when you receive this and try it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It makes for a great gift as well!!!  LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> love this stuff. so much. it&#x27;s a bit floral/grandma, but in a good, subtle way?</li>
            <li> Arrived early and as described.  This soap may be a little more expensive (and smaller) than your typical bath soap, but the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> smells as good as it cleans.  Not another soap out there that comes even close.</li>
            <li> Great soap. The whole family loves it</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this soap smells and feels.  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> My very favorite soap - can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> fantastic soap. lightly abrasive, clean smell, long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Received originally as a Christmas present.  Had to have more.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap. Feels so clean. No residue. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Non-drying but doesn&#x27;t smell feminine. Great for shaving too. If you use it for multiple hand washings and then a shower the salt can be a &#x27;little&#x27; abrasive. Rub off the surface salt and all is fine.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes your skin feel.  You can feel the salt in the soap and it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this soap at Anthropologies.  This is by far the best soap for really dry skin.  Not only does it give moisture to your skin but also exfoliates.  Great soap!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. This is the best out there. You have to try it. Makes getting ready for work at 4am more refreshing</li>
            <li> Love this awesome soap. Heard about through a &amp;#34;YouTuber&amp;#34;... So happy I purchased.</li>
            <li> Once you start using it, none of soap can satisfy you...&lt;br /&gt;The perfection of soap!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells good &amp; feels goooood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it Love it Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely Love it!!!</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING!!! I&#x27;m in love with their fresh scent... SO clean smelling.  I love it so much, I purchased the candle! Now I can smell it all day long rather than only at shower time!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I use it for face and body. The lather is smooth, but the surface of the soap is somewhat rough (from the sea salt?), so it&#x27;s great for exfoliating. It doesn&#x27;t leave any film and it has a really pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after using this soap.  I am a red head with very pale sensitive skin and this works great.  I dislike soaps or creams that leave any type of residue on my skin, I prefer a clean soft, touchable result.</li>
            <li> After I started using this soap my world changed forever. I can&#x27;t tell you how because it would be unfair to those who have not tried it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap ever since I found it in a small shop while shopping on vacation. I have ordered these several times from Amazon since then because I love the mild, fresh smell of these soaps and I enjoy the thick lather they produce. These last a pretty long time and have been great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the 4 pack ! Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. The bar has cool texture from the large salt granules for exfoliation. Scent is not overpowering, my new default soap!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  The sea salt in the bar acts as a great exfoliator and the soap itself can develop a good lather.  Leaves my skin soft and does not drying out.</li>

            <li> Cleans well and easy to hold for my wife who has small hands.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap.  The sea salt scrubs and you feel squeeky clean when done.</li>
            <li> I love this soap ! This is all I will use on my skin now.  Smells amazing and I love the exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Love those soaps&lt;br /&gt;they are moist and wonderful for the skin&lt;br /&gt;I will order those again&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  I bought a bar while at the beach last summer and I was hooked!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds and I&#x27;m very picky. It smells great and the sea salt is a great srcub for your skin. Awesome product!</li>
