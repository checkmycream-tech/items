            <li> I use this product to moisturize my feet after I shower.  It goes on a little oily and sometimes can be shiny but it definitely helps dry feet.  I also use it for my knees and elbows.  I let my family use some and now I have to buy it by the case because my dad and nephew love it. Red Fox also makes a lotion but it doesn&#x27;t smell very good in my opinion so I don&#x27;t recommend it for women who like pleasant smelling lotions.  The Tub O&#x27;Butter doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and is a much better option.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it&#x27;s wonderful! It clears up scars and leaves my face very soft. I also apply it onto my feet and it dries up ashy patches. I use it twice a day (morning &amp; night). A very good moisterizer!</li>
            <li> Love using this good for my skin</li>
            <li> A cheap way to maintain the glow and smoothness of your skin it also removes some marks...My mother loves it....</li>
            <li> SIMPLY THE BEST LOTION YOU WILL EVER BUY AND THE CHEAPEST FOR THE PORTION YOU GET.</li>
            <li> Try a tub of butter you will see a different in your skin. Not like a lot of creams, That once you put on you can still see dry skin.Use everyday. Will not break your budget</li>
            <li> IThis rich, emollient body butter has been around forever. Simple ingredient list containing high amounts of cocoa butter and lanolin. The lanolin in this formula keeps it from being too greasy because it soaks into your skin, unlike regular sticky petroleum jelly. Cocoa butter has been proven scientifically to promote collagen production. It evens out skin tone as well. This is a cult product if there ever was one! Smell isn&#x27;t chocolatey and overbearing like a certain other brand of cocoa butter. I purchase this at Roses for $4 a tub.</li>
            <li> Product smells great but i do feel its a little too greasy. I am looking for something that&#x27;s not so greasy/clammy. But great smell.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as expected!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love tub o butter it feels and smells great!!  I used it on my belly and feet it works great.</li>
            <li> Great for ethnic skin and hair. I like the smell and we get instant results. It can be a little heavy so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Love this...used it for over 35 years..</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s skin need extra love during the drying winter months and this product takes care of that.  I keep extra on hand for dry patches.</li>
            <li> Great product if you have sensitive, dry skin. Mostly Petroleum jelly, cocoa butter, lanolin, palm oil and slight fragrance. I use it daily after shower.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product and works smoothing on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching all over the place for this! This is the only cream that works for me. Not even CVS or Walgreens carry it. The day they stop making this, i&#x27;ll go CRAZY!!</li>
            <li> great stuff, not greasy like vaseline and has cocoa butter in it</li>
            <li> Greasier than I thought but I like so far..</li>
