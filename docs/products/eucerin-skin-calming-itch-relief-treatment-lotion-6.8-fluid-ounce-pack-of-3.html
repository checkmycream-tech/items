            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>it does work, how nice for you.  </li>
            <li>Have always liked Eucerin.</li>
            <li>This was by far the best of all I tried.  </li>
            <li>but if I use this lotion on my legs after the shower - they are fine!  </li>
            <li>A great product, and one I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>The results were fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I generally love Eucerin products.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use for many to come.  </li>
            <li>Helps my skin and is fragrance free, Yeh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>I love Eucerin products.</li>
            <li>and I love this.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion more for the anti effect rather than the lotion effect.</li>
            <li>That smile says it all!!</li>
            <li>If it turns out to be right for you, you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is wonderful for dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Best moisturizer for dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Eucerin and use many of their products, but they aren&#x27;t yet officially in the \\&quot;itch-relief\\&quot; market if they don&#x27;t put lidocaine and/or hydrocortisone in their product.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very watery and isn&#x27;t as good as Eucerin skin calming moisturizing creme.</li>
            <li>When you first put in on the itchy area,  it is cool and feels good.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is mostly odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Within seconds my son was turning bright red, scratching and screaming at the top of his lungs - \\&quot;Mama</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on recently shaved legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is soothing and smooth</li>
            <li>This is great lotion for dry skin in winter or sun parched skin in summer.</li>
            <li>This product worked like nothing else has, and many of the patches faded and the skin became much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I think that many people find that better than an incessent itch, and I&#x27;m definitely one of those people.  </li>
            <li>Received product quickly.</li>
            <li>But this might make a good body lotion for someone who is not sensitive to menthol.</li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer who wishes that it came it a more \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; size, as these run out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>This product may not be for everyone or for every kind of skin problem, but I would strongly recommend buying just one bottle and trying it out for a few days to see if it might be right for you.  </li>
            <li>These splotches were even more itchy than the original dry skin itch.  </li>
            <li>Just nice for dry skin, or in an aircon room</li>
            <li>And the delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li>but I would love a BIG bottle for after my shower!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, he started screaming and clawing at his skin.</li>
            <li>I tried my favorite Bath Junkie lotion but the relief only lasted 20 minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid gardener</li>
            <li>I was first advised by a nurse (R.N.) to use Eucerin for my psoriasis that I had suffered with for some time.</li>
            <li>This lotion is vrey calming which is the exact reason that I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me state that even though I am going to rant my rating is based solely on the product.</li>
            <li>&quot; I thought it was safe enough to put on her skin.</li>
            <li>but doggone it, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>My doctor recommends Eucerin for such cases, and I am glad I followed her suggestion.</li>
            <li>The normal (small) bottles are great for my purse</li>
            <li>Light and non-greasy, quick to dry.</li>
            <li>Moved into a new house RIGHT after a hurricane came through.  </li>
            <li>Sarna is probably the most effective anti-itch lotion: quick and dirty.  </li>
            <li>As a standard body lotion, this is fine.</li>
            <li>I flip the bottle over and find two of the main ingredients are types of alcohol!</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>B005ALUKUY Purpose Gentle Cleansing Bar, 6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>He really likes this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Ordering through Amazon is convenient, fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well on my  hands and legs.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>, they get very itchy &amp; irritated after I shave/shower -</li>
            <li>I was hoping for some real working ingredients in this Eucerin product.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, it is a good idea to test it on a small area first to minimize any reaction if your skin rejects it like mine</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the lotion is not very greasy and has a mild medicine smell that is not bad.    </li>
            <li>Most other Eucerin creams I would give about a 4 rating.</li>
            <li>I use it almost daily for a recurring itch and it relieves the itch, leaving the skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>High quality for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>skin is only sensitive on my face and my rosacea is VERY mild</li>
            <li>For example, I&#x27;m using the Dry Skin Therapy Pklus Smoothing Essentials, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>All the standing water provided a great breeding ground for mosquitos and my entire family got eaten alive by them as the doors were open for so long moving things into the house.    </li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs very quickly and really does relieve the itching due to dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in the mild rosacea I have on my hips and upper arms!</li>
            <li>Only thing that will calm my Itchy skin</li>
            <li>I contacted customer service, and to their credit, they responded very quickly and created a new order for a 3 pack at no charge and told me I did not need to return the bottle due to \\&quot;health and safety reasons.\\</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without this stuff</li>
            <li>The item description clearly says this is a 3 pack and, as one bottle costs about 7 dollars at your local drug store, 20 dollars is about right for a 3 pack.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after I towel off from my shower in a pretty generous amount and after a few seconds, the itching stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As soon as I became an adult, I developed super sensitive skin on my back and upper arms.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s doing the absolute opposite of what it should.</li>
            <li>The amount of menthol in it is quite low, actually; much lower than Aveeno&#x27;s version of an itch-relief lotion</li>
            <li>Well I guess Amazon couldn&#x27;t leave well enough alone because now they are asking where the first bottle is and want it back, otherwise they will charge me for it.</li>
            <li>&quot; Well, I received the new package, opened it, and, guess what, there is only one bottle.</li>
            <li>This lotion REALLY works ... calming itchy or dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am at least glad to see someone else had the same issue we did.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend has used this and says it works, however I have used it a couple times and have noticed no real difference between it and a standard moisturizer, both seem to calm an itch equally well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a skin problem that leaves very dry and constantly itchy skin, along with large patchy marks.  </li>
            <li>After trying several lotions—including Eucerin&#x27;s own &amp;#34;Calming Creme&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Aquaphor&amp;#34; products—which all failed to stop it, I had been tempted to go to a dermatologist who would have presumably prescribed a cortisone (steroidal) lotion.  </li>
            <li>I usually need to use a cream to adequately moisturize my very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For less severe skin problems or for regular day to day use on sensitive skin, I highly recommend Eucerin calming creme daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>(I swim five miles a day) or just regular sensitive skin, but it got so bad that I would cry myself to sleep pretty much every night because the itching was so intense and</li>

            <li> I usually need to use a cream to adequately moisturize my very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For less severe skin problems or for regular day to day use on sensitive skin, I highly recommend Eucerin calming creme daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> (I swim five miles a day) or just regular sensitive skin, but it got so bad that I would cry myself to sleep pretty much every night because the itching was so intense and</li>
            <li> The Calming Itch-Relief by Eucerin is less intense and provides a long lasting moisturing effect as well, which Sarna doesn&#x27;t.      </li>
            <li> I recently moved from warm, humid Texas to cold, dry Washington DC.</li>
            <li> It has a slight medicinal smell that took a little getting used to, but it was worth it for the comfort it provided.</li>
            <li> The only real itch-relief ingredients I&#x27;ve found are lidocaine and hydrocortisone, most commonly found in the drug-section in expensive</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything about menthol that can ease itchy skin; if anything, it can irritate already inflamed, sensitive skin and make the itching worse.</li>
            <li> I suffer from atopic dermatitis, but since I&#x27;ve started using this lotion as my daily moisturizer, I have not had a single flare up.  </li>
            <li> Despite the mention of &amp;#34;menthol&amp;#34; in the ingredients, it does not feel or smell different from any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> (Some other reviews mentioned this; everyone&#x27;s skin is different.)</li>
            <li> Calming Itch-Relief can be difficult to find, so I was excited to buy it in bulk.  </li>
            <li> his skin is sometimes dry.  </li>
            <li> dry, itchy skin</li>
            <li> I have post herpetic neuralgia after a serious case of shingles on my temple and head and find this lotion very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d rather burn than itch, and the burning passes within a few minutes for me, but the itch doesn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li> I can see making a mistake like this once in awhile, sending a single bottle instead of a 3 pack, but doing it twice in a row has to make one think something is up.</li>
            <li> I tried a half dozen different creams, sprays, ointments to get relief from the itching.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with typical skin that needs a little extra boost during the dry/cold months.</li>
            <li> They bottles are little bigger than a deck of cards!</li>
            <li> If I could give it a minus 5 I would.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, having both menthol AND camphor in the formula, it will burn your skin somewhat as an everyday anti-itch lotion.  </li>
            <li> No real scent to it.</li>
            <li> It does not really relieve your itch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like it works for others based on reviews, but please be careful.  </li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers have described.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this item, but would like to thank the other parents who posted their reviews saying that the product cause itching and burning.</li>
            <li> However, I gave one bottle away and have used the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than Eucerin&#x27;s Plus Intensive Repair Foot Creme, a little thinner than Eucerin&#x27;s Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first . . . .</li>
            <li> One of the few that calms the itching I get from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Eucerin company - please take a second look at this product, at least for some people</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin Calming Itch-relief for at least ten years</li>
            <li> I have a (stress-related) skin condition, the main symptoms are extreme itchiness, and from scratching an uncomfortable raised rash-like condition.  </li>
            <li> Putting this on replaces the itch with a half numb-half burning feeling.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend parents not use this on young children with sensitive skin :-(</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed, but decide to just leave it alone, since I&#x27;m only down 6 dollars.</li>
            <li> The lotion IS heavy but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I put it on and felt some relief for a few moments.  </li>
            <li> so I usually have little scratches from branches on my arms as well as bug bites, and the lotion has never stung those areas.</li>
            <li> To say the least, the prospect of paying 40 dollars for two bottles has me a little pissed off.    </li>
            <li> As a result, my skin began feeling tight, itchy, dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from chemicals in the pool</li>
            <li> so maybe I have thick skin or something.</li>
            <li> This solved a mysterious nighttime itch on my torso that had been making it very difficult to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the company for not checking this cream out enough before releasing it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find only 1 6.8oz bottle instead of 3.</li>
            <li> There is something in this formula that reacted poorly with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a great scent, but who cares?</li>
            <li> They got something seriously wrong with this anti-itch cream though.</li>
            <li> It was so painful and itchy</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I find that annoying.</li>
            <li> So bad that I have to keep my nails trimmed x-short to prevent shredding my skin!  </li>
            <li> This product was my worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I work in the medical field and suffer from a severe latex allergy.  I am also allergic to bananas and have hyper-sensitive skin. My allergy issues tend to show up on my skin...hives, itching, redness, etc.  So bad that I have to keep my nails trimmed x-short to prevent shredding my skin!  At times I have taken up to 5 Benadryl to stop the itching.  I saw this lotion advertised and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It really works.  My only wish is that it came in an industrial sized bottle with a pump!  The normal (small) bottles are great for my purse but I would love a BIG bottle for after my shower!  A great product, and one I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am at least glad to see someone else had the same issue we did.  I bought this lotion for my son&#x27;s severe eczema in hopes of getting him some itch relief.    The first time I used it, he started screaming and clawing at his skin. I washed it off, and set the lotion aside.    Last night, in a pinch, I tried it again. Within seconds my son was turning bright red, scratching and screaming at the top of his lungs - \\&quot;Mama no HURT mama no HURT HURT HURT ITCHY!!!\\&quot;    What more can I say? It will be pitched today.</li>
            <li> This product is great - I have a (stress-related) skin condition, the main symptoms are extreme itchiness, and from scratching an uncomfortable raised rash-like condition.  I was already using the product, buying it from Walgreens- take how great the product is and the great savings that Amazon.com has to offer, and you have a real winner!!</li>
            <li> I recently moved from warm, humid Texas to cold, dry Washington DC. As a result, my skin began feeling tight, itchy, dry and uncomfortable. I tried my favorite Bath Junkie lotion but the relief only lasted 20 minutes so I started using Eucerin External Analgesic Lotion with Calming Itch-Relief. The results were fantastic! My skin feels refreshed almost all day. I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in the mild rosacea I have on my hips and upper arms! The lotion is mostly odorless and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s great on recently shaved legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is only sensitive on my face and my rosacea is VERY mild so I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the burning or itchiness other reviewers have described. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with typical skin that needs a little extra boost during the dry/cold months.</li>
            <li> Just nice for dry skin, or in an aircon room</li>
            <li> Moved into a new house RIGHT after a hurricane came through.  All the standing water provided a great breeding ground for mosquitos and my entire family got eaten alive by them as the doors were open for so long moving things into the house.    I tried a half dozen different creams, sprays, ointments to get relief from the itching.  This was by far the best of all I tried.  No it is not a miracle cure but it is soothing and smooth and I love it.  I now have a bottle at work and at home.</li>
            <li> yes, that is what i want</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this item, but would like to thank the other parents who posted their reviews saying that the product cause itching and burning. I have daughters with eczema as well and was going to try this on them, but have decided not to now after reading the reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to end up with 3 bottles of product i would never use!</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff and it is the only thing that seems to do it for her irritated skin.</li>
            <li> This item has been great for me. One of the few that calms the itching I get from dry skin. Just wish it didn&#x27;t contain alcohol</li>
            <li> I generally love Eucerin products. For example, I&#x27;m using the Dry Skin Therapy Pklus Smoothing Essentials, and it works just fine. They got something seriously wrong with this anti-itch cream though. It was so painful and itchy I had to wash it all off. I&#x27;ve tried 3 times with the same reaction, and now need to throw it away. Eucerin company - please take a second look at this product, at least for some people it&#x27;s doing the absolute opposite of what it should. If I could give it a minus 5 I would. Most other Eucerin creams I would give about a 4 rating. I&#x27;m disappointed in the company for not checking this cream out enough before releasing it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a skin problem that leaves very dry and constantly itchy skin, along with large patchy marks.  This product worked like nothing else has, and many of the patches faded and the skin became much healthier.  The itching subsides upon application too.  This product may not be for everyone or for every kind of skin problem, but I would strongly recommend buying just one bottle and trying it out for a few days to see if it might be right for you.  If it turns out to be right for you, you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.  For less severe skin problems or for regular day to day use on sensitive skin, I highly recommend Eucerin calming creme daily moisturizer.  That is another product that has worked miracles for me.</li>
            <li> Putting this on replaces the itch with a half numb-half burning feeling.  I think that many people find that better than an incessent itch, and I&#x27;m definitely one of those people.  I guess others don&#x27;t, which is why this product seems to have all 5&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s.  Personally, I&#x27;d rather burn than itch, and the burning passes within a few minutes for me, but the itch doesn&#x27;t come back.  Ahhh...</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Skin feels moisturized but not greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I became an adult, I developed super sensitive skin on my back and upper arms. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from chemicals in the pool (I swim five miles a day) or just regular sensitive skin, but it got so bad that I would cry myself to sleep pretty much every night because the itching was so intense and PAINFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found two things that calmed it: [[ASIN:B005ALUKUY Purpose Gentle Cleansing Bar, 6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 2)]] - it&#x27;s the ONLY soap I use on my back and arms and Neutrogena Anti-Itch lotion. Of course, neutrogen STOPPED making the lotion, but before it disappeared I stocked up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my stash ran out last year and I had to find a replacement. I tried a lot of different lotions and the Eucerin is the only thing that comes close. I apply it right after I towel off from my shower in a pretty generous amount and after a few seconds, the itching stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any pain related with it- I&#x27;m an avid gardener so I usually have little scratches from branches on my arms as well as bug bites, and the lotion has never stung those areas. If anything, it immediately cools my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that there&#x27;s no oiliness or breakouts. The lotion IS heavy but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a replacement for Neutrogena or just an all around good anti-itch lotion, try this out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like heaven in a bottle. I was having severe allergic reactions and breaking out in hives all over my body and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to put me out of my misery. I found this lotion and as soon as I smoothed it on it cooled my skin and took the itch away. It has a slight medicinal smell that took a little getting used to, but it was worth it for the comfort it provided. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I was first advised by a nurse (R.N.) to use Eucerin for my psoriasis that I had suffered with for some time. Amazingly, within 2 days the psoriasis (itching and blisters) were gone. I now apply it daily and in the last four years have had no reoccurrences of the problem. Obviously, I consider it a God-send.</li>
            <li> great stuff.  The itch cream helps under my lymphodema wraps that stay on for 2 to 4 days.</li>
            <li> good, excelentro product</li>
            <li> I order this product for my husband who is a diabetic and his skin is sometimes dry.  He really likes this lotion.  I will be placing another order soon.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Only thing that will calm my Itchy skin</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000O3SS7U Eucerin External Analgesic Lotion, Calming Itch-Relief Treatment, 6.8 fl oz (200 ml) Bottles, (Pack of 3)]]  A great product to relieve skin irritation (itching), and a great value, as well.</li>
            <li> Using this for quite some time to take care of my itchy skin on my head and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin Calming Itch-relief for at least ten years and I will continue to use for many to come.  This says it all about the lotion.  Ordering through Amazon is convenient, fast and efficient.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> When I have an itchy place, just a dab of the Eucerin Calming Itch Relief stops the itching.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry, itchy skin.  Works so well!</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs very quickly and really does relieve the itching due to dryness. It worked very well on my  hands and legs.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin and is fragrance free, Yeh!</li>
            <li> This solved a mysterious nighttime itch on my torso that had been making it very difficult to sleep.  After trying several lotions—including Eucerin&#x27;s own &amp;#34;Calming Creme&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Aquaphor&amp;#34; products—which all failed to stop it, I had been tempted to go to a dermatologist who would have presumably prescribed a cortisone (steroidal) lotion.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  This &amp;#34;Calming Itch-Relief&amp;#34; lotion now allows me to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not produce a burning—or any other—sensation for me.  Despite the mention of &amp;#34;menthol&amp;#34; in the ingredients, it does not feel or smell different from any other lotion.  (Some other reviews mentioned this; everyone&#x27;s skin is different.)</li>
            <li> exellent product, good price</li>
            <li> Impulse purchase. The lotion is very watery and isn&#x27;t as good as Eucerin skin calming moisturizing creme. Won&#x27;t buy that again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff skin never been so good!</li>
            <li> I have an itchy skin condition called Grovers Disease and I really need a heavy duty itch relief several times a day. Sarna is probably the most effective anti-itch lotion: quick and dirty.  The only thing is, having both menthol AND camphor in the formula, it will burn your skin somewhat as an everyday anti-itch lotion.  The Calming Itch-Relief by Eucerin is less intense and provides a long lasting moisturing effect as well, which Sarna doesn&#x27;t.      I agree with the reviewer who wishes that it came it a more \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; size, as these run out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion for dry skin in winter or sun parched skin in summer. Light and non-greasy, quick to dry. No real scent to it. Works well!</li>
            <li> Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is vrey calming which is the exact reason that I ordered it.  And the delivery was very fast.  What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> First off, let me state that even though I am going to rant my rating is based solely on the product. My girlfriend has used this and says it works, however I have used it a couple times and have noticed no real difference between it and a standard moisturizer, both seem to calm an itch equally well. Then again, when I tried that touch massage oil I noticed almost no \\&quot;warming sensation\\&quot; so maybe I have thick skin or something. I just tested it on my arm though. Otherwise, the lotion is not very greasy and has a mild medicine smell that is not bad.    Now to my rant, which is basically a buyer beware. The item description clearly says this is a 3 pack and, as one bottle costs about 7 dollars at your local drug store, 20 dollars is about right for a 3 pack. However, when I opened the package from Amazon I was disappointed to find only 1 6.8oz bottle instead of 3. I contacted customer service, and to their credit, they responded very quickly and created a new order for a 3 pack at no charge and told me I did not need to return the bottle due to \\&quot;health and safety reasons.\\&quot; Well, I received the new package, opened it, and, guess what, there is only one bottle. I was a little annoyed, but decide to just leave it alone, since I&#x27;m only down 6 dollars. Well I guess Amazon couldn&#x27;t leave well enough alone because now they are asking where the first bottle is and want it back, otherwise they will charge me for it. However, I gave one bottle away and have used the other. To say the least, the prospect of paying 40 dollars for two bottles has me a little pissed off.    So, buyer beware. I can see making a mistake like this once in awhile, sending a single bottle instead of a 3 pack, but doing it twice in a row has to make one think something is up.</li>
            <li> For itch release I did not find this as good as Calomine lotions which is a lot cheaper. It does not really relieve your itch.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a doctor (but not a dermatologist).  When you first put in on the itchy area,  it is cool and feels good.  But as for stopping the itching, the relief lasts only about five minutes, if that.  It just didn&#x27;t work, plain and simple.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Spend your money on something else  IF you can find anything that actually does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Soothing lotion . Using it with arthitis lotions for releif. Received product quickly. Would suggest to others. Try it soon</li>
            <li> I have always been a big fan of Eucerin lotion.  Calming Itch-Relief can be difficult to find, so I was excited to buy it in bulk.  Moisturizing effects last all day.</li>
            <li> I used this product because my daughters pediatrician gave me a sample when she erupted in an itchy rash. With the front of the bottle touting \\&quot;calming oatmeal\\&quot; I thought it was safe enough to put on her skin. Once applied she began to scream in agony. I flip the bottle over and find two of the main ingredients are types of alcohol! A \\&quot;calming\\&quot; cream shouldn&#x27;t burn!!!    I would recommend parents not use this on young children with sensitive skin :-(</li>
            <li> This lotion REALLY works ... calming itchy or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Finally found the one lotion that works for my family ... and at a good savings.</li>
            <li> I thought Eucerin was supposed to be a trusted brand.  This product was my worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With dry, itchy skin, I put it on and felt some relief for a few moments.  With several minutes, my skin started breaking out in red splotches.  These splotches were even more itchy than the original dry skin itch.  There is something in this formula that reacted poorly with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like it works for others based on reviews, but please be careful.  I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t try it, just know it is possible that it may not be the miracle cure others have claimed it to be.  If you have sensitive skin like me, it is a good idea to test it on a small area first to minimize any reaction if your skin rejects it like mine did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does work, how nice for you.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for dry itchy skin.  I suffer from atopic dermatitis, but since I&#x27;ve started using this lotion as my daily moisturizer, I have not had a single flare up.  Not a great scent, but who cares?</li>
            <li> I usually need to use a cream to adequately moisturize my very dry and sensitive skin. This lotion does just as well. Great product. I love Eucerin products. High quality for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Nothing works like this.  Of course, it may depend on your skin condition and what you use it for.  I use it almost daily for a recurring itch and it relieves the itch, leaving the skin feeling clean.  I believe it&#x27;s the menthol that makes the difference. I find that it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to find, so I buy more than one to keep on hand.  Try it and see if it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel any menthol in this lotion.  I couldn&#x27;t even smell anything.  I was disappointed.  They bottles are little bigger than a deck of cards!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for several months now for an elderly parent that has residual effects of lymphodema in the lower legs.  The treating clinician recommended this product to relieve the itching created by the constant chafing of compression hosiery.  All I get is smiles from Mom when I walk through the door with another three-pack of Eucerin Analgesic Lotion.  That smile says it all!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I have eczema on my legs, they get very itchy &amp; irritated after I shave/shower - but if I use this lotion on my legs after the shower - they are fine!  I stock up on this lotion &amp; pray that it never gets discontinued.  It is the only lotion I ever ever ever ever put on my legs.  It was a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> I have psoarsis and I love this.</li>
            <li> As a standard body lotion, this is fine. The amount of menthol in it is quite low, actually; much lower than Aveeno&#x27;s version of an itch-relief lotion so it won&#x27;t burn your eyes or sinuses. It&#x27;s a little thicker than Eucerin&#x27;s Plus Intensive Repair Foot Creme, a little thinner than Eucerin&#x27;s Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme. There really isn&#x27;t anything about menthol that can ease itchy skin; if anything, it can irritate already inflamed, sensitive skin and make the itching worse. I&#x27;ve read the ingredients&#x27; list to see if there was another ingredient(s) that was(were) known to ease itching, irritated skin, but they all seem to be standard, moisturizer-type ingredients. The only real itch-relief ingredients I&#x27;ve found are lidocaine and hydrocortisone, most commonly found in the drug-section in expensive 1- or 2-ounce tubes. I find that annoying. I was hoping for some real working ingredients in this Eucerin product. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Eucerin and use many of their products, but they aren&#x27;t yet officially in the \\&quot;itch-relief\\&quot; market if they don&#x27;t put lidocaine and/or hydrocortisone in their product. But this might make a good body lotion for someone who is not sensitive to menthol. That&#x27;s probably how I&#x27;ll finish it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first . . . . but doggone it, this stuff really works! Mosquito bites, rashes, allergic reactions to weedy plants, all are calmed by this lotion. It&#x27;s now one of my essential travel and gardening items.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product anywhere... then after I found it with you, I see it in the stores!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the cream.&lt;br /&gt;B.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone suffering from itchy scalp.  I have post herpetic neuralgia after a serious case of shingles on my temple and head and find this lotion very helpful.  My doctor recommends Eucerin for such cases, and I am glad I followed her suggestion.</li>
            <li> Have always liked Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion more for the anti effect rather than the lotion effect. The lotion does help take away the itchiness and is a great substitute for Benadryl.</li>
