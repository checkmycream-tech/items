    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This shampoo and matching conditioner works wonderfully on my keratin treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It did not have the best lather of any sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but the lather was acceptable.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo and conditioner ever!!!!</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully when my hair was waist length or chin length, and worked well for my husband as well.  </li>
            <li>Happy I bought it!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in my 19 years of life.</li>
            <li>Is it perfect?</li>
            <li>and I am SO glad I did!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy and looks the best it has in years.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is good if you are after a sleeker look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is the best, and healthiest, of the cheap smoothing shampoos.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller is a good seller.</li>
            <li>I have been in search of a good quality product for months now.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for good products.</li>
            <li>I used it with the conditioner (see separate review) which was also a good product.</li>
            <li>If I had hair, I am sure it would have looked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m very glad with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the L&#x27;oreal EverSleek hair serum, so I assumed this would be great too, but nope.</li>
            <li>Does it feel nice and smell good?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair today even after walking throughout downtown in raining weather!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what a difference there has been since I have started using it.</li>
            <li>I think it lathers nicely, even though I&#x27;ve heard people complain about sulfate-free shampoos not lathering well.</li>
            <li>Its okay, not as good as the shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, when visiting my sister I used her shampoo because I didn&#x27;t feel like packing my own.</li>
            <li>I thought the fragrance was acceptable -- noticeable, but not too strong, and I found the scent to be pleasant.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and easily damaged, but it has a good amount of curl to it and so tends to be voluminous and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I came across it while researching sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners and happen to like Loreal for the most part and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Yes, most times I have to lather twice</li>
            <li>Plus, this shampoo does lather as most sulfate-free products do not.</li>
            <li>If you prefer more bounce to you hair</li>
            <li>It smells great and from what I can tell people with hair (ready my wife) seem to love it.</li>
            <li>Im not quite sure I would recommend the conditioner though.</li>
            <li>Being sulfate-free, this should be safe for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I love everything I&#x27;ve ever used from L&#x27;Oreal, just not this line.</li>
            <li>being said, I (98% of the time) love L&#x27;oreal products, but I have to say after paying what I did and using your L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many people this was tested on, but there are a lot of people allergic to it.</li>
            <li>It claims to have frizz-control, but it made my hair even more frizzy than it was before I used it.</li>
            <li>The suds and soaps went on and on which is great if you like to look at soap but not so much if you want a product that works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used the Loreal Everpure products and wasn&#x27;t particularly pleased with the smell</li>
            <li>Love that it is sulfate free!  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love how it keeps my hair smelling and feeling after a wash</li>
            <li>This shampoo is effective at keeping my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>After use this shampoo...the result is amazing, my hair is very soft and with good aspect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Reparative Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, which did wonders for my fine, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent shampoo, but there&#x27;s nothing remarkable about it.</li>
            <li>This one in particular give alot of volume and keeps the frizzies away when it&#x27;s humid or foggy :o)</li>
            <li>this up with Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk - I never have to go out looking like a lion again :)</li>
            <li>Very happy with their other products.</li>
            <li>This enrire process would easily take an hour+ every day.   </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the clean factor of the Everpure, either.</li>
            <li>Maybe this shampoo works for fine hair, but not for mine.</li>
            <li>did a fine job of cleaning my hair; I used it after a workout</li>
            <li>-in-all, it&#x27;s a fine shampoo at an affordable price</li>
            <li>I have tried the conditioner which I believe leaves my hair greasy, but the shampoo is just fine in that matter.</li>
            <li>My curls and frizz can nearly make me cry or scream in frustration, but these L&#x27;Oreal products are the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smooth or soften my hair out one bit.</li>
            <li>A fantastic hair product indeed.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is sulfate and silicone free.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product is for thinner, lightly curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free products since they marketed them.</li>
            <li>fact that it is sulfate free is a huge bonus for me.</li>
            <li>So this is a good shampoo for my hair that is not harsh.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, leaves my hair feeling clean and soft, and is gentler than most.</li>
            <li>My hair felt coarse and full of fly always.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair pretty smooth!</li>
            <li>I felt the difference immediately when combing through my hair after showering, but refrained from being too excited.   </li>
            <li>)&lt;br /&gt;Frizz get reduced significantly after 2 washes.</li>
            <li>so I was somewhat sweaty, but my hair felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out cleanly without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used loads of shampoos and this is my absolute favorite sulfate free option.  </li>
            <li>In addition to frequent trims, this product has helped to restore my hair to a more healthy state.  </li>
            <li>It gets my hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like all your hairs nutrients are being stripped right in front of you!</li>
            <li>If your hair is fine, and gets greasy easily, this product might provide too much moisture for you.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for more than two years now, and I really like the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>When I use this shampoo and conditioner it seems to make the blow dry/ straight iron process faster and more</li>
            <li>Not bad though.</li>
            <li>you may want one of the other Loreal shampoo choices, but this one worked great for me.</li>
            <li>It claims to be sulfate free, but the ingredient list sure does include a lot of other chemicals, so I don&#x27;t know whether being sulfate free makes it any better for the environment or my health.  </li>
            <li>I have straight and dry hair, and this shampoo does a great job of giving my hair a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>I used the conditioner and shampoo together and still had super frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Love it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My daughter just liked the other L&#x27;Oreal products for body and volume better than this.</li>
            <li>Holy cow, my hair is so soft, sleek and smells wonderful after just one use!</li>
            <li>Normally I would saturate each section in serum to tame the frizz before drying, and then have to reapply the serum afterwards, still in hopes of the best.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found yet and worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li>It is smooth &amp; shiny &amp; hangs straight.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this Shampoo and the Conditioner and it&#x27;s made my hair look great and feel soft.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>So its more natural moisture which is healthier and better than all those chemicals other cheap brands use.</li>
            <li>And it don&#x27;t smell too pretty either.   </li>
            <li>My preference is keep my hair straight, but as we all know, curly hair and humidity always wins.</li>
            <li>make sure you&#x27;re getting the &amp;#34;EverSleek&amp;#34; Smoothing shampoo and conditioner you intend to order and not just the one with the similar bottle.</li>
            <li>it would have been very helpful!</li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more</li>
            <li>My hair was bouncy and soft, truly frizz free.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>A week of use has made my hair better, from all that heat from flat iron and dye</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t even come close to being able to smooth my hair during shampooing in the shower or during blow drying with a round brush.</li>
            <li>In future if they do make a pill to grow hair, I want my scalp to be ready and sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Also, if there&#x27;s no sulfate, why does it lather so much.</li>
            <li>I still have just as much frizz and roughness as I did before.</li>
            <li>Further, it&#x27;s also free of parabens, if that is of concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like having a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of friz by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>These products (I use both the shampoo and the conditioner) really help.</li>
            <li>My colored, course hair has improved so much in looks and feel since using this product.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this and the conditioner and finally used it today.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much of it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I found that it really doesn&#x27;t prevent frizz...</li>
            <li>If you have dry, chemically treated hair, or ethnic hair which may be a bit coarse, you will probably be moderately to very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I barely need to use a brush, my hair falls straight, even right out of bed.</li>
            <li>I have fine, dry hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to have to deal with an itchy scalp if I can&#x27;t get a decent smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li>Her hair is just as dry frizzy and coarse as the day before with just as many flyaways.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any other shampoos now since I discovered the Loreal sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo, used in conjunction with the conditioner provides adequate moisture and texture to otherwise dry hair.</li>
            <li>As I began drying the first section the difference in my hair became obvious...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d then only truly achieve frizz free hair after applying a flat iron, section by section again.</li>
            <li>I believe that this shampoo line is equal to or better than Pureology or other brands that cost upwards of $30 per bottle.</li>
            <li>I live in the Seattle area where humidity is constant and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to fight my thin, unruly curly tresses that never look good.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and find it hard to locate natural and/or organic shampoos I like.</li>
            <li>It feels soft as you rub it in your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft when I get out of the shower, and although I do use a leave-in conditioner, I don&#x27;t have to nuke my hair with spray to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>It took about a month for me to really see the change, but now I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li>It helps with keeping your hair smooth without being too heavy</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, unruly hair that I straighten</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t remember it having much of a scent at all, so I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about when they use the word \\&quot;invigorating.\\&quot; Definitely will not be buying this product.</li>
            <li>Last year I had bleached my hair several times trying to get it light enough.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money like me.</li>
            <li>It looked as if I had just had it professionally blow-dried.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered the products from Amazon and was surprised by how inexpensive they are.</li>
            <li>I love Loreal Everpure for my thick, colored hair</li>
            <li>I just hope I can get my hair back to normal again!</li>
            <li>They are really fantastic products--and I don&#x27;t think there is a product to tame unruly hair that I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>but I do not mind because the product is very reasonably priced when compared to salon or other name sulfate-free products.</li>
            <li>I was surprised since this is the same company that makes Kerastase.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly, long, coarse hair that normally blows out straight with the right products.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair with moderate frizz that I always blow dry and straight iron.</li>
            <li>I was expecting these products to make my hair silky smooth, but it leaves a coarse, dull texture and feel.</li>
            <li>I have thick somewhat curly hair (a full curl completes in about 2 inches)</li>
            <li>Today, with this new system, I not only eliminated the added serum on my hair, but was able to dry it all in less than 15 minutes with only a 2 minute flat iron touch up to straighten a few crown waves; no taming of frizzy hair needed.</li>
            <li>I wonder whether the problem some customers have is that they used too much of the product and that made their hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have long straight blonde hair that I add highlights to, so it gets frizzy and dry at times.</li>
            <li>This conditioner and shampoo made my hair dry and oddly crunchy, and did little, if anything, for frizz, which I tend to have on the top layer of my hair.</li>

            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free products since they marketed them.</li>
            <li> fact that it is sulfate free is a huge bonus for me.</li>
            <li> So this is a good shampoo for my hair that is not harsh.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, leaves my hair feeling clean and soft, and is gentler than most.</li>
            <li> My hair felt coarse and full of fly always.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair pretty smooth!</li>
            <li> I felt the difference immediately when combing through my hair after showering, but refrained from being too excited.   </li>
            <li> )&lt;br /&gt;Frizz get reduced significantly after 2 washes.</li>
            <li> so I was somewhat sweaty, but my hair felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out cleanly without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used loads of shampoos and this is my absolute favorite sulfate free option.  </li>
            <li> In addition to frequent trims, this product has helped to restore my hair to a more healthy state.  </li>
            <li> It gets my hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like all your hairs nutrients are being stripped right in front of you!</li>
            <li> If your hair is fine, and gets greasy easily, this product might provide too much moisture for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for more than two years now, and I really like the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> When I use this shampoo and conditioner it seems to make the blow dry/ straight iron process faster and more</li>
            <li> Not bad though.</li>
            <li> you may want one of the other Loreal shampoo choices, but this one worked great for me.</li>
            <li> It claims to be sulfate free, but the ingredient list sure does include a lot of other chemicals, so I don&#x27;t know whether being sulfate free makes it any better for the environment or my health.  </li>
            <li> I have straight and dry hair, and this shampoo does a great job of giving my hair a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner and shampoo together and still had super frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Love it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My daughter just liked the other L&#x27;Oreal products for body and volume better than this.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, my hair is so soft, sleek and smells wonderful after just one use!</li>
            <li> Normally I would saturate each section in serum to tame the frizz before drying, and then have to reapply the serum afterwards, still in hopes of the best.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found yet and worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> It is smooth &amp; shiny &amp; hangs straight.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this Shampoo and the Conditioner and it&#x27;s made my hair look great and feel soft.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> So its more natural moisture which is healthier and better than all those chemicals other cheap brands use.</li>
            <li> And it don&#x27;t smell too pretty either.   </li>
            <li> My preference is keep my hair straight, but as we all know, curly hair and humidity always wins.</li>
            <li> make sure you&#x27;re getting the &amp;#34;EverSleek&amp;#34; Smoothing shampoo and conditioner you intend to order and not just the one with the similar bottle.</li>
            <li> it would have been very helpful!</li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying more</li>
            <li> My hair was bouncy and soft, truly frizz free.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> A week of use has made my hair better, from all that heat from flat iron and dye</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even come close to being able to smooth my hair during shampooing in the shower or during blow drying with a round brush.</li>
            <li> In future if they do make a pill to grow hair, I want my scalp to be ready and sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Also, if there&#x27;s no sulfate, why does it lather so much.</li>
            <li> I still have just as much frizz and roughness as I did before.</li>
            <li> Further, it&#x27;s also free of parabens, if that is of concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like having a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of friz by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> These products (I use both the shampoo and the conditioner) really help.</li>
            <li> My colored, course hair has improved so much in looks and feel since using this product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this and the conditioner and finally used it today.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much of it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I found that it really doesn&#x27;t prevent frizz...</li>
            <li> If you have dry, chemically treated hair, or ethnic hair which may be a bit coarse, you will probably be moderately to very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I barely need to use a brush, my hair falls straight, even right out of bed.</li>
            <li> I have fine, dry hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to have to deal with an itchy scalp if I can&#x27;t get a decent smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> Her hair is just as dry frizzy and coarse as the day before with just as many flyaways.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other shampoos now since I discovered the Loreal sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo, used in conjunction with the conditioner provides adequate moisture and texture to otherwise dry hair.</li>
            <li> As I began drying the first section the difference in my hair became obvious...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d then only truly achieve frizz free hair after applying a flat iron, section by section again.</li>
            <li> I believe that this shampoo line is equal to or better than Pureology or other brands that cost upwards of $30 per bottle.</li>
            <li> I live in the Seattle area where humidity is constant and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to fight my thin, unruly curly tresses that never look good.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and find it hard to locate natural and/or organic shampoos I like.</li>
            <li> It feels soft as you rub it in your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft when I get out of the shower, and although I do use a leave-in conditioner, I don&#x27;t have to nuke my hair with spray to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> It took about a month for me to really see the change, but now I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> It helps with keeping your hair smooth without being too heavy</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, unruly hair that I straighten</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t remember it having much of a scent at all, so I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about when they use the word \\&quot;invigorating.\\&quot; Definitely will not be buying this product.</li>
            <li> Last year I had bleached my hair several times trying to get it light enough.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money like me.</li>
            <li> It looked as if I had just had it professionally blow-dried.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered the products from Amazon and was surprised by how inexpensive they are.</li>
            <li> I love Loreal Everpure for my thick, colored hair</li>
            <li> I just hope I can get my hair back to normal again!</li>
            <li> They are really fantastic products--and I don&#x27;t think there is a product to tame unruly hair that I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> but I do not mind because the product is very reasonably priced when compared to salon or other name sulfate-free products.</li>
            <li> I was surprised since this is the same company that makes Kerastase.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, long, coarse hair that normally blows out straight with the right products.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair with moderate frizz that I always blow dry and straight iron.</li>
            <li> I was expecting these products to make my hair silky smooth, but it leaves a coarse, dull texture and feel.</li>
            <li> I have thick somewhat curly hair (a full curl completes in about 2 inches)</li>
            <li> Today, with this new system, I not only eliminated the added serum on my hair, but was able to dry it all in less than 15 minutes with only a 2 minute flat iron touch up to straighten a few crown waves; no taming of frizzy hair needed.</li>
            <li> I wonder whether the problem some customers have is that they used too much of the product and that made their hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have long straight blonde hair that I add highlights to, so it gets frizzy and dry at times.</li>
            <li> This conditioner and shampoo made my hair dry and oddly crunchy, and did little, if anything, for frizz, which I tend to have on the top layer of my hair.</li>
            <li> The flat iron didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few days ago for my daughter who has 4a hair, When i washed her hair with this product it was oddly rough and the suds are too much</li>
            <li> My thick, curly hair has gotten more coarse and frizzier as I&#x27;ve aged into my 40s, and it&#x27;s really hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that will help keep it under control.</li>
            <li> Oh, and btw my hair type is thick and curly...and pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I have to use at least 3X as much conditioner in order to detangle it.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample of this line in the mail; not impressed.</li>
            <li> When I went to reorder, I thought this was the same bottle I was using, just slightly redesigned, as the colors and label look so similar.  </li>
            <li> any different from all the other lines I use.  </li>
            <li> and I did not like it as much as other prodcuts that I have found such as John Freida Frizz-Ease gel and L&#x27;Oreal Everstyle gel and mousse.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair also felt \\&quot;weird\\&quot; when it was dry.  </li>
            <li> I used all of the products recommended but my hair felt dry and straw like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out different amounts and techniques of applying it for a few weeks now, but I get the same result each time.</li>
            <li> I am guessing nothing will ever really tame my frizz especially as the weather turns humid, but I recently found myself on a trip, all products forgotten at home, and bought this shampoo, along with the conditioner and the anti-humidity cream, in a supermarket.</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy, damaged, and/or dry hair, try this product!</li>
            <li> I actually threw the bottles out after one week of use, because I couldn&#x27;t subject myself to this anymore.   </li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would be a better product than similar, less expensive products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo and conditioning system on my long, thick, wavy hair, I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> It makes me sick smelling it all day and touching my hair is a no-no because it just feels like I dunked my head in a vat of grease.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate with very hard water.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, virgin hair that is extremely long and has just a tiny bit of wave to it.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair dry, frizzy and dull.</li>
            <li> Discovered it in Mexico City, and can&#x27;t use any other now.</li>
            <li> being said I don&#x27;t have curly hair or extremely frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> (costs &amp;#62; S$20 at a local department store, and hard to find..</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I had just used too much product, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have thick, wavy, coarse hair, which is prone to frizziness in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to see my money go down the drain.</li>
            <li> After shampooing and conditioning, my hair felt very rough and not clean at all.</li>
            <li> As usual, I sectioned my hair off to dry in stages.</li>
            <li> Now mind you, my hair was one notch below a brillo pad so using the shampoo and conditioner along with the previous keratin treatment did the trick.</li>
            <li> i feel like it made my hair smoother and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> There are many reviews praising this product and several others saying it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> It has no sulfates as you know, and a little argan oil...</li>
            <li> Too bad this shampoo missed the opportunity of serving me in golden days.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, and I felt the need to counter the bad reviews and offer some hope to my frizz-prone friends.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> It made my hair heavy and look greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so heavy and greasy</li>
            <li> It is 100% Vegan with natural botanicals and oils, so one can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Noticed no more shine or sleekness as promised.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have gone back to Pantene.  </li>
            <li> It was one of the worst, most drying shampoos I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of wasting my money on.</li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with it because it is too late for me to return it</li>
            <li> Particularly this one is the worst product since- hair feels like dry rope.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and frizzy, so if yours is as well, keep looking.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp too oily and thick.</li>
            <li> And while I realize a larger print ingredient list would be impossible on these tubes, putting the fact that this product contains Citronella in</li>
            <li> Not only did my hair tangle up so bad that no amount of SLEEK conditioner helped.  </li>
            <li> this stuff SUCKS!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the absolute WORST shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It was not shiny anymore and just looked unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> It got worse as the day went by.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally do this, but this product was so horrible</li>
            <li> I was so upset that my hair looked and felt like crap all day long.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for very expensive products that promise to do miracles and never do.</li>
            <li> Once I lost all my hair I was always looking for something that would provide nutrition to the faint follicles which , according to George, resemble remnants of a society that was once thriving.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner product team has proven to ba a miracle for my thin yet ultra defiant curly hair!</li>
            <li> I used it for almost 2 months and my hair just seemed to get progressively worse!  </li>
            <li> When I went to use it, I knew something was up -- the results were horrible compared with the last bottle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this as well as I hoped I would.</li>
            <li> My hair made me so uncomfortable all day</li>
            <li> I have been buying expensive salon brands for years.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that there are not any artificial dyes in this product, as I sometimes have reactions to those.</li>
            <li> Product along with conditioner made hair feel like it still hade product in it after it was washed out and dried...very unhappy with it</li>
            <li> After using the leave-in-creme and blow drying, my hair looked greasy and dirty.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks, it leaves my hair feeling dead, greasy and it looks absolutely nasty.</li>
            <li> so for me it&#x60;s very difficult to find some products.</li>
            <li> It horribly tangles my hair and makes it so tough.  </li>
            <li> and I used it 2 days in a row, didn&#x27;t do anything bad, just didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> hated it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!</li>
            <li> but that comes with a nasty greasy feeling too.</li>
            <li> My hair got to the point of looking disgusting</li>
            <li> Nope, I&#x27;m just out of ways to say nasty now.</li>
            <li> After the salon permed my hair too soon after having highlights my hair has been horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo and matching conditioner works wonderfully on my keratin treated hair.  I came across it while researching sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners and happen to like Loreal for the most part and decided to give it a try.  Now mind you, my hair was one notch below a brillo pad so using the shampoo and conditioner along with the previous keratin treatment did the trick. My hair is so healthy and looks the best it has in years. Yes, most times I have to lather twice but I do not mind because the product is very reasonably priced when compared to salon or other name sulfate-free products. Plus, this shampoo does lather as most sulfate-free products do not. This shampoo is good if you are after a sleeker look.  If you prefer more bounce to you hair you may want one of the other Loreal shampoo choices, but this one worked great for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair dry and frizzy.  I hate it.  For the record, I have thick, wavy, coarse hair, which is prone to frizziness in humid weather.  Maybe this shampoo works for fine hair, but not for mine.</li>
            <li> Once I lost all my hair I was always looking for something that would provide nutrition to the faint follicles which , according to George, resemble remnants of a society that was once thriving. With no hair to come in between the scalp and shampoo, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. It smells great and from what I can tell people with hair (ready my wife) seem to love it. If I had hair, I am sure it would have looked great. Too bad this shampoo missed the opportunity of serving me in golden days. I still enlist its services from time to time. In future if they do make a pill to grow hair, I want my scalp to be ready and sulfate free.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is effective at keeping my hair clean.  It claims to be sulfate free, but the ingredient list sure does include a lot of other chemicals, so I don&#x27;t know whether being sulfate free makes it any better for the environment or my health.  I think it lathers nicely, even though I&#x27;ve heard people complain about sulfate-free shampoos not lathering well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is the best, and healthiest, of the cheap smoothing shampoos. It did make my hair pretty smooth! It feels soft as you rub it in your hair. It has no sulfates as you know, and a little argan oil...and I think olive oil in it. So its more natural moisture which is healthier and better than all those chemicals other cheap brands use. Im not quite sure I would recommend the conditioner though. Its okay, not as good as the shampoo. Not bad though. Oh, and btw my hair type is thick and curly...and pretty dry. So this is a good shampoo for my hair that is not harsh.</li>
            <li> If it was possible for me to give this product 0 stars, I would.   This is one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. It horribly tangles my hair and makes it so tough.  I have to use at least 3X as much conditioner in order to detangle it. Also, if there&#x27;s no sulfate, why does it lather so much. I&#x27;ve used WEN, which truly has no soap ingredient, and it doesn&#x27;t lather. Ever.   It didn&#x27;t smooth or soften my hair out one bit. I still have just as much frizz and roughness as I did before. And it don&#x27;t smell too pretty either.   I actually threw the bottles out after one week of use, because I couldn&#x27;t subject myself to this anymore.   Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo, but there&#x27;s nothing remarkable about it. In fact, there are several L&#x27;Oreal shampoos out there that perform very similarly to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this along with the conditioner and leave-in treatment from the same product line. I thought the fragrance was acceptable -- noticeable, but not too strong, and I found the scent to be pleasant. I appreciate that there are not any artificial dyes in this product, as I sometimes have reactions to those. Being sulfate-free, this should be safe for color-treated hair. Further, it&#x27;s also free of parabens, if that is of concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did a fine job of cleaning my hair; I used it after a workout so I was somewhat sweaty, but my hair felt clean after using it. It did not have the best lather of any sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but the lather was acceptable. It rinsed out cleanly without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, it&#x27;s a fine shampoo at an affordable price and I would consider using it again in the future.</li>
            <li> My thick, curly hair has gotten more coarse and frizzier as I&#x27;ve aged into my 40s, and it&#x27;s really hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that will help keep it under control. I really don&#x27;t like having a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of friz by the end of the day. These products (I use both the shampoo and the conditioner) really help. My hair feels soft when I get out of the shower, and although I do use a leave-in conditioner, I don&#x27;t have to nuke my hair with spray to keep it under control. Hooray!</li>
            <li> My colored, course hair has improved so much in looks and feel since using this product. It is the only product I use for my hair anymore. A fantastic hair product indeed.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m very glad with this product. I have a curly hair...so for me it&#x60;s very difficult to find some products. After use this shampoo...the result is amazing, my hair is very soft and with good aspect.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is a good seller.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample of this line in the mail; not impressed. It didn&#x27;t do anything as promised. It was enough for 2 uses and I used it 2 days in a row, didn&#x27;t do anything bad, just didn&#x27;t do anything any different from all the other lines I use.  Noticed no more shine or sleekness as promised.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> OMG! This shampoo and conditioner product team has proven to ba a miracle for my thin yet ultra defiant curly hair! I live in the Seattle area where humidity is constant and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to fight my thin, unruly curly tresses that never look good. My preference is keep my hair straight, but as we all know, curly hair and humidity always wins. I picked up this shampoo/conditioner set after returning another brand I thought I&#x27;d try (but couldn&#x27;t stand the smell) and I am SO glad I did!!! I felt the difference immediately when combing through my hair after showering, but refrained from being too excited.   As usual, I sectioned my hair off to dry in stages. As I began drying the first section the difference in my hair became obvious...  Normally I would saturate each section in serum to tame the frizz before drying, and then have to reapply the serum afterwards, still in hopes of the best. I&#x27;d then only truly achieve frizz free hair after applying a flat iron, section by section again. This enrire process would easily take an hour+ every day.   Today, with this new system, I not only eliminated the added serum on my hair, but was able to dry it all in less than 15 minutes with only a 2 minute flat iron touch up to straighten a few crown waves; no taming of frizzy hair needed. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair today even after walking throughout downtown in raining weather!  All in all, I&#x27;m SOLD!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the absolute WORST shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not only did my hair tangle up so bad that no amount of SLEEK conditioner helped.  My hair also felt \\&quot;weird\\&quot; when it was dry.  It was not shiny anymore and just looked unhealthy.  I used it for almost 2 months and my hair just seemed to get progressively worse!  Needless to say, I have gone back to Pantene.  I noticed a difference after just 1 wash/condition.  I just hope I can get my hair back to normal again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for abotu 6 months and I have noticed such a difference in my hair. It is smooth &amp; shiny &amp; hangs straight. I wish I had this as a kid! I barely need to use a brush, my hair falls straight, even right out of bed. It&#x27;s amazing what a difference there has been since I have started using it. It took about a month for me to really see the change, but now I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Reparative Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, which did wonders for my fine, frizzy hair.  When I went to reorder, I thought this was the same bottle I was using, just slightly redesigned, as the colors and label look so similar.  When I went to use it, I knew something was up -- the results were horrible compared with the last bottle.  It was only when I was in a drugstore that I spotted that &amp;#34;Reparative Smoothing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Intense Smoothing&amp;#34; formulas are different.  Don&#x27;t make my mistake -- make sure you&#x27;re getting the &amp;#34;EverSleek&amp;#34; Smoothing shampoo and conditioner you intend to order and not just the one with the similar bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, virgin hair that is extremely long and has just a tiny bit of wave to it. I live in a very dry climate with very hard water. This product left my hair dry, frizzy and dull.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this as well as I hoped I would. I used all of the products recommended but my hair felt dry and straw like. I love everything I&#x27;ve ever used from L&#x27;Oreal, just not this line.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I have found in my price range that will work on my unruly, curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever!!!!</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel like straw ... blonde straw. It was one of the worst, most drying shampoos I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of wasting my money on.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT buy this on Amazon! So this is NOT a rip on Amazon or the selIers of this item! This is a rip of L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I (98% of the time) love L&#x27;oreal products, but I have to say after paying what I did and using your L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek...this stuff SUCKS! And while I realize a larger print ingredient list would be impossible on these tubes, putting the fact that this product contains Citronella in it would have been very helpful! I don&#x27;t know how many people this was tested on, but there are a lot of people allergic to it. I thought I was trying to wash my hair, not repel mosquitoes! If I could return this, I would.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other shampoos now since I discovered the Loreal sulfate free products.  This one in particular give alot of volume and keeps the frizzies away when it&#x27;s humid or foggy :o)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I Use it every day!  Discovered it in Mexico City, and can&#x27;t use any other now.</li>
            <li> I have used loads of shampoos and this is my absolute favorite sulfate free option.  It worked wonderfully when my hair was waist length or chin length, and worked well for my husband as well.  Some issues with shipping but Amazon corrected it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for more than two years now, and I really like the feel of my hair. I have straight and dry hair, and this shampoo does a great job of giving my hair a smooth feel. I have tried the conditioner which I believe leaves my hair greasy, but the shampoo is just fine in that matter.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would be a better product than similar, less expensive products I&#x27;ve used in the past. Nope. L&#x27;Oreal has disappointed me. I used the conditioner and shampoo together and still had super frizzy hair. Even their serum isn&#x27;t all that its cracked up to be for the price.     My hair is thick and frizzy, so if yours is as well, keep looking.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo and conditioning system on my long, thick, wavy hair, I was not pleased. It made my hair heavy and look greasy. It claims to have frizz-control, but it made my hair even more frizzy than it was before I used it. I thought maybe I had just used too much product, but I was wrong. I&#x27;ve been trying out different amounts and techniques of applying it for a few weeks now, but I get the same result each time. Now I am stuck with it because it is too late for me to return it and I don&#x27;t want to see my money go down the drain. I have been in search of a good quality product for months now. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few days ago for my daughter who has 4a hair, When i washed her hair with this product it was oddly rough and the suds are too much, it&#x27;s like all your hairs nutrients are being stripped right in front of you! The suds and soaps went on and on which is great if you like to look at soap but not so much if you want a product that works. Her hair is just as dry frizzy and coarse as the day before with just as many flyaways.</li>
            <li> Some shampoos will make my head itch and flake. This one doesn&#x27;t do that. It has a nice clean smell but not overwhelming. It helps with keeping your hair smooth without being too heavy</li>
            <li> I love Loreal Everpure for my thick, colored hair so I decided to try Ever Sleek. I have naturally curly, unruly hair that I straighten so I&#x27;m always looking for good products. This stuff is horrible! My hair felt so heavy and greasy the minute I was done drying it.  It got worse as the day went by. My hair made me so uncomfortable all day and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it. Yeah, I guess it was sleek but that comes with a nasty greasy feeling too.</li>
            <li> Product along with conditioner made hair feel like it still hade product in it after it was washed out and dried...very unhappy with it</li>
            <li> I have been buying expensive salon brands for years.  I believe that this shampoo line is equal to or better than Pureology or other brands that cost upwards of $30 per bottle.</li>
            <li> This conditioner and shampoo made my hair dry and oddly crunchy, and did little, if anything, for frizz, which I tend to have on the top layer of my hair. I love the L&#x27;oreal EverSleek hair serum, so I assumed this would be great too, but nope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going out of my way to review this product... It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, when visiting my sister I used her shampoo because I didn&#x27;t feel like packing my own. I have long straight blonde hair that I add highlights to, so it gets frizzy and dry at times. Holy cow, my hair is so soft, sleek and smells wonderful after just one use! If you have frizzy, damaged, and/or dry hair, try this product!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this EverSleek line. I was expecting these products to make my hair silky smooth, but it leaves a coarse, dull texture and feel.I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo, conditioner and leave-in-creme. I wouldn&#x27;t normally do this, but this product was so horrible I felt obligated to share my experience. After shampooing and conditioning, my hair felt very rough and not clean at all. After using the leave-in-creme and blow drying, my hair looked greasy and dirty. I was so upset that my hair looked and felt like crap all day long. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out. And I don&#x27;t remember it having much of a scent at all, so I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about when they use the word \\&quot;invigorating.\\&quot; Definitely will not be buying this product.</li>
            <li> Last year I had bleached my hair several times trying to get it light enough. My hair got to the point of looking disgusting so I just stopped bleaching and added a shade of red on using Henna. I recently bought this Shampoo and the Conditioner and it&#x27;s made my hair look great and feel soft. Happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in my 19 years of life. (Or rather 4, for I didn&#x27;t care before..)&lt;br /&gt;Frizz get reduced significantly after 2 washes. A week of use has made my hair better, from all that heat from flat iron and dye jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ it&#x27;s inexpensive here! (costs &amp;#62; S$20 at a local department store, and hard to find..)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m stocking my supplies for this!&lt;br /&gt;Pair this up with Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk - I never have to go out looking like a lion again :)</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this and the conditioner and finally used it today. (3/2/14) I didn&#x27;t think much of it. I didn&#x27;t expect much of it. After all, it is just another shampoo. Is it perfect? No. Does it feel nice and smell good? Yes. I also like the fact that it is sulfate and silicone free. The price isn&#x27;t too bad either. It is 100% Vegan with natural botanicals and oils, so one can&#x27;t go wrong. I used it with the conditioner (see separate review) which was also a good product. I&#x27;m happy. I have fine, straight hair and find it hard to locate natural and/or organic shampoos I like. For me, this is one I will keep in mind when making shampoo purchases.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for me, I like it and the conditioner, as well. I have no problem purchasing it or recommending it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used the Loreal Everpure products and wasn&#x27;t particularly pleased with the smell so I went with this on my next purchase. I&#x27;m allergic to sulfates so I&#x27;ve been buying Loreal for a while. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the clean factor of the Everpure, either. I should have stuck with it! This stuff stinks, it leaves my hair feeling dead, greasy and it looks absolutely nasty. I have fine, dry hair so I thought this would work. Nope, I&#x27;m just out of ways to say nasty now. Between this and that Karatin Garbage that&#x27;s low-sulfate that Suave make I&#x27;ve gone off sulfate-free. I&#x27;m just going to have to deal with an itchy scalp if I can&#x27;t get a decent smelling shampoo. It makes me sick smelling it all day and touching my hair is a no-no because it just feels like I dunked my head in a vat of grease. It&#x27;s just gross and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these 3 items as a hair treatment to replace my Brazilian blowout products and Matrix SleekLook. They didn&#x27;t even come close to being able to smooth my hair during shampooing in the shower or during blow drying with a round brush. The flat iron didn&#x27;t help. My hair felt coarse and full of fly always. I was surprised since this is the same company that makes Kerastase. I returned all 3, the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in creme. I have thick, curly, long, coarse hair that normally blows out straight with the right products. I re-ordered Kerastase Oleo Relax and Slim. It&#x27;s much more expensive but works every time. Maybe this product is for thinner, lightly curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick somewhat curly hair (a full curl completes in about 2 inches) and I used this shampoo with conditioner for 3 weeks. There was no difference, my hair was still frizzy and unruly.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp too oily and thick.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free products since they marketed them. Very happy with their other products. Particularly this one is the worst product since- hair feels like dry rope. I did not send them back but trashed them. Please do not waste your money like me.</li>
            <li> After the salon permed my hair too soon after having highlights my hair has been horrible.  In addition to frequent trims, this product has helped to restore my hair to a more healthy state.  Love that it is sulfate free!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. i feel like it made my hair smoother and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;That being said I don&#x27;t have curly hair or extremely frizzy hair. I have wavy hair with moderate frizz that I always blow dry and straight iron. When I use this shampoo and conditioner it seems to make the blow dry/ straight iron process faster and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is sulfate free is a huge bonus for me.</li>
            <li> There are many reviews praising this product and several others saying it&#x27;s horrible. What&#x27;s the truth? Well, it all depends on the type of hair you have. If you have dry, chemically treated hair, or ethnic hair which may be a bit coarse, you will probably be moderately to very pleased with this product. If your hair is fine, and gets greasy easily, this product might provide too much moisture for you. The shampoo, used in conjunction with the conditioner provides adequate moisture and texture to otherwise dry hair. In applying the conditioner, I immediately noticed a difference in the softness of my hair. I have been struggling with dryness in my hair. No matter what the product, my hair would still feel thirsty. I now realize that the sulfates in my prior shampoos and condtioners were drying out my hair. I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with this product. And plan to continue to use as a shampoo and conditioner. For extra moisture, I use a another product as a deep conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and easily damaged, but it has a good amount of curl to it and so tends to be voluminous and frizzy. This is easily the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found yet and worth the extra few bucks. It smells nice, leaves my hair feeling clean and soft, and is gentler than most.</li>
            <li> My daugher and I have both used this product.  I found that it really doesn&#x27;t prevent frizz...and I did not like it as much as other prodcuts that I have found such as John Freida Frizz-Ease gel and L&#x27;Oreal Everstyle gel and mousse.  My daughter just liked the other L&#x27;Oreal products for body and volume better than this.</li>
            <li> Bought this. Used it. hated it. Left my hair feeling dirtier than before I washed with it. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love it I definitely will be buying more I love how it keeps my hair smelling and feeling after a wash</li>
            <li> I am guessing nothing will ever really tame my frizz especially as the weather turns humid, but I recently found myself on a trip, all products forgotten at home, and bought this shampoo, along with the conditioner and the anti-humidity cream, in a supermarket. They are really fantastic products--and I don&#x27;t think there is a product to tame unruly hair that I haven&#x27;t tried. My hair was bouncy and soft, truly frizz free. It looked as if I had just had it professionally blow-dried. I immediately ordered the products from Amazon and was surprised by how inexpensive they are. I was in a rush and hadn&#x27;t paid any attention to price in the store. I am a sucker for very expensive products that promise to do miracles and never do. I wonder whether the problem some customers have is that they used too much of the product and that made their hair feel weighed down. My curls and frizz can nearly make me cry or scream in frustration, but these L&#x27;Oreal products are the best I have found so far. I rarely write reviews, and I felt the need to counter the bad reviews and offer some hope to my frizz-prone friends.</li>
            <li> Product works well for my hair for keeping curls without frizzing horridly on humid days.  It gets my hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li> Love it leaves my hair soft and smooth. This is the only shampoo I use since I discovered it.</li>
