            <li>Great product as per my wife.</li>
            <li>This makeup is great</li>
            <li>I am sincerely happy.</li>
            <li>but I love the foundation!!</li>
            <li>This is the best foundation ever, covers all flaws and has gives a smooth look to your skin!</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and evenly and hides the imperfections wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this at a discount store once and liked</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and cheaper than at another website.</li>
            <li>It is very light, you don&#x27;t feel like you have a mask on your face, it covers all flaws perfectly and it gives your skin a smooth and fresh look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and am so pleased, that my mom has now made a purchase, and I will be making more.</li>
            <li>Love the brush applicator.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I got it on time.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is great and reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li>I love it,.</li>
            <li>Love the easy application with the attached brush.</li>
            <li>I had noticed that you couldn&#x27;t see my fine lines AT ALL, and was sooo pleased, but didn&#x27;t want to give a review until I had it on for an extended period to see how it held up.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is smooth and not make me break out, good covered and stayed on a whole day.</li>
            <li>Happy to be able to get a little stock pile online</li>
            <li>Great foundation for dry skin.</li>
            <li>delivery was fast, I had this in 3 days, with free shipping with my order!</li>
            <li>The brush on top turns out to be a real pain to use.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the brush at the top (that you really can&#x27;t wash well)</li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>Absolutely does all a girl could ask for ... thank you L&#x27;Oreal Visible Lift for a light, all day foundation.  </li>
            <li>Second, I am a blonde with green eyes, so I&#x27;m very light skinned, and this color is a perfect match!</li>
            <li>I really liked the first batch of this makeup that I received, but this batch seems a bit thick and doesn&#x27;t want to get into the brush without many turns</li>
            <li>When I read some of the complaints I realize people are not using it properly, and if they used it correctly they would love it too.</li>
            <li>First things first...</li>
            <li>And that what was described was exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup and have made a second purchase.  </li>
            <li>so I have a few stubborn fine lines, mostly between my eyebrows and smile lines, and I used this for the first time yesterday to go meet my daughter&#x27;s new teacher, and before I left the house</li>
            <li>I Really like this make up -- wish they hadn&#x27;t stopped making it.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li>and when I did too much came out.</li>
            <li>Product was in fact sealed and brand new when it arrived to me also.</li>
            <li>I know sometimes you&#x27;re playing with fire when ordering things online, but this was definitely brand new, and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>Third, I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>

            <li> This is the best foundation ever, covers all flaws and has gives a smooth look to your skin! I have used lots of expensive foundations, but none of them gave me this effect. It is very light, you don&#x27;t feel like you have a mask on your face, it covers all flaws perfectly and it gives your skin a smooth and fresh look. I&#x27;ve been buying this foundation since 2011 and I will keep on purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Love the brush applicator.</li>
            <li> I Really like this make up -- wish they hadn&#x27;t stopped making it. Happy to be able to get a little stock pile online</li>
            <li> Great product as per my wife. She loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, a little lighter coverage.  Stores in my area no longer carry this product.</li>
            <li> This makeup is great it goes on smooth and evenly and hides the imperfections wonderfully. When I read some of the complaints I realize people are not using it properly, and if they used it correctly they would love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is smooth and not make me break out, good covered and stayed on a whole day.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the brush at the top (that you really can&#x27;t wash well) but I love the foundation!! I used my sponge to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im in the over 50 crowd,it evened out my skin tone, didn&#x27;t feel dry or cakey. I&#x27;ll order again!</li>
            <li> I like the brush on the applicator. Some of the time , It breaks and you can not get to the end of the bottle. However,  I still prefer this color and applicator.</li>
            <li> Could not find this in the stores and that seems to be the case lately I find makeup I like and I go back to repurchase and they no longer stock it ..Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this at a discount store once and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I could never find it locally again so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and cheaper than at another website.</li>
            <li> I don´t know how use it.</li>
            <li> Great foundation for dry skin. Quick shipping</li>
            <li> First things first...delivery was fast, I had this in 3 days, with free shipping with my order! Second, I am a blonde with green eyes, so I&#x27;m very light skinned, and this color is a perfect match! Third, I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s so I have a few stubborn fine lines, mostly between my eyebrows and smile lines, and I used this for the first time yesterday to go meet my daughter&#x27;s new teacher, and before I left the house I had noticed that you couldn&#x27;t see my fine lines AT ALL, and was sooo pleased, but didn&#x27;t want to give a review until I had it on for an extended period to see how it held up. Well, I was at my daughter&#x27;s school for an hour, and then her and I went for dinner, and then on the way home we stopped in at my mom&#x27;s house, just to say hey and hang out for a few. Once I got home I checked to see if I was still covered, (or if I needed a touch up) and I was still covered an still no fine lines. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and am so pleased, that my mom has now made a purchase, and I will be making more. Product was in fact sealed and brand new when it arrived to me also. I know sometimes you&#x27;re playing with fire when ordering things online, but this was definitely brand new, and worked like a charm. I definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in this product. The brush on top turns out to be a real pain to use. I had a hard time getting it to work and when I did too much came out.</li>
            <li> I really liked the first batch of this makeup that I received, but this batch seems a bit thick and doesn&#x27;t want to get into the brush without many turns</li>
            <li> Love the easy application with the attached brush. Eliminates pulling on your skin with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation, extremely disappointed it has been discontinued but Amazon to rescue as usual</li>
            <li> Absolutely does all a girl could ask for ... thank you L&#x27;Oreal Visible Lift for a light, all day foundation.  All those pesky imperfections just seem to disappear with almost no effort at all.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I got it on time. And that what was described was exactly what I got. I am sincerely happy.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup and have made a second purchase.  I will continue to buy it.  I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I do not like this at all. It&#x27;s so thick and you can tell your wearing it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all. Looks like you need to scrap it off with a putty knife.</li>
            <li> It is great and reasonable in price.  I love it,.</li>
