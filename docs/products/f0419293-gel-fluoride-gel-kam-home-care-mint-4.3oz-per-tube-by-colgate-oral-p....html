            <li>This product is very, very sticky!</li>
            <li>I had to have a crown put in for one of my front teeth, and it became even more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon it by accident at a local drug store, and I came to Amazon to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Better price then my local pharmacy.</li>

            <li>It would help if they could find a way to make the product thicker and less runny so it would stay on my teeth and in place and work better.  </li>

            <li>I have sensitive teeth  (or maybe gums?)</li>
            <li>Just the ticket for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>All you do is brush the sensitive area with the gel, leave it on for a minute and then rinse.  </li>

            <li>According to her, this product worked wonders with her sensitive teeth, so based on that fact alone, I am giving this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>As for helping the sensitivity, I do find that if I use this for a few days the sensitivity is better, but once I stop using it, the sensitivity problem comes back within a few days.</li>

            <li> and nightly use of this product helps to make them less sensitive.</li>
            <li> You have to keep using this product ongoing to get long term relief.</li>
            <li> Has worked very well to slow the decay of my daughter&#x27;s teeth from acid reflux symptoms.</li>
            <li> It can (and maybe does) contribute to making teeth less white however</li>
            <li> Talked to the dentist and unfortunately it seems to be a trait of high fluoride products, but it is only necessary to let it sit for 30 minutes</li>
            <li> When I got back, it took about a week of using the Gel Kam heavily to get rid of my sensitivity..  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get the product to stay on my teeth very long to provide much long lasting relief.</li>
            <li> Also it would be helpful if this was sold over the counter on the shelf with other teeth sensitivity products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yuck also to the slightly salty taste you have to suffer through for 30 minutes ...with no mint or other flavor for distraction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always use it after brushing and it cuts down on my cavities.</li>
            <li> Prepare for a gooey mess.  </li>
            <li> I find that if I apply it with a Q-tip is stays put a little longer than if I apply with a toothbrush as recommended.</li>
            <li> This gel probably does the technical job, but it was impossible to put it on a brush without getting this clear, sticky, slimy gel on the tube or the counter or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I needed the water a few degrees warmer).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not as effective as Prevident.</li>
            <li> Its 0.4% concentration is weak in comparison to Prevident&#x27;s 1.1%.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the pharmacist has it behind his counter, but there is no reason you should have to ask and bother the pharmacist for this, nor do you need a prescription from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It is so messy I hate to deal with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product smells and tastes terrible.</li>

            <li> This really works.  I have sensitive teeth  (or maybe gums?) and nightly use of this product helps to make them less sensitive. Hooray!  It can (and maybe does) contribute to making teeth less white however (the package does warn of this), so probably take other steps to keep your teeth happy white with prolonged use of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product been using for years</li>
            <li> This product is the best! I stumbled upon it by accident at a local drug store, and I came to Amazon to purchase more. It has relieved tooth pain from which I have been suffering for years. I&#x27;ve been using numerous products for sensitivity, and while they&#x27;ve been helpful, they didn&#x27;t solve the problem. Gel-Kam has finally put this problem to rest and did so immediately. I noticed a difference after the first use, and after the second use, I knew I was well on my way to finding true relief. The only thing I regret is not having been introduced to this product sooner. It tastes great, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it works!</li>
            <li> I always use it after brushing and it cuts down on my cavities.</li>
            <li> This product is very, very sticky! It has the consistency of runny maple syrup and it gets all over my hands, all over the tube, bathroom vanity, and my lips! It is hard to get the product to stay on my teeth very long to provide much long lasting relief. I find that if I apply it with a Q-tip is stays put a little longer than if I apply with a toothbrush as recommended. As for helping the sensitivity, I do find that if I use this for a few days the sensitivity is better, but once I stop using it, the sensitivity problem comes back within a few days. You have to keep using this product ongoing to get long term relief. It is so messy I hate to deal with this product.  It would help if they could find a way to make the product thicker and less runny so it would stay on my teeth and in place and work better.  Also it would be helpful if this was sold over the counter on the shelf with other teeth sensitivity products. Sometimes, the pharmacist has it behind his counter, but there is no reason you should have to ask and bother the pharmacist for this, nor do you need a prescription from the dentist. Sell it over the counter and reduce the price. It tends to be quite pricey!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist to prevent gum erosion, and it appears to have worked wonders. I am getting great reports from my dental hygienist since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this item to me over 25 years ago.  Been using it every since and it eliminates the sensitivity.  I recommended it to a friend who use to have a cavity with every dental visit.  Has not had a cavity since he started using this product three years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gel-Kam for years. It&#x27;s the only product that seems to help tooth sensitivity for me. I recommend this and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> Just the ticket for sensitive teeth. Makes you forget that you have them.</li>
            <li> This product really works well in treating sensitive teeth.  I highly recommend it for periodic sensitivity with your teeth.  All you do is brush the sensitive area with the gel, leave it on for a minute and then rinse.  I ordered this product through Amazon because I could no longer obtain it through my local pharmacy.  The order was completed quickly, shipped and received in 3-5 business days.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive teeth. I had to have a crown put in for one of my front teeth, and it became even more sensitive. Room temperature water was bothering it (I needed the water a few degrees warmer). I was in so much pain. My dentist recommended this on top of the Sensodyne I usually use, and it was a godsend. It lowered my teeth sensitivity dramatically within days. I&#x27;m still not biting into any ice cream cones (and never will), but can drink my coffee and refrigerated drinks without pain.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years</li>
            <li> This is not the 1.1% prescription strength product you get from the Dentist.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a while now. Don&#x27;t have enough input by my dentist to know if it is making a big difference. My dentist is the one who told me to use this.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this years ago for my sensitive teeth. As long as I use it daily, my teeth don&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve tried stopping, but my teeth start hurting again. I don&#x27;t like the idea of using flouride daily, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Has worked very well to slow the decay of my daughter&#x27;s teeth from acid reflux symptoms. So glad that we were&lt;br /&gt;able to buy another tube.</li>
            <li> This product smells and tastes terrible. Talked to the dentist and unfortunately it seems to be a trait of high fluoride products, but it is only necessary to let it sit for 30 minutes and then you can brush it out with real toothpaste.</li>
            <li> great if you need extra help to keep your teeth strong and protected. easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Gel-Kam does work as advertised. Brushing it on teeth applies fluoride to strengthen the enamel. Unfortunately it is not as effective as Prevident. Its 0.4% concentration is weak in comparison to Prevident&#x27;s 1.1%.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many years and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mom. She said she couldn&#x27;t find it locally and the dentist wanted over $20.00 to order it for her. This is a great value if this product is recommended for you.</li>
            <li> Good product recommended by my dentist. Seems like it will last a long time. Better price then my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Yuck.  Prepare for a gooey mess.  This gel probably does the technical job, but it was impossible to put it on a brush without getting this clear, sticky, slimy gel on the tube or the counter or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck also to the slightly salty taste you have to suffer through for 30 minutes ...with no mint or other flavor for distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a wasteful person so it pained me to finally throw out the 90% full tube.  The product development team needs to get going with a project for &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week.  Easy to apply.  However, too soon to say if it&#x27;s working.  Will need 6 months and my next visit to my dentist to know for sure if it&#x27;s working on my sensitive teeth.  Check back with me then.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years because I am &amp;#34;long in the tooth&amp;#34; and have very sensitive teeth.  I recently went away for a week and forgot my Gel Kam.  When I got back, it took about a week of using the Gel Kam heavily to get rid of my sensitivity..  I will never forget to take it along again!</li>
            <li> works well good taste</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a family member had has sensitive teeth. According to her, this product worked wonders with her sensitive teeth, so based on that fact alone, I am giving this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this product isn&#x27;t actually a toothpaste that you&#x27;re supposed to brush/clean your teeth with. It&#x27;s somewhat of a topical gel/cream that you brush on and leave on for a short duration. In the end, you spit it out.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly and correct item......</li>
            <li> GOOD Trade  FAST shipment............TANKS</li>
            <li> Purchased at the recommendation of our dentist.</li>
