            <li>Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li>Although this reduces the efficiency of the sharpener it is still a good product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Good luck, hope it works for you.</li>
            <li>Iexpected not all all good</li>
            <li>Fancier razors like Mach 3 by Gillette, fair.</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I love it, sharpens the blades great for womens use.</li>
            <li>I was spending 100&#x27;s of $ on razor blades at the time and said to myself &amp;#34;hell if it even has a 10% chance of working then it will be worth buying for 19.99&amp;#34; so I did and it worked perfect for over a year till I dropped it and broke it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it was just excellent, feeling very smooth, sometimes not so smooth (on the face)</li>
            <li>Sometimes it was just excellent, feeling very smooth, sometimes not so smooth (on the face)</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found these available on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind of product, but who knows maybe it sharpens blades like there&#x27;s no tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps, have a nice day.</li>
            <li>I had owned one for a couple years and liked how it extended the life of blades.      </li>
            <li>so I figured I should buy my own.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my own razors but the wife likes her&#x27;s sharpened this way as well.  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and I save a ;lot of money because I don&#x27;t have to purchase razor blades very often.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just seemed like to good to be true.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to place my blade in the sharpener, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver as good as when the razor does when I first have used it on the face and skin of my body.</li>
            <li>I somehow convinced myself in a greed of getting more than 200 saves with just one blade and started calculating my savings for 1, 2, 3 years and so on.</li>
            <li>I had looked into buying one of these but decided not to since most reviews confirm his findings</li>
            <li>It claims you can get up to 75 uses out of a blade, and more conservatively, 30</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel quite like a brand-new blade, more like one that I&#x27;ve used maybe once.</li>
            <li>It was a kind of cheap product.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>and this time it was much better.</li>
            <li>(I keep a one week beard most of the time).</li>
            <li>(I keep a one week beard most of the time).</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth a try, some people get good savings from it.  </li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>well Ok it didn&#x27;t, AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Most do not work.  </li>
            <li>: spend the $20 on a couple more blades, and skip this product.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to learn &amp;#34;the touch&amp;#34; of a DE razor, they&#x27;ll be some nicks, but after that, it is actually a much, much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love infomercials and that is where I found this POS.  </li>
            <li>Use a butter knife and you can sharpen your blade better.  </li>
            <li>I had one before for many years.</li>
            <li>and they love it too.</li>
            <li>Bought one many years ago and used one blade for over a year.</li>
            <li>There have been so many As Seen On TV products that haven&#x27;t delivered the promise as they have claimed to have shown.</li>
            <li>There are better things to get with your money from</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything they say it is and was delivered promptly, but - I just don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought three more for my Sons as a Xmas Stocking Stuffer.</li>
            <li>Call me satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am trying to buy 3 more for gifts.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at first, but wears out easily.</li>
            <li>and I love a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I got a very clean shave.</li>
            <li>I Bought this item about 2 months ago and it is 1 of the best things I have used in A long time.</li>
            <li>I have been able to get a comfortable shave from 1 blade for 3 - 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that they are still available on the market.  </li>
            <li>It is the best money that I ever spent.</li>
            <li>so I could return it easily.</li>
            <li>Paying for itself very quickly.</li>
            <li>As good as from a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And my shaves wouldn&#x27;t be a good as when the blade is brand new.</li>
            <li>And my shaves wouldn&#x27;t be a good as when the blade is brand new.</li>
            <li>and they all seemed to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I used it, it resored the edge just fine.  </li>
            <li>Works as perscribed , bought as a gift for someone, they say it works fine .</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap and easy.</li>
            <li>It sharpens my razor quickly and provides for a much better shaving experience, and results.</li>
            <li>Truly one of the best little gadgets I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>That is still a huge savings so this is very cost effective.</li>
            <li>and they definitely won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>For me, it works FABULOUSLY.</li>
            <li>Save a Blade seems to work for a couple of extra shaves and thats great news.  </li>
            <li>package and product seems cheap.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>Anyway, the joy I felt when I inserted the Mach 3 into this device was palpable.</li>
            <li>However, I was intrigued, and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I had better success.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Last week I bought TWO HUNDRED DE blades, a well respected brand, a great sale admittedly, for under $25, bottom line.</li>
            <li>MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;IT SHAVES SMOOTH EACH TIME WITH OUT</li>
            <li>Last week I bought TWO HUNDRED DE blades, a well respected brand, a great sale admittedly, for under $25, bottom line.</li>
            <li>He buys the cheap throw-away razors and reuses them by sharpening them with this.</li>
            <li>Did not work and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Think what a true money saver it would be if the manufacturer could correct the problem of one honing strip becoming detached.</li>
            <li>I have used the same blade for 13 weeks and still get a great shave.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good by frequent razor buying.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about purchasing this item</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this as Gillette is competing with the gas companies on who will make me broke quicker.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product many years ago, when it first appeared on the market.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it to clean rusty blade.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use and clean and store.</li>
            <li>to keep your razor clean then hone with the sharpener.</li>
            <li>I can sharpen my blades maybe once or twice at best before they stay dull.  </li>
            <li>Maybe normally I can get 3 good shaves tops without sharpening, so this really didn&#x27;t do anything.    </li>
            <li>and I started to reuse the blades (I had a bag full of them, about 400).</li>
            <li>Amazon should NOT sell this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  A good friend of mine also bought this a couple of years ago and had the same experience.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product my Gillette Mach 4 would be good for about 1 week.  </li>
            <li>full well it would never work.  </li>
            <li>This one is much more powerful and sharpens better then the one I purchased several months ago.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I have been very satisfied with both.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;That was the reason I purchased this thing in the first place\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>And I had to drag the razor over my face more and more each use.    </li>
            <li>But with the price of blades it was a worth while purchase</li>
            <li>And for the price I pay for Gillette Fusion blades, I thought they were worth a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Your money is better spent on more razors than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and try at the cost of Gillette blades.</li>
            <li>Is it honestly worth the money?</li>
            <li>I started with a fresh blade and used the sharpener.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>AND A HALF &amp; STILL CONTINUES TO RESHARPEN SUCCESSFULLY.  </li>
            <li>But I remembered some of the reviews here mentioning something about using it right, and inserting the blades right.</li>
            <li>It is June 2010 right now.   </li>
            <li>it was not running right</li>
            <li>With save-a-blade, I can easily get 30 shaves that are pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Eventually the battery died, and I was able to get 2 more for significantly less money.  </li>
            <li>I have previous experience with this sharpener and it does an excellent job on keeping a blade sharpened if used regularly.</li>
            <li>Inserted the blades,... pulled the handle of my Gillette Fusion down, hoping this would get the blades in the right position, and then pressed the button for a good 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>When I clean that off the shaft, the drum inside spins like new.  </li>
            <li>I first bought Save a Blade from a pharmacy to try it.  </li>
            <li>Not to sure how it works for ladies, seen some BIG OLE&#x27; razors for that</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as prescribed (even got on their website to confirm before I used it).</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s available online and clearly shows the damage I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered my 2nd save a blade just to be safe.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that most people did not actually read and follow the directions.</li>
            <li>first thought when I received</li>
            <li>I suppose it needs some getting used to, and you need to figure out, how exactly to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I suppose it needs some getting used to, and you need to figure out, how exactly to use it.  </li>
            <li>Rinse in hot water before and after use.  </li>
            <li>First one I had lasted 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the first blade That came with my 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li>I use Gillette Fusion blades and after the first 3 or 4 shaves use  Save a Blade for every shave after that.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 3 years.</li>
            <li>If you position the razor opposite of what is indicated in the manual, you might find better results.</li>
            <li>Sounds funny</li>
            <li>but itâ€™s actually a real stress reliever!</li>
            <li>Used it the first day I got it, and it never worked again.</li>
            <li>I FIRST BROUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN WALLGREES 7 YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li>I CAN USE THE SAME BLADE FOR MORE THAN A</li>
            <li>DRAG.I WISH THAT I INVENTED IT FIRST.</li>
            <li>He said the first didn&#x27;t work after he dropped it in the water.</li>
            <li>When I first received Save A Blade, it did not seem to sharpen the blade at all.</li>
            <li>After the first week it pays for itself....</li>
            <li>I deleted how to sharpen the blades..seems no one was interested..</li>
            <li>I suggest you look for something better, or simply say no period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I have to reinsert the blade a few times over in the sharpener, till it feels good.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to reinsert the blade a few times over in the sharpener, till it feels good.</li>
            <li>I can not say that the blade returns to a new state but the blade gets me a very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>it does practically nothing, actually; it can&#x27;t produce any pressure worth mentioning to smooth the blade.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Besides I based my assessment on previous reviews and this will encourage the manufacturer to maintain a high quality product and retain a good reputation.</li>
            <li>it felt more and more dull and was less effective.</li>
            <li>I really like this item it works very well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how long I can use the sharpener.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m not quite sure how long I can use the sharpener.</li>
            <li>great product helps keep my razor blades sharp last three times longer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review because today I am ordering a second one in case this item should be discontinued, even though my first one still works fine.</li>
            <li>Your average disposables will fit fine, as well as the Gillette brand (Fusion, ProGlide, etc.).</li>
            <li>But if you use a regular size razor it should work for the gals just fine.  </li>
            <li>This product has re-sharpened my razors (3-blade disposables) so much so that a package of 8 lasts me about a year.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The merchant however was very prompt in giving the refund.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know about the product quality, but shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I saw this on TV, and then saw it at the drug store for not too much, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>don&#x60;t know how much</li>
            <li>it really works.  </li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t ready for that yet.</li>
            <li>Very cautiously I tried it,.....</li>
            <li>The firsat time I used it, it felt like a really overdue blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheaply Made-in-China unit, apparently by different factories who then slap the \\&quot;Save-A-Blade\\&quot; name on it.</li>
            <li>I cant tell you how much $$$$ this has saved over the venus razor blades.</li>
            <li>I am thankful this product was invented, because it has saved me much money.</li>
            <li>It saves me so much money.</li>
            <li>Amazon made fast delivery.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s all just hype to make you pay a fortune for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s all just hype to make you pay a fortune for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li>With the price of razor blades these days it is really a saver..</li>
            <li>The type of replacement blades he buys cost nearly $15, so he really appreciates this product.</li>
            <li>These things really work and save you money on blades.</li>
            <li>probly cus the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>(I think it&#x27;s stainless steel) with as much pressure as you think the piddly plastic hinges on the razor will handle.</li>
            <li>Does it really deliver its promise?</li>
            <li>REALLY SAVES A LOT OF MONEY ON BLADES.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do anything really</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Once it even modified the blade so that with every stroke, the blade left a perfect straight line of whiskers behind.  </li>
            <li>I am a sucker for things that talk a good talk.  </li>
            <li>I honestly say if you use disposable razors, don&#x27;t waste your time here.</li>
            <li>that most consumers do not take the time to look for other options, he/</li>
            <li>that most consumers do not take the time to look for other options, he/</li>
            <li>The shave that I got from a relatively old blade was okay but not quite the same as a brand new blade.</li>
            <li>He has taken it apart and trying to clean up now putting it back together.  </li>
            <li>I have owned one previously and they really add a lot of shaves to the blade, shaving you from buying more blades.</li>
            <li>This product is a true blue money saver!!!</li>
            <li>Mostly because the structure of the blade begins to break down.</li>
            <li>Not like a new blade, but can give you more life out of your other blades.</li>
            <li>Old-school flat DE (double-edge) blades cost incredibly less and, after the learning curve, yield up a superior shave.</li>
            <li>Old-school flat DE (double-edge) blades cost incredibly less and, after the learning curve, yield up a superior shave.</li>
            <li>I am completely delighted with it and feel as if I&#x27;m winning against the razor-blade companies, who overcharge so badly for their product.</li>
            <li>No it won&#x27;t give you 200 shaves on one blade, but I do get 30 decent shave with one.</li>
            <li>, cartridge blades are also total rip-off, incredibly overpriced.</li>
            <li>, cartridge blades are also total rip-off, incredibly overpriced.</li>
            <li>Used it and it sharpened an older razor i had.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to those of the penny pinching bent.</li>
            <li>With the price of razors going sky high</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that my expectations were too high.  </li>
            <li>Sharpen the razor when it&#x27;s new, then before every shave and it will feel like a new razor every time!</li>
            <li>thing is complete and absolute junk.  </li>
            <li>Considering the low price, this product is well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>I was expecting like new blades and it was only capable of keeping blades usably sharp, and in the end I realized that was ok, the blades did work, and I was saving money.</li>
            <li>it is back together and running right now but for a new product makes me wonder.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, on the basis of in-home testing, it will sharpen Bic disposables credibly.  </li>
            <li>It makes brand new mach 3 blade feel like it has been used 200 times already.</li>
            <li>and so then I start with a new blade.  </li>
            <li>I used it with a blade I was already using, and was about to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li>Although the instructions say you need to use it with new blades.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it with a new blade after my 1st try.</li>
            <li>After all this was a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Now every shave is like I just used a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After all this was a new blade.    </li>
            <li>Now every shave is like I just used a new blade.     </li>
            <li>My husband is amazed that he hasn&#x27;t had to buy new blades for months.</li>
            <li>So if you live with others, I suggest using it at a time when no one is trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>I start with a new blade, and once its sharpness begins to tapper off</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work, even on relatively new blades</li>
            <li>I owned this product for about 4 years and decided I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>When I found it on amazon I immediately ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t go for over a week with a new blade.</li>
            <li>I took a unit home and was very suspicious that this thing really did all that it said, but, (as another view said) if it sharpened just half as well as they claimed, it would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Three weeks extra use out of a blade that I probably used three weeks in it&#x27;s first life and after sitting in a bathroom drawer for two years is phenominal, so I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 3 months, and it really does work!</li>
            <li>I did as instructed but to my dismay the instructions said not to use old razors!</li>
            <li>I bought this, I also bought another called Razor Saver at the same time, figuring that one of them would be better than the other.</li>
            <li>But months later I was out of new cartridges, wasn&#x27;t planning on going to the store, and gave it another shot and to my surprise discovered that it really does work</li>
            <li>Also, they question the Dallas-based distributor about the tests and the answers they got back were pure bologna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, they question the Dallas-based distributor about the tests and the answers they got back were pure bologna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A razor blade can be used for weeks, with just A quick sharpening after shaving (the blade must be kept sharp).</li>
            <li>and after that it just seemed to cut me more than even a dull blade.  </li>
            <li>They advertise that this product works on EVERY blade, but if you read the instructions, it clearly states that their product does not work on blades that have the safety wires on them.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t advertise that they were old stock from 2008.</li>
            <li>the battery it came with had leaked in the packaging its so old.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to throw it in the garbage yet, so I gave it a 2nd try.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to wow me.</li>
            <li>It is fairly loud.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sharpen week old blades.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sharpen three day old blades.  </li>
            <li>Also, they directly lie in the instructions.</li>
            <li>took a product home and used it on some old razors that I had</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>All you have to do is insert your old razor head into the slot while still attached to the razor post for about 30 seconds and</li>
            <li>i belieave the save a blade people developed this knowing</li>
            <li>Instead of falling for scams like this gizmo, magnetic sharpeners and such ... start looking at a high-quality stainless steel DE \\&quot;safety</li>
            <li>I chose this rating on the basis of what looked like a durable product although it&#x27;s early days.</li>
            <li>This is my second Save-A-Blade and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually sharpened the razor, but it smoothed the bumps and oxidation (which does occur, even on stainless steel) off of it and improved the edge.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>That is far from the 200 times that was advertised when I bought it.</li>
            <li>What a waste of money that i could&#x27;ve used to go get a fantastic meal at Ihop.</li>
            <li>For the low price of this product, it works very well.</li>
            <li>The first blade I started using had absolutely no lubrication strip left, so it had been very well used as I often get 2-3 weeks out of new blades.  </li>
            <li>I was very saddened, as I really depend on mine for keeping my razor sharp.  </li>
            <li>It definitely sharpens razors pretty well, but, with the initial $20 price tag and the batteries you use, and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for personal use and also for gifts!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my personal habit to daily run that razor  over my head, sometimes a couple of times a day, to keep it clean and  smooth, and Save A Blade makes my Mach III blades last up to a month at least before I feel a tugging or dragging  occur and sharpening doesn&#x27;t seem to help anymore,</li>
            <li>Not sure if my Gillette Fusion blades would fit.</li>
            <li>My first one fell in the sink, got wet, and so no longer is functional</li>
            <li>Normal wear and tear out of my razors, used properly and read the directions</li>
            <li>I was better off using a regular dull blade than using a blade that had been \\&quot;sharpened\\&quot; with Save A Blade.</li>
            <li>I gave the Save A Blade 4 stars because it obviously does not return the blade to new, but it does keep it within tolerances where I can get a close satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li>the fact that it wears out because it uses little pieces of 600 grit sand paper, it just isn&#x27;t worth it in my view.  </li>
            <li>This product works great a few times of sharpening you old blades, but afterward it fails to bring the blade back to like new quality.</li>
            <li>Is this not the exact polar opposite of the intended purpose for this save a blade thingy?  </li>
            <li>and it clearly shows the blade edge is totally destroyed by the device ...</li>
            <li>and it clearly shows the blade edge is totally destroyed by the device ...</li>
            <li>Make sure you wet the blade or use a small amount of clipper oil.</li>
            <li>Especially when they are nearly twenty dollars for 4 blades.</li>
            <li>I just bought the same razor as my husband and sharpen his old razor blades when hes done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought an old fashioned double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>No patents to pay for on the old fashioned blades which helps make the double triple, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this thing and tried it for a week, only to completely give up on it.  </li>
            <li>Still,... normally I already would have replace the blade long ago.</li>
            <li>Still,... normally I already would have replace the blade long ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK, not great.</li>
            <li>I thought if it makes my blades last even 50% longer, it would be worth the money, but I did try it for two weeks, and it did seem to make the blade last a little longer, thought it did not feel like a new blade.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll buy new blades, and guess what, after daily use 2 weeks later it extended the life of the blade,</li>
            <li>Not only does not sharpen your razor, it actually made a new razor unusable after one shave.</li>
            <li>was very skeptical at first and wasn&#x27;t sure to order it or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product actually made the blades I was using worse than better.  </li>
            <li>The little stropping strip that rotates inside to hone the blades ripped apart on my first unit after about 7 months.</li>
            <li>It saves you money the end, but you wont get the closeness that a new blade offers after a few uses of this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old Gillette single edge, steel, safety razor</li>
            <li>My resharpened blades just weren&#x27;t anything like as sharp as new cartridges.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my razor blade just like new and you only have to use it about every other day.</li>
            <li>But it does keep the blades sharp enough to shave without pulling, which used to be when I&#x27;d change blades to new ones.  </li>

            <li> I was spending 100&#x27;s of $ on razor blades at the time and said to myself &amp;#34;hell if it even has a 10% chance of working then it will be worth buying for 19.99&amp;#34; so I did and it worked perfect for over a year till I dropped it and broke it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it was just excellent, feeling very smooth, sometimes not so smooth (on the face)</li>
            <li> Sometimes it was just excellent, feeling very smooth, sometimes not so smooth (on the face)</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found these available on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kind of product, but who knows maybe it sharpens blades like there&#x27;s no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps, have a nice day.</li>
            <li> I had owned one for a couple years and liked how it extended the life of blades.      </li>
            <li> so I figured I should buy my own.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my own razors but the wife likes her&#x27;s sharpened this way as well.  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and I save a ;lot of money because I don&#x27;t have to purchase razor blades very often.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just seemed like to good to be true.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to place my blade in the sharpener, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver as good as when the razor does when I first have used it on the face and skin of my body.</li>
            <li> I somehow convinced myself in a greed of getting more than 200 saves with just one blade and started calculating my savings for 1, 2, 3 years and so on.</li>
            <li> I had looked into buying one of these but decided not to since most reviews confirm his findings</li>
            <li> It claims you can get up to 75 uses out of a blade, and more conservatively, 30</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel quite like a brand-new blade, more like one that I&#x27;ve used maybe once.</li>
            <li> It was a kind of cheap product.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> and this time it was much better.</li>
            <li> (I keep a one week beard most of the time).</li>
            <li> (I keep a one week beard most of the time).</li>

            <li> OK...</li>
            <li> well Ok it didn&#x27;t, AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Most do not work.  </li>
            <li> : spend the $20 on a couple more blades, and skip this product.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to learn &amp;#34;the touch&amp;#34; of a DE razor, they&#x27;ll be some nicks, but after that, it is actually a much, much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Use a butter knife and you can sharpen your blade better.  </li>
            <li> I had one before for many years.</li>
            <li> and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Bought one many years ago and used one blade for over a year.</li>
            <li> There have been so many As Seen On TV products that haven&#x27;t delivered the promise as they have claimed to have shown.</li>
            <li> There are better things to get with your money from</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything they say it is and was delivered promptly, but - I just don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought three more for my Sons as a Xmas Stocking Stuffer.</li>
            <li> Call me satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am trying to buy 3 more for gifts.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at first, but wears out easily.</li>
            <li> and I love a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I got a very clean shave.</li>
            <li> I Bought this item about 2 months ago and it is 1 of the best things I have used in A long time.</li>
            <li> I have been able to get a comfortable shave from 1 blade for 3 - 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that they are still available on the market.  </li>
            <li> It is the best money that I ever spent.</li>
            <li> so I could return it easily.</li>
            <li> Paying for itself very quickly.</li>
            <li> As good as from a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Truly one of the best little gadgets I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> That is still a huge savings so this is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> and they definitely won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> For me, it works FABULOUSLY.</li>
            <li> Save a Blade seems to work for a couple of extra shaves and thats great news.  </li>
            <li> package and product seems cheap.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> Anyway, the joy I felt when I inserted the Mach 3 into this device was palpable.</li>
            <li> However, I was intrigued, and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I had better success.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Last week I bought TWO HUNDRED DE blades, a well respected brand, a great sale admittedly, for under $25, bottom line.</li>
            <li> MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;IT SHAVES SMOOTH EACH TIME WITH OUT</li>
            <li> Last week I bought TWO HUNDRED DE blades, a well respected brand, a great sale admittedly, for under $25, bottom line.</li>
            <li> He buys the cheap throw-away razors and reuses them by sharpening them with this.</li>
            <li> Did not work and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Think what a true money saver it would be if the manufacturer could correct the problem of one honing strip becoming detached.</li>
            <li> I have used the same blade for 13 weeks and still get a great shave.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good by frequent razor buying.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about purchasing this item</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this as Gillette is competing with the gas companies on who will make me broke quicker.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product many years ago, when it first appeared on the market.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it to clean rusty blade.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Simple to use and clean and store.</li>
            <li> to keep your razor clean then hone with the sharpener.</li>
            <li> I can sharpen my blades maybe once or twice at best before they stay dull.  </li>
            <li> Maybe normally I can get 3 good shaves tops without sharpening, so this really didn&#x27;t do anything.    </li>
            <li> and I started to reuse the blades (I had a bag full of them, about 400).</li>
            <li> Amazon should NOT sell this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  A good friend of mine also bought this a couple of years ago and had the same experience.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product my Gillette Mach 4 would be good for about 1 week.  </li>
            <li> full well it would never work.  </li>
            <li> This one is much more powerful and sharpens better then the one I purchased several months ago.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I have been very satisfied with both.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;That was the reason I purchased this thing in the first place\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> And I had to drag the razor over my face more and more each use.    </li>
            <li> But with the price of blades it was a worth while purchase</li>
            <li> And for the price I pay for Gillette Fusion blades, I thought they were worth a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Your money is better spent on more razors than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and try at the cost of Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> Is it honestly worth the money?</li>
            <li> I started with a fresh blade and used the sharpener.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> AND A HALF &amp; STILL CONTINUES TO RESHARPEN SUCCESSFULLY.  </li>
            <li> But I remembered some of the reviews here mentioning something about using it right, and inserting the blades right.</li>
            <li> It is June 2010 right now.   </li>
            <li> it was not running right</li>
            <li> With save-a-blade, I can easily get 30 shaves that are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Eventually the battery died, and I was able to get 2 more for significantly less money.  </li>
            <li> I have previous experience with this sharpener and it does an excellent job on keeping a blade sharpened if used regularly.</li>
            <li> Inserted the blades,... pulled the handle of my Gillette Fusion down, hoping this would get the blades in the right position, and then pressed the button for a good 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> When I clean that off the shaft, the drum inside spins like new.  </li>
            <li> I first bought Save a Blade from a pharmacy to try it.  </li>
            <li> Not to sure how it works for ladies, seen some BIG OLE&#x27; razors for that</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as prescribed (even got on their website to confirm before I used it).</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s available online and clearly shows the damage I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered my 2nd save a blade just to be safe.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that most people did not actually read and follow the directions.</li>
            <li> first thought when I received</li>
            <li> I suppose it needs some getting used to, and you need to figure out, how exactly to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I suppose it needs some getting used to, and you need to figure out, how exactly to use it.  </li>
            <li> Rinse in hot water before and after use.  </li>
            <li> First one I had lasted 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the first blade That came with my 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> I use Gillette Fusion blades and after the first 3 or 4 shaves use  Save a Blade for every shave after that.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 3 years.</li>
            <li> If you position the razor opposite of what is indicated in the manual, you might find better results.</li>
            <li> Sounds funny</li>
            <li> but itâ€™s actually a real stress reliever!</li>
            <li> Used it the first day I got it, and it never worked again.</li>
            <li> I FIRST BROUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN WALLGREES 7 YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> I CAN USE THE SAME BLADE FOR MORE THAN A</li>
            <li> DRAG.I WISH THAT I INVENTED IT FIRST.</li>
            <li> He said the first didn&#x27;t work after he dropped it in the water.</li>
            <li> When I first received Save A Blade, it did not seem to sharpen the blade at all.</li>
            <li> After the first week it pays for itself....</li>
            <li> I deleted how to sharpen the blades..seems no one was interested..</li>
            <li> I suggest you look for something better, or simply say no period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I have to reinsert the blade a few times over in the sharpener, till it feels good.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to reinsert the blade a few times over in the sharpener, till it feels good.</li>
            <li> I can not say that the blade returns to a new state but the blade gets me a very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> it does practically nothing, actually; it can&#x27;t produce any pressure worth mentioning to smooth the blade.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Besides I based my assessment on previous reviews and this will encourage the manufacturer to maintain a high quality product and retain a good reputation.</li>
            <li> it felt more and more dull and was less effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this item it works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how long I can use the sharpener.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not quite sure how long I can use the sharpener.</li>
            <li> great product helps keep my razor blades sharp last three times longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because today I am ordering a second one in case this item should be discontinued, even though my first one still works fine.</li>
            <li> Your average disposables will fit fine, as well as the Gillette brand (Fusion, ProGlide, etc.).</li>
            <li> But if you use a regular size razor it should work for the gals just fine.  </li>
            <li> This product has re-sharpened my razors (3-blade disposables) so much so that a package of 8 lasts me about a year.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The merchant however was very prompt in giving the refund.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know about the product quality, but shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> I saw this on TV, and then saw it at the drug store for not too much, so I bought it.</li>
            <li> don&#x60;t know how much</li>
            <li> it really works.  </li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t ready for that yet.</li>
            <li> Very cautiously I tried it,.....</li>
            <li> The firsat time I used it, it felt like a really overdue blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheaply Made-in-China unit, apparently by different factories who then slap the \\&quot;Save-A-Blade\\&quot; name on it.</li>
            <li> I cant tell you how much $$$$ this has saved over the venus razor blades.</li>
            <li> I am thankful this product was invented, because it has saved me much money.</li>
            <li> It saves me so much money.</li>
            <li> Amazon made fast delivery.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s all just hype to make you pay a fortune for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s all just hype to make you pay a fortune for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li> With the price of razor blades these days it is really a saver..</li>
            <li> The type of replacement blades he buys cost nearly $15, so he really appreciates this product.</li>
            <li> These things really work and save you money on blades.</li>
            <li> probly cus the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s stainless steel) with as much pressure as you think the piddly plastic hinges on the razor will handle.</li>
            <li> Does it really deliver its promise?</li>
            <li> REALLY SAVES A LOT OF MONEY ON BLADES.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything really</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Once it even modified the blade so that with every stroke, the blade left a perfect straight line of whiskers behind.  </li>
            <li> I am a sucker for things that talk a good talk.  </li>
            <li> I honestly say if you use disposable razors, don&#x27;t waste your time here.</li>
            <li> that most consumers do not take the time to look for other options, he/</li>
            <li> that most consumers do not take the time to look for other options, he/</li>
            <li> The shave that I got from a relatively old blade was okay but not quite the same as a brand new blade.</li>
            <li> He has taken it apart and trying to clean up now putting it back together.  </li>
            <li> I have owned one previously and they really add a lot of shaves to the blade, shaving you from buying more blades.</li>
            <li> This product is a true blue money saver!!!</li>
            <li> Mostly because the structure of the blade begins to break down.</li>
            <li> Not like a new blade, but can give you more life out of your other blades.</li>
            <li> Old-school flat DE (double-edge) blades cost incredibly less and, after the learning curve, yield up a superior shave.</li>
            <li> Old-school flat DE (double-edge) blades cost incredibly less and, after the learning curve, yield up a superior shave.</li>
            <li> I am completely delighted with it and feel as if I&#x27;m winning against the razor-blade companies, who overcharge so badly for their product.</li>
            <li> No it won&#x27;t give you 200 shaves on one blade, but I do get 30 decent shave with one.</li>
            <li> , cartridge blades are also total rip-off, incredibly overpriced.</li>
            <li> , cartridge blades are also total rip-off, incredibly overpriced.</li>
            <li> Used it and it sharpened an older razor i had.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to those of the penny pinching bent.</li>
            <li> With the price of razors going sky high</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just that my expectations were too high.  </li>
            <li> Sharpen the razor when it&#x27;s new, then before every shave and it will feel like a new razor every time!</li>
            <li> thing is complete and absolute junk.  </li>
            <li> Considering the low price, this product is well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I was expecting like new blades and it was only capable of keeping blades usably sharp, and in the end I realized that was ok, the blades did work, and I was saving money.</li>
            <li> it is back together and running right now but for a new product makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, on the basis of in-home testing, it will sharpen Bic disposables credibly.  </li>
            <li> It makes brand new mach 3 blade feel like it has been used 200 times already.</li>
            <li> and so then I start with a new blade.  </li>
            <li> I used it with a blade I was already using, and was about to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li> Although the instructions say you need to use it with new blades.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it with a new blade after my 1st try.</li>
            <li> After all this was a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Now every shave is like I just used a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After all this was a new blade.    </li>
            <li> Now every shave is like I just used a new blade.     </li>
            <li> My husband is amazed that he hasn&#x27;t had to buy new blades for months.</li>
            <li> So if you live with others, I suggest using it at a time when no one is trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> I start with a new blade, and once its sharpness begins to tapper off</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, even on relatively new blades</li>
            <li> I owned this product for about 4 years and decided I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> When I found it on amazon I immediately ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go for over a week with a new blade.</li>
            <li> I took a unit home and was very suspicious that this thing really did all that it said, but, (as another view said) if it sharpened just half as well as they claimed, it would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Three weeks extra use out of a blade that I probably used three weeks in it&#x27;s first life and after sitting in a bathroom drawer for two years is phenominal, so I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 3 months, and it really does work!</li>
            <li> I did as instructed but to my dismay the instructions said not to use old razors!</li>
            <li> I bought this, I also bought another called Razor Saver at the same time, figuring that one of them would be better than the other.</li>
            <li> But months later I was out of new cartridges, wasn&#x27;t planning on going to the store, and gave it another shot and to my surprise discovered that it really does work</li>
            <li> Also, they question the Dallas-based distributor about the tests and the answers they got back were pure bologna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, they question the Dallas-based distributor about the tests and the answers they got back were pure bologna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A razor blade can be used for weeks, with just A quick sharpening after shaving (the blade must be kept sharp).</li>
            <li> and after that it just seemed to cut me more than even a dull blade.  </li>
            <li> They advertise that this product works on EVERY blade, but if you read the instructions, it clearly states that their product does not work on blades that have the safety wires on them.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t advertise that they were old stock from 2008.</li>
            <li> the battery it came with had leaked in the packaging its so old.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready to throw it in the garbage yet, so I gave it a 2nd try.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to wow me.</li>
            <li> It is fairly loud.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sharpen week old blades.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sharpen three day old blades.  </li>
            <li> Also, they directly lie in the instructions.</li>
            <li> took a product home and used it on some old razors that I had</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is insert your old razor head into the slot while still attached to the razor post for about 30 seconds and</li>
            <li> i belieave the save a blade people developed this knowing</li>
            <li> Instead of falling for scams like this gizmo, magnetic sharpeners and such ... start looking at a high-quality stainless steel DE \\&quot;safety</li>
            <li> I chose this rating on the basis of what looked like a durable product although it&#x27;s early days.</li>
            <li> This is my second Save-A-Blade and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually sharpened the razor, but it smoothed the bumps and oxidation (which does occur, even on stainless steel) off of it and improved the edge.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> That is far from the 200 times that was advertised when I bought it.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money that i could&#x27;ve used to go get a fantastic meal at Ihop.</li>
            <li> For the low price of this product, it works very well.</li>
            <li> The first blade I started using had absolutely no lubrication strip left, so it had been very well used as I often get 2-3 weeks out of new blades.  </li>
            <li> I was very saddened, as I really depend on mine for keeping my razor sharp.  </li>
            <li> It definitely sharpens razors pretty well, but, with the initial $20 price tag and the batteries you use, and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for personal use and also for gifts!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my personal habit to daily run that razor  over my head, sometimes a couple of times a day, to keep it clean and  smooth, and Save A Blade makes my Mach III blades last up to a month at least before I feel a tugging or dragging  occur and sharpening doesn&#x27;t seem to help anymore,</li>
            <li> Not sure if my Gillette Fusion blades would fit.</li>
            <li> My first one fell in the sink, got wet, and so no longer is functional</li>
            <li> Normal wear and tear out of my razors, used properly and read the directions</li>
            <li> I was better off using a regular dull blade than using a blade that had been \\&quot;sharpened\\&quot; with Save A Blade.</li>
            <li> I gave the Save A Blade 4 stars because it obviously does not return the blade to new, but it does keep it within tolerances where I can get a close satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li> the fact that it wears out because it uses little pieces of 600 grit sand paper, it just isn&#x27;t worth it in my view.  </li>
            <li> This product works great a few times of sharpening you old blades, but afterward it fails to bring the blade back to like new quality.</li>
            <li> Is this not the exact polar opposite of the intended purpose for this save a blade thingy?  </li>
            <li> and it clearly shows the blade edge is totally destroyed by the device ...</li>
            <li> and it clearly shows the blade edge is totally destroyed by the device ...</li>
            <li> Make sure you wet the blade or use a small amount of clipper oil.</li>
            <li> Especially when they are nearly twenty dollars for 4 blades.</li>
            <li> I just bought the same razor as my husband and sharpen his old razor blades when hes done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought an old fashioned double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> No patents to pay for on the old fashioned blades which helps make the double triple, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing and tried it for a week, only to completely give up on it.  </li>
            <li> Still,... normally I already would have replace the blade long ago.</li>
            <li> Still,... normally I already would have replace the blade long ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK, not great.</li>
            <li> I thought if it makes my blades last even 50% longer, it would be worth the money, but I did try it for two weeks, and it did seem to make the blade last a little longer, thought it did not feel like a new blade.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll buy new blades, and guess what, after daily use 2 weeks later it extended the life of the blade,</li>
            <li> Not only does not sharpen your razor, it actually made a new razor unusable after one shave.</li>
            <li> was very skeptical at first and wasn&#x27;t sure to order it or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product actually made the blades I was using worse than better.  </li>
            <li> The little stropping strip that rotates inside to hone the blades ripped apart on my first unit after about 7 months.</li>
            <li> It saves you money the end, but you wont get the closeness that a new blade offers after a few uses of this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old Gillette single edge, steel, safety razor</li>
            <li> My resharpened blades just weren&#x27;t anything like as sharp as new cartridges.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my razor blade just like new and you only have to use it about every other day.</li>
            <li> But it does keep the blades sharp enough to shave without pulling, which used to be when I&#x27;d change blades to new ones.  </li>
            <li> Instead of falling for scams like this gizmo, magnetic sharpeners and such ... start looking at a high-quality stainless steel DE &amp;#34;safety razor.&amp;#34; They go for $30 to $50, which you will &amp;#34;earn back&amp;#34; very quickly on the much less expensive blades.</li>
            <li> A fresh, sharp blade every few days.  </li>
            <li> This item cuts down on my buying new blades every month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Gi11ette has, over the years, simply bullied old-school flat double-edge &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; blades off of the retail shelves of America.</li>
            <li> Because any competitor can make a regular flat DE razor blade without violating a Gi11ette patent.</li>

            <li> My previous purchase of this product lasted 3 years &amp; saved hundreds of dollars in purchase new costs.</li>
            <li> Every few weeks I take the unit apart and clean the tiny metal shaft with a rough paper towel because the rotation slows down a bit from rust on the shaft.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll save a small fortune along the way.art looking at a high-quality stainless steel DE \\&quot;safety</li>
            <li> And I was wondering how long it would last.</li>
            <li> And I was wondering how long it would last.</li>
            <li> I am 77 years old and shave every day and this has cut down my cost by I</li>
            <li> My common sense told me that companies like Gillete would have put machines worth millions of dollars to get that sharp edge and a simple device can&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was not new (previously opened and printing scratched off) but the product looked new.  </li>
            <li> Then recently I decided to put some water (enough to make it wet or running water) over the Save A Blade with the shaver in place, and then running it for 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> It was too fragile and did not live up to it&#x27;s billing.</li>
            <li> instructions are not very clear.</li>
            <li> Seriously I bought one when it first came out in 20092009</li>
            <li> suspect that other users that gave &#x27;Shave A Blade&#x27; may not of left the blade heads in the devise long enough or</li>
            <li> We always added water when sharpening just enough so that it is wet - never understood why; but that&#x27;s the conclusion that I came up with</li>
            <li> Hope it works because he has had one of these for a long time.  </li>
            <li> buy the seller crap and good luck.keep</li>
            <li> One new blade will last me at least 15-20 times longer, before I eventually throw it away.</li>
            <li> Two and a half years later I still use the same blades I purchased with the Save a Blade.  </li>
            <li> This way it&#x27;s always sharp for the next time.  </li>
            <li> I can see how men wouldnt think it is sharp enough for their face.</li>
            <li> However, for my three blade razors (probably due to the larger surface area of each razor)</li>
            <li> Perhaps, the other users did not \\&quot;mount\\&quot; their razor properly in the holder, and therefore it sharpened at an incorrect angle, therefore dulling the blade.  </li>
            <li> Just wet the razor, hold flat and press the button sharpen the blades.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, due to convenience and ease of use.</li>
            <li> This product does not hold up very long.</li>
            <li> I often use the blade on dry skin for touch ups around my mustache and neck</li>
            <li> As a blade sharpened it was not good enough, so I keep  using new brand blades.</li>
            <li> Do I use it till the batteries run out, and then get a new one (because it might have become dull itseld?), or do I just replace the batteries and continue using it?</li>

            <li> You should sharpen before and after you shave oncee your new razor starts to dull.</li>
            <li> &quot; They go for $30 to $50, which you will \\&quot;earn back\\&quot; very quickly on the much less expensive blades.</li>

            <li> If you expect this doo-hickie to give you that same quality shave you will be let down.</li>
            <li> But after getting this product I was so disappointed and wasted some of my brand new Mach 3 blades giving this product chance many times.</li>
            <li> Also when I ordered it, it was less then ten box.</li>
            <li> Then, after only about three weeks of use the small piece on the inside that actually spins and sharpens the blade broke.</li>
            <li> This should last me one to one and a half years.  </li>
            <li> I am ordering my 3rd save a blade as I have worn out the 2 previous ones.  </li>
            <li> Blades are only slightly  improved.  </li>
            <li> It striped the white gel stip off and ground down the little rubber fins on my double gillette blades.</li>
            <li> she will certainly lose business for giving a false impression of the product should it not be durable as expected.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, so I used the same Target brand double razor about 5 times, sharpening before each use, before it started cutting my neck up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the rubber flaps that sharpen the blades stripped (after 2yrs of use mind you) but for $10 thats not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Overall I saw a few design flaws (the battery compartment was close to the area that comes in contact with water and was not sealed off) and</li>
            <li> after each shave while the blade is still wet  </li>
            <li> The blade should be wet to sharpen as they recommend.</li>
            <li> This item fits only a few sizes of razors.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that for my four and five blade razors the effect was minimal.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and change blades only once every four months.</li>
            <li> If you use this device as directed, and wet the blade before sharpening, it will save you a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This automatic razor sharpener tries to get rid of the dullness that can wear on from your razors after time and use.</li>
            <li> This one was bought as a spare in case they are not available when the one I am using breaks or wears out in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving a small fortune by not having to continually buy Mach III blades so often that get dull so fast.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it does on other blades, but certainly not the ones we tried.</li>
            <li> May be this product works for other products but not atleast Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a product called the Razor Saver that works buy rubbing the blade across a mirrored surface made of silica which strips off oxidation and other build up.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure how you feel, I bought mine at my local Walgreen&#x27;s</li>
            <li> One seems to work well, the other not at all.</li>
            <li> It performs well in keeping sharp razors sharp.</li>
            <li> Once the razor has dulled, however, it will not restore the sharp edge.</li>
            <li> It does something to one side of the blade (lots of luck reaching in for the other side.</li>
            <li> You MUST wet the blade before sharpening, and hold the button down for 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the instructions very carefully and it does not work.  </li>
            <li> I find when I shave with the razor after I use this product it shaves less and is rough to the face.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly tough beard with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Had one before hard time finding it X-Mas present.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a replacement at local retailers.</li>
            <li> But it worked very well with expensive blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First use was not a success either.</li>
            <li> According to a number of investigative television and blogging websites, this gizmo actually RUINS the blade.</li>
            <li> According to a number of investigative television and blogging websites, this gizmo actually RUINS the blade.</li>
            <li> Used now several times over the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> reports that this thing RUINS blades</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought Save A Blade several years ago for $25, and I bet it saved me at least $150,</li>
            <li> Razor Saver hands down: You draw the blade across a plate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this slightly odd contraption.  </li>
            <li> Less then half the price</li>
            <li> In fact, it dings and dulls blades, making them significantly worse than prior to the sharpening.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my previous one broke</li>
            <li> If this device makes new blades dull after 5 seconds, how can it sharpen dull blades after 30 seconds?!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I moved to my new house</li>
            <li> the plastic was a little janky.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research on this myself before I bought 2.</li>
            <li> is a little electric motor with a strop on it that it bangs against the blade.</li>
            <li> Get a little longer life out of my razors.</li>
            <li> All 4 save a blade sharpeners batteries were dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tell you where to find it, but it&#x27;s not available on amazon, so you&#x27;ll just have to google it.  </li>
            <li> The idea behind the device is simple and works.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have a spare backup in case I need it.  </li>
            <li> or so I need another one, and who knows, maybe they are not available then.</li>
            <li> or so I need another one, and who knows, maybe they are not available then.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money, time and effort.</li>
            <li> Several women&#x27;s blades are wrapped in thin wires to prevent nicks as a safety precaution.</li>

            <li> how can you just rip people off like that and not get in trouble.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few times and nothing seemed to work.</li>

            <li> if not more, in razor blade purchases.  </li>
            <li> It not only made the blades worse, it damaged them so badly that you can see it with the naked eye.  </li>
            <li> The problem that I found was it almost seemed to speed up the blade getting dull.  </li>
            <li> never did anything advertised, blades just as dull as before and now on the way to the landfill with the sharpener</li>
            <li> I never have to deal with a dull razor.  </li>
            <li> Where these ridiculously expensive razor blades once had to be replaced once a week, a single blade now lasts me about three months!  </li>
            <li> Use your common sense people.</li>
            <li> all the negative reviews here did not help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made this awful sound. ...</li>
            <li> After that the blade is too rough and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting at least one spare as I know it will eventually wear out</li>
            <li> I have read all the reviews listed, and I have NOT had there negative experience with this product at all.</li>
            <li> The razor can be sharpened at least 2 times - extending the life of your blade.</li>
            <li> It at least quadruples the time I can use a razor blade.</li>
            <li> So, as others have said, it&#x27;s a poorly made flimsy waste of money.</li>

            <li> am not sure why others report poor results.</li>

            <li> Worthless plain and simple.  </li>

            <li> I still can&#x27;t figure out how that save-a-blade thing got an infomercial (and everyone says it&#x27;s worthless), while the razor savor actually works and doesn&#x27;t seem to be promoted at all.  </li>
            <li> I had to think of antique broken mechanical tin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does not hold up very long. It does a great job at first, but wears out easily. My husband has been thru 3 of these. It still saves you money on blades. Especially when they are nearly twenty dollars for 4 blades.</li>
            <li> All 4 save a blade sharpeners batteries were dead. 3 of them the batteries leaked all in the sharpeners. They didn&#x27;t advertise that they were old stock from 2008. What made them worst is they were gifts.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.I thought of all the shaves I was going to get from this.But sad to say I couldnot get it to sharpen my Gillete fusion blades</li>
            <li> I first bought Save a Blade from a pharmacy to try it.  Two and a half years later I still use the same blades I purchased with the Save a Blade.  IT IS THAT GOOD!  You lose the lubricating strips over time but I been shaving since before those strips.  An excellent product, if you want to save money, get yourself one.  Not to sure how it works for ladies, seen some BIG OLE&#x27; razors for that and they definitely won&#x27;t fit.  But if you use a regular size razor it should work for the gals just fine.  Sharpen the razor when it&#x27;s new, then before every shave and it will feel like a new razor every time!</li>
            <li> I just replaced this from one I bought a couple of years ago... just ran out of gas I guess.  This product has re-sharpened my razors (3-blade disposables) so much so that a package of 8 lasts me about a year.[[ASIN:B0013J99FO Save a Blade Automatic Razor Sharpener]]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in my blades.</li>
            <li> I use gillette razor blades 8 cartridges for 40 something dollars. I bought this product and I started to reuse the blades (I had a bag full of them, about 400). This thing worked well for me. I could tell that it worked because used blades give me bumps. Unfortunately, I moved to my new house and I lost it somehow. I think one of the guys helping me move might have taken it. I am not sure. But it worked very well with expensive blades.</li>
            <li> My common sense told me that companies like Gillete would have put machines worth millions of dollars to get that sharp edge and a simple device can&#x27;t do that.  I somehow convinced myself in a greed of getting more than 200 saves with just one blade and started calculating my savings for 1, 2, 3 years and so on. Oh such a dream.  But after getting this product I was so disappointed and wasted some of my brand new Mach 3 blades giving this product chance many times. It makes brand new mach 3 blade feel like it has been used 200 times already. May be this product works for other products but not atleast Mach 3.  Use your common sense people. Don&#x27;t buy this product.    The merchant however was very prompt in giving the refund.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift so I don&#x27;t know about the product quality, but shipping was fast.  Packaging was not new (previously opened and printing scratched off) but the product looked new.  Overall I saw a few design flaws (the battery compartment was close to the area that comes in contact with water and was not sealed off) and the plastic was a little janky.  Guess that&#x27;s what you get with a made in china kind of product, but who knows maybe it sharpens blades like there&#x27;s no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought one of these and said it never worked and ince I had looked into buying one of these but decided not to since most reviews confirm his findings, I thought I&#x27;d post what does work.  There&#x27;s a product called the Razor Saver that works buy rubbing the blade across a mirrored surface made of silica which strips off oxidation and other build up.  It claims you can get up to 75 uses out of a blade, and more conservatively, 30+.  I have 43 used Mach 3 blades from the last couple years that I&#x27;m using this on.  I initially \\&quot;sharpened\\&quot; four blades and tried all four and they all seemed to work just fine.  I then sharpened all 43 blades and stored all but one four pack outside of the bathroom to keep them away from moisture.  The first blade I started using had absolutely no lubrication strip left, so it had been very well used as I often get 2-3 weeks out of new blades.  I began using it on July 12th and am still using it today (Aug 3, 22 days).  In the last couple days I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as well, but it still does the job and has never cut my skin (I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s the build-up on the blade that cuts you, not the blade itself).  Three weeks extra use out of a blade that I probably used three weeks in it&#x27;s first life and after sitting in a bathroom drawer for two years is phenominal, so I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.  I still can&#x27;t figure out how that save-a-blade thing got an infomercial (and everyone says it&#x27;s worthless), while the razor savor actually works and doesn&#x27;t seem to be promoted at all.  Billy Mays should have been all over this thing.  I&#x27;d tell you where to find it, but it&#x27;s not available on amazon, so you&#x27;ll just have to google it.  I found a deal for two for $21 total.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and promptly ruined 2 expensive Mach 3 razor blades.  I used it exactly as prescribed (even got on their website to confirm before I used it). It not only made the blades worse, it damaged them so badly that you can see it with the naked eye.  Fox also did a review of this that&#x27;s available online and clearly shows the damage I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury, the company that sells this junk refuses to refund your money or accept returns.  They&#x27;ll only allow you to exchange it.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is complete and absolute junk.  Amazon should NOT sell this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  A good friend of mine also bought this a couple of years ago and had the same experience. He destroyed some razors as well using this as instructed. It&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> I saw this on TV, and then saw it at the drug store for not too much, so I bought it. You will NEVER get \\&quot;200 perfect uses\\&quot; of a disposable razor with this thing.    I really wanted this to work, so I used the same Target brand double razor about 5 times, sharpening before each use, before it started cutting my neck up. And I had to drag the razor over my face more and more each use.    Maybe normally I can get 3 good shaves tops without sharpening, so this really didn&#x27;t do anything.    Save your money.</li>
            <li> I Bought this item about 2 months ago and it is 1 of the best things I have used in A long time. It keeps my razor blade just like new and you only have to use it about every other day. I am 77 years old and shave every day and this has cut down my cost by I don&#x60;t know how much as I don&#x60;t know when I will have to buy razors again . I ordered my 2nd save a blade just to be safe. It is great.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  This product does not do what it claims.  The treatment it applies to the blade makes the blade duller and the shave afterwards is worsened.  In my experience, it in fact shortened the life of the razor.  I followed the direction and used the correct type of blades, and I tried on several blades before making the conclusion that the sharpener does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought anything through an informercial before but I was beguiled by the Save-a-Blade and decided to try it. For me, it works FABULOUSLY. I use the Mach 3 blade and I have used one blade a month since I bought it. That&#x27;s 30 or so shaves per blade. It doesn&#x27;t feel quite like a brand-new blade, more like one that I&#x27;ve used maybe once. I will save hundreds of dollars a year on this product. I am completely delighted with it and feel as if I&#x27;m winning against the razor-blade companies, who overcharge so badly for their product.</li>
            <li> Excellent item and it really works.  I have a tough beard and 1 blade lasts over a month.  after each shave while the blade is still wet  just sharpen for 5 seconds. Amazing!</li>
            <li> It was a kind of cheap product. As a blade sharpened it was not good enough, so I keep  using new brand blades.</li>
            <li> Observe: eBay sells these for a penny apiece, and it still way too overpriced.  I&#x27;ve used this slightly odd contraption.  Warning: it may damage your brand-new razor cartridges!  As an example, I shave with the Gillette Sensor Excel razor -- that razor cartridge is now entirely blunt, and ineffective?  Is this not the exact polar opposite of the intended purpose for this save a blade thingy?  Then again, what do you expect for a penny?        On the other hand, on the basis of in-home testing, it will sharpen Bic disposables credibly.  But why bother.  The concept as I understand it, is to save money on razor cartridges?  To sum it up, save yourself some time, and aggravation, avoid &#x27;save a blade&#x27; -- stay away.</li>
            <li> This is the second Blade Saver I have had. The forst one worked, but was rathertdlimsy. This one is much more powerful and sharpens better then the one I purchased several months ago. I love this one. A razor blade can be used for weeks, with just A quick sharpening after shaving (the blade must be kept sharp). At Amazon&#x27;s cost, it will pay for itself in blade costs in just a very short while. I have been able to get a comfortable shave from 1 blade for 3 - 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Lasted 2 weeks before pad that is supposed to sharpen blades fell off. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I was really excited about purchasing this item but after I tried it, none of my razor&#x27;s got sharper or extended the life of the razor.</li>
            <li> I really like this item it works very well!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality - the batteries had eroded &amp; it was all over in the packaging! Did not give it as s gift as I orginslly intended</li>
            <li> This product does not work, at least on the Mach3 razors that I tried it on!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any sharpening that this item does. I find when I shave with the razor after I use this product it shaves less and is rough to the face.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;My personal subjective experience\\&quot; is that it&#x27;s an excellent product.  I&#x27;m in my 3rd year of using it. My first one fell in the sink, got wet, and so no longer is functional but I definitely wanted another one. I&#x27;m saving a small fortune by not having to continually buy Mach III blades so often that get dull so fast.  I&#x27;m a shaved-head guy and it&#x27;s my personal habit to daily run that razor  over my head, sometimes a couple of times a day, to keep it clean and  smooth, and Save A Blade makes my Mach III blades last up to a month at least before I feel a tugging or dragging  occur and sharpening doesn&#x27;t seem to help anymore, and so then I start with a new blade.  No complaints here at all. But obviously we all have different skin types and hair textures and shaving habits, etc., so it may not be 100% the same results for everyone; no product is. But this works for me!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 3 months, and it really does work! No it won&#x27;t give you 200 shaves on one blade, but I do get 30 decent shave with one. I use the Mach 3 razor, and I usually get a bad shave after the third day. With save-a-blade, I can easily get 30 shaves that are pretty decent. I probably could go over 30 days, but I feel good with that number, and it seems like others do too! I have a feeling that most people did not actually read and follow the directions. You MUST wet the blade before sharpening, and hold the button down for 5 seconds. I have no question about buying another unit once this one dies. If you&#x27;re not sure how you feel, I bought mine at my local Walgreen&#x27;s so I could return it easily.The idea behind the device is simple and works.</li>
            <li> Save a Blade seems to work for a couple of extra shaves and thats great news.  They claim you get hundreds of extra shaves, I don&#x27;t see it.  But with the price of blades it was a worth while purchase</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have a spare backup in case I need it.  It works great and it has save me a lot of money on the purchase of blades.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It works! Just don&#x27;t use it to clean rusty blade.</li>
            <li> Piece of garbage. Does not work at all and the battery it came with had leaked in the packaging its so old.</li>
            <li> About time I write a review on this.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for over 8 months now. And IT WORKS !&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical at first and wasn&#x27;t sure to order it or not.&lt;br /&gt;Reading all the negative reviews here did not help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seemed like to good to be true. Then again, sometimes the best ideas/products are the simplest ones. And for the price I pay for Gillette Fusion blades, I thought they were worth a try. Also when I ordered it, it was less then ten box. Less then half the price it&#x27;s now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought when I received it were like \\&quot;o crap,... I just threw my money away\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The package and product seems cheap. When unpacking I accidentally pressed the button, .... It made this awful sound. ... Again my mind went \\&quot;O crap!\\&quot;... I had to think of antique broken mechanical tin toys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are not very clear. Not sure if my Gillette Fusion blades would fit. But it was here and I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use was not a success either. I used it with a blade I was already using, and was about to replace with a new one. Although the instructions say you need to use it with new blades. But I wasn&#x27;t ready for that yet. I was very cautious, and it just felt horrible. It felt like scrapping my face with the edge of cut open soda container. I thought I just scrapped a piece of my face away. Thankfully it only felt that way, I did not cut open my face. But I remembered some of the reviews here mentioning something about using it right, and inserting the blades right. I wasn&#x27;t ready to throw it in the garbage yet, so I gave it a 2nd try. Inserted the blades,... pulled the handle of my Gillette Fusion down, hoping this would get the blades in the right position, and then pressed the button for a good 5 seconds. Very cautiously I tried it,..... and this time it was much better. I was quite surprised. I got a very clean shave. As good as from a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this went well, I wasn&#x27;t quite convinced yet. I decided to try it with a new blade after my 1st try. Still at the beginning I was quite confused. Sometimes it was just excellent, feeling very smooth, sometimes not so smooth (on the face) but the shave was still very good. My feelings about it were quite mixed. And I was wondering how long it would last. After all this was a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after 8 months I&#x27;m still using that same blade! In all fairness, I shave only once a week (I keep a one week beard most of the time). Still,... normally I already would have replace the blade long ago. And my shaves wouldn&#x27;t be a good as when the blade is brand new. Now every shave is like I just used a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I have to reinsert the blade a few times over in the sharpener, till it feels good. I suppose it needs some getting used to, and you need to figure out, how exactly to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m not quite sure how long I can use the sharpener. Do I use it till the batteries run out, and then get a new one (because it might have become dull itseld?), or do I just replace the batteries and continue using it? Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, it has worked for me, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit sad to see the price has gone up. I&#x27;m thinking of buying a 2nd one just in case. Not because of the batteries, but just if over a year or so I need another one, and who knows, maybe they are not available then. Perhaps I&#x27;ll wait for a deal or something. But for the price I pay for blades I know it will still save me money, even at the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only rating 4 stars, because I think there&#x27;s room for improvement of this product. Especially with regards to the instructions. Also it requires some getting used to, and figuring how to use it best.my 1st try. Still at the beginning I was quite confused.

            <li> We bought this product about 7 years ago and have only gone through 10 blades between the 2 of us.  Rinse in hot water before and after use.  We use gillette fusion blades.</li>
            <li> In no way does this make your blade last longer.  Instead, you&#x27;ll just cut yourself and rub raw places on your skin.  Once it even modified the blade so that with every stroke, the blade left a perfect straight line of whiskers behind.  It&#x27;s only through the decrepit state of George W. Bush&#x27;s Federal Trade Commission that a product like this is allowed on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I used Save A Blade on a Gillette Mach 3 disposable blade. Rather than sharpening the blade, it actually made the blade duller.  I was better off using a regular dull blade than using a blade that had been \\&quot;sharpened\\&quot; with Save A Blade.</li>
            <li> First one I had lasted 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Made my blades last 6 months&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use and clean and store.</li>
            <li> This is an exception to the rule. You do it as per instructions and the blade is sharpened.  I&#x27;m using the first blade That came with my 5 blade razor. KEITH</li>
            <li> I have used the Save A Blade for almost 2 years. I use Gillette Fusion blades and after the first 3 or 4 shaves use  Save a Blade for every shave after that. I run it for about 10 seconds and get about 20-30 shaves per blade. Without using it I used to get about 6-8 shaves per blade at most.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why others report poor results. Perhaps they are not inserting the blade into the device correctly, not running it for 10 seconds, or not rinsing the blade before and after each resharpening. The blade should be wet to sharpen as they recommend. Update: Now after 4 years of use I am getting about 15-20 shaves from a blade. After that the blade is too rough and uncomfortable to use. But if you are expecting that this will make the blade just like a new blade, you will be disappointed. But it still gives a very good shave up till about 15 uses. That is still a huge savings so this is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve had this product for a couple of years now and I think it works great.  But I should add that I also use a electric razor.  Everytime I used it, it resored the edge just fine.  I always restored the edge after shaving while the razor is still damp.  This way it&#x27;s always sharp for the next time.  I&#x27;m writing this review because today I am ordering a second one in case this item should be discontinued, even though my first one still works fine.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for things that talk a good talk.  It was cheap so I purchased this.  The problem that I found was it almost seemed to speed up the blade getting dull.  The firsat time I used it, it felt like a really overdue blade.  and after that it just seemed to cut me more than even a dull blade.  For the price it was worth a try, some people get good savings from it.  But now that I have tried it, I am going back to an electric.  Hope this helps, have a nice day.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product my Gillette Mach 4 would be good for about 1 week.  After using Save A Blade, I use each cartridge for a MINIMUM of 60 days.  I plan on getting at least one spare as I know it will eventually wear out and I prefer not to be without one for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this as Gillette is competing with the gas companies on who will make me broke quicker. Anyway, the joy I felt when I inserted the Mach 3 into this device was palpable. I did as instructed but to my dismay the instructions said not to use old razors! \\&quot;But!\\&quot; I exclaimed... \\&quot;That was the reason I purchased this thing in the first place\\&quot;! OK...so I&#x27;ll buy new blades, and guess what, after daily use 2 weeks later it extended the life of the blade, well Ok it didn&#x27;t, AT ALL. If I could congratulate anyone it would be there marketing team for getting this heap of (expletive) in to Walgreen stores. Save your money, but I&#x27;m still searching for something that works.</li>
            <li> Had one before hard time finding it X-Mas present. First one lasted 3 years. Husband and I both use it. Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third Save A Blade now, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  Does it work? Yes. I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money on my blades, both Fusion and Mach 3. I have sort of a weird shaving routine; I use the Power Fusion to shave down, and the Mach 3 to shave up, against the grain. Don&#x27;t ask how I came up with this routine, all I know is it works for me. I shave in the shower every day, then I reach out, grab the Save A Blade, and sharpen both blades for 5 seconds each.   Using the Save A Blade, I don&#x27;t have to replace blades for months. I used to replace blades about every 9-10 days. At the cost of those blades, I&#x27;m saving a bundle of $$.   Does it sharpen the blades to a like-new standard? No. But it does keep the blades sharp enough to shave without pulling, which used to be when I&#x27;d change blades to new ones.  Why not 5 stars? It&#x27;s a cheaply Made-in-China unit, apparently by different factories who then slap the \\&quot;Save-A-Blade\\&quot; name on it. The little stropping strip that rotates inside to hone the blades ripped apart on my first unit after about 7 months. I ordered another unit, but that arrived with the strip already fallen off the part that rotates it. Amazon returned my purchase price.  The third unit uses slightly different plastic bearings inside, which is how I know it&#x27;s made by different factories.  Every few weeks I take the unit apart and clean the tiny metal shaft with a rough paper towel because the rotation slows down a bit from rust on the shaft. When I clean that off the shaft, the drum inside spins like new.  I do recommend this unit, like I said, I&#x27;ve saved plenty of $$ using it.</li>
            <li> never did anything advertised, blades just as dull as before and now on the way to the landfill with the sharpener</li>
            <li> Worthless plain and simple.  A company that sells a product claiming to improve something and actually instead destroys it should be held accountable by some sort of agency.</li>
            <li> Despite trying this razor sharpener on different types of razors, it does not work at all.  In fact, it dings and dulls blades, making them significantly worse than prior to the sharpening.  Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Works as perscribed , bought as a gift for someone, they say it works fine .</li>
            <li> This sharpener works great. My husband is amazed that he hasn&#x27;t had to buy new blades for months. It sharpens all blades that we tried. We even bought one for our son and my brother. Blades are expensive to buy. This has save us a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This item fits only a few sizes of razors.  Most do not work.  It was a waste of money, time and effort.</li>
            <li> I love it, sharpens the blades great for womens use. I can see how men wouldnt think it is sharp enough for their face. I just bought the same razor as my husband and sharpen his old razor blades when hes done. I cant tell you how much $$$$ this has saved over the venus razor blades. My only complaint is the rubber flaps that sharpen the blades stripped (after 2yrs of use mind you) but for $10 thats not a big deal. I had a hard time finding a replacement at local retailers. They should be selling these instead of those stupid snuggies.</li>
            <li> You will not have to purchase any expensive razors for a while.  Definitely worth purchasing. Very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> I have tried the product several times and I haven&#x27;t had it work for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to wow me. However, I was intrigued, and it was cheap. I noticed that for my four and five blade razors the effect was minimal. My razor was still pulling as if it were never sharpened. However, for my three blade razors (probably due to the larger surface area of each razor) I had better success. If you position the razor opposite of what is indicated in the manual, you might find better results. It is fairly loud. So if you live with others, I suggest using it at a time when no one is trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is \\&quot;sharpening\\&quot; however it isn&#x27;t even an it pulls the hair. I would not recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> I have read all the reviews listed, and I have NOT had there negative experience with this product at all. In fact, I like it so well, that I am going to purchase a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; Save A Blade.  I was pleased to see that they are still available on the market.  Perhaps, the other users did not \\&quot;mount\\&quot; their razor properly in the holder, and therefore it sharpened at an incorrect angle, therefore dulling the blade.  I start with a new blade, and once its sharpness begins to tapper off, I use my Save A Blade to re-sharpen and maintain its sharpness.  I am thankful this product was invented, because it has saved me much money. One new blade will last me at least 15-20 times longer, before I eventually throw it away. Mostly because the structure of the blade begins to break down. This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I thought if it makes my blades last even 50% longer, it would be worth the money, but I did try it for two weeks, and it did seem to make the blade last a little longer, thought it did not feel like a new blade. Then, after only about three weeks of use the small piece on the inside that actually spins and sharpens the blade broke. My buying advise: spend the $20 on a couple more blades, and skip this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the instructions very carefully and it does not work.  It didn&#x27;t sharpen week old blades.  It didn&#x27;t sharpen three day old blades.  It didn&#x27;t sharpen at all.  I&#x27;ve actually done what another reviewer recommended.  I&#x27;ve bought an old fashioned double edge razor.  I bought 100 blades for about $16.  This should last me one to one and a half years.  A fresh, sharp blade every few days.  No patents to pay for on the old fashioned blades which helps make the double triple, etc. blades cost what they do. They have to pay the patent holders and spend a lot on advertising.</li>
            <li> That says it all. Not only does not sharpen your razor, it actually made a new razor unusable after one shave. Your money is better spent on more razors than this piece of junk. The only reason I give it 1 star is because I cant give it ZERO stars.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Itâ€™s perfect!! It saves me so much money. Sounds funny but itâ€™s actually a real stress reliever!</li>
            <li> Used it the first day I got it, and it never worked again. Nothing happens when the button is pressed... sometimes if I shake it around, it&#x27;ll work for a second, but then stop. So, as others have said, it&#x27;s a poorly made flimsy waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product preforms as advertised. My previous purchase of this product lasted 3 years &amp; saved hundreds of dollars in purchase new costs. I would highly recommend it to those of the penny pinching bent.</li>
            <li> Great product! Amazon made fast delivery. It already saved me $35 in blades! This is my second one. I bought this one for my second home. I encourage anyone to consider this product.</li>
            <li> According to a number of investigative television and blogging websites, this gizmo actually RUINS the blade. The best video on this scam is found at myfoxdfw.com/dpp/news/Deal_or_Dud_Save_A_Blade . There you will see that they put the blade under a high-powered microscope at Southern Methodist U. and it clearly shows the blade edge is totally destroyed by the device ... it even destroyed the edge of an UNused blade. Also, they question the Dallas-based distributor about the tests and the answers they got back were pure bologna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, cartridge blades are also total rip-off, incredibly overpriced. They too are a scam. The government recently forced Gi11ette to stop claiming the battery-powered handles improve performance. They do not. And four, five blades, turbo blades, and so on -- it&#x27;s all just hype to make you pay a fortune for a whole lot of nothing. Wake up. $[...] for a razor blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gi11ette has, over the years, simply bullied old-school flat double-edge &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; blades off of the retail shelves of America. Why? Because any competitor can make a regular flat DE razor blade without violating a Gi11ette patent. Because of the patents Gi11ette holds on worthless gimmicks like five-blade cartridges, it has a monopoly on them. (Gi11ette actually sued Sch-lick (over the Quattro) claiming it held the patent rights on ALL multi-edge cartridge technology. Gi11ette lost.) And, of course, when there is a monopoly, prices go sky-high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that most consumers do not take the time to look for other options, he/she has only his/herself to blame for being suckered into $[...] a blade. Old-school flat DE (double-edge) blades cost incredibly less and, after the learning curve, yield up a superior shave. Last week I bought TWO HUNDRED DE blades, a well respected brand, a great sale admittedly, for under $25, bottom line. THAT IS 6.25 CENTS PER EDGE, FOLKS ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor. Instead of falling for scams like this gizmo, magnetic sharpeners and such ... start looking at a high-quality stainless steel DE &amp;#34;safety razor.&amp;#34; They go for $30 to $50, which you will &amp;#34;earn back&amp;#34; very quickly on the much less expensive blades. Merkur is one company that makes a number of high-quality DE razors, and there are others. It takes a while to learn &amp;#34;the touch&amp;#34; of a DE razor, they&#x27;ll be some nicks, but after that, it is actually a much, much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, DE/safety &amp;#34;wetshaving&amp;#34; with a quality cream will change shaving from chore into a small luxury that you look forward to each morning. And you&#x27;ll save a small fortune along the way.</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of junk. It not only doesn&#x27;t work, it ruins expensive razor heads. Also, they directly lie in the instructions. They advertise that this product works on EVERY blade, but if you read the instructions, it clearly states that their product does not work on blades that have the safety wires on them. Several women&#x27;s blades are wrapped in thin wires to prevent nicks as a safety precaution. Save a Blade claims that their product does not work on these razors because the wires are there to keep the product in place during shipping. A total lie. I hate this product and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> I did a little research on this myself before I bought 2. The review seemed mixed, so I gave it a shot. One was for a stocking stuffer for my dad.  After several attempts at utilizing this product I finally tossed it in the trash.  I wont embarrass myself by gifting this to my dad either.  I shave with everyday and I love a nice clean shave.  If you expect this doo-hickie to give you that same quality shave you will be let down. It actually made the blade worse! It striped the white gel stip off and ground down the little rubber fins on my double gillette blades.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, even on relatively new blades</li>
            <li> I sometimes buy &#x27;As Seen On TV&#x27; products for my retail store and decided to carry these.  I took a unit home and was very suspicious that this thing really did all that it said, but, (as another view said) if it sharpened just half as well as they claimed, it would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I took a product home and used it on some old razors that I had and I was really surprised.  All you have to do is insert your old razor head into the slot while still attached to the razor post for about 30 seconds and the blades are like new.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that other users that gave &#x27;Shave A Blade&#x27; may not of left the blade heads in the devise long enough or it just didn&#x27;t work with their razor heads.  I used it on Mach 3 and Schick Quadro and am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best</li>
            <li> i belieave the save a blade people developed this knowing full well it would never work.  how can you just rip people off like that and not get in trouble.  they suck. and they should die.</li>
            <li> I FIRST BROUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN WALLGREES 7 YEARS AGO. THEN I SAW IT ON YOUR SIGHT TWO YEAR AGO . I BROUGHT 3 . TWO TO GIVE TO MY FRIENDS AT CHRISTMAS.MY ORIGANAL ONE IS STILL WORKING . WE  HAVE SAVED HUNDREDS OVER THE LAST 7 YEARS IN BLADES. I NOW USE THE SHICK QUARTO AND SHARPEN IT TWICE A MONTH. EACH TIME THE SHAVE IS LIKE THE FRIST TIME YOU USE IT. I LOVE  IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN USE THE SAME BLADE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;IT SHAVES SMOOTH EACH TIME WITH OUT ANY PULLING OR DRAG.I WISH THAT I INVENTED IT FIRST.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all! It made the blades worse than what they were before I tried to sharpen them. Lame.</li>
            <li> According to a number of investigative television and blogging websites, this gizmo actually RUINS the blade. The best video on this scam is found at myfoxdfw.com/dpp/news/Deal_or_Dud_Save_A_Blade . There you will see that they put the blade under a high-powered microscope at Southern Methodist U. and it clearly shows the blade edge is totally destroyed by the device ... it even destroyed the edge of an UNused blade. Also, they question the Dallas-based distributor about the tests and the answers they got back were pure bologna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, cartridge blades are also total rip-off, incredibly overpriced. They too are a scam. The government recently forced Gi11ette to stop claiming the battery-powered handles improve performance. They do not. And four, five blades, turbo blades, and so on -- it&#x27;s all just hype to make you pay a fortune for a whole lot of nothing. Wake up. $[...] for a razor blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gi11ette has, over the years, simply bullied old-school flat double-edge \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; blades off of the retail shelves of America. Why? Because any competitor can make a regular flat DE razor blade without violating a Gi11ette patent. Because of the patents Gi11ette holds on worthless gimmicks like five-blade cartridges, it has a monopoly on them. (Gi11ette actually sued Sch-lick (over the Quattro) claiming it held the patent rights on ALL multi-edge cartridge technology. Gi11ette lost.) And, of course, when there is a monopoly, prices go sky-high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that most consumers do not take the time to look for other options, he/she has only his/herself to blame for being suckered into $[...] a blade.

            <li> I chose this rating on the basis of what looked like a durable product although it&#x27;s early days. Besides I based my assessment on previous reviews and this will encourage the manufacturer to maintain a high quality product and retain a good reputation. However should customers be disappointed he/she will certainly lose business for giving a false impression of the product should it not be durable as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the second one my husband has gotten.  He said the first didn&#x27;t work after he dropped it in the water. So another.  He buys the cheap throw-away razors and reuses them by sharpening them with this.</li>
            <li> This product is a true blue money saver!!! Seriously I bought one when it first came out in 20092009 and they were only sold on TV. I was spending 100&#x27;s of $ on razor blades at the time and said to myself &amp;#34;hell if it even has a 10% chance of working then it will be worth buying for 19.99&amp;#34; so I did and it worked perfect for over a year till I dropped it and broke it. I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere till I searched amazon in April 2014 and found one for 14.99. I&#x27;m so happy to be saving my money that was being blown on razor blades. Thank you amazon and sava-blade! !!!</li>
            <li> There is no convenient way of replacing the batteries when they are worn out.  You will need a screw driver in order to open the unit to expose the batteries.</li>
            <li> This product works great a few times of sharpening you old blades, but afterward it fails to bring the blade back to like new quality. It saves you money the end, but you wont get the closeness that a new blade offers after a few uses of this item.</li>
            <li> If this device makes new blades dull after 5 seconds, how can it sharpen dull blades after 30 seconds?!</li>
            <li> I have been using the same blade since Christmas 2009!!!!  It is June 2010 right now.   I absolutely love it!!!  I have been sharpening a Mach 3 razor.   I have even replaced the batteries and it still works great.   It is the best money that I ever spent.</li>
            <li> Did not work and cheaply made. If you have a multi blade razor then get a Razorpit and you will be very happy!</li>
            <li> Works alright. Buts it feels cheep.</li>
            <li> This is the third \\&quot;Sav a Blade\\&quot; sharpener that I have owned. Each device has two honing strips within it. One of the strips in each device that I have owned has become detached. Although this reduces the efficiency of the sharpener it is still a good product, in my opinion. I have used one blade upwards to 25 days when I sharpen it after each shave. A hugh savings even though there is only one honing strip in place. Think what a true money saver it would be if the manufacturer could correct the problem of one honing strip becoming detached.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  I tried everything to get it to sharpen my old blade, and it was just brutal.  I wish I could get my money back or something.  So I decided to try and save you the money.  I love infomercials and that is where I found this POS.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  Use a butter knife and you can sharpen your blade better.  Ugh</li>
            <li> You have to unscrew it to replace the battery</li>
            <li> When I first received Save A Blade, it did not seem to sharpen the blade at all. I tried a few times and nothing seemed to work. Then recently I decided to put some water (enough to make it wet or running water) over the Save A Blade with the shaver in place, and then running it for 5 seconds. The result a sharper, smoother blade.    I added water because I remember growing up in a restaurant where we used a block to sharpen knives and cleavers. We always added water when sharpening just enough so that it is wet - never understood why; but that&#x27;s the conclusion that I came up with and it works.    Good luck, hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> I am ordering my 3rd save a blade as I have worn out the 2 previous ones.  I even have another friend of mine hooked on it.  You should sharpen before and after you shave oncee your new razor starts to dull.</li>
            <li> Hubby says it works just great. He is very happy with it. With the price of razor blades these days it is really a saver..</li>
            <li> Used now several times over the past few weeks.  Blades are only slightly  improved.  At the same time the Teflon strip used to increase comfort is destroyed with each sharpening.  The product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had one before for many years. The battery finally wore out and the case cracked, so I got another one. I use the same razor blade for months at a time.</li>
            <li> After the first week it pays for itself....from there your saving money, if I buy a pack of  four disposable blades  for $8  a month that would give me a savings of $88 a  year....this is the third save a blade I&#x27;ve brought in 6 years, that&#x27;s  around $45 compared to close  $500 for  buying blades in the  same period of time....Plus it  works you will be using the same blade for months.</li>
            <li> disposable razor lasts 4x longer</li>
            <li> This is my second Save-A-Blade and it really works.  I shave everyday and change blades only once every four months.</li>
            <li> Works well and as advertized. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this was a Christmas gift for my son, &amp; I must say, that I scored 100 with this. The type of replacement blades he buys cost nearly $15, so he really appreciates this product.</li>
            <li> great product helps keep my razor blades sharp last three times longer</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product many years ago, when it first appeared on the market. Recently, the clip broke on it and I now have to finally buy another one. This device has saved me HUNDREDS of dollars in razor blades over the years. Where these ridiculously expensive razor blades once had to be replaced once a week, a single blade now lasts me about three months!  I use a gilette mach 3 razor blade with a battery in it, that makes it vibrate.      If you use this device as directed, and wet the blade before sharpening, it will save you a lot of money. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made in my lifetime!  MG</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of the Save a Blades.  I had owned one for a couple years and liked how it extended the life of blades.      I ordered 2 from this supplier.  One seems to work well, the other not at all.</li>
            <li> Earlier I wrote how well my husband loves this well this morning it was not running right and he opened it up and the battery was corroded and looked like foam all in the inside.  He has taken it apart and trying to clean up now putting it back together.  Hope it works because he has had one of these for a long time.  We shouldn&#x27;t have to do this it is back together and running right now but for a new product makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> does a great job. bought one for my sons and they love it too.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;need to keep your razor clean then hone with the sharpener. blades last for months.</li>
            <li> Bought one many years ago and used one blade for over a year. These things really work and save you money on blades.</li>
            <li> 29 one star reviews and 29 5 star reviews..what does that tell you...means 1/2 of you are going to get screwed. this thing cant get above 3 stars probly cus the shipping was fast. read a few 1 star reviews and you will know what ur up against..reports that this thing RUINS blades yea yea i know some of you are tickled to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I deleted how to sharpen the blades..seems no one was interested..buy the seller crap and good luck.keep you out of trouble for an hr or two.</li>
            <li> I purchased this device Via Amazon after seeing the results&lt;br /&gt;of the unit my son bought a few years ago. I was surprised&lt;br /&gt;that it actually worked. He has touched up the blades of his&lt;br /&gt;razors dozens of times. I&#x27;ve done a four bladed razor about&lt;br /&gt;ten times myself so I figured I should buy my own.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my own razors but the wife likes her&#x27;s sharpened this way as well.  With the price of razors going sky high this is a great product to have in the house.</li>
            <li> It performs well in keeping sharp razors sharp. Once the razor has dulled, however, it will not restore the sharp edge. It&#x27;s just OK, not great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  sharpen razors.</li>
            <li> I have received the unit as expected and put into practice on old disposables lying around.  It definitely sharpened as promised and now using it with my 5 blade razor.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> This razor sharpener saves me money every month on razors.  I never have to deal with a dull razor.  I would highly recommend this product for personal use and also for gifts!</li>
            <li> I think it works well on my Gillette razor. Not sure but I use it regularly and it seems my blades last longer. Batteries too also last longer. Worth the price and try at the cost of Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> Back in the day, there was the leather strop that you would pull the razor against, just before using it. I don&#x27;t know if it actually sharpened the razor, but it smoothed the bumps and oxidation (which does occur, even on stainless steel) off of it and improved the edge.&lt;br /&gt;This is a little electric motor with a strop on it that it bangs against the blade. I doubt that it makes the blade worse -- it does practically nothing, actually; it can&#x27;t produce any pressure worth mentioning to smooth the blade.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this, I also bought another called Razor Saver at the same time, figuring that one of them would be better than the other. Razor Saver hands down: You draw the blade across a plate (I think it&#x27;s stainless steel) with as much pressure as you think the piddly plastic hinges on the razor will handle. It does something to one side of the blade (lots of luck reaching in for the other side. Don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> Used it and it sharpened an older razor i had. i can see it giving longer life to blades thus saving some money..</li>
            <li> Exceedingly disappointed broke down within 1week&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy that product again&lt;br /&gt;It is not what  Iexpected not all all good</li>
            <li> i bought one for my dad, and he is just amazed at how well this thing works.</li>
            <li> I owned this product for about 4 years and decided I needed a new one.  When I found it on amazon I immediately ordered a new one.  This product is wonderful and I save a ;lot of money because I don&#x27;t have to purchase razor blades very often.</li>
            <li> There have been so many As Seen On TV products that haven&#x27;t delivered the promise as they have claimed to have shown. Unfortunately, when I have heard about Save A Blade, I was very skeptical to see if it does deliver for its money. Does it really deliver its promise? This automatic razor sharpener tries to get rid of the dullness that can wear on from your razors after time and use. I found it very easy to place my blade in the sharpener, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver as good as when the razor does when I first have used it on the face and skin of my body. There are better things to get with your money from the As Seen On TV items. Is it honestly worth the money? Well, yes and no. It worked on some razors, but not all of them. I honestly say if you use disposable razors, don&#x27;t waste your time here. Fancier razors like Mach 3 by Gillette, fair. I suggest you look for something better, or simply say no period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: C-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setup &amp; Convience: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: C</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t sharpen at all and had to return. Normal wear and tear out of my razors, used properly and read the directions</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found this product again.  I bought one through as seen on TV about 6 years ago or so and I&#x27;ve not bought razor blades since then.  Unfortunately my previous one broke and I searched the internet for a replacement and found them.  I bought one for each of my sons.  Good by frequent razor buying.</li>
            <li> this product actually made the blades I was using worse than better.  I started with a fresh blade and used the sharpener.  it felt more and more dull and was less effective.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT.  HAVE BEEN USING THE SAME TRAC II BLADE FOR A MONTH AND A HALF &amp; STILL CONTINUES TO RESHARPEN SUCCESSFULLY.  REALLY SAVES A LOT OF MONEY ON BLADES. GREAT.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over a year ago.  I can sharpen my blades maybe once or twice at best before they stay dull.  That is far from the 200 times that was advertised when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have had a Save a Blade for over 10 years.  It finally broke.  Last summer I went to every WalMart and Wangreens and  store that sold &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; items, and could not find one.  I was very saddened, as I really depend on mine for keeping my razor sharp.  I have not bought a package of razor blades in over 5 years, as I can keep using the same blade for months, with regular sharpening with the Save a Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found these available on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is tired of spending up to $30 for a pack of razor blades over and over should consider  buying one of these.  You will be amazed at the savings on razors!</li>
            <li> This product provides a convenient way to sharpen your razor. Just wet the razor, hold flat and press the button sharpen the blades. It does a great job sharpening a multi-blade razor. I use it daily, due to convenience and ease of use. It sharpens my razor quickly and provides for a much better shaving experience, and results.</li>
            <li> do not buy this ,it do not work at all save your money,this is a joke and it was on me ,took my money and it do not work</li>
            <li> I bought this thing and tried it for a week, only to completely give up on it.  My resharpened blades just weren&#x27;t anything like as sharp as new cartridges.  But months later I was out of new cartridges, wasn&#x27;t planning on going to the store, and gave it another shot and to my surprise discovered that it really does work, it&#x27;s just that my expectations were too high.  I was expecting like new blades and it was only capable of keeping blades usably sharp, and in the end I realized that was ok, the blades did work, and I was saving money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything they say it is and was delivered promptly, but - I just don&#x27;t love it.  It definitely sharpens razors pretty well, but, with the initial $20 price tag and the batteries you use, and the fact that it wears out because it uses little pieces of 600 grit sand paper, it just isn&#x27;t worth it in my view.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old Gillette single edge, steel, safety razor and it&#x27;s cheap and easy.</li>
            <li> just as good as it says!!</li>
            <li> I have used this item for over two years.  It has save me a lot of money on buying blades. I bought three more for my Sons as a Xmas Stocking Stuffer. Every shaver should have one of these. Great item.</li>
            <li> not worth it. it didn&#x27;t do anything really</li>
            <li> This product did not work as seen on tv. It was too fragile and did not live up to it&#x27;s billing. Great idea, but the application is flawed.</li>
            <li> Bull. What a waste of money that i could&#x27;ve used to go get a fantastic meal at Ihop. This Save a Blade made my blades worse (Mach III), I took the thing apart, and I&#x27;m wondering if I can find use to it now. There&#x27;s a thing that turns. Perhaps I can find a way to use it to wind back the string of a yo-yo. But it will do NOTHING to your blade except make them worse. HORRIBLE. DISGUSTING. The guys who make this product should be ashamed of themselves. TOTAL RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> Dont buy. Doesnt work. Doesnt come with good instructions</li>
            <li> This item cuts down on my buying new blades every month.  I think the only problem I have with it is that if the blade head is not the standard size, it won&#x27;t work.  Your average disposables will fit fine, as well as the Gillette brand (Fusion, ProGlide, etc.).</li>
            <li> This product works well to extend the life of your razor. The razor can be sharpened at least 2 times - extending the life of your blade.</li>
            <li> Get a little longer life out of my razors. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I tried this device out immediately on the advice of my wife. The shave that I got from a relatively old blade was okay but not quite the same as a brand new blade. Still, it will save me money and deliver on its claim.</li>
            <li> Save a blade works good on mach 3 and it will save you money</li>
            <li> I bought Save A Blade several years ago for $25, and I bet it saved me at least $150, if not more, in razor blade purchases.  Eventually the battery died, and I was able to get 2 more for significantly less money.  Truly one of the best little gadgets I have ever bought.  It at least quadruples the time I can use a razor blade.</li>
            <li> waste of money. don&#x27;t buy its a scam</li>
            <li> Does sharpen the blade a tad. Not like a new blade, but can give you more life out of your other blades. Make sure you wet the blade or use a small amount of clipper oil. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have owned one previously and they really add a lot of shaves to the blade, shaving you from buying more blades. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> I will be sending this back for ANOTHER ONE, the one I received battery had corroded.</li>
            <li> I have previous experience with this sharpener and it does an excellent job on keeping a blade sharpened if used regularly. This one was bought as a spare in case they are not available when the one I am using breaks or wears out in the future.</li>
            <li> For the low price of this product, it works very well. Paying for itself very quickly. This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I have been very satisfied with both. Considering the low price, this product is well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I think that these low ratings are nuts A friend gave me his. It broke after one year. I ordered another one. I have used the same blade for 13 weeks and still get a great shave. I couldn&#x27;t go for over a week with a new blade. Call me satisfied. I am trying to buy 3 more for gifts. Dean Garber</li>
            <li> Never work! Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> it does not work well with about 3 kinds of disposable blades that my husband tried it on.Maybe it does on other blades, but certainly not the ones we tried.</li>
            <li> I have used the Save A Blade for over three years and have no complaints. I have seen caveats that it does not work with the Fusion blades, but this is the only blade that that I sharpened with this product. I have seen the review that relates that this blade was tested by 20-20 and that under a microscope the blade in fact was not sharpened but actually damaged. I can not dispute these findings but my only &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; is the use of the blade after using the product. I have a fairly tough beard with sensitive skin and I have NEVER experience any discomfort using my Fusion sharpened blade.I can not say that the blade returns to a new state but the blade gets me a very close comfortable shave. I often use the blade on dry skin for touch ups around my mustache and neck and I discard the blade when it fails to give a close shave. I gave the Save A Blade 4 stars because it obviously does not return the blade to new, but it does keep it within tolerances where I can get a close satisfactory shave. I discard the blade when I pass my hand over my face I can feel &amp;#34;nubs&amp;#34; but I never get to the point of irritation or surface cuts.</li>
