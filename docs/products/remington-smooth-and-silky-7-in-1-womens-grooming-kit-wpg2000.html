            <li>I am very happy with my Remington WPG-2000 Smooth &amp; Silky Woomen&#x27;s Body and Bikini Kit.</li>
            <li>It did not give me good results</li>
            <li>It also is good for a lot of</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good reviews it got.</li>
            <li>All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace the one that I had had for years and loved, got the newer model</li>
            <li>I recommend it is a good buy</li>
            <li>Good trimmer for a mans goatee.</li>
            <li>They also make one that is good for nose trimming.</li>
            <li>So I say for the money its an all around good product.</li>
            <li>Said it was good for the legs but did not work..</li>
            <li>(good luck with that).</li>
            <li>and it still works good.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Body &amp; Bikini Remington.  </li>
            <li>It was perfect and was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy something better quality!</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry around and the performance is great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It worked great for almost a year, with medium to light use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing bikini trimmer IMO.</li>
            <li>The price of the product is also reasonable and perfect one</li>
            <li>If that was what it was doing to his chin, I couldn&#x27;t imagine using this product to do any kind of bikini trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its honestly overpriced.</li>
            <li>The interface when changing the head is nice.</li>
            <li>And honestly....</li>
            <li>this product is cute and the pouch makes it a good purchase, but the contents does not.  </li>
            <li>it came with a nice purse to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li>this is a steal, and holds up nicely.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>Plus, it came with a nice carrying case and charger.</li>
            <li>It thinned out and trimmed the hair nicely</li>
            <li>Had a lot of catching up to do.</li>
            <li>my own fault.  </li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>I would recommend to all my friends and already have to be honest</li>
            <li>A great tool for when I need a quick shave, or don&#x27;t feel like using a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li>The attachments are very easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li>either get a razor or spend more money on a better shaver!</li>
            <li>Surprising because it appears cheap when taking the shaver out of the box.</li>
            <li>The service was fantastic and the price was good.</li>
            <li>I have had great success with this product; I use it instead of paying $35/mo.</li>
            <li>If you want something easy and no pain get this because it works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feminine and easy to use!..  </li>
            <li>I have the same product from another manufacturer that has worked flawlessly for years and after seeing this product I thought what a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li>I love that it is very easy to hold and use not bulky like most ladies electric razors.</li>
            <li>As I said, the IDEA is brilliant, but the execution and quality fell far below my expectations.</li>
            <li>I did nick myself once, but it was more of a pinch</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is more a review on the seller not the product because I never received the product.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off trying to trim your bikini line with a butter knife.</li>
            <li>come on, Remington, you know better.</li>
            <li>its not going to be Remington WPG-2000 thats for sure.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the precision trimmer for the bikini area</li>
            <li>I also love that this shaver keeps a charge that&#x27;s important!</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I was able to use this once.</li>
            <li>many years now.</li>
            <li>Just be sure NOT to press the head to your skin as stated in the instructions for use.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>its purple, can you ask for more?</li>
            <li>and it has better power/speed.</li>
            <li>I wish stores would discontinue them today and never sell them again and stick to electric razors, I wish they sell more women&#x27;s electric razors now and throw out cord razors.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job....</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>The plastic comb piece on this one is made better.</li>
            <li>Love that you can use it with or without water.</li>
            <li>No problem with the ptoduct and its water proof too. :-)</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully for my facial hair.</li>
            <li>think there are better products,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>He likes it better than the men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>TAKES FOREVER to use and needs more power.&lt;br /&gt;Buying</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many nips from this thing</li>
            <li>sure my neighbors knows when I&#x27;m shaving)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really can&#x27;t ask for more from a shaving product.</li>
            <li>Why is this one so much,  they are asking 3 times more than what I paid at the store!!</li>
            <li>The razor was the real reason why i bought this product and it DOESN&#x27;T EVEN WORK!!!!</li>
            <li>However the shaver attachment really doesn&#x27;t do much good, but if you&#x27;re going over the rest anyway with your own razor then the trimmer is fine.</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer to trim my fem area and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but does nick in the most tender of places.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not intended for shaving large areas like legs, but worked exceptionally well for shaping and trimming bikini area.  </li>
            <li>easy to cut</li>
            <li>I would recommend this because it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>Otherwise easy to use.</li>
            <li>to use, Easy to change heads, and Easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Instructions easy .....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife, and in her words, &amp;#34;It makes it really easy to shave all my tender</li>
            <li>They work just fine for bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t abused it and can&#x27;t understand why it works fine one day and</li>
            <li>I just use an eyebrow brush when I need to and it works fine.</li>
            <li>turned on fine</li>
            <li>and what I use it for that is fine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it would be fine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and good quality as far as price concern</li>
            <li>This is a perfect wife/mother gift for anyone even children and husbands because women sometimes need a little pampering to make them feel go  od.</li>

            <li>Edit to my Initial Review:     I bought one of these about 4 years ago and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Trimmed to a comfortable level, without pain or itching.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you want to be in pain and enjoy bleeding all over the place.</li>
            <li>Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice bag to keep it all</li>
            <li>Too light could not use it</li>
            <li>so it always available.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for \\&quot;smooth and silky\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It does shave the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the smooth feel on my legs that I would like.</li>
            <li>This is a great product especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s never used an electric razor before.</li>
            <li>After using the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020/31 BodyGroom]] to maintain my bikini area for years (yes, I&#x27;m female and the Bodygroom is advertised as a men&#x27;s product, but it&#x27;s been great for me)</li>
            <li>This same trimmer set was at Sally&#x27;s for 17 dollars lol like what..</li>
            <li>My skin was as smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>It does not give a close smooth trim.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull and pinch so its a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I had an old version that was really good.</li>
            <li>It is far from being a good choice.</li>
            <li>I bought this product right before the summer knowing I had more to trim during the warmer months and didn&#x27;t feel like spending the money on buying a bunch of separate pieces.</li>
            <li>The first latest about a year but for the price that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Super happy with this purchase as for while I could only shave.</li>
            <li>It worked okay the first time, but has lost its charge after each use all 4 or 5 times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>It could have been user error, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I was using it according to the directions included with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li>Now to be fair, it was a great trimmer when it worked, but it died far too soon for the amount of money spent!</li>
            <li>Love the different attachments, and the bag makes it handy to keep everything together.</li>
            <li>I even demonstrated it to my husband attempting to shave it with and without attachments and it did nothing but emit a mild buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>Because it charges, it does a clean shave wherever you need it.  </li>
            <li>, it took me awhile to realize that you can pull apart the shaver heads to clean them.</li>
            <li>This replaced an old Remington shaver that lasted 10 + years, so far so good!  </li>
            <li>and I was able to get the old one to fit and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Charged for the full day, and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since.</li>
            <li>I contacted them and all they said is \\&quot;we are very sorry,\\&quot; and they did nothing more.</li>
            <li>I had not had an electric shaver in many years because they never seemed to work very well.</li>
            <li>maybe most people know that they &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>just run the motor alone, shut off, add the head back and it is good.</li>
            <li>The little bag is also great for quick and easy storage/travel.</li>
            <li>Next the razor that doesn&#x27;t work as my hair is too fine, my boyfriend tried it and it works for him, how nice.</li>
            <li>Being able to use this trimmer wet or dry makes it so perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and adore the ability to trim my hair to varying lengths, trim my eyebrows, and do quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item to use while pregnant</li>
            <li>I &#x27;ve had many personal trimmers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for in between waxes.:-)</li>
            <li>This shaver works very well on fine hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do as good a job on coarse hair as I would like.</li>
            <li>I figured since I&#x27;d had such a good experience with the brand, I could be as happy with a new version of the same product.</li>
            <li>And it comes with this fantastic mini/micro shaver head and boy, that baby really works!</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer for touch-ups only, and I have been very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li>Holds it&#x27;s charge a good long time, even when not used often.</li>
            <li>And at this price, it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a pack of new razor blades.</li>
            <li>I found that it cuts very well and very quickly.</li>
            <li>but this product has not failed to accomplish anything that has been tried!</li>
            <li>shaver won&#x27;t get your skin as smooth as waxing, although using the mini-shaver attachment gets really close to the skin and will leave your skin feeling pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>Years ago, I bought the first in this series of Lady&#x27;s Remington at Walmart for about $18!  </li>
            <li>I keep having to charge it, it keeps losing charge very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t last me more than 5 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little shaver.can be used in the shower too</li>
            <li>and I find the thing can&#x27;t be charged because the charger doesn&#x27;t fit very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle, close, accurate, albeit a pain.  </li>
            <li>The travel bag I got was white not like the picture but its nice for traveling.</li>
            <li>Whatever kind of silver they use in it totally does prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The Wahl isn&#x27;t worth diddly for getting those shorter nose hairs that the nose-hair trimmer can&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li>This version seems to work just as well but didn&#x27;t come with as many attachments as the old version did.</li>
            <li>Not so good, It was a gift for my gf, and the product doesn&#x27;t work as she expected to be,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>But worth the money.</li>
            <li>For trimming along the bikini line, the trimmer head was perfect, and the number 4 setting (one comb has settings from 1-4, the other 5-8 increasing in length) on the trimmer head left the bikini area</li>
            <li>First it would lose charge extremely quickly, this went on for about 2 months before it downright refused to turn on anymore.</li>
            <li>The detail trimmer is decent enough, it does cut and works good around the bikini line and the underarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t right at all</li>
            <li>just right so that it will charge.</li>
            <li>Its efficient and is a great tool to use (even if the head is a bit small, its worth it for those detail areas).  </li>
            <li>For my money, it&#x27;s the best twenty-some dollars I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have been being cheap and just bought a decent one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, its a simple, clean product that is good for occasional use.</li>
            <li>a very reasonable, trimmed length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe the cord is defective as it is fine when my old cord is used.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it dry makes it a lifesaver for quick fixes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I bought this because the price was right for the assortment of shavers included.&lt;br /&gt;Thought they would come in handy for something or other.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a quick &amp; easy substitute for a razor in getting everything completely smooth down there, but unfortunately not.</li>
            <li>It may be because for the first year or two I had it</li>
            <li>It does not, and I can only imagine that it has to do more with Quality assurance than anything else since some of the reviews here indicate that theirs works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>Putting the guard attachment on it that first time, it would not function at all until I had taken the attachment off and then poked the metal post in the head.</li>
            <li>And not cutting quite as close really reduces razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The first time I thought I broke it or over charged it or something thats</li>
            <li>I totally love this shaver, and so does my husband, who uses it on his back and chest.  </li>
            <li>the precision trimmer attatchment was painfull and did a better job at nicking my skin than it did at actually removing hair.</li>
            <li>I thought the first one was a fluke</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the first one that I owned, that one lasted 5 years or so.</li>
            <li>I actually think that it works better in the shower.</li>
            <li>The functions allow you to change to 3 different head sizes, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the attachments shown in the first picture.  </li>
            <li>I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to worry if it got wet.</li>
            <li>Worked well the first time around.</li>
            <li>therefore the only one i use.&lt;br /&gt;i love that it can be used in the shower and that it is rechargable and the battery lasts for days.</li>
            <li>will say however, that I love how the attachments are very simple to put on and off.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple times and the most it will do</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer at Target for a fraction of what they&#x27;re charging here, and I still paid too much!</li>
            <li>it is not even funny.</li>
            <li>You must charge this thing about 16 hours before first use.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t come with one of the key attachments that the older model had that i liked so much about it.  </li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted, but I&#x27;m definitely not going to replace it with the same model.</li>
            <li>The attachments are nothing spectacular, standard with shavers as far as I know.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine used it at our last spa night and enjoyed it so much that I&#x27;m here to buy one for her for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Most of the attachments don&#x27;t work on hair that is short and it does absolutely nothing to stubble.</li>
            <li>I really like it very much.</li>
            <li>I would say do not plan on having too long, if the price makes that ok, then it does work well.</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for over a year and it has always pretty much sucked.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is it can not remove the very small rooted hair perfectly otherwise works well for my eye brow .</li>
            <li>considering how little I paid for it, but there are far better electric razors out there that are much safer and do a much better job.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver last night and immediately opened it because I was excited to find a cute shaver with all of the different attachments.  </li>
            <li>The only problem with this razor is the fact that the charger breaks easily.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are made for a woman but strong enough for a MAN!</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that in the picture the mini eyebrow shaver, the cutting edge is at the top, mine is on the side, and I really think it would be more ideal if the razor was on the top.</li>
            <li>so I snatched it up even though my last one is still fine.</li>
            <li>I oiled it maybe 4 or 5 times the whole time I had it.</li>
            <li>I have another one by Philips which really works.</li>
            <li>I tried two different outlets and ended up having to wiggle the cord around to get the charge light to come on.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I bought it from target, and it came with a 30 day money back guarantee, so I will be returning it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it works, but it really does.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver and I bought two because after the plug socket gets wet, the charger will not work.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem to even work.</li>
            <li>I tried using the mini shaver (not the brow or bikini trimmer) and it did not work for me very well.</li>
            <li>The Bikini trimmer worked very well though.</li>
            <li>It came charged and ready too go.</li>
            <li>Battery die fast.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge really well</li>
            <li>If I were you, I would really reconsider.</li>
            <li>You really get what you paid for with this product.</li>
            <li>I got it through Wal-Mart and really should have looked at reviews before I did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was using with lackluster results, with this.($18.00 for the WHOLE kit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I expected and gratefully deserved.  </li>
            <li>problems I have with the device are that it really irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to work reasonably well.</li>
            <li>Im very well used to using a shaver;I bought this one to replace a Wahl which was going bad(used it for years and</li>
            <li>it started making so much noise,(im</li>
            <li>The microfoil does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get quite as close and smooth as a similar one I had years ago, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li>I bought this product from a popular \\&quot;big box\\&quot; store, to replace a Remington shaver that I&#x27;d had for 5 years that finally literally fell to pieces in my hands.</li>
            <li>So once again, I had to go over the same spot multiple times to get an effective shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the previous reviewers were expecting, but I thought this was an excellent product.</li>
            <li>As long as you turn the blade so it stays even with the skin from edge to edge, it&#x27;s easy to avoid nicks.</li>
            <li>This is my third trimmer (the other two wore out after years of much loved use, but weren&#x27;t remingtons.)  </li>
            <li>The only good aspect was the eyebrow trimmer, however that was not what I bought it for, I bought it for the other two.</li>
            <li>Other than the lack of those attachments I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I would order it again if it wasn&#x27;t suddenly $35 over what I originally paid.</li>
            <li>Honestly better to use just about any other razor.</li>
            <li>This Remington was purchased to replace and older but same model, I had the other one over 10 years before the battery wasn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very user friendly and the battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 4 years, and I&#x27;ve used this little trimmer every week to trim my bikini area to a more feminine length before using my regular razor to get a closer, clean shave on the edges.</li>
            <li>The previous generation of this product had a better one.</li>
            <li>The main heads of the groomer do not work at all.</li>
            <li>A lot of them did not come with one particular head that I needed.</li>
            <li>Only used it a few times but so fr, so good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s weight just for the main attachment with the foil screen.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item thinking that it was going to be strong and fast enough for the bikini line, but it wasn&#x27;t(it didn&#x27;t work anywhere actually), the blade just jumps and cuts my</li>
            <li>I bought my last one about 8 years ago and when it gave out I knew exactly what I wanted to replace it with!</li>
            <li>But I mostly use it for keeping hair at a manageable and less noticeable length, so it works for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use the shaver in the shower if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast it shaves your bikini line.</li>
            <li>While the battery gets old fast (my battery needs to get charged nearly after every use, and I only just purchased the razor 3 mos ago), and despite that the razor will (sometimes) get buggy, i.e. not turn on, and need to be smacked gently to get it working again, this razor is still totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The different comb guards are really bulky and you cannot get a precise cut, though they have different numbers.  </li>
            <li>The only cons would be that it is pretty noisy and the foil shaver doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>the first one i bought straight from the store and it lasted me 5 years, this is the second one ive owned and</li>
            <li>I had the same razor in the past and loved it until it just quit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought my share of electric razors/shavers (for women), usually from the big scary interwebs (with not being able to see it in person before buying it), and I must say this 7 in 1 razor by Remington is one of the best electric razors I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t review</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good and not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>I had this set for approximately 6-7 months, and it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>The trimmer without the comb works great for mowing down an overgrown forest in seconds, but only reduces it to a long stubble.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they need to make the design better so that the charger doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>Can be left right in the shower</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think it was new although it claimed to be.</li>
            <li>This new razor makes noise when plugged in.</li>
            <li>Took allot of shopping to find a new one.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend it and wish I had just ordered a new Phillips.</li>
            <li>I will be getting a new Bodygroom [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 BodyGroom Pro]]</li>
            <li>i want to try something new if if it doesn&#x27;t work out i will repurchase.</li>
            <li>I spent more than I should have on it and didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d bought such a dud until way after the grace period that I had to return it.    </li>
            <li>It lost charge very fast, until it finally just stopped charging altogether  Oh, and did I mention it pulls on your skin and hair?</li>
            <li>This was done in a very sensitive bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with irritation.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Did not cut through hair very easily, takes forever to charge and the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough to shave anything.</li>
            <li>Being such a cute little product, I really wanted to like this razor.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li>The entire unit gave out its battery life within 10 minutes on that first try, and the battery never held a charge afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This price is better than I usually get it for</li>
            <li>I had the same exact razor</li>
            <li>I purchased this against the reviews because it was the same exact model.  </li>
            <li>This only cost me $20 when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>Now the rest of my bikini area wants me to give up the razor, too, but I feel like I have to keep some level of clean definition down there!     </li>
            <li>I figured maybe the battery was just run down, but when I plugged the charger in, the charge light wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very close, accurate, micro-foil women&#x27;s shaver, same for other grooming attachments.  </li>
            <li>its cheap &amp; lasted less than a week pulled hair out instead of shaved</li>
            <li>I was able to get it to charge fully once, and less than five minutes later when I went to use it</li>
            <li>I tried it both wet and dry and was not at all satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>When I initially received, I noticed it was not the quality of the older version and wondered about returning it then; hind sight is 20/20!</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the instructions clearly say charge for 14-16 hours, and it WILL NOT work while plugged in.</li>
            <li>And really, in a bikini trimmer, that one reason is the only one I need.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the mini-foil shaver or the eyebrow trimmer (and the eyebrow trimmer is an awful pain to remove once it&#x27;s attached), but the regular trimmer head worked great.</li>
            <li>No trouble.</li>
            <li>like what happens with batteries get really old.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>,I really want my money back for both of them.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had one of the old attachments.</li>
            <li>It is just like the old one</li>
            <li>It boasts all sorts of connectors/cutters but only one of them really works, the rest were just pieces of plastic sitting in my drawer collecting dust.</li>
            <li>And so far I&#x27;ve had no problem with the battery dying or not charging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li>I have not \\&quot;played\\&quot;with this too much, but it works for trimming hair very low.</li>
            <li>Ok I bought two of these shavers and both of them stopped working after the second use,don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li>The size is nice, too, not too bulky or big for delicate areas.</li>
            <li>The shaver does nothing and the trimmer is way too intense for shaving/trimming your \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area (particularly if you&#x27;re like me and using an electric because a straight razor is too harsh for sensitive areas).  </li>
            <li>Small and compact makes it easy to take along while traveling.</li>
            <li>it trimmed to a shorter length, and then a plain old razor to clean up the edges.   </li>
            <li>It works, but its only decent, not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when using the guard, you have to go over the same spot over and over to get a decent shave</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s necessarily the fault of this particular</li>
            <li>it smelled... somewhat clean.. but washed it several times due to the smell...</li>
            <li>but only that first time, and only with the bare razor that you put the guard on, not the steel mesh attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will irritate and nick skin in sensitive areas if not very careful.</li>
            <li>The new one is only $25.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an earlier model that eventually did the same thing but that one lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter if you use this product wet or dry, on fine or coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for trimming down longer hairs before going in with a razor, or for a quick skim before putting on a swimsuit, especially if you&#x27;re not a fan of putting sharp, large, awkward blades in tight places.</li>
            <li>and I wish I had not spent my money on it.</li>
            <li>Barely used this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He told me that it felt like the shaver was ripping off the ends of the hair and barely trimmed anything off.</li>
            <li>After barely 5 months of use, the unit doesn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li>I found that this one doesn&#x27;t cut the hair nearly as close as the same brand that I use to have.</li>
            <li>Mine just died last week and it was 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>Its not terrible but its not great.</li>
            <li>My little triangle area has never been happier, no more razor burn on the most sensitive area!</li>
            <li>I found this got as close as any other brand electric shaver I have used and was extremely reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like this product because it gets really close to the skin compared to other razors reducing the frequency of shaving needed.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Remington personal groomer that I&#x27;d had for close to ten years</li>
            <li>It initially held charge for 3 to 4 uses (2-4 minutes per use), then gradually decreased until it couldn&#x27;t keep a charge for more than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely not recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li>My one complaint was it didn&#x27;t come with the eyebrow trimmer that my old one did and its body was just a bit too large to attach the old trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it will pull a little at your hair, although nothing serious it does kind of hurt.</li>
            <li>I was surprised it lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li>It replaced an old Sunbeam that lasted a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>After using this old one for as long as I can remember, I think power is getting weaker now.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this trimmer, wish I had read the reviews first before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>someone who doesn&#x27;t do a lot of work down there and just wants to stay neat</li>
            <li>Lots of reviews express disappointment, but once you get the hang of this thing, you will be pleased, and you will forget the others!  </li>
            <li>It used to be green, and called a 5-in-1, but it looks to be exactly the same thing in a different color.   </li>
            <li>I finally set it down at an angle where the light stayed on and let it charge for a few hours, but it still won&#x27;t do anything when I try to turn it on.</li>
            <li>Tried the eyebrow trimmer for those little antennae hairs in the middle, but it didn&#x27;t really float my boat</li>

            <li> , it does the job nice!</li>
            <li> For trimming hair below the waist, make sure you go in the direction the hair grows for best results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great results!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Remington WPG-2000 Smooth &amp; Silky Woomen&#x27;s Body and Bikini Kit.</li>
            <li> It did not give me good results</li>
            <li> It also is good for a lot of</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews it got.</li>
            <li> All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace the one that I had had for years and loved, got the newer model</li>
            <li> I recommend it is a good buy</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for a mans goatee.</li>
            <li> They also make one that is good for nose trimming.</li>
            <li> So I say for the money its an all around good product.</li>
            <li> Said it was good for the legs but did not work..</li>
            <li> (good luck with that).</li>
            <li> and it still works good.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Body &amp; Bikini Remington.  </li>
            <li> It was perfect and was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something better quality!</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry around and the performance is great</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It worked great for almost a year, with medium to light use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing bikini trimmer IMO.</li>
            <li> The price of the product is also reasonable and perfect one</li>
            <li> If that was what it was doing to his chin, I couldn&#x27;t imagine using this product to do any kind of bikini trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its honestly overpriced.</li>
            <li> The interface when changing the head is nice.</li>
            <li> And honestly....</li>
            <li> this product is cute and the pouch makes it a good purchase, but the contents does not.  </li>
            <li> it came with a nice purse to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> this is a steal, and holds up nicely.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> Plus, it came with a nice carrying case and charger.</li>
            <li> It thinned out and trimmed the hair nicely</li>
            <li> Had a lot of catching up to do.</li>
            <li> my own fault.  </li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> I would recommend to all my friends and already have to be honest</li>
            <li> A great tool for when I need a quick shave, or don&#x27;t feel like using a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> The attachments are very easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li> either get a razor or spend more money on a better shaver!</li>
            <li> Surprising because it appears cheap when taking the shaver out of the box.</li>
            <li> The service was fantastic and the price was good.</li>
            <li> I have had great success with this product; I use it instead of paying $35/mo.</li>
            <li> If you want something easy and no pain get this because it works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine and easy to use!..  </li>
            <li> I have the same product from another manufacturer that has worked flawlessly for years and after seeing this product I thought what a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li> I love that it is very easy to hold and use not bulky like most ladies electric razors.</li>
            <li> As I said, the IDEA is brilliant, but the execution and quality fell far below my expectations.</li>
            <li> I did nick myself once, but it was more of a pinch</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is more a review on the seller not the product because I never received the product.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off trying to trim your bikini line with a butter knife.</li>
            <li> come on, Remington, you know better.</li>
            <li> its not going to be Remington WPG-2000 thats for sure.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the precision trimmer for the bikini area</li>
            <li> I also love that this shaver keeps a charge that&#x27;s important!</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I was able to use this once.</li>
            <li> many years now.</li>
            <li> Just be sure NOT to press the head to your skin as stated in the instructions for use.</li>
            <li> There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> its purple, can you ask for more?</li>
            <li> and it has better power/speed.</li>
            <li> I wish stores would discontinue them today and never sell them again and stick to electric razors, I wish they sell more women&#x27;s electric razors now and throw out cord razors.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job....</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> The plastic comb piece on this one is made better.</li>
            <li> Love that you can use it with or without water.</li>
            <li> No problem with the ptoduct and its water proof too. :-)</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> think there are better products,</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> He likes it better than the men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> TAKES FOREVER to use and needs more power.&lt;br /&gt;Buying</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many nips from this thing</li>
            <li> sure my neighbors knows when I&#x27;m shaving)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really can&#x27;t ask for more from a shaving product.</li>
            <li> Why is this one so much,  they are asking 3 times more than what I paid at the store!!</li>
            <li> The razor was the real reason why i bought this product and it DOESN&#x27;T EVEN WORK!!!!</li>
            <li> However the shaver attachment really doesn&#x27;t do much good, but if you&#x27;re going over the rest anyway with your own razor then the trimmer is fine.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to trim my fem area and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but does nick in the most tender of places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not intended for shaving large areas like legs, but worked exceptionally well for shaping and trimming bikini area.  </li>
            <li> easy to cut</li>
            <li> I would recommend this because it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> Otherwise easy to use.</li>
            <li> to use, Easy to change heads, and Easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Instructions easy .....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, and in her words, &amp;#34;It makes it really easy to shave all my tender</li>
            <li> They work just fine for bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t abused it and can&#x27;t understand why it works fine one day and</li>
            <li> I just use an eyebrow brush when I need to and it works fine.</li>
            <li> turned on fine</li>
            <li> and what I use it for that is fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it would be fine.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and good quality as far as price concern</li>
            <li> This is a perfect wife/mother gift for anyone even children and husbands because women sometimes need a little pampering to make them feel go  od.</li>

            <li> Edit to my Initial Review:     I bought one of these about 4 years ago and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Trimmed to a comfortable level, without pain or itching.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you want to be in pain and enjoy bleeding all over the place.</li>
            <li> Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice bag to keep it all</li>
            <li> Too light could not use it</li>
            <li> so it always available.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for \\&quot;smooth and silky\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It does shave the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the smooth feel on my legs that I would like.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s never used an electric razor before.</li>
            <li> After using the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020/31 BodyGroom]] to maintain my bikini area for years (yes, I&#x27;m female and the Bodygroom is advertised as a men&#x27;s product, but it&#x27;s been great for me)</li>
            <li> This same trimmer set was at Sally&#x27;s for 17 dollars lol like what..</li>
            <li> My skin was as smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> It does not give a close smooth trim.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull and pinch so its a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I had an old version that was really good.</li>
            <li> It is far from being a good choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this product right before the summer knowing I had more to trim during the warmer months and didn&#x27;t feel like spending the money on buying a bunch of separate pieces.</li>
            <li> The first latest about a year but for the price that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this purchase as for while I could only shave.</li>
            <li> It worked okay the first time, but has lost its charge after each use all 4 or 5 times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> It could have been user error, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I was using it according to the directions included with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li> Now to be fair, it was a great trimmer when it worked, but it died far too soon for the amount of money spent!</li>
            <li> Love the different attachments, and the bag makes it handy to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> I even demonstrated it to my husband attempting to shave it with and without attachments and it did nothing but emit a mild buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> Because it charges, it does a clean shave wherever you need it.  </li>
            <li> , it took me awhile to realize that you can pull apart the shaver heads to clean them.</li>
            <li> This replaced an old Remington shaver that lasted 10 + years, so far so good!  </li>
            <li> and I was able to get the old one to fit and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Charged for the full day, and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since.</li>
            <li> I contacted them and all they said is \\&quot;we are very sorry,\\&quot; and they did nothing more.</li>
            <li> I had not had an electric shaver in many years because they never seemed to work very well.</li>
            <li> maybe most people know that they &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> just run the motor alone, shut off, add the head back and it is good.</li>
            <li> The little bag is also great for quick and easy storage/travel.</li>
            <li> Next the razor that doesn&#x27;t work as my hair is too fine, my boyfriend tried it and it works for him, how nice.</li>
            <li> Being able to use this trimmer wet or dry makes it so perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and adore the ability to trim my hair to varying lengths, trim my eyebrows, and do quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use while pregnant</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve had many personal trimmers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for in between waxes.:-)</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well on fine hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do as good a job on coarse hair as I would like.</li>
            <li> I figured since I&#x27;d had such a good experience with the brand, I could be as happy with a new version of the same product.</li>
            <li> And it comes with this fantastic mini/micro shaver head and boy, that baby really works!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for touch-ups only, and I have been very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> Holds it&#x27;s charge a good long time, even when not used often.</li>
            <li> And at this price, it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a pack of new razor blades.</li>
            <li> I found that it cuts very well and very quickly.</li>
            <li> but this product has not failed to accomplish anything that has been tried!</li>
            <li> shaver won&#x27;t get your skin as smooth as waxing, although using the mini-shaver attachment gets really close to the skin and will leave your skin feeling pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I bought the first in this series of Lady&#x27;s Remington at Walmart for about $18!  </li>
            <li> I keep having to charge it, it keeps losing charge very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t last me more than 5 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little shaver.can be used in the shower too</li>
            <li> and I find the thing can&#x27;t be charged because the charger doesn&#x27;t fit very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle, close, accurate, albeit a pain.  </li>
            <li> The travel bag I got was white not like the picture but its nice for traveling.</li>
            <li> Whatever kind of silver they use in it totally does prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Wahl isn&#x27;t worth diddly for getting those shorter nose hairs that the nose-hair trimmer can&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li> This version seems to work just as well but didn&#x27;t come with as many attachments as the old version did.</li>
            <li> Not so good, It was a gift for my gf, and the product doesn&#x27;t work as she expected to be,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> But worth the money.</li>
            <li> For trimming along the bikini line, the trimmer head was perfect, and the number 4 setting (one comb has settings from 1-4, the other 5-8 increasing in length) on the trimmer head left the bikini area</li>
            <li> First it would lose charge extremely quickly, this went on for about 2 months before it downright refused to turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> The detail trimmer is decent enough, it does cut and works good around the bikini line and the underarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t right at all</li>
            <li> just right so that it will charge.</li>
            <li> Its efficient and is a great tool to use (even if the head is a bit small, its worth it for those detail areas).  </li>
            <li> For my money, it&#x27;s the best twenty-some dollars I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have been being cheap and just bought a decent one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, its a simple, clean product that is good for occasional use.</li>
            <li> a very reasonable, trimmed length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe the cord is defective as it is fine when my old cord is used.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it dry makes it a lifesaver for quick fixes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was right for the assortment of shavers included.&lt;br /&gt;Thought they would come in handy for something or other.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a quick &amp; easy substitute for a razor in getting everything completely smooth down there, but unfortunately not.</li>
            <li> It may be because for the first year or two I had it</li>
            <li> It does not, and I can only imagine that it has to do more with Quality assurance than anything else since some of the reviews here indicate that theirs works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> Putting the guard attachment on it that first time, it would not function at all until I had taken the attachment off and then poked the metal post in the head.</li>
            <li> And not cutting quite as close really reduces razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The first time I thought I broke it or over charged it or something thats</li>
            <li> I totally love this shaver, and so does my husband, who uses it on his back and chest.  </li>
            <li> the precision trimmer attatchment was painfull and did a better job at nicking my skin than it did at actually removing hair.</li>
            <li> I thought the first one was a fluke</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the first one that I owned, that one lasted 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> I actually think that it works better in the shower.</li>
            <li> The functions allow you to change to 3 different head sizes, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the attachments shown in the first picture.  </li>
            <li> I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to worry if it got wet.</li>
            <li> Worked well the first time around.</li>
            <li> therefore the only one i use.&lt;br /&gt;i love that it can be used in the shower and that it is rechargable and the battery lasts for days.</li>
            <li> will say however, that I love how the attachments are very simple to put on and off.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple times and the most it will do</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer at Target for a fraction of what they&#x27;re charging here, and I still paid too much!</li>
            <li> it is not even funny.</li>
            <li> You must charge this thing about 16 hours before first use.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t come with one of the key attachments that the older model had that i liked so much about it.  </li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted, but I&#x27;m definitely not going to replace it with the same model.</li>
            <li> The attachments are nothing spectacular, standard with shavers as far as I know.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine used it at our last spa night and enjoyed it so much that I&#x27;m here to buy one for her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Most of the attachments don&#x27;t work on hair that is short and it does absolutely nothing to stubble.</li>
            <li> I really like it very much.</li>
            <li> I would say do not plan on having too long, if the price makes that ok, then it does work well.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for over a year and it has always pretty much sucked.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is it can not remove the very small rooted hair perfectly otherwise works well for my eye brow .</li>
            <li> considering how little I paid for it, but there are far better electric razors out there that are much safer and do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver last night and immediately opened it because I was excited to find a cute shaver with all of the different attachments.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with this razor is the fact that the charger breaks easily.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are made for a woman but strong enough for a MAN!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that in the picture the mini eyebrow shaver, the cutting edge is at the top, mine is on the side, and I really think it would be more ideal if the razor was on the top.</li>
            <li> so I snatched it up even though my last one is still fine.</li>
            <li> I oiled it maybe 4 or 5 times the whole time I had it.</li>
            <li> I have another one by Philips which really works.</li>
            <li> I tried two different outlets and ended up having to wiggle the cord around to get the charge light to come on.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I bought it from target, and it came with a 30 day money back guarantee, so I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it works, but it really does.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and I bought two because after the plug socket gets wet, the charger will not work.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem to even work.</li>
            <li> I tried using the mini shaver (not the brow or bikini trimmer) and it did not work for me very well.</li>
            <li> The Bikini trimmer worked very well though.</li>
            <li> It came charged and ready too go.</li>
            <li> Battery die fast.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge really well</li>
            <li> If I were you, I would really reconsider.</li>
            <li> You really get what you paid for with this product.</li>
            <li> I got it through Wal-Mart and really should have looked at reviews before I did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was using with lackluster results, with this.($18.00 for the WHOLE kit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than I expected and gratefully deserved.  </li>
            <li> problems I have with the device are that it really irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to work reasonably well.</li>
            <li> Im very well used to using a shaver;I bought this one to replace a Wahl which was going bad(used it for years and</li>
            <li> it started making so much noise,(im</li>
            <li> The microfoil does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get quite as close and smooth as a similar one I had years ago, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a popular \\&quot;big box\\&quot; store, to replace a Remington shaver that I&#x27;d had for 5 years that finally literally fell to pieces in my hands.</li>
            <li> So once again, I had to go over the same spot multiple times to get an effective shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the previous reviewers were expecting, but I thought this was an excellent product.</li>
            <li> As long as you turn the blade so it stays even with the skin from edge to edge, it&#x27;s easy to avoid nicks.</li>
            <li> This is my third trimmer (the other two wore out after years of much loved use, but weren&#x27;t remingtons.)  </li>
            <li> The only good aspect was the eyebrow trimmer, however that was not what I bought it for, I bought it for the other two.</li>
            <li> Other than the lack of those attachments I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I would order it again if it wasn&#x27;t suddenly $35 over what I originally paid.</li>
            <li> Honestly better to use just about any other razor.</li>
            <li> This Remington was purchased to replace and older but same model, I had the other one over 10 years before the battery wasn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very user friendly and the battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 4 years, and I&#x27;ve used this little trimmer every week to trim my bikini area to a more feminine length before using my regular razor to get a closer, clean shave on the edges.</li>
            <li> The previous generation of this product had a better one.</li>
            <li> The main heads of the groomer do not work at all.</li>
            <li> A lot of them did not come with one particular head that I needed.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times but so fr, so good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weight just for the main attachment with the foil screen.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking that it was going to be strong and fast enough for the bikini line, but it wasn&#x27;t(it didn&#x27;t work anywhere actually), the blade just jumps and cuts my</li>
            <li> I bought my last one about 8 years ago and when it gave out I knew exactly what I wanted to replace it with!</li>
            <li> But I mostly use it for keeping hair at a manageable and less noticeable length, so it works for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use the shaver in the shower if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast it shaves your bikini line.</li>
            <li> While the battery gets old fast (my battery needs to get charged nearly after every use, and I only just purchased the razor 3 mos ago), and despite that the razor will (sometimes) get buggy, i.e. not turn on, and need to be smacked gently to get it working again, this razor is still totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The different comb guards are really bulky and you cannot get a precise cut, though they have different numbers.  </li>
            <li> The only cons would be that it is pretty noisy and the foil shaver doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> the first one i bought straight from the store and it lasted me 5 years, this is the second one ive owned and</li>
            <li> I had the same razor in the past and loved it until it just quit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my share of electric razors/shavers (for women), usually from the big scary interwebs (with not being able to see it in person before buying it), and I must say this 7 in 1 razor by Remington is one of the best electric razors I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good and not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> I had this set for approximately 6-7 months, and it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer without the comb works great for mowing down an overgrown forest in seconds, but only reduces it to a long stubble.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they need to make the design better so that the charger doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> Can be left right in the shower</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think it was new although it claimed to be.</li>
            <li> This new razor makes noise when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Took allot of shopping to find a new one.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend it and wish I had just ordered a new Phillips.</li>
            <li> I will be getting a new Bodygroom [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 BodyGroom Pro]]</li>
            <li> i want to try something new if if it doesn&#x27;t work out i will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I spent more than I should have on it and didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d bought such a dud until way after the grace period that I had to return it.    </li>
            <li> It lost charge very fast, until it finally just stopped charging altogether  Oh, and did I mention it pulls on your skin and hair?</li>
            <li> This was done in a very sensitive bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with irritation.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Did not cut through hair very easily, takes forever to charge and the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough to shave anything.</li>
            <li> Being such a cute little product, I really wanted to like this razor.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> The entire unit gave out its battery life within 10 minutes on that first try, and the battery never held a charge afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This price is better than I usually get it for</li>
            <li> I had the same exact razor</li>
            <li> I purchased this against the reviews because it was the same exact model.  </li>
            <li> This only cost me $20 when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> Now the rest of my bikini area wants me to give up the razor, too, but I feel like I have to keep some level of clean definition down there!     </li>
            <li> I figured maybe the battery was just run down, but when I plugged the charger in, the charge light wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very close, accurate, micro-foil women&#x27;s shaver, same for other grooming attachments.  </li>
            <li> its cheap &amp; lasted less than a week pulled hair out instead of shaved</li>
            <li> I was able to get it to charge fully once, and less than five minutes later when I went to use it</li>
            <li> I tried it both wet and dry and was not at all satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> When I initially received, I noticed it was not the quality of the older version and wondered about returning it then; hind sight is 20/20!</li>
            <li> Huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the instructions clearly say charge for 14-16 hours, and it WILL NOT work while plugged in.</li>
            <li> And really, in a bikini trimmer, that one reason is the only one I need.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the mini-foil shaver or the eyebrow trimmer (and the eyebrow trimmer is an awful pain to remove once it&#x27;s attached), but the regular trimmer head worked great.</li>
            <li> No trouble.</li>
            <li> like what happens with batteries get really old.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> ,I really want my money back for both of them.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had one of the old attachments.</li>
            <li> It is just like the old one</li>
            <li> It boasts all sorts of connectors/cutters but only one of them really works, the rest were just pieces of plastic sitting in my drawer collecting dust.</li>
            <li> And so far I&#x27;ve had no problem with the battery dying or not charging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> I have not \\&quot;played\\&quot;with this too much, but it works for trimming hair very low.</li>
            <li> Ok I bought two of these shavers and both of them stopped working after the second use,don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> The size is nice, too, not too bulky or big for delicate areas.</li>
            <li> The shaver does nothing and the trimmer is way too intense for shaving/trimming your \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area (particularly if you&#x27;re like me and using an electric because a straight razor is too harsh for sensitive areas).  </li>
            <li> Small and compact makes it easy to take along while traveling.</li>
            <li> it trimmed to a shorter length, and then a plain old razor to clean up the edges.   </li>
            <li> It works, but its only decent, not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when using the guard, you have to go over the same spot over and over to get a decent shave</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s necessarily the fault of this particular</li>
            <li> it smelled... somewhat clean.. but washed it several times due to the smell...</li>
            <li> but only that first time, and only with the bare razor that you put the guard on, not the steel mesh attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will irritate and nick skin in sensitive areas if not very careful.</li>
            <li> The new one is only $25.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an earlier model that eventually did the same thing but that one lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if you use this product wet or dry, on fine or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for trimming down longer hairs before going in with a razor, or for a quick skim before putting on a swimsuit, especially if you&#x27;re not a fan of putting sharp, large, awkward blades in tight places.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had not spent my money on it.</li>
            <li> Barely used this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He told me that it felt like the shaver was ripping off the ends of the hair and barely trimmed anything off.</li>
            <li> After barely 5 months of use, the unit doesn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li> I found that this one doesn&#x27;t cut the hair nearly as close as the same brand that I use to have.</li>
            <li> Mine just died last week and it was 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> Its not terrible but its not great.</li>
            <li> My little triangle area has never been happier, no more razor burn on the most sensitive area!</li>
            <li> I found this got as close as any other brand electric shaver I have used and was extremely reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i like this product because it gets really close to the skin compared to other razors reducing the frequency of shaving needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Remington personal groomer that I&#x27;d had for close to ten years</li>
            <li> It initially held charge for 3 to 4 uses (2-4 minutes per use), then gradually decreased until it couldn&#x27;t keep a charge for more than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely not recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li> My one complaint was it didn&#x27;t come with the eyebrow trimmer that my old one did and its body was just a bit too large to attach the old trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it will pull a little at your hair, although nothing serious it does kind of hurt.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li> It replaced an old Sunbeam that lasted a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> After using this old one for as long as I can remember, I think power is getting weaker now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this trimmer, wish I had read the reviews first before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> someone who doesn&#x27;t do a lot of work down there and just wants to stay neat</li>
            <li> Lots of reviews express disappointment, but once you get the hang of this thing, you will be pleased, and you will forget the others!  </li>
            <li> It used to be green, and called a 5-in-1, but it looks to be exactly the same thing in a different color.   </li>
            <li> I finally set it down at an angle where the light stayed on and let it charge for a few hours, but it still won&#x27;t do anything when I try to turn it on.</li>
            <li> Tried the eyebrow trimmer for those little antennae hairs in the middle, but it didn&#x27;t really float my boat</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything in the directions about that so for a few months, I had trouble figuring out how to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Lower power and does not last long.</li>
            <li> The razor just flat out does not work.</li>
            <li> trims hair very low, doesn&#x27;t take long when trimming.</li>
            <li> The battery is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The plastic comb attachment didn&#x27;t work very well because the actual comb is just too thick for the tiny, close to the body hairs that you are trying to trim/cut.</li>
            <li> This trimmer did not last long!</li>
            <li> had to go over the same place a couple of times in stubborn areas but that was to be expected especially after nothing being done all winter.</li>
            <li> It has a nice wide base which makes for a very sturdy grip so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping out of your hand ever.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to use it, and the connection with the charger is so poor that I have to wiggle it to find the right a spot where it will charge.  </li>
            <li> , I stored it on the shelf and not in the shower, so it only got wet once a week when I used it.</li>
            <li> It does not hold a charge long either.</li>
            <li> The trimmer, trims way too long even on the lowest setting of all the attachments and their settings, and when you take the attachments off it trims way to close, to the point that it is might as well be the razor.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t take long to charge either).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I had purchased this so long ago.  </li>
            <li> gets to all those lady parts, water proof and battery holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge a long time and has a variety of heads to trim to varying lengths.</li>
            <li> It was used regularly and only quit accepting a charge to the battery after having been left in the shower for a few uses and the connection corroded...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not able to catch enough and you are more likely to cut yourself on random bumps than get hairs out.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand that considering how long I had charged it.  </li>
            <li> I have been through so many other lousy ones, and spent another $100 searching.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, between the having to go over the same area a hundred times before it would trim, or the sound of the trimmer getting weak and strong and weak again, or the way the plastic is molded so that it can \\&quot;trap\\&quot; your hair (OWCH!)</li>
            <li> Other produces have left me irritated.</li>
            <li> I looked around at other products and went back with what I know.</li>
            <li> Same goes for when changing to other heads.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for very long</li>
            <li> so i think if i would have kept it in a dry place it would have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I charge it, it&#x27;ll last half way through a shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I had no success with the shaver, big dissappointment and</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the first time I am leaving a review since I am really not happy paying 62 dollars for nothing.</li>
            <li> It is a wet and dry product meaning you can use it in the shower or dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any hair that was long enough so my boyfriend tried to trim his beard a little with this thing.</li>
            <li> Used it dry and wet.  </li>
            <li> the bottom half of it was cut open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item dry and wet and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> If you see what looks like black powder left on your skin, NOT TO WORRY.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest it coming with is a little brush to wipe off the clippers after each use.  </li>
            <li> This little Remington-branded gem has a shaver head that actually works like</li>
            <li> Far less work than shaving all the time, far less expensive than waxing, far less drastic than both.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The charge held for roughly five minutes then it died on me.</li>
            <li> This thing trims well and relatively close, but even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;wet/dry,&amp;#34; the charger rusted and is now forever dead.</li>
            <li> This item is really not what i expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I think once it gets wet</li>
            <li> Be careful this trimmer will grab your skin and cut it as if you cut it with a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> I used this razor maybe once or twice a month, during which time it worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I have gotten it wet, but not used it in the shower, and have no problems.</li>
            <li> However, I feel like that is a risk I run using a shaver, since they are notorious for being rough on skin.</li>
            <li> I tried using the other attachments and found them uncomforable during use, and not a clean shave, so, like I said, trimmer for the larger area where you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> It is not a good product and I&#x27;m surprised at Remington.</li>
            <li> It will no longer charge based on some of the other reviews I see</li>
            <li> and it was a total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even bother with the other attachment.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after my other Remington trimmer (which is now discontinued) stopped working.</li>
            <li> It was nothing like my other one.</li>
            <li> other uses also.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to buy some other shaver...</li>
            <li> The razors hold up well, stay sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought this going against other reviews, but I must admit it was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> Small price to pay, if you&#x27;ve struggled with facial hair.</li>
            <li> It protects your skin with the combs but even if you take the combs off for a closer cut, it&#x27;s still not aggressive like men shavers but still be careful.!</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It could barely trim the delicate peach-fuzz on my face.</li>
            <li> still give it two stars because it \\&quot;works,\\&quot; in the sense that it does, with some coaxing, trim hair... but not very closely and not very quickly and not very comfortably and with some nicking.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointing as I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to return this one without any packaging.</li>
            <li> This trimmer left me bleeding pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> not worth</li>
            <li> I had this (poorly made) razor for about 6 months and it completely stopped working about a month ago.</li>
            <li> umm i say off and on because i always end up with bumps and itching and hurting down there.....</li>
            <li> I owned this shaver for less than a year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted an upgrade from my previous version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous eyebrow trimmer comb broke and upon seeing this I couldn&#x27;t wait until it arrived, however after receiving it</li>
            <li> This is well shaped and works well, but after going through two that each lasted less than two years, I will find something else.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping to shave less and it didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve changed it less than 10 times (no lie).</li>
            <li> Less than 4 months since purchase</li>
            <li> Less than five uses and it died and stopped charging.</li>
            <li> But Remington, please bring forth a less fussy product.</li>
            <li> I also use a little bit of shaving cream to cut down on irritation.</li>
            <li> for legs, I have seen the company tell some people it can be used for your legs and that is not true.</li>
            <li> As with any electric trimmer/razor, you must pull the skin you are working on tight.</li>
            <li> As with any trimmer/shaver, you have to pull the skin tight to prevent that.</li>
            <li> A little whittling with my Xacto knife</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that trims AND shaves, this little guy is just what you need.</li>
            <li> For the little bit I use it, I&#x27;ve had it for months without having to charge it.</li>
            <li> After gradualdecrease in the life of the charge, it is now dead after almost 4 years.</li>
            <li> Few weeks</li>
            <li> The unguarded attachment was extremely harsh on the skin, the mesh razor never worked at all, and the guard used on the trimmer was ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and it was completely dead.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> if you dont the battery will be dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Uneven cuts.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months, and it&#x27;s already dead/broke.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time/money on this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> wAs a waste of money.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of money, would not  recomend</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer a few months ago from another website.  </li>
            <li> So for those users who were having trouble because it dies or didn&#x27;t work while plugged in, that&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably use once a week for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It has given a few nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I try to wait until it&#x27;s almost dead before recharging it to preserve the battery life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i was disappointed right from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I tried to used it gently, but it is impossible, it always cuts my skin.</li>
            <li> I could have used that $16 towards a wax, and that still would been less of a pain than this sorry excuse of a product.</li>
            <li> small, compact and works quite well.  </li>
            <li> There are just no redeeming qualities about it.</li>
            <li> That is what usually breaks and this looks rather sturdy.</li>
            <li> No more cord to plug in</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had enough with having to deal with uncomfortable, itchy bikini lines.</li>
            <li> Now I am past the return policy days and looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was trying to avoid razor burn and cutting myself and this product has actually given me a few cuts and does not remove hair all that well.</li>
            <li> A serious waste of money.</li>
            <li> It still works well when charged, but after a few months the charging port got bent somehow and it very hard to get the charger situated</li>
            <li> and I hardly felt it.</li>
            <li> but now it is dull or something, so hardly working at all.  </li>
            <li> And, despite which trimmer head I used, the blades were soooo dull.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I think the old one the cord was bad or somethings..</li>
            <li> this is a common problem ugh</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was the optional eyebrow trimmer was not included.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to add my two cents since all the negative reviews were making me panic about buying this.</li>
            <li> Painful to use on sensitive areas...</li>
            <li> My advice don&#x27;t waste your money on remington anymore, they are an outdated product to buy today.</li>
            <li> I am hoping there are no more disappointments but won&#x27;t hold my breath!</li>
            <li> Also sometimes the blades would pinch my skin and create a small cut which is not welcomed for the bikini area!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the battery died in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Also after less than six months it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge so it is useless to me now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not going to risk it again, too bad because like I stated before - It actually worked well while it did work.</li>
            <li> this one is not good quality.</li>
            <li> We hardly have the patience for this!</li>
            <li> This thing cut me and made me bleed and when using wet or dry, it felt like it was shocking</li>
            <li> I was tired of razor burn from a Brazillian-style razor shave every week, and I wanted to let some au-natural beauty come through to save me time/itching/discomfort.     </li>
            <li> was the worse purchase I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> It is just a poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> If you want a close shave, you&#x27;ll have to go behind it with a razor.</li>
            <li> really waste of money...blades dosent wrk at all..really bad</li>
            <li> Once I turned it on, I noticed that the motor seemed weak as if it was about to conk out!  </li>
            <li> So if it won&#x27;t take a charge it is completely useless as there is also no way to change the battery.  </li>
            <li> This product is nearly useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the eyebrow trimmer/comb, so I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible waste of space and money and if I could give it negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> Simple put... terrible.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.</li>
            <li> the mini shaver attatchment was completely useless.</li>
            <li> This legitimately is useless.</li>
            <li> This piece of equipment is way too expensive for any price you pay here on Amazon.    </li>
            <li> and I hope they discontinue this awful product and create something that ACTUALLY works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve lost the recharger, so I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
            <li> No complaints with the trimmer&#x27;s performance but very disappointed that the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge or even work after less than a year.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> i had a remington shaver years ago that was equally disappointing.</li>
            <li> I also noticed, as did others, that it pulls the hair out instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> Without the attachments, you will get nicks like crazy.  </li>
            <li> AWFUL dont waste your money !!!</li>
            <li> Bad idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When not using any attaqchments, the razor cuts up my skin so bad.  </li>
            <li> Really bad product.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the bad reviews for this product, I was worried that I had sunk $20 in a mistake.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too shocked about this</li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if you could use it plugged into the AC power but for some crazy reason you CAN&#x27;T use it while it is PLUGGED IN!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it failed to cut hair even a quarter-inch in length even with the close shaving attachment and nicked horribly.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in that</li>
            <li> But for everything else it fails miserably.</li>
            <li> This stupid thing won&#x27;t hold a charge to save a life.</li>
            <li> I HATE this trimmer</li>
            <li> BADLY!</li>
            <li> I think this body and bikini kit is a very bad product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like the product but that battery life is horrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This groomer is horrible.  </li>
            <li> It was awful and made me nervous when the blood wouldn&#x27;t stop.  </li>
            <li> Terrible shaver for the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> This shaver was terrible!  </li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good product. I really like it very much. The price of the product is also reasonable and perfect one</li>
            <li> This is a excellent razor. Cuts close. I used it all the time till my sibling broke it and I had to purchase one off amazon. UPDATE. iT BREAKS AFTER A YEAR!!! It will no longer charge based on some of the other reviews I see this is a common problem ugh</li>
            <li> I bought this end of  year and only used it one time, when I try to charge it this year and I find the thing can&#x27;t be charged because the charger doesn&#x27;t fit very well.&lt;br /&gt;this is the first time I am leaving a review since I am really not happy paying 62 dollars for nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago and had no complaints until it simply stopped taking a charge. That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if you could use it plugged into the AC power but for some crazy reason you CAN&#x27;T use it while it is PLUGGED IN! So if it won&#x27;t take a charge it is completely useless as there is also no way to change the battery.  Next time I&#x27;ll just look for a corded version.</li>
            <li> I owned this shaver for less than a year. Only used it about 15 times maybe. Now all of the sudden it will not turn on at all. Tried charging it a couple times, but nothing. do not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Edit to my Initial Review:     I bought one of these about 4 years ago and it worked great. When it finally died, I immedietly went out to buy another. After one use, it wouldn&#x27;t work or even charge again. I figured it was a fluke, so I purchased another. It worked okay the first time, but has lost its charge after each use all 4 or 5 times I&#x27;ve used it. Now it won&#x27;t charge at all. Very, very disappointing as I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to return this one without any packaging. I am done with this Remington product and will be looking for something else.    Initial Review:  I bought this product for tidying, but not glorifying, my bikini area. I was tired of razor burn from a Brazillian-style razor shave every week, and I wanted to let some au-natural beauty come through to save me time/itching/discomfort.     It&#x27;s been almost 4 years, and I&#x27;ve used this little trimmer every week to trim my bikini area to a more feminine length before using my regular razor to get a closer, clean shave on the edges. My little triangle area has never been happier, no more razor burn on the most sensitive area! Now the rest of my bikini area wants me to give up the razor, too, but I feel like I have to keep some level of clean definition down there!     I used the shortest length setting on the comb attachment once a week. Trimmed to a comfortable level, without pain or itching.    I tried using the other attachments and found them uncomforable during use, and not a clean shave, so, like I said, trimmer for the larger area where you&#x27;d like it trimmed to a shorter length, and then a plain old razor to clean up the edges.   Tried the eyebrow trimmer for those little antennae hairs in the middle, but it didn&#x27;t really float my boat so I just leave them be.    I will be purchasing this product again, but it looks like they have updated the model to call it a 7-in-1 kit. It used to be green, and called a 5-in-1, but it looks to be exactly the same thing in a different color.   After gradualdecrease in the life of the charge, it is now dead after almost 4 years. I was surprised it lasted as long as it did. It may be because for the first year or two I had it, I stored it on the shelf and not in the shower, so it only got wet once a week when I used it. It initially held charge for 3 to 4 uses (2-4 minutes per use), then gradually decreased until it couldn&#x27;t keep a charge for more than 30 seconds. I oiled it maybe 4 or 5 times the whole time I had it.</li>
            <li> The shaver does nothing and the trimmer is way too intense for shaving/trimming your \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area (particularly if you&#x27;re like me and using an electric because a straight razor is too harsh for sensitive areas).  It hurts and it made me bleed.  I&#x27;m returning it, stat.</li>
            <li> Bought the thing from a big box retailer. Brought it home. It was a total waste of time and money. It didn&#x27;t seem to ever fully charge. It started loosing power mid-shave. Now, it won&#x27;t charge or turn on at all. That was only 3 months ago that I bought it. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I HATE this trimmer and it was a total waste of money!  This is my third trimmer (the other two wore out after years of much loved use, but weren&#x27;t remingtons.)  My biggest issue is that it pulls my hair out instead of shaving and cuts the skin.  And really, in a bikini trimmer, that one reason is the only one I need.  Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you want to be in pain and enjoy bleeding all over the place.</li>
            <li> Does not work correctly!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Remington WPG-2000 Smooth &amp; Silky Woomen&#x27;s Body and Bikini Kit. I love that it is very easy to hold and use not bulky like most ladies electric razors.</li>
            <li> Bought this item and it didn&#x27;t work.  The shaver attachment did NOTHING.  Not one strand of hair was removed.  Used it dry and wet.  The razor part only worked if the guard was off.  Didn&#x27;t even bother with the other attachment.  Returning it today.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my other Remington trimmer (which is now discontinued) stopped working. It was nothing like my other one. It did not give me good results and I wish I had not spent my money on it. After one year, it has stopped working. I have no idea why. In any case, I would say \\&quot;good riddance\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This never worked very good. One of the tips broke within. Few weeks</li>
            <li> If the product worked the way its meant to, it would be great..... however... It does not, and I can only imagine that it has to do more with Quality assurance than anything else since some of the reviews here indicate that theirs works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine worked once after being fully charged as instructed in the pamphlet that came with it. Putting the guard attachment on it that first time, it would not function at all until I had taken the attachment off and then poked the metal post in the head. Once I did that it did work ... but only that first time, and only with the bare razor that you put the guard on, not the steel mesh attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The unguarded attachment was extremely harsh on the skin, the mesh razor never worked at all, and the guard used on the trimmer was ineffective.  The entire unit gave out its battery life within 10 minutes on that first try, and the battery never held a charge afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As I said, the IDEA is brilliant, but the execution and quality fell far below my expectations.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s item doesn&#x27;t work at all. I have another one by Philips which really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the previous reviewers were expecting, but I thought this was an excellent product. For trimming along the bikini line, the trimmer head was perfect, and the number 4 setting (one comb has settings from 1-4, the other 5-8 increasing in length) on the trimmer head left the bikini area a very reasonable, trimmed length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the extra combs, it does cut closely, though not as close as a blade razor. It&#x27;s perfect for trimming down longer hairs before going in with a razor, or for a quick skim before putting on a swimsuit, especially if you&#x27;re not a fan of putting sharp, large, awkward blades in tight places. And not cutting quite as close really reduces razor burn and ingrown hairs. I did nick myself once, but it was more of a pinch and I hardly felt it. As long as you turn the blade so it stays even with the skin from edge to edge, it&#x27;s easy to avoid nicks. Being able to use it dry makes it a lifesaver for quick fixes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who doesn&#x27;t do a lot of work down there and just wants to stay neat, it&#x27;s perfect. Far less work than shaving all the time, far less expensive than waxing, far less drastic than both. And at this price, it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a pack of new razor blades. For my money, it&#x27;s the best twenty-some dollars I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is nearly useless.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to use it, and the connection with the charger is so poor that I have to wiggle it to find the right a spot where it will charge.  It finally stopped charging altogether.  Even when it was fully charged, it was wimpy.</li>
            <li> I had this set for approximately 6-7 months, and it worked fairly well. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the mini-foil shaver or the eyebrow trimmer (and the eyebrow trimmer is an awful pain to remove once it&#x27;s attached), but the regular trimmer head worked great. It worked well in and out of the shower, but I went to turn it on recently and it was completely dead. I figured maybe the battery was just run down, but when I plugged the charger in, the charge light wouldn&#x27;t come on. I tried two different outlets and ended up having to wiggle the cord around to get the charge light to come on. I finally set it down at an angle where the light stayed on and let it charge for a few hours, but it still won&#x27;t do anything when I try to turn it on. Disappointing. It was good while it lasted, but I&#x27;m definitely not going to replace it with the same model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer now for about a yr and it&#x27;s amazing; works great every time: I&#x27;ve never nicked myself. I&#x27;ve never used the eyebrow trimmer/comb, so I&#x27;m sorry can&#x27;t review it. Being able to use this trimmer wet or dry makes it so perfect for me.</li>
            <li> small, compact and works quite well.  I recommend it.[[ASIN:B001886K48 Remington WPG-250 Trim &amp; Shape 7-in-1 Precision Women&#x27;s Grooming Kit]]</li>
            <li> I just bought this razor and after opening it and \\&quot;charging\\&quot; it for a couple hours I tried using it. The charge held for roughly five minutes then it died on me. I plugged it into the charging cord and tried turning it on. It turned on for a couple seconds and died again, turned it off for a minute, turned it on for two seconds then it died. This stupid thing won&#x27;t hold a charge to save a life. It&#x27;s a horrible waste of space and money and if I could give it negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a popular \\&quot;big box\\&quot; store, to replace a Remington shaver that I&#x27;d had for 5 years that finally literally fell to pieces in my hands. I figured since I&#x27;d had such a good experience with the brand, I could be as happy with a new version of the same product. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. This shaver is a piece of garbage. I can charge it for twelve hours and still the minute I start to use it, it&#x27;ll offer almost no motor power. The attachments are nothing spectacular, standard with shavers as far as I know. There are just no redeeming qualities about it. I spent more than I should have on it and didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d bought such a dud until way after the grace period that I had to return it.    Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. It is not a good product and I&#x27;m surprised at Remington.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works on this is the eyebrow trimmer attachment. Everything else does not work. The razor also tugs on your hair no matter how short it is. It does not hold a charge long either. No matter how long I charge it, it&#x27;ll last half way through a shave. I just use it for my eyebrows and have purchased another shaver from Panasonic. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and adore the ability to trim my hair to varying lengths, trim my eyebrows, and do quick touch-ups.  A friend of mine used it at our last spa night and enjoyed it so much that I&#x27;m here to buy one for her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Works great! Charged for the full day, and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since. The battery charge lasts for days. Love the different attachments, and the bag makes it handy to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted an upgrade from my previous version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;It has different heads that allow you to get different shaves. Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice bag to keep it all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is horrible. I fully charged it, used it once, and tried to use it again a couple days later and it was dead.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to cut/pinch yourself if you do not use the safety. However, for closer trimming you can&#x27;t use the safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product but that battery life is horrible. You have to fully charge it before you use it. So you have to plan ahead when you want to use it because if you dont the battery will be dead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use while pregnant and it has been a wonderful accessory to have!  No complaints!</li>
            <li> We have two of these. They work just fine for bikini area.  Rechargeable and comes with several attachments. I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years. No trouble.</li>
            <li> I have the same product from another manufacturer that has worked flawlessly for years and after seeing this product I thought what a nice upgrade. My previous eyebrow trimmer comb broke and upon seeing this I couldn&#x27;t wait until it arrived, however after receiving it I discovered there is no eyebrow comb. I would have never have bought this had I know. Next the razor that doesn&#x27;t work as my hair is too fine, my boyfriend tried it and it works for him, how nice. I am hoping there are no more disappointments but won&#x27;t hold my breath!</li>
            <li> This is more a review on the seller not the product because I never received the product. I contacted them and all they said is \\&quot;we are very sorry,\\&quot; and they did nothing more. I am now out the money and they will not help fix the situation. I would not recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> Too light could not use it</li>
            <li> Being such a cute little product, I really wanted to like this razor. Unfortunately it failed to cut hair even a quarter-inch in length even with the close shaving attachment and nicked horribly. I wasn&#x27;t too shocked about this considering how little I paid for it, but there are far better electric razors out there that are much safer and do a much better job.</li>
            <li> This thing trims well and relatively close, but even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;wet/dry,&amp;#34; the charger rusted and is now forever dead. Barely used this. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it was a complete waste of money! I was able to get it to charge fully once, and less than five minutes later when I went to use it the charge had already left and couldn&#x27;t even shave my armpit hair, which is finer and softer than my bikini area. I even demonstrated it to my husband attempting to shave it with and without attachments and it did nothing but emit a mild buzzing sound. I ended up taking it to the trash and throwing it away. This product deserves a zero star rating.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I bought the same trimmer. It was perfect and was exactly what I needed. Suddenly, it stopped working. I bought a second one and have had this one for about a year as well and it too has stopped working. It will not charge and there is a grainy substance in the spot where the cord gets plugged in- like what happens with batteries get really old. I haven&#x27;t abused it and can&#x27;t understand why it works fine one day and a week later its unusable. I think it&#x27;s time to move on to another brand...</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  It is perfect for those of us that get ingrowns from waxing and shaving.  It also is good for a lot of other uses also.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking that it was going to be strong and fast enough for the bikini line, but it wasn&#x27;t(it didn&#x27;t work anywhere actually), the blade just jumps and cuts my skin(and believe me, it&#x27;s not because my skin is damp or anything like that).&lt;br /&gt;Also I keep having to charge it, it keeps losing charge very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t last me more than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It was the worse purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also give it no stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Simple put... terrible. Mine does not charge well. Lower power and does not last long. Uneven cuts.</li>
            <li> so i saw this in walmart.. and i should\\&quot;ve read review before i bought it.. had it for 6mos or so and use this off and on...... umm i say off and on because i always end up with bumps and itching and hurting down there..... when i don&#x27;t use this i use the lil bikini shavers and have no problem or my reg razor no problem.. its just when i use this product.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;d be better off trying to trim your bikini line with a butter knife. Maybe a spoon.  Seriously, between the having to go over the same area a hundred times before it would trim, or the sound of the trimmer getting weak and strong and weak again, or the way the plastic is molded so that it can \\&quot;trap\\&quot; your hair (OWCH!) this was thrown in the trash the minute I got out of the shower...come on, Remington, you know better.</li>
            <li> This product works great!!! The product does everything it says. I won&#x27;t go into detail but this product has not failed to accomplish anything that has been tried!</li>
            <li> I had one these for years, purchased I believe at Walmart. They are no longer sold in the stores and so I was very happy to find it online. I need it for my chin and use baby shampoo lather. Other produces have left me irritated. Can be left right in the shower so it always available. Five stars from Me!</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months, and it&#x27;s already dead/broke. This is well shaped and works well, but after going through two that each lasted less than two years, I will find something else.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if you use this product wet or dry, on fine or coarse hair. It does nothing! Very disappointed! Waste of time and money. If it was possible to give no stars I would.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product. Out of the three heads to use, the razor, trimmer with attachments, and the eyebrow trimmer. The only good aspect was the eyebrow trimmer, however that was not what I bought it for, I bought it for the other two. The razor just flat out does not work. The trimmer, trims way too long even on the lowest setting of all the attachments and their settings, and when you take the attachments off it trims way to close, to the point that it is might as well be the razor. You can&#x27;t win with the trimmer. It is just a poorly designed product. It is a wet and dry product meaning you can use it in the shower or dry. I tried both and it does work in the shower, but it works only to the extent that I have already said. Fortunately, I bought it from target, and it came with a 30 day money back guarantee, so I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 months ago and i was disappointed right from the beginning. The razor was the real reason why i bought this product and it DOESN&#x27;T EVEN WORK!!!! the only thing that works is the eyebrow trimmer. Dont waste your time/money on this product.</li>
            <li> Ok I bought two of these shavers and both of them stopped working after the second use,don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. The first time I thought I broke it or over charged it or something thats why I bought another one, and it wasn&#x27;t me its the shaver it don&#x27;t right at all,I really want my money back for both of them.Now I have to buy some other shaver...its not going to be Remington WPG-2000 thats for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews it got. I would recommend this because it&#x27;s so easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out. I was surprised at how fast it shaves your bikini line. I mostly use the precision trimmer for the bikini area and it doesn&#x27;t give you any irritation so that&#x27;s a plus! The mini-shaver is great for your armpits. I wish Remington made a shaver that worked this great for your legs! I thought it had a separate attachment for your legs but it doesn&#x27;t. The travel bag I got was white not like the picture but its nice for traveling. I also love that this shaver keeps a charge that&#x27;s important! If you want something easy and no pain get this because it works!</li>
            <li> This product is useless. Most of the attachments don&#x27;t work on hair that is short and it does absolutely nothing to stubble. I didn&#x27;t have any hair that was long enough so my boyfriend tried to trim his beard a little with this thing. Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;He told me that it felt like the shaver was ripping off the ends of the hair and barely trimmed anything off. This is supposed to be used for the \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot;?! Glad I didn&#x27;t have the hair to test it. If that was what it was doing to his chin, I couldn&#x27;t imagine using this product to do any kind of bikini trimming.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for \\&quot;smooth and silky\\&quot;, this is item does not offer it.&lt;br /&gt;It deserves no stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to go with a micro trimmer or a beard trimmer(lol).</li>
            <li> I bought this product right before the summer knowing I had more to trim during the warmer months and didn&#x27;t feel like spending the money on buying a bunch of separate pieces. I&#x27;ve been really happy with the battery life. I use it maybe once every two weeks and I&#x27;ve only had to fully charge it twice since I bought it in April (doesn&#x27;t take long to charge either). I found that it cuts very well and very quickly. The attachments are very easy to take off and put on. It has a nice wide base which makes for a very sturdy grip so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping out of your hand ever. The little bag is also great for quick and easy storage/travel. The only cons would be that it is pretty noisy and the foil shaver doesn&#x27;t really do anything. I have to say though I have been very happy with this product. Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect wife/mother gift for anyone even children and husbands because women sometimes need a little pampering to make them feel go  od.</li>
            <li> I totally love this shaver, and so does my husband, who uses it on his back and chest.  Whatever kind of silver they use in it totally does prevent ingrown hairs.  I don&#x27;t know why it works, but it really does.</li>
            <li> i bought this product at walmart. the precision trimmer attatchment was painfull and did a better job at nicking my skin than it did at actually removing hair. the mini shaver attatchment was completely useless. i had a remington shaver years ago that was equally disappointing. i don&#x27;t think remmington put&#x27;s their products to the tests before they put them on the market.</li>
            <li> I found this and purchased it for around $60, but there&#x27;s nothing like it so I had to get it. I did notice the owner of this has now raised the price so I will not be repurchasing. Its honestly overpriced. The package was also open, it comes in a sealed plastic package and the bottom half of it was cut open so I don&#x27;t think it was new although it claimed to be. the first one i bought straight from the store and it lasted me 5 years, this is the second one ive owned and i am expecting it to last a while as well . works great, it does the job nice!</li>
            <li> Great little shaver.can be used in the shower too</li>
            <li> I had this (poorly made) razor for about 6 months and it completely stopped working about a month ago. First it would lose charge extremely quickly, this went on for about 2 months before it downright refused to turn on anymore. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this product. I shouldn&#x27;t have been being cheap and just bought a decent one. I&#x27;d give this no stars if I could.</li>
            <li> trims hair very low, doesn&#x27;t take long when trimming. best part you can use it in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping to shave less and it didn&#x27;t help at all. I was trying to avoid razor burn and cutting myself and this product has actually given me a few cuts and does not remove hair all that well. I would absolutely not recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li> This groomer is horrible.  I use it on my bikini area and if your hair is to short, none of the attachments work.  When not using any attaqchments, the razor cuts up my skin so bad.  Have tried in and out of the shower with same results.  Huge waste of money.  I will give it 1 star because it does work on arm hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not turn on anymore. I purchased it from a big box retailer and have only used it about a dozen times and it no longer charges. Also, like others have said it cuts your skin. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> I think this body and bikini kit is a very bad product. I only used it about 3 times, because it cuts my bikini skin every time. I tried to used it gently, but it is impossible, it always cuts my skin.</li>
            <li> I had the same razor in the past and loved it until it just quit. That&#x27;s why I ordered another one that was the same. This new razor makes noise when plugged in. I believe the cord is defective as it is fine when my old cord is used.</li>
            <li> This replaced an old Remington shaver that lasted 10 + years, so far so good!  Great battery life and great product hoping for another 10 out of this one</li>
            <li> I was able to use this once. It won&#x27;t recharge.  I need to try returning it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these now (neither from Amazon). Both had died about 9 months after purchase. Part of the problem is the part that gets the charge has corroded. I thought the first one was a fluke so I would try a second. I always had to start the machine then put the shaver head on. I will be looking for something different.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but does nick in the most tender of places. If used with any guards it does not provide a close enough trim. One must chose between closeness &amp; nicks.</li>
            <li> its cheap &amp; lasted less than a week pulled hair out instead of shaved it left rash AWFUL dont waste your money !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this before, and it lasts YEARS longer than any of the comparable products, including the overpriced Phillips brand of personal grooming tools. My only disappointment was the optional eyebrow trimmer was not included.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and I bought two because after the plug socket gets wet, the charger will not work. I want another one but I do not want to have to keep replacing it or rigging the charger everytime it needs to charge. Why is this one so much,  they are asking 3 times more than what I paid at the store!!</li>
            <li> Just save yourself the money and buy a men&#x27;s razor. This legitimately is useless. It really doesn&#x27;t seem to even work. I tried to even use it on my arm just to experiment and nothing came off. Really bad product.</li>
            <li> This item is really not what i expected it to do. I was really disappointed. Will not suggest this any one</li>
            <li> The trimming tools are great on this product, but it says in the instructions that it can be used for underarm hair. I tried using the mini shaver (not the brow or bikini trimmer) and it did not work for me very well. It could have been user error, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I was using it according to the directions included with the product. The Bikini trimmer worked very well though. I have yet to use the brow trimmer part (I&#x27;m nervous about messing those up!) I recommend this product specifically for the bikini trimmer part.</li>
            <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work properly! I had an old version that was really good. this one is not good quality.</li>
            <li> This product is great, the foil shaver is not that great, but that is not what I bought this for. The only complaint I have is that in the picture the mini eyebrow shaver, the cutting edge is at the top, mine is on the side, and I really think it would be more ideal if the razor was on the top. All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for FOREVER! I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and I&#x27;ve changed it less than 10 times (no lie). and the fact that you can use it in the shower is a plus too</li>
            <li> Surprising because it appears cheap when taking the shaver out of the box. Yet it trims quite well. It came charged and ready too go. The interface when changing the head is nice. That is what usually breaks and this looks rather sturdy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I had purchased this so long ago.  Three years!  It worked for a while but now it is dull or something, so hardly working at all.  It replaced an old Sunbeam that lasted a LONG time.  I will not buy this again.  Seems quite pricey too.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th one of these razors...many years now. This price is better than I usually get it for so I snatched it up even though my last one is still fine. The razors hold up well, stay sharp. Just be sure NOT to press the head to your skin as stated in the instructions for use. The razor blades eventually cut through the thinnish mesh head cover if you don&#x27;t heed the warning. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years and then it died. Took allot of shopping to find a new one. My one complaint was it didn&#x27;t come with the eyebrow trimmer that my old one did and its body was just a bit too large to attach the old trimmer attachment. Not to worry. A little whittling with my Xacto knife and I was able to get the old one to fit and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once before it died on me. It refused to charge after that. I could have used that $16 towards a wax, and that still would been less of a pain than this sorry excuse of a product.</li>
            <li> Expectations not met. Battery die fast. It does not function as described. The main heads of the groomer do not work at all. It is far from being a good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my share of electric razors/shavers (for women), usually from the big scary interwebs (with not being able to see it in person before buying it), and I must say this 7 in 1 razor by Remington is one of the best electric razors I&#x27;ve ever come across. While the battery gets old fast (my battery needs to get charged nearly after every use, and I only just purchased the razor 3 mos ago), and despite that the razor will (sometimes) get buggy, i.e. not turn on, and need to be smacked gently to get it working again, this razor is still totally worth every penny. And it comes with this fantastic mini/micro shaver head and boy, that baby really works! *yum*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, no complaints. If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that trims AND shaves, this little guy is just what you need.</li>
            <li> After charging for the recommended 16 hours, it won&#x27;t hold a charge. I also noticed, as did others, that it pulls the hair out instead of cutting it. There are better products out there. Probably at your local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Works great for face or bikini.  Because it charges, it does a clean shave wherever you need it.  Once it is charged it lasts a while so no need to keep it plugged in.  The only thing I would suggest it coming with is a little brush to wipe off the clippers after each use.  I just use an eyebrow brush when I need to and it works fine.</li>
            <li> does not work it did not cut the hair at all turned on fine just dont shave like it should. wAs a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace the one that I had had for years and loved, got the newer model and I like it, but it didn&#x27;t come with one of the key attachments that the older model had that i liked so much about it.  I still like it and prefer to use this over regular shaving in my bikini area because it still gets a close shave, but no razor burn or bumps.  Just wish it had one of the old attachments.</li>
            <li> I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the trimmer attachment. The previous generation of this product had a better one. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It is just like the old one and I am happy with the purchase...&lt;br /&gt;I think the old one the cord was bad or somethings..</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this trimmer.  It holds a charge really well (I&#x27;ve used it twice a week since I bought it a month ago and I have yet to need to recharge it).  Its efficient and is a great tool to use (even if the head is a bit small, its worth it for those detail areas).  And honestly.... its purple, can you ask for more?</li>
            <li> This piece of equipment is way too expensive for any price you pay here on Amazon.    After barely 5 months of use, the unit doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. But, never mind that. It boasts all sorts of connectors/cutters but only one of them really works, the rest were just pieces of plastic sitting in my drawer collecting dust. It lost charge very fast, until it finally just stopped charging altogether  Oh, and did I mention it pulls on your skin and hair? BADLY!</li>
            <li> Worked well, but after a short while one of the attachments won&#x27;t work.  Dissappointing!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I upgrade it to a panasonic cordless razor. No more cord to plug in and it has better power/speed. After using this old one for as long as I can remember, I think power is getting weaker now. My advice don&#x27;t waste your money on remington anymore, they are an outdated product to buy today. I wish stores would discontinue them today and never sell them again and stick to electric razors, I wish they sell more women&#x27;s electric razors now and throw out cord razors.</li>
            <li> Holds it&#x27;s charge a good long time, even when not used often. I bought this to replace the first one that I owned, that one lasted 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing this item, perhaps you should reconsider.  I bought this going against other reviews, but I must admit it was a mistake.  this product is cute and the pouch makes it a good purchase, but the contents does not.  I purchased this shaver last night and immediately opened it because I was excited to find a cute shaver with all of the different attachments.  I tried them all and the only attachment that worked satisfactorily was the trimmer.  The different comb guards are really bulky and you cannot get a precise cut, though they have different numbers.  It just doesn&#x27;t work out.  The mini shaver is just what it says a mini shaver that doesn&#x27;t mini{mal}.  I had no success with the shaver, big dissappointment and therefore, I am returning the product today.  As for the eyebrow, I did not try this, because I purchased this product because of the shaver, not to mention that it was $27 in the store.  If I were you, I would really reconsider.</li>
            <li> It worked great for almost a year, with medium to light use. But now no longer charges up. I would say do not plan on having too long, if the price makes that ok, then it does work well.</li>
            <li> really waste of money...blades dosent wrk at all..really bad</li>
            <li> tried it once, didn&#x27;t like it. if you like you hair all gone this is not for you!</li>
            <li> A great tool for when I need a quick shave, or don&#x27;t feel like using a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job....</li>
            <li> this was great until it broke.</li>
            <li> This is my second Remington shaver. I bought my last one about 8 years ago and when it gave out I knew exactly what I wanted to replace it with!</li>
            <li> This item is excellent it came with a nice purse to pack when traveling. It is easy to carry around and the performance is great u can shave your legs, arms etc.  it  can be purchase for a gift also. The battery is long lasting. I recommend it is a good buy</li>
            <li> this is a steal, and holds up nicely. I even used it to shave my boyfriends head and it held up nice did not get clogged or over heated. I have used lots and still havent had to charge,</li>
            <li> The only problem with this razor is the fact that the charger breaks easily. I like that you can use it in the shower. I actually think that it works better in the shower. Unfortunately they need to make the design better so that the charger doesn&#x27;t break easily. I think once it gets wet then that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased the Wahl counterpart, which is sleek and stainless-steel shiny, but has a crummy shaver attachment.  They do make great clippers, though.  The Wahl isn&#x27;t worth diddly for getting those shorter nose hairs that the nose-hair trimmer can&#x27;t get.  This little Remington-branded gem has a shaver head that actually works like a shaver should.  I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was great. The functions allow you to change to 3 different head sizes, I absolutely love it. Plus, it came with a nice carrying case and charger.</li>
            <li> I think everyone who gave this product 1 star explained it great. All I have to say is that it was a waste of money and I hope they discontinue this awful product and create something that ACTUALLY works.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review but I wanted to add my two cents since all the negative reviews were making me panic about buying this. I found this in a big box store and picked it up. I&#x27;ve never used a bikini trimmer before but I thought it was about time to do some maintenance. It worked pretty well as a trimmer. It thinned out and trimmed the hair nicely and I was not irritated, no nicks or anything using it with the comb. And so far I&#x27;ve had no problem with the battery dying or not charging. However the shaver attachment really doesn&#x27;t do much good, but if you&#x27;re going over the rest anyway with your own razor then the trimmer is fine.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased. The first latest about a year but for the price that&#x27;s fine. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this groomer for shaving. The only thing I use it for is around the bikini line and nothing else. The shaver never worked but like I said, for the price and what I use it for that is fine.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, would not  recomend</li>
            <li> I had not had an electric shaver in many years because they never seemed to work very well. This shaver works very well on fine hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do as good a job on coarse hair as I would like. It does shave the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the smooth feel on my legs that I would like.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the attachments shown in the first picture.  Was disappointed in that but what I did recurve works okay.</li>
            <li> Did not cut through hair very easily, takes forever to charge and the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough to shave anything. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I had the same exact razor but I accidentally broke the device.  I purchased this against the reviews because it was the same exact model.  This razor cuts me every time and does not charge properly.</li>
            <li> It was used... it smelled... somewhat clean.. but washed it several times due to the smell... now it seems to have greasy residue inside it... not worth the used buy IMO</li>
            <li> I keep buying this style but the comb piece always cracks. This is my third one. The plastic comb piece on this one is made better.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had enough with having to deal with uncomfortable, itchy bikini lines. This is a great product especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s never used an electric razor before. Love that you can use it with or without water. Easy to use and great results!</li>
            <li> After using the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020/31 BodyGroom]] to maintain my bikini area for years (yes, I&#x27;m female and the Bodygroom is advertised as a men&#x27;s product, but it&#x27;s been great for me), its battery finally died while I was traveling, so I picked up this Remington in a pinch. I cannot recommend it and wish I had just ordered a new Phillips. I have to use the trimmer before using the razor to get anything resembling a close shave. I&#x27;ve nicked myself several times. The smaller head just means, for me, that it takes longer to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give it two stars because it \\&quot;works,\\&quot; in the sense that it does, with some coaxing, trim hair... but not very closely and not very quickly and not very comfortably and with some nicking. I will be getting a new Bodygroom [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 BodyGroom Pro]] asap.</li>
            <li> gets to all those lady parts, water proof and battery holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for a mans goatee. They also make one that is good for nose trimming. Yes, they are made for a woman but strong enough for a MAN!</li>
            <li> I used this for years until it finally died. I looked around at other products and went back with what I know. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best electric shaver out there. But it&#x27;s good and not too big and not too small. I like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer a few months ago from another website.  This trimmer left me bleeding pretty bad.  It went on for about 1/2 hour where the blood just would not stop.  This was done in a very sensitive bikini area.  Be careful this trimmer will grab your skin and cut it as if you cut it with a razor blade.  It was awful and made me nervous when the blood wouldn&#x27;t stop.  What a way to go to the emergency room to get stitches and explain that one....how embarrassing that would have been if it didn&#x27;t stop and I ended up there bleeding.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this trimmer, wish I had read the reviews first before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> It works for what I need it to do. No problem with the ptoduct and its water proof too. :-)</li>
            <li> I used this razor maybe once or twice a month, during which time it worked as expected. I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to worry if it got wet. Unfortunately, the battery died in less than a year. Save your money and buy something better quality!</li>
            <li> I needed to replace one of the interchangeable heads. A lot of them did not come with one particular head that I needed. This one did and it was cheaper than in stores. Works wonderfully for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Remington personal groomer that I&#x27;d had for close to ten years (the rechargeable battery finally stopped taking a charge). This version seems to work just as well but didn&#x27;t come with as many attachments as the old version did. Other than the lack of those attachments I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times but so fr, so good. Battery has help up and I have used it a lot. Had a lot of catching up to do. Worked well the first time around. had to go over the same place a couple of times in stubborn areas but that was to be expected especially after nothing being done all winter. So I say for the money its an all around good product.</li>
            <li> Does everything I need it to do!</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve had many personal trimmers and this is my favorite. It holds a charge a long time and has a variety of heads to trim to varying lengths.The size is nice, too, not too bulky or big for delicate areas. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve lost the recharger, so I&#x27;m ordering another. Mine was a gift, and upon purchasing this one,&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m surprised how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years, it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving it a 4/5 is because the \\&quot;detailed\\&quot; trimmer is the only one that actually does the job... and therefore the only one i use.&lt;br /&gt;i love that it can be used in the shower and that it is rechargable and the battery lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Not so good, It was a gift for my gf, and the product doesn&#x27;t work as she expected to be,&lt;br /&gt;I think there are better products,</li>
            <li> I bought this probably over four years ago from another store for maybe a third of the asking price here. It literally just died; it lasted years. I would order it again if it wasn&#x27;t suddenly $35 over what I originally paid. It&#x27;s an amazing bikini trimmer IMO. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> You really get what you paid for with this product. It works, but its only decent, not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the instructions clearly say charge for 14-16 hours, and it WILL NOT work while plugged in. It&#x27;s only intended to use as a hand held NOT plugged in. So for those users who were having trouble because it dies or didn&#x27;t work while plugged in, that&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;After using the trimmer I found that although it does cut, I had to go over the same area multiple times to get an even shave. Sometimes it will pull a little at your hair, although nothing serious it does kind of hurt. The plastic comb attachment didn&#x27;t work very well because the actual comb is just too thick for the tiny, close to the body hairs that you are trying to trim/cut. So once again, I had to go over the same spot multiple times to get an effective shave. The close shaver that&#x27;s meant for harder to reach areas and sensitive parts, is almost entirely ineffective, it just doesn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;I will say however, that I love how the attachments are very simple to put on and off.  The detail trimmer is decent enough, it does cut and works good around the bikini line and the underarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a simple, clean product that is good for occasional use. Its not terrible but its not great.</li>
            <li> Worked well for trimming (didn&#x27;t use the shaver or eyebrow attachments) but then just died one day after only about 9 months.</li>
            <li> Love it. Only wish the regular razor head was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> No complaints with the trimmer&#x27;s performance but very disappointed that the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge or even work after less than a year. I used this maybe twice a month and only used in water a couple of times (the one I purchased was wet/dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not going to risk it again, too bad because like I stated before - It actually worked well while it did work.</li>
            <li> Terrible shaver for the bikini area.  Painful to use on sensitive areas...just holding any of the two trimmer attachments to my skin caused pain.  It drew blood every time.  Total junk, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I were you.</li>
            <li> The service was fantastic and the price was good. I found that this one doesn&#x27;t cut the hair nearly as close as the same brand that I use to have. Also sometimes the blades would pinch my skin and create a small cut which is not welcomed for the bikini area!</li>
            <li> This same trimmer set was at Sally&#x27;s for 17 dollars lol like what.. Also after less than six months it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge so it is useless to me now. (It will knick you up a bunch too)</li>
            <li> I bought this about 6 months ago. I got it through Wal-Mart and really should have looked at reviews before I did.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that could do armpits, legs and bikini.&lt;br /&gt;This does do great in the bikini area. The adjustable length guide is awesome. I&#x27;ve used this item dry and wet and have had no problems with it. I have not had it nick or catch my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;However the foil shaver head does not cut AT ALL. I have tried multiple times and the most it will do it get one or two hairs. I have had to use the Bikini head attachment to shave armpit areas. Even then it does not do a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;As for legs, I have seen the company tell some people it can be used for your legs and that is not true. It was not made to run for any substantial length of time. It also cannot give a close shave on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a bikini trimmer this is great. But for everything else it fails miserably.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use!!  Small and compact makes it easy to take along while traveling. Comes with the case too.  Would highley recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Mine just died last week and it was 2 years old.  It was used regularly and only quit accepting a charge to the battery after having been left in the shower for a few uses and the connection corroded... my own fault.  It&#x27;s not intended for shaving large areas like legs, but worked exceptionally well for shaping and trimming bikini area.  If you want a razor close shave, dont use an electric razor, it wont get as close.  I found this got as close as any other brand electric shaver I have used and was extremely reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing a different razor this time and hating it I am buying this one again!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a trooper. I have used it in the shower, at the sink. I&#x27;ve dropped it. It&#x27;s held on. Don&#x27;t store in the shower or corrosion will occur. Super happy with this purchase as for while I could only shave.</li>
            <li> It still works well when charged, but after a few months the charging port got bent somehow and it very hard to get the charger situated just right so that it will charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for touch-ups only, and I have been very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  I use it to shave my neck in between haircuts, to remove any missed spots in shaven areas, and any stray facial hair. I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with irritation. This trimmer is not to be used in lieu of a razor, so no one should expect it to do that extensive a job. I will buy another one when, and if, this one dies!</li>
            <li> Mine also stopped working after a couple of months. It&#x27;s like the battery stops recharging or something. Otherwise it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Less than 4 months since purchase and it is dead/not charging or working. I bought this to replace an earlier model that eventually did the same thing but that one lasted much longer. When I initially received, I noticed it was not the quality of the older version and wondered about returning it then; hind sight is 20/20! Now I am past the return policy days and looking for a replacement. Would not recommend purchasing this product</li>
            <li> This works for what I need it for.  It&#x27;s very user friendly and the battery lasts a long time.  Nice</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was right for the assortment of shavers included.&lt;br /&gt;Thought they would come in handy for something or other.  It turns out it is worthi it&#x27;s weight just for the main attachment with the foil screen.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I tried it on facial hair (e.g. chin) which has been a headache.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the way it worked.  My skin was as smooth as silk.  I have replaced the $300 NO!NO! I was using with lackluster results, with this.($18.00 for the WHOLE kit.  What a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;Just be advised... If you see what looks like black powder left on your skin, NOT TO WORRY.  Just wash off. It&#x27;s a chemical reaction with the nickel shaver head which may happen occasionally from some substance in your skin.  Small price to pay, if you&#x27;ve struggled with facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have not \\&quot;played\\&quot;with this too much, but it works for trimming hair very low. I have only tried the shield once and it didn&#x27;t reach the short hairs I was trying to trim. Worth the money and I use it alot. Will irritate and nick skin in sensitive areas if not very careful. Otherwise easy to use. I have gotten it wet, but not used it in the shower, and have no problems. For the little bit I use it, I&#x27;ve had it for months without having to charge it. Probably use once a week for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> when using the guard, you have to go over the same spot over and over to get a decent shave and even then it misses hairs.  Without the attachments, you will get nicks like crazy.  and it will not hold a charge for an entire shaving session unless you are only doing a touchup.  I have had this shaver for over a year and it has always pretty much sucked.  either get a razor or spend more money on a better shaver!</li>
            <li> I use this as a bikini trimmer and it works great. But at this price find something else. Remington no longer makes the product as they&#x27;ve improve on this model. The new one is only $25. This only cost me $20 when I first purchased it. $92 is a rip off!!! For that reason I give it one star.</li>
            <li> My second one just died. I like it however just like another reviewer it stops taking a charge - appears as though the charging area become corroded. I always keep it in the carrying case.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this mini shaver.  It is the perfect size for traveling, works great and has the attachments I like to use.  My husband also uses to trim his facial hair.  He likes it better than the men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome!... It&#x27;s feminine and easy to use!..  It protects your skin with the combs but even if you take the combs off for a closer cut, it&#x27;s still not aggressive like men shavers but still be careful.! Highly recommend for in between waxes.:-)</li>
            <li> i like this product because it gets really close to the skin compared to other razors reducing the frequency of shaving needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than I expected and gratefully deserved.  I am very pleased with the Body &amp; Bikini Remington.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.  Happy Birthday to ME !!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, Easy to change heads, and Easy to hold.  Instructions easy .....LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This shaver was terrible!  My boyfriend bought it for me for Valentine&#x27;s Day and the only attachment that worked was the trimmer.  The foil shaver didn&#x27;t remove hair, even after going over the same spot 10 times.  I tried it both wet and dry and was not at all satisfied with the product.  We&#x27;re taking it back today.</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I was expecting. It has given a few nicks and cuts. It does not give a close smooth trim.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the bad reviews for this product, I was worried that I had sunk $20 in a mistake. However, I bought this shaver over six months ago, and I have not had any problems. I only use it about once a month, maybe twice a month during the summer. I have only had to charge it twice. I try to wait until it&#x27;s almost dead before recharging it to preserve the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;The problems I have with the device are that it really irritates my skin. I have very sensitive skin and I get red bumps of irritation and sometimes ingrown hairs. However, I feel like that is a risk I run using a shaver, since they are notorious for being rough on skin. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s necessarily the fault of this particular shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it took me awhile to realize that you can pull apart the shaver heads to clean them. There isn&#x27;t anything in the directions about that so for a few months, I had trouble figuring out how to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver won&#x27;t get your skin as smooth as waxing, although using the mini-shaver attachment gets really close to the skin and will leave your skin feeling pretty smooth. But I mostly use it for keeping hair at a manageable and less noticeable length, so it works for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use the shaver in the shower if you have sensitive skin! I also use a little bit of shaving cream to cut down on irritation. It seems to work reasonably well.</li>
            <li> This thing cut me and made me bleed and when using wet or dry, it felt like it was shocking me!!!&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. TAKES FOREVER to use and needs more power.&lt;br /&gt;Buying a different product so it doesn&#x27;t take me forever.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to use. I would recommend to all my friends and already have to be honest</li>
            <li> This trimmer did not last long! Less than five uses and it died and stopped charging. A serious waste of money. Now to be fair, it was a great trimmer when it worked, but it died far too soon for the amount of money spent!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer at Target for a fraction of what they&#x27;re charging here, and I still paid too much! I haven&#x27;t had it for very long and it&#x27;s already dying on me.</li>
            <li> I have had great success with this product; I use it instead of paying $35/mo. for a bikini wax.  My husband is happy with it too, heehee.</li>
            <li> This Remington was purchased to replace and older but same model, I had the other one over 10 years before the battery wasn&#x27;t good and u can&#x27;t use it while on charger. It does what I need it to do I give it a 4 star because you can not use on AC. But worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before so maybe most people know that they &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really as close as a razor. This will work perfectly for trimming but I&#x27;ll still have to razor shave my legs. WHOMP WHOMP</li>
            <li> The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Does not work at ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the reviews before buying this rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;My advice, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Said it was good for the legs but did not work.. Have to go over and over in the bikini area. Do not like</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many nips from this thing it is not even funny.Im very well used to using a shaver;I bought this one to replace a Wahl which was going bad(used it for years and have never been nipped)it worked well except for the nips the after awhile it started making so much noise,(im sure my neighbors knows when I&#x27;m shaving)</li>
            <li> This is the only micro-foil shaver that has worked for me in comparison to everything else out there.  Yes, it is tricky.  When charging, you do NOT try to run it.  Can only be turned on, when it is NOT plugged in.  If it does not go on, remove the head, turn the motor on, then add the head back on.  Same goes for when changing to other heads.  Sometimes they don&#x27;t run- just run the motor alone, shut off, add the head back and it is good. It&#x27;s a very close, accurate, micro-foil women&#x27;s shaver, same for other grooming attachments.  You must charge this thing about 16 hours before first use.  Lots of reviews express disappointment, but once you get the hang of this thing, you will be pleased, and you will forget the others!  It is gentle, close, accurate, albeit a pain.  But your skin will thank you.  Years ago, I bought the first in this series of Lady&#x27;s Remington at Walmart for about $18!  It was excellent. Then it disappeared from the market. Now they only offer this thing for $59.  I have been through so many other lousy ones, and spent another $100 searching.  Now I am back to this and will make a go of it.  But Remington, please bring forth a less fussy product. We hardly have the patience for this!</li>
            <li> The blades are not able to catch enough and you are more likely to cut yourself on random bumps than get hairs out. Honestly better to use just about any other razor.</li>
            <li> I have had one for about three years, it is perfect to use in the shower. As with any electric trimmer/razor, you must pull the skin you are working on tight. Otherwise, it&#x27;s like trying to shave a cotton ball (good luck with that). I&#x27;ve been in the beauty industry since I was 16. I am a nurse now, however, I still do hair and make-up part time. I recently bought one of these for my daughter, she loves it, also. For trimming hair below the waist, make sure you go in the direction the hair grows for best results. I use this with, and without the guard. I use the foil head on my underarms in the shower, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for three years purchased it at Walmart for about 30 bucks and I absolutely loved it! I kept it in the shower so i think if i would have kept it in a dry place it would have lasted longer. it gave me a close shave so razor bumps, no ingrown hairs, just perfection. i may repurchase but i haven&#x27;t decided yet. i want to try something new if if it doesn&#x27;t work out i will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Works well for trimming bikini line and keeping things low-cut.  I&#x27;ve also used it for undearms when in a rush.  I&#x27;ve had it for years and it still works good.  I wish there was a way to tell when the battery was low.</li>
            <li> The trimmer without the comb works great for mowing down an overgrown forest in seconds, but only reduces it to a long stubble. The microfoil does absolutely nothing. I was hoping this would be a quick &amp; easy substitute for a razor in getting everything completely smooth down there, but unfortunately not.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to trim my fem area and it works pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t get quite as close and smooth as a similar one I had years ago, but it gets the job done and well enough. Battery lasts for 1-2 trims before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Target recently. I followed all directions including charging for 15 hours before initial use.  Once I turned it on, I noticed that the motor seemed weak as if it was about to conk out!  I couldn&#x27;t understand that considering how long I had charged it.  And, despite which trimmer head I used, the blades were soooo dull.  It could barely trim the delicate peach-fuzz on my face. What a piece of junk!  Back to the store for an immediate refund.</li>
            <li> This product works well if all you want is a trim. If you want a close shave, you&#x27;ll have to go behind it with a razor. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with nicks and cuts. As with any trimmer/shaver, you have to pull the skin tight to prevent that. It doesn&#x27;t pull and pinch so its a comfortable shave. But it won&#x27;t get you &amp;#34;smooth &amp; silky&amp;#34; by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and good quality as far as price concern the only thing is it can not remove the very small rooted hair perfectly otherwise works well for my eye brow .</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, and in her words, &amp;#34;It makes it really easy to shave all my tender areas.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really can&#x27;t ask for more from a shaving product.</li>
    </ol>
