            <li>but it does not work too effectively</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dermalogica Environmental Control Deodorant... 4 times , when traveling the will break very easy</li>
            <li>This is the BEST deodorant I have found - I have sensitive skin and have been using it for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a masculine scent in my opinion, but results are great!</li>
            <li>A very light lavender sent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use this product too, but the smell is more for men.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant it has lasted about 4-5 months</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I never thought that I would be able to find anything that worked that didn&#x27;t have aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.  </li>
            <li>I love it a lot</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I think it works much better than Toms.</li>
            <li>Looks good on the bathrm shelf, too.  ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a strong deodorant that is not harmful to your health.  </li>
            <li>Works for 8-10 hours, smells clean and masculine yet would smell great on a woman.</li>
            <li>It goes a great job of controlling your personal environment!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this deodorant so far - have been using it for three weeks or so, the scent is lovely and it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>not very effective, it does smell awesome when you apply it</li>
            <li>The scent is a very fresh clean lavender scent that has the power to hide body odor.</li>
            <li>I have tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this is BY FAR the best!!!  </li>
            <li>It smells good for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasing non-intrusive fragrance and when they call it Environmental Control that is exactly what it does for 12+hours easily.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It smelled amazing and didn&#x27;t irritate my under arms, but it didn&#x27;t work well enough to stop the sweat or the smell.</li>
            <li>I may be allergic to product but company was nice enough to work with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, I&#x27;m not convinced whether or not it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling fresh all day without the added aluminum</li>
            <li>but it is still better than the other aluminum free deodorants out there!</li>
            <li>I perspire and have hot flashes, but with this product I stay fresh.  </li>
            <li>I try not to use very much...</li>
            <li>AND, it&#x27;s safe to use unlike the other deodorants who are filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li>I must have tried over 30 natural deodorant that were aluminum free and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>But it was a hot summer so maybe for winter this would have worked, but I gave it away.</li>
            <li>I have used it too and it really works!</li>
            <li>Smells good, all natural, and holds up longer than expected.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend to anyone with the same type of skin allergy</li>
            <li>I was hoping this deoderant would be strong enough, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Great product last longer than the typical stick of deodorant.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any marks and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Trust me; I have been through 4 or 5 different aluminum free deodorants just this year.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth, especially, while skin is damp.</li>
            <li>Have tried more aluminum free deodorants than we can count, and all no good.</li>
            <li>It has a very natural and pleasing scent of mild herbs when first applied, then is totally scentless, so it won&#x27;t clash with your lotions or perfumes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Okay, how can I sound so enthusiastic about something as boring as deodorant?</li>
            <li>Long lasting, free of aluminum and smells great(for men or women, my girlfriend is now using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive underarms; most deodorants irritate my skin in only a few days.</li>
            <li>I have developed...</li>
            <li>It is not messy.</li>
            <li>My eleven year old daughter loves it, also.</li>
            <li>maybe natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I have been slowly replacing all my products to more natural ones.</li>
            <li>I have used deodorant with aluminum in it all my life and, now that I am aware of the potential hazzard, I try to eliminate every possible source of contamination.  </li>
            <li>Using it for years I can only highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t keep you non-stinky for a long day, but generally through the work day if you don&#x27;t sweat too much.</li>
            <li>The scent is masculine enough to convince the men to use it.  </li>
            <li>Since my mother, her mother, and 4 of her 7 siblings all developed Alzheimers disease I have tried to do everyting possible to eliminate potential contributing factors.  </li>
            <li>Apparently there is some scientific concern about a potential link between aluminum and Alzheimers disease.  </li>

            <li> Apparently there is some scientific concern about a potential link between aluminum and Alzheimers disease.  </li>
            <li> Due to a skin allergy I developed almost 10 years ago, this is the only deodorant I have found that does not cause a rash under my arm and actually controls order.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll continue to buy it until I make up my mind since it seems to be one of the few deodorants on the market that attempts to avoid dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> Applied every single day, a single 2.25 oz stick can last for over a year.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long while.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this deodorant was because every other deodorant on the market severely dried out my skin , this one doesn&#x27;t even come close to drying out skin.</li>
            <li> Took care of my underarm burn I got from other deodorants, but didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> But it is not, doesn&#x27;t last all day which was a huge disappointment considering the price.</li>
            <li> And even though it&#x27;s pricier than other brands, it lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit rough.</li>
            <li> I eventually found a product and stuck with it for years until my doctor inquired about my aluminum intake due my family history with Alzheimers disease.  </li>
            <li> I use this because other deodorants give me a rash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an aluminum-free deodorant that actually works!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in it....</li>
            <li> and since I live in the desert during the summer months I can start to sweat a lot and still not smell bad.</li>
            <li> I like it, maybe a little irritating to the skin on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put it through a tough (summer) test yet but do look forward to seeing if it works as well.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> My husband does not smell bad ever.</li>
            <li> It is not laden with awful chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has no aluminum, so I don&#x27;t worry about nasty chemical contaminants on my body.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This deodorant works excellent!  It smells good for the entire day.  Great for the office or a workout.  A very light lavender sent.</li>
            <li> 2 hours after shower I start to smell some armpit odor. Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  Smells good, all natural, and holds up longer than expected.  No rashes, no T-shirt stains.  Looks good on the bathrm shelf, too.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, yes-- but in my opinion, you get what you pay for.  Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Due to a skin allergy I developed almost 10 years ago, this is the only deodorant I have found that does not cause a rash under my arm and actually controls order. I love it and highly recommend to anyone with the same type of skin allergy I have developed...</li>
            <li> do not use if you travel I ordered this item&lt;br /&gt;Dermalogica Environmental Control Deodorant... 4 times , when traveling the will break very easy</li>
            <li> Nice deodorant. Doesn&#x27;t leave any marks and lasts the whole day. The smell is a bit rough.</li>
            <li> Works great for my husband, nice woodsy smell. No aluminum in it, which is why we bought it. Have tried more aluminum free deodorants than we can count, and all no good. I&#x27;d use this product too, but the smell is more for men. I don&#x27;t know if they make a woman scent or not, if so I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> The best! I am won over and a fan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deoderant within limits. It won&#x27;t keep you non-stinky for a long day, but generally through the work day if you don&#x27;t sweat too much.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant it has lasted about 4-5 months and it doesn&#x27;t irritate smells good. I just love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this is BY FAR the best!!!  I am so happy I gave it a try.  It smells great, gender neutral and it actually works!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, still had odor and did not protect. It also made me itch. I may be allergic to product but company was nice enough to work with me. Thank to the company</li>
            <li> As good as it&#x27;s always been</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive underarms; most deodorants irritate my skin in only a few days. This doesn&#x27;t - and it works. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot-even when I&#x27;m sitting still.  I struggled for years to find a quality anti-persperent or deterrent that worked for me. I eventually found a product and stuck with it for years until my doctor inquired about my aluminum intake due my family history with Alzheimers disease.  I must have tried over 30 natural deodorant that were aluminum free and nothing worked.  Either my BO was unbearable or I ruined shirts from excess sweating.  I never thought that I would be able to find anything that worked that didn&#x27;t have aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.  Dermalogica is the real deal.  Long lasting, free of aluminum and smells great(for men or women, my girlfriend is now using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a strong deodorant that is not harmful to your health.  The extra money you spend now is a bargain compared to using an inferior, aluminum based product that may cost your health and wellness in the future.</li>
            <li> Took care of my underarm burn I got from other deodorants, but didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have been slowly replacing all my products to more natural ones. This is the best aluminum free deodorant I have found to date. I still find myself having to reapply it two or three times a day but it is still better than the other aluminum free deodorants out there! Trust me; I have been through 4 or 5 different aluminum free deodorants just this year. The scent is a very fresh clean lavender scent that has the power to hide body odor. So if you just got out of the gym, have no worries after application.</li>
            <li> Works for 8-10 hours, smells clean and masculine yet would smell great on a woman. The main reason I purchased this deodorant was because every other deodorant on the market severely dried out my skin , this one doesn&#x27;t even come close to drying out skin. Great product last longer than the typical stick of deodorant. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Using it for years I can only highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an aluminum-free deodorant that actually works!  This one DOES work.  It&#x27;s more of a masculine scent in my opinion, but results are great!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Dermalogica&#x27;s facial products. I was hoping this deoderant would be strong enough, but it wasn&#x27;t. It smelled amazing and didn&#x27;t irritate my under arms, but it didn&#x27;t work well enough to stop the sweat or the smell. But it was a hot summer so maybe for winter this would have worked, but I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I use this deoderant as an alternative to deoderants containing aluminum.  I love it a lot and since I live in the desert during the summer months I can start to sweat a lot and still not smell bad.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My husband also loves it.  Apparently there is some scientific concern about a potential link between aluminum and Alzheimers disease.  Since my mother, her mother, and 4 of her 7 siblings all developed Alzheimers disease I have tried to do everyting possible to eliminate potential contributing factors.  I have used deodorant with aluminum in it all my life and, now that I am aware of the potential hazzard, I try to eliminate every possible source of contamination.  This deodorant works well and contains no aluminum.  I perspire and have hot flashes, but with this product I stay fresh.  It also works well for my husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this deodorant so far - have been using it for three weeks or so, the scent is lovely and it does what it says it will. I haven&#x27;t put it through a tough (summer) test yet but do look forward to seeing if it works as well.</li>
            <li> not very effective, it does smell awesome when you apply it but it does not work too effectively</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long while. It glides on smooth, especially, while skin is damp. It is not messy. My eleven year old daughter loves it, also.</li>
            <li> Best smelling deodorant EVER. AND, it&#x27;s safe to use unlike the other deodorants who are filled with chemicals. I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective and I was wrong. It works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Be good to your body and use this deodorant. It lasts forever too--almost for an entire year and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I like it, maybe a little irritating to the skin on my underarms. I try not to use very much... it works well. The smell is okay. Not sure what&#x27;s in it.... maybe natural ingredients, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s pricey, I&#x27;m not convinced whether or not it&#x27;s worth it but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll continue to buy it until I make up my mind since it seems to be one of the few deodorants on the market that attempts to avoid dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this deodorant.  I love it.  It keeps me smelling fresh all day without the added aluminum</li>
            <li> My husband keeps buying this. It is not laden with awful chemicals. My husband does not smell bad ever. I have used it too and it really works! I think it works much better than Toms.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  I walk 3-5 miles a day in Los Angeles and when I get home after a day in the sun- well - my pits don&#x27;t stink.  The scent is masculine enough to convince the men to use it.  One stick lasts about 4-5 weeks.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. If you can afford it - use it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST deodorant I have found - I have sensitive skin and have been using it for over 5 years now. It has a pleasing non-intrusive fragrance and when they call it Environmental Control that is exactly what it does for 12+hours easily. It goes a great job of controlling your personal environment! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was touted in the reviews as being exceptional.  But it is not, doesn&#x27;t last all day which was a huge disappointment considering the price.</li>
            <li> Okay, how can I sound so enthusiastic about something as boring as deodorant? Because this stuff is the bomb! I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and when applied after my shower up it keeps me smelling wonderful all day. No BO smell at all. It has a very natural and pleasing scent of mild herbs when first applied, then is totally scentless, so it won&#x27;t clash with your lotions or perfumes. It has no aluminum, so I don&#x27;t worry about nasty chemical contaminants on my body. And even though it&#x27;s pricier than other brands, it lasts a LONG time. Applied every single day, a single 2.25 oz stick can last for over a year. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I use this because other deodorants give me a rash. It smells clean and fresh and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The only product that he can use.  Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and works.</li>
    </ol>
