    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>One of the best CC creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have a light-medium complexion &amp; the Beige works perfectly for me</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a perfect match.</li>
            <li>but just gives a real nice glow.  </li>
            <li>Great great product.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and design itself is very nice but the foundation itself cakes soon after applying.</li>
            <li>I realize the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; look is very popular in Korea, so perhaps that explains why the colors offered are so fair.</li>
            <li>The tone is quite bright on your skin.</li>
            <li>I loved this CC cream.  </li>
            <li>It gives fairly light coverage, but was a perfect cc cream for the summer.  </li>
            <li>Heard some good reviews about this product even on youtube</li>
            <li>It good product, i did a mistake before.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, though not in love yet per se.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>the cushion is so light and great on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cushion gives a nice dewy glow.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>my skin has a tendency to get drier, so it gets kind of cakey.</li>
            <li>This mist cushion is nice but it doesn&#x27;t have the color that match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>nice as well</li>
            <li>It will Def give your face that watery glow so popular in k drama.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for my skin type because I have very super dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, nice and soft, great coverage to flaws and pores, great spf, will buy again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li>Hey, when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m not being pestered, so I am more than happy to buy this for her, especially when she is paying for it.</li>
            <li>Good product ang shipping not bad since it is from Koren.</li>
            <li>They are very light.</li>
            <li>However, it tones a fair skin to a very natural bright color (not shiny).</li>
            <li>All-day stay for most of my face-</li>
            <li>This cushion is also more saturated and contains more product than the Innisfree one.</li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>Wish it will come out with more color like AmorPacific.</li>
            <li>Love the cushion midst.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m glad I opted for it over the Vanilla as I&#x27;m sure that would have been too light for me.</li>
            <li>Great cushion, gives a very natural finish.  </li>
            <li>It probably won&#x27;t be so good for people who normally have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s easy, clean, and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>the color is so light..</li>
            <li>easy and comfortable to use, and looks very</li>
            <li>I definitely need more cover!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t assume that just because thsi cosmetic company caters predominately to the asian community (afterall, this line is not offered in USA), that the colors will cater to the light golden tan most asians have.</li>
            <li>And the color is very light as expected which is fine for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It protects from harmful skin rays and one looks fresh and not of lots of make up in hot temp area in summer</li>
            <li>It really moisturize my skin, dosn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, love it!</li>
            <li>downside is that it does sometimes leave hand prints if you touch your face since it&#x27;s pretty dewy.</li>
            <li>it is more sheer</li>
            <li>It looks so smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>A light dusting of finishing powder does help if you want a little more satin finish.</li>
            <li>I used the Innisfree long wear cushion and Hera is wayyyy better, no contest.  </li>
            <li>The finish is dewy and slightly tacky in warm weather  </li>
            <li>Also very portable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really wear this in the winter b/c</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t contain that much.</li>
            <li>Its more than I expected!</li>
            <li>well my forehead is just supernaturally oily.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra shipping  cost.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that Hera, under Amore&#x27;s parent Co. offers the option of natural or cover.</li>
            <li>looks naturally glowing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a nw25 in Mac and deauville  or light 4 in nars.</li>
            <li>This is my main go-to base makeup; it works beautifully for me.</li>
            <li>Wow, it totally does not feel like you have anything on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty pale Asian</li>
            <li>I suggest using loose powder with a duo fiber brush for natural finish or else</li>
            <li>so what I do is give it a thin layer onto my skin and wait for it to set like 5 mins then top it off with my loose powder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It protects from harmful skin rays and one looks fresh and not of lots of make up in hot temp area in summer you do not look over made and like your face will melt along with regular make up</li>
            <li> Great cushion, gives a very natural finish.  Not exactly matte or wet but just gives a real nice glow.  All-day stay for most of my face- well my forehead is just supernaturally oily.  I used the Innisfree long wear cushion and Hera is wayyyy better, no contest.  This cushion is also more saturated and contains more product than the Innisfree one.</li>
            <li> One of the best CC creams I have ever used. The sponge that comes with it, you have to wash it regularly as it absorbs CC cream and starts to have oily residue that builds up.</li>
            <li> So suprised!!!!!! the cushion is so light and great on my skin. Its more than I expected! Will come again.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s easy, clean, and quick to apply. It&#x27;s also good for my skin type because I have very super dehydrated skin. This cushion gives a nice dewy glow.&lt;br /&gt; It probably won&#x27;t be so good for people who normally have oily skin. And the color is very light as expected which is fine for my skin tone. I&#x27;m a pretty pale Asian girl.&lt;br /&gt;One downside is that it does sometimes leave hand prints if you touch your face since it&#x27;s pretty dewy. But I still love it. Also very portable.</li>
            <li> It really moisturize my skin, dosn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, love it! the only bad thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t last long for a price like this, hope it could last longer. It does comes with a spare filling.</li>
            <li> I loved this CC cream.  It gives fairly light coverage, but was a perfect cc cream for the summer.  I can&#x27;t really wear this in the winter b/c my skin has a tendency to get drier, so it gets kind of cakey.</li>
            <li> Heard some good reviews about this product even on youtube so I thought it would become a replacement foundation because it&#x27;s so convenient to apply. The packaging and design itself is very nice but the foundation itself cakes soon after applying. It has a strong lemony makeup smell that is somewhat unpleasant. I might just use this as a back-up foundation and stick to my usual foundation I apply with a brush.</li>
            <li> It good product, i did a mistake before. ignored the review i written before.</li>
            <li> This mist cushion is nice but it doesn&#x27;t have the color that match my skin tone.Wish it will come out with more color like AmorPacific. The finish is semi-matt on my skin. Coverage is medium and it does cakes when I build up. My skin tone is around NC30-35 so what I do is give it a thin layer onto my skin and wait for it to set like 5 mins then top it off with my loose powder. I suggest using loose powder with a duo fiber brush for natural finish or else it will be cakey</li>
            <li> This is a great product, though not in love yet per se. I have tried the (new, at least to the USA) Amore Pacific Skin Cushion, &amp; it is more sheer then this one. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s probably the difference between the (N)atural &amp; the (C)over. I like the fact that Hera, under Amore&#x27;s parent Co. offers the option of natural or cover. I definitely need more cover! I have a light-medium complexion &amp; the Beige works perfectly for me &amp; I&#x27;m glad I opted for it over the Vanilla as I&#x27;m sure that would have been too light for me. I realize the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; look is very popular in Korea, so perhaps that explains why the colors offered are so fair. Don&#x27;t assume that just because thsi cosmetic company caters predominately to the asian community (afterall, this line is not offered in USA), that the colors will cater to the light golden tan most asians have. They are very light.</li>
            <li> easy and comfortable to use, and looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;I should have bought refill one together because it is a little.</li>
            <li> Soso... Not impressed.. N the color is so light..</li>
            <li> Great great product.  Love it! looks naturally glowing. I hope it could last longer than two months but it doesn&#x27;t contain that much. Bought one for my mom too.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The tone is quite bright on your skin. However, it tones a fair skin to a very natural bright color (not shiny). The only downside is that it takes quite awhile to receive the product (about one month).</li>
            <li> She asks me to buy her this stuff a few times a year. Hey, when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m not being pestered, so I am more than happy to buy this for her, especially when she is paying for it.</li>
            <li> Good product ang shipping not bad since it is from Koren.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Korea when visiting family. I can&#x27;t use U.S. base makeup for some reason, I always get skin irritations or breakout (maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m Asian, who knows). This is my main go-to base makeup; it works beautifully for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, nice and soft, great coverage to flaws and pores, great spf, will buy again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell nice as well</li>
            <li> The color is spot on. I ordered c23 and it&#x27;s a perfect match. I&#x27;m usually a nw25 in Mac and deauville  or light 4 in nars. The finish is dewy and slightly tacky in warm weather  (summer in texas) some transfer but not much.  It will Def give your face that watery glow so popular in k drama. A light dusting of finishing powder does help if you want a little more satin finish.</li>
            <li> Love the cushion midst.  It&#x27;s so hard to find do the right color in the states.  I&#x27;m thankful for this option! Definitely worth the extra shipping  cost.</li>
            <li> Wow, it totally does not feel like you have anything on! It looks so smooth and natural. It&#x27;s been a month, and I did not break out from it. Love it!</li>
