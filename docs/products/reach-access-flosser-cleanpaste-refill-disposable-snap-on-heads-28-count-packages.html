            <li>I love Reach Access Flosser; the quality of floss string is absolutely the best, and you will not want to use another flosser product again.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it was old product since Listerine has now purchased the company, but this is a product that doesn&#x27;t have a shelf life and the price was great!</li>
            <li>Makes flossing so easy!</li>
            <li>fast and just what I ordered and a good price, too!</li>
            <li>Good price, quick delivery, product as advertised.</li>
            <li>so you are sure to cover the roundness of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love the Reach Access Flosser.  </li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Yes, this costs more than using a tradition roll of floss, but the cost is nothing compared to the effectiveness and ease of use.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I love these flossers.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine finding these at a better price anywhere.  </li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>These are my husbands favorite flossers so you can imagine his heartbreak when he went to buy refills and we can no longer find them anywhere around our house.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for him, I guess not realizing how many were coming (even though the amount was listed.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to order more.</li>
            <li>we use this type of product all the time and have for many many years.</li>
            <li>Still favorite floss out there...</li>
            <li>I use them daily and the Internet is the best place to get them.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>But some type of flossing is better than not flossing at all.</li>
            <li>Love the Reach flosser..</li>
            <li>Makes flossing almost enjoyable...</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>I love these flossers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>/&gt;These refills cost way more than a container of string.  </li>
            <li>flossing enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product and it has along with the Philips Sonicare tooth brush given me years of great dental care.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Reach&#x27;s Snap-n Heads floss is the one type of floss I find quick, easy, and effective.</li>
            <li>but with this thing, flossing is easy.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They make flossing really easy.</li>
            <li>They are OEM and do not break easily.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and so portable.</li>
            <li>The flosser refill is convenient and easy to snap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the difference of flossing now and then to easily every day.</li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly.  </li>
            <li>In comes the Access flosser, and now it&#x27;s easy to get to every side of every tooth, including the 4 wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Reach Access flosser is easy to use and that means that I now floss every day.</li>
            <li>You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for those who aren&#x27;t as good at this important habit.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!  :)</li>
            <li>The prices are what is available here on amazon five minutes before i wrote this review, so they may fluctuate.</li>
            <li>These timed refills on items that the drugstores do not stock is a fantastic idea.</li>
            <li>This event will cause you to fuss around in order to free it.</li>
            <li>They are a far superior way to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excited to have a 6 month supply.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;d be more likely to not floss</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to sit in the chair while they scrape my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>These types of flossers are designed to clean between the teeth.</li>
            <li>but what good is regular floss sitting alone and unloved in a drawer?</li>
            <li>True story: With the Reach Access flosser</li>
            <li>I just wish that sometimes you didn&#x27;t run on to a set of 4 or 5 that break so quickly.</li>
            <li>the local stores stopped stocking them, so glad to able to get them from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Loved these ever since I first tried them from the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>If only it was easier to consistently find a good price on them.</li>
            <li>I have used these for a few years with good results, because they are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great product, had trouble finding this anywhere else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are minty fresh as well which is a bonus but not a deal</li>
            <li>Nice to have multiple flavors to choose from also.</li>
            <li>These cleanpaste refills have the added bonus of slowly releasing the cleanpaste paste, and in my opinion they taste brilliant.</li>
            <li>If you use the Reach Flosser you know that you need to put in a supply of these, so buying in quantity is the right thing to do.  </li>
            <li>The had Speedy delivery and the price is right.</li>
            <li>This is the only flossing system that I have ever been able to use - I just can&#x27;t seem to manage regular floss effectively.</li>
            <li>But, I actually use them daily and my oral hygeine has been greatly enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For many years, I avoided flossing because there is very little room between many of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would/will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>as part of my &#x27;thanks for coming in to get your teeth cleaned!&#x27;</li>
            <li>Love these for my Reach Flosser as now I actually floss.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what the package  says.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll have enough for many months.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better value- qty for the low price.</li>
            <li>Perfect head for the Reach Access Flossers--the easiest way to reach all those difficult areas in my mouth.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well, but they do tend to break sometimes while flossing.  </li>
            <li>Nice item have been using them for three or four years and really like the convenience and ease of use compared to loose floss.</li>
            <li>At my last dental exam, the hygienist seemed to think these flossers don&#x27;t do as good a job as regular floss because they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; around the tooth, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>The first snap-on worked well enough, but the floss itself began to fray very quickly.</li>
            <li>Because of this nifty tool, I now floss with every brushing and it&#x27;s made a positive difference.</li>
            <li>hard to find in stores, so glad i was able to find it online and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this large supply from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you find it much easier to use these than normal floss, it may be worth the cost, but if not, it won&#x27;t make any economic sense at all.</li>
            <li>I wrote to ask for a replacement or credit as several broke one the very first use!</li>
            <li>I actually floss now and it has made a huge difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li>My hands hurt too much.</li>
            <li>is so much easier than flossing with the string alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beware putting too much pressure on inserting the floss between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Push gently.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much for flossing, but after buying these, I&#x27;ve been doing it almost every day.</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>These are just as I had hoped, it is much easier to order from Amazon than to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much else to say than that! :)</li>
            <li>I love these flossers and think they do a much better job at getting all those hard to reach areas than regular floss does.</li>
            <li>For teeth tightly aligned the Access Flosser is the best, because you can use your upper or lower jaw to bite down gently and help the floss move into place.</li>
            <li>Love this over typical flossing.  </li>
            <li>I have the older model battery operated handle and these are the flavor and strength of floss that makes it work so well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend AMAZON&#x27;s periodic refill orders.</li>
            <li>I really like the Reach Access Flosser, it is more expensive than floss alone, but it is convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These are, hands-down (pun intended) the best flossing product for painful hands I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>This is a dread to use compared to normal floss dispensers.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing he will use and it isn&#x27;t always easy to find, especially now since we have been stationed in England.</li>
            <li>I just grab a new one each morning and floss each time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The flosser suggests using a new refill every day.</li>
            <li>I put in a new snap-on and it did not work at all.</li>
            <li>Some of my teeth are very close together, and i can&#x27;t use a side-to-side motion to get the flosser between them because the whole length of floss is only one inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so easy to get to every tooth and stays securely fastened even for the teeth that are tight to each other.  </li>
            <li>it was almost as if they were very old or brittle.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised -- the same product you buy in stores.  </li>
            <li>Strong and firm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using these nice little snap-on flossers is the only way I&#x27;ll actually floss.</li>
            <li>This style of flossing is far and away the easiest way to floss.  </li>
            <li>They are more expensive than regular floss, but I actually use them which makes them a better bargain than the spool of floss that would sit unused in my cabinet for years.</li>
            <li>I would still like a response, but can no longer comment directly to them..</li>
            <li>we use this product instead of the old fashioned string floss.  </li>
            <li>my family no longer hesitates to floss, this is so much easier and faster that they actually use it every time before they brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li>The Reach flosser definitely makes flossing much easier than sticking you fingers into your mouth.</li>
            <li>much easier than regular floss</li>
            <li>With this purchase it is much easier to floss those teeth at the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They may be more expensive than the string, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this deal due to the fact that it came with 6 months worth of refills.</li>
            <li>When you can&#x27;t find locally, I recommend this site highly.</li>
            <li>I am a bit concerned about how food might get transferred from one tooth to the other because of how short the string is, but I haven&#x27;t had a huge problem with that; will have to ask my dentist next time I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li>Nothing is going to make flossing fun for me, but it&#x27;s less of a chore now.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is their relatively high price for such a simple device!</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier and less of a hassle to floss</li>
            <li>Happy to find the blue &amp;#34;clean paste&amp;#34; refills on Amazon (spearmint is icky and plain is, well, plain) as none of my local stores carry them anymore.  </li>

            <li> I ordered these for him, I guess not realizing how many were coming (even though the amount was listed.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to order more.</li>
            <li> we use this type of product all the time and have for many many years.</li>
            <li> Still favorite floss out there...</li>
            <li> I use them daily and the Internet is the best place to get them.</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> But some type of flossing is better than not flossing at all.</li>
            <li> Love the Reach flosser..</li>
            <li> Makes flossing almost enjoyable...</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> /&gt;These refills cost way more than a container of string.  </li>
            <li> flossing enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product and it has along with the Philips Sonicare tooth brush given me years of great dental care.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Reach&#x27;s Snap-n Heads floss is the one type of floss I find quick, easy, and effective.</li>
            <li> but with this thing, flossing is easy.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They make flossing really easy.</li>
            <li> They are OEM and do not break easily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use and so portable.</li>
            <li> The flosser refill is convenient and easy to snap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the difference of flossing now and then to easily every day.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly.  </li>
            <li> In comes the Access flosser, and now it&#x27;s easy to get to every side of every tooth, including the 4 wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Reach Access flosser is easy to use and that means that I now floss every day.</li>
            <li> You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product for those who aren&#x27;t as good at this important habit.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!  :)</li>
            <li> The prices are what is available here on amazon five minutes before i wrote this review, so they may fluctuate.</li>
            <li> These timed refills on items that the drugstores do not stock is a fantastic idea.</li>
            <li> This event will cause you to fuss around in order to free it.</li>
            <li> They are a far superior way to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excited to have a 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;d be more likely to not floss</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to sit in the chair while they scrape my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> These types of flossers are designed to clean between the teeth.</li>
            <li> but what good is regular floss sitting alone and unloved in a drawer?</li>
            <li> True story: With the Reach Access flosser</li>
            <li> I just wish that sometimes you didn&#x27;t run on to a set of 4 or 5 that break so quickly.</li>
            <li> the local stores stopped stocking them, so glad to able to get them from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Loved these ever since I first tried them from the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> If only it was easier to consistently find a good price on them.</li>
            <li> I have used these for a few years with good results, because they are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Great product, had trouble finding this anywhere else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are minty fresh as well which is a bonus but not a deal</li>
            <li> Nice to have multiple flavors to choose from also.</li>
            <li> These cleanpaste refills have the added bonus of slowly releasing the cleanpaste paste, and in my opinion they taste brilliant.</li>
            <li> If you use the Reach Flosser you know that you need to put in a supply of these, so buying in quantity is the right thing to do.  </li>
            <li> The had Speedy delivery and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This is the only flossing system that I have ever been able to use - I just can&#x27;t seem to manage regular floss effectively.</li>
            <li> But, I actually use them daily and my oral hygeine has been greatly enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For many years, I avoided flossing because there is very little room between many of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would/will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> as part of my &#x27;thanks for coming in to get your teeth cleaned!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love these for my Reach Flosser as now I actually floss.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what the package  says.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have enough for many months.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better value- qty for the low price.</li>
            <li> Perfect head for the Reach Access Flossers--the easiest way to reach all those difficult areas in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well, but they do tend to break sometimes while flossing.  </li>
            <li> Nice item have been using them for three or four years and really like the convenience and ease of use compared to loose floss.</li>
            <li> At my last dental exam, the hygienist seemed to think these flossers don&#x27;t do as good a job as regular floss because they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; around the tooth, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> The first snap-on worked well enough, but the floss itself began to fray very quickly.</li>
            <li> Because of this nifty tool, I now floss with every brushing and it&#x27;s made a positive difference.</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores, so glad i was able to find it online and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this large supply from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you find it much easier to use these than normal floss, it may be worth the cost, but if not, it won&#x27;t make any economic sense at all.</li>
            <li> I wrote to ask for a replacement or credit as several broke one the very first use!</li>
            <li> I actually floss now and it has made a huge difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li> My hands hurt too much.</li>
            <li> is so much easier than flossing with the string alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware putting too much pressure on inserting the floss between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Push gently.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much for flossing, but after buying these, I&#x27;ve been doing it almost every day.</li>
            <li> They work really well.</li>
            <li> These are just as I had hoped, it is much easier to order from Amazon than to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say than that! :)</li>
            <li> I love these flossers and think they do a much better job at getting all those hard to reach areas than regular floss does.</li>
            <li> For teeth tightly aligned the Access Flosser is the best, because you can use your upper or lower jaw to bite down gently and help the floss move into place.</li>
            <li> Love this over typical flossing.  </li>
            <li> I have the older model battery operated handle and these are the flavor and strength of floss that makes it work so well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend AMAZON&#x27;s periodic refill orders.</li>
            <li> I really like the Reach Access Flosser, it is more expensive than floss alone, but it is convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> These are, hands-down (pun intended) the best flossing product for painful hands I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> This is a dread to use compared to normal floss dispensers.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing he will use and it isn&#x27;t always easy to find, especially now since we have been stationed in England.</li>
            <li> I just grab a new one each morning and floss each time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The flosser suggests using a new refill every day.</li>
            <li> I put in a new snap-on and it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Some of my teeth are very close together, and i can&#x27;t use a side-to-side motion to get the flosser between them because the whole length of floss is only one inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so easy to get to every tooth and stays securely fastened even for the teeth that are tight to each other.  </li>
            <li> it was almost as if they were very old or brittle.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised -- the same product you buy in stores.  </li>
            <li> Strong and firm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using these nice little snap-on flossers is the only way I&#x27;ll actually floss.</li>
            <li> This style of flossing is far and away the easiest way to floss.  </li>
            <li> They are more expensive than regular floss, but I actually use them which makes them a better bargain than the spool of floss that would sit unused in my cabinet for years.</li>
            <li> I would still like a response, but can no longer comment directly to them..</li>
            <li> we use this product instead of the old fashioned string floss.  </li>
            <li> my family no longer hesitates to floss, this is so much easier and faster that they actually use it every time before they brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li> The Reach flosser definitely makes flossing much easier than sticking you fingers into your mouth.</li>
            <li> much easier than regular floss</li>
            <li> With this purchase it is much easier to floss those teeth at the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They may be more expensive than the string, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deal due to the fact that it came with 6 months worth of refills.</li>
            <li> When you can&#x27;t find locally, I recommend this site highly.</li>
            <li> I am a bit concerned about how food might get transferred from one tooth to the other because of how short the string is, but I haven&#x27;t had a huge problem with that; will have to ask my dentist next time I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> Nothing is going to make flossing fun for me, but it&#x27;s less of a chore now.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is their relatively high price for such a simple device!</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier and less of a hassle to floss</li>
            <li> Happy to find the blue &amp;#34;clean paste&amp;#34; refills on Amazon (spearmint is icky and plain is, well, plain) as none of my local stores carry them anymore.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with them is that they are pretty expensive, but it is worth it to me to not have to deal with a less convenient flossing process.</li>
            <li> They last about a week or 2 before you have to replace it so the 28 count will go a long way</li>
            <li> Because of the design of the product, the floss stay tight and tense, making it easy to remove and food or build-up between your teeth.</li>
            <li> , so you can decide if it&#x27;s worth the money to save a few minutes of having your fingertips tingle from the floss pulling too tight.</li>
            <li> It tends to thin out quickly and break off.</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty finding these replacement pieces lately, so this is a real blessing.  </li>
            <li> This is a good alternative to string floss if you hate flossing and find yourself skipping it.</li>
            <li> also, using the reach flossers allows me to access the spaces between teeth all they way in the back alot easier than using any other product.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep selling these, I&#x27;ll keep buying them!</li>
            <li> I use the Reach Access Flosser, but somehow these are a little bigger, and a bit less convenient to use, than the regular &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; variety.</li>
            <li> the spaces between my teeth are very tight, &amp; these make flossing alot easier &amp; safer than using the other, larger flossers on the market that are not taut enough to get between my teeth &amp;</li>
            <li> was not flossing regularly with conventional string floss due to the difficulty of getting my fat fingers to all the areas of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> They are heavy duty enough to extract in tight gaps and go on to the next gap.</li>
            <li> I worked under the assumption that the average person uses about half a yard of floss per flossing, and only flosses once per day.</li>
            <li> I used to hate flossing, but this product makes it very easy to floss</li>
            <li> that to floss using any other product.</li>
            <li> I use the reach flosser due the inability to reach inside my mouth from arthritis.  </li>
            <li> I tried a knockoff solely due to these just not being at the stores, and they were horrid.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money and now a waste of my time since this is my second attempt to get a resolve from the seller .I will continue to order things thru amazon</li>
            <li> you have any difficulty in reaching areas with conventional floss, give them a try.  </li>
            <li> Regular floss just sat in the drawer because it was hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I have used reach access dental flossers before, in fact they are all that I will use because they get the hard to reach places in the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The refills are hard to find in my area, so the price and convenience of buying them here was terrific.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and these make sure I get it done...</li>
            <li> With this product, you can hold the handle in a way that you can use your jaw to properly floss - up and down at least 10 times on each side of each tooth.</li>
            <li> I then hunted them down here and bought 8 packs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get any leverage with the thin plastic handle, so you have to practically hold it by the head, which means you&#x27;ve got your hands in your mouth just like you would flossing normally.</li>
            <li> A little pricey.</li>
            <li> they were a little cheaper...</li>
            <li> These little flossers are quite a bit more expensive than just using standard dental floss, but I REALLY hate flossing.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years now, and they make flossing a breeze if you have trouble sticking your hands in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> it is what i wanted and needed..use them everyday</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use these every day and before this flosser, I had trouble getting myself to floss even once a week.</li>
            <li> and I do it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have never experienced breakage such as this.</li>
            <li> Husband uses these everyday.</li>
            <li> and these flossers can get \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in the gaps if they are narrow.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed, because these refills are virtually impossible for me to find in stores here.  </li>
            <li> You can slowly rotate around a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it actually slightly harder to floss with, except that i don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m cutting the tips of my fingers off by wrapping the loose floss around it.</li>
            <li> Also, reaching to floss between back teeth with your fingers can be difficult, and even impossible, especially for someone like me who has never had to have their wisdom teeth</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in my town</li>
            <li> Likes them, it&#x27;s hard to find them in the stores, they&#x27;re always out of them.</li>
            <li> Now that I use Reach Access, I floss at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> Position the flosser handle on the biting surface of the oposite jaws teeth, and slowly bite the floss into place.</li>
            <li> to extract the flosser from between the teeth, slowly use a \\&quot;seesaw\\&quot; motion away from you gums.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you&#x27;re not 20 anymore</li>
            <li> My mouth is small and using traditional floss is difficult and awkward.</li>
            <li> and you just can&#x27;t pretend you don&#x27;t know that plaque is bad for your teeth and your overall health.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Over the past few months (perhaps a packaging change), they&#x27;ve been impossible to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> I wrote amazon and the seller regarding this product being really poor in quality-</li>
            <li> I found the DenTek  flosser refill part remaining behind, stuck in the gap.</li>
            <li> I feel QUITE guilty using all this plastic.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I order these things all of the time.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely cynical money making scheme.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad for the planet.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly as advertised -- the same product you buy in stores.  This style of flossing is far and away the easiest way to floss.  I just grab a new one each morning and floss each time I brush my teeth.  And my dental checkups confirm that I&#x27;ve been doing well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these flossing heads literally for years.  They are more expensive than regular floss, but I actually use them which makes them a better bargain than the spool of floss that would sit unused in my cabinet for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of flossers for people with arthritis and nothing beats this. I WANT to use the ones you load with thread and reuse - but I can&#x27;t manage them. My hands hurt too much. AND they don&#x27;t allow you to properly floss.  With this product, you can hold the handle in a way that you can use your jaw to properly floss - up and down at least 10 times on each side of each tooth. (Only floss the teeth you want to keep!) You can slowly rotate around a little so you are sure to cover the roundness of your teeth.  I feel QUITE guilty using all this plastic. It&#x27;s bad for the planet. So I use them with guilt and do use regular floss several times a week. But truth be told, my hands hurt. These are, hands-down (pun intended) the best flossing product for painful hands I have ever seen. And I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of them.</li>
            <li> Great flavor! Love these, best design EVER for flossing your pearlies.</li>
            <li> Great to floss with fits on my Reach flosser handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years now, and they make flossing a breeze if you have trouble sticking your hands in your mouth.  Over the past few months (perhaps a packaging change), they&#x27;ve been impossible to find in the store.  Excited to have a 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> These things are WONDERFUL !  I wish I&#x27;d learned of them years ago.</li>
            <li> I love the Reach Access Flosser.  For many years, I avoided flossing because there is very little room between many of my teeth.  Floss would break, leaving a piece stuck in my teeth.  My fingers would get cuts from flossing.  Now that I use Reach Access, I floss at least once a day.  My dentist is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Regular floss just sat in the drawer because it was hard to use.  I actually floss now and it has made a huge difference in my oral health.  Yes it is more expensive than the alternative but what good is regular floss sitting alone and unloved in a drawer?</li>
            <li> This is a good alternative to string floss if you hate flossing and find yourself skipping it.</li>
            <li> I bought these like it was the end of the world b/c they dont sell these at Walmart.  I love them b/c I like to floss while at my computer.  Heheh</li>
            <li> The Reach Access flosser is the best and easiest way to floss. To be honest, I&#x27;d be more likely to not floss that to floss using any other product. Yes, this costs more than using a tradition roll of floss, but the cost is nothing compared to the effectiveness and ease of use. Because of the design of the product, the floss stay tight and tense, making it easy to remove and food or build-up between your teeth. Also, reaching to floss between back teeth with your fingers can be difficult, and even impossible, especially for someone like me who has never had to have their wisdom teeth removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a product I swear by, and my dentist has definitely noticed.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest invention for flossing between teeth.  I used to struggle trying to floss but with this thing, flossing is easy.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Terrific convenience.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers.  They are so easy to use.  My only problem with them is that they are pretty expensive, but it is worth it to me to not have to deal with a less convenient flossing process.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine finding these at a better price anywhere.  I use the Reach Flosser because it&#x27;s the only one I can get in and out from between my teeth.  If you use the Reach Flosser you know that you need to put in a supply of these, so buying in quantity is the right thing to do.  This is my second order.</li>
            <li> Great flosser product.  Lots of options on the market but this is my favorite.  I would/will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> These are my husbands favorite flossers so you can imagine his heartbreak when he went to buy refills and we can no longer find them anywhere around our house. So of course checking Amazon was the next thing to do. I ordered these for him, I guess not realizing how many were coming (even though the amount was listed. Oops.) Anyways, I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to order more. I hope. I also hope nobody looks in the drawers in the bathroom and sees the lifetime supply of flossers. It&#x27;s a borderline hoarders situation. We are going to have the cleanest teeth on the west coast.</li>
            <li> I have used reach access dental flossers before, in fact they are all that I will use because they get the hard to reach places in the back of your mouth. The only problem is that Walmart was the only place that I could find them, and they are always out of them every time I go to restock. The flossers I bought here on Amazon were the exact same ones that I usually use, they are in the same price range as walmart, and they were delivered to me in a timely matter. I would definately recommend them to anyone, and Amazon was the best place to buy them.</li>
            <li> it is what i wanted and needed..use them everyday</li>
            <li> This product I use daily.  Would like to see it made stronger so that it can last longer. A little pricey.</li>
            <li> I use the reach flosser due the inability to reach inside my mouth from arthritis.  I have had difficulty finding these replacement pieces lately, so this is a real blessing.  They were delivered promptly and everything was as described.</li>
            <li> My husband is a flossing fool. He hates regular floss or floss picks. This is the only thing he will use and it isn&#x27;t always easy to find, especially now since we have been stationed in England. Needless to say I order these things all of the time.</li>
            <li> I wrote amazon and the seller regarding this product being really poor in quality- we use this type of product all the time and have for many many years. I wrote to ask for a replacement or credit as several broke one the very first use! it was almost as if they were very old or brittle. what a waste of money and now a waste of my time since this is my second attempt to get a resolve from the seller .I will continue to order things thru amazon just will not use this seller ever again if this is how they handle things. I would still like a response, but can no longer comment directly to them..hmmmm</li>
            <li> These are great.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t floss without them, hence&lt;br /&gt;they ensure my teeth stay healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the handle once, then just the refills.&lt;br /&gt;This is so much easier than flossing with the string alone.&lt;br /&gt;They are minty fresh as well which is a bonus but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;I try to get two flossing sessions with one string.&lt;br /&gt;They may be more expensive than the string, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a product that is great for people who want to floss hate jamming their hands in their mouths. While these are, overall, too expensive for what they are, the Amazon deal is much better than the grocery store. Pleasant minty taste.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickley and packaged well. When you can&#x27;t find locally, I recommend this site highly. Use them ALL the time!</li>
            <li> I used it everyday. It is great. Strong and firm. The peppermint scent is also good. I will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> Still favorite floss out there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so easy to get to every tooth and stays securely fastened even for the teeth that are tight to each other.  I tried a knockoff solely due to these just not being at the stores, and they were horrid.  I then hunted them down here and bought 8 packs.  Just remember to buy the actual flosser tool that you need for these.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. They make flossing really easy. No need to stick your fingers in your mouth anymore!</li>
            <li> I use them daily and the Internet is the best place to get them. Without them, I probably would not floss daily. They are OEM and do not break easily.</li>
            <li> Our local store was always out of this item.  So I ordered this large supply from Amazon.  Now we won&#x27;t be running to the store every time we run out!</li>
            <li> Great product, so much more convenient than using old-school dental floss.  Nice to have multiple flavors to choose from also.</li>
            <li> I like these. U struggle flossing every day. Not any more. I floss every night. These are hard to find in my town so it&#x27;s nice I can order them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Received product as described and expeditiously. A++++</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so easy!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. They are the easiest to use for me.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> So it is not what the dentist prefers. But some type of flossing is better than not flossing at all. Beware putting too much pressure on inserting the floss between the teeth. You could cut your gum. Push gently.</li>
            <li> I just wish that sometimes you didn&#x27;t run on to a set of 4 or 5 that break so quickly. I use these every day and before this flosser, I had trouble getting myself to floss even once a week.</li>
            <li> I love Reach Access Flosser; the quality of floss string is absolutely the best, and you will not want to use another flosser product again. These cleanpaste refills have the added bonus of slowly releasing the cleanpaste paste, and in my opinion they taste brilliant.</li>
            <li> fast and just what I ordered and a good price, too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year. Just bought a replacement. I used to hate flossing, but this product makes it very easy to floss and I do it everyday.</li>
            <li> True story: With the Reach Access flosser I went from flossing 4 or 5 times a year to 4 or 5 hundred times per year.  I have one at home, one at the office, and one in my car.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a [[ASIN:B0017TU2HE Reach Flosser, Starter Pack 1 set]] as part of my &#x27;thanks for coming in to get your teeth cleaned!&#x27; kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it actually slightly harder to floss with, except that i don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m cutting the tips of my fingers off by wrapping the loose floss around it. It&#x27;s hard to get any leverage with the thin plastic handle, so you have to practically hold it by the head, which means you&#x27;ve got your hands in your mouth just like you would flossing normally. Some of my teeth are very close together, and i can&#x27;t use a side-to-side motion to get the flosser between them because the whole length of floss is only one inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought refills so i could keep using the flosser, hoping that it&#x27;ll get easier over time. Perhaps there&#x27;s some nuance to the technique that i have yet to master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some comparison math for you, so you can decide if it&#x27;s worth the money to save a few minutes of having your fingertips tingle from the floss pulling too tight. I worked under the assumption that the average person uses about half a yard of floss per flossing, and only flosses once per day. The flosser suggests using a new refill every day. The prices are what is available here on amazon five minutes before i wrote this review, so they may fluctuate. However, the trend is clear:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss brand A: 1.25 cents per day&lt;br /&gt;Floss brand B: 4.2 cents per day&lt;br /&gt;Floss brand C: 2.5 cents per day&lt;br /&gt;Reach cleanpaste floss: 3.17 cents per day&lt;br /&gt;Reach Access flosser cleanpaste refills: 14 cents per day (the unflavored refills have the same cost-per-day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that these refills are 3 to 4 times more expensive than regular floss. If you find it much easier to use these than normal floss, it may be worth the cost, but if not, it won&#x27;t make any economic sense at all.</li>
            <li> Love these for my Reach Flosser as now I actually floss. They&#x27;re easy to use and so portable. Enough said!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Great, speedy service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things for years and have loved them. There&#x27;s not much else to say than that! :)</li>
            <li> Love the Reach flosser.. Easy to use and comes in great flavors... Makes flossing almost enjoyable...</li>
            <li> This is the best product for flossing. My dentist appointment have been great since using it cause I floss more.</li>
            <li> I have used these for a few years with good results, because they are so easy to use.  The only drawback is their relatively high price for such a simple device!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Nothing is going to make flossing fun for me, but it&#x27;s less of a chore now. I don&#x27;t feel as though I have to jam my elbows into my mouth anymore!</li>
            <li> Great price of a well known product.</li>
            <li> The flosser refill is convenient and easy to snap. Wish they had stronger floss. It tends to thin out quickly and break off.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent buy for the money.  These timed refills on items that the drugstores do not stock is a fantastic idea. The product is exactly what the package  says.  I highly recommend AMAZON&#x27;s periodic refill orders.</li>
            <li> we use this product instead of the old fashioned string floss.  my family no longer hesitates to floss, this is so much easier and faster that they actually use it every time before they brush their teeth.  i can&#x27;t seem to find the refills in stores so i bought through amazon.  good deal as well!</li>
            <li> I really like the Reach Access Flosser, it is more expensive than floss alone, but it is convenient and easy to use.  The refills are hard to find in my area, so the price and convenience of buying them here was terrific.</li>
            <li> i love this product. hard to find in stores, so glad i was able to find it online and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Can&#x27;t find them in stores because they are always sold out.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick delivery, product as advertised.</li>
            <li> The Reach flosser definitely makes flossing much easier than sticking you fingers into your mouth. It&#x27;s the difference of flossing now and then to easily every day.</li>
            <li> reach access flossers are really the best for me. the spaces between my teeth are very tight, &amp; these make flossing alot easier &amp; safer than using the other, larger flossers on the market that are not taut enough to get between my teeth &amp; then back out again. also, using the reach flossers allows me to access the spaces between teeth all they way in the back alot easier than using any other product. these are the best, &amp; i hope they never stop making them. amazon prime prices are just excellent.</li>
            <li> These flossers are great and so easy to use. The packaging is handy and convenient. The package of 6 saves me money. I love these flossers.</li>
            <li> Only thing that gets me to floss since I have big hands.</li>
            <li> These little flossers are quite a bit more expensive than just using standard dental floss, but I REALLY hate flossing. I&#x27;ve found that using these nice little snap-on flossers is the only way I&#x27;ll actually floss. At my last dental exam, the hygienist seemed to think these flossers don&#x27;t do as good a job as regular floss because they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; around the tooth, but I don&#x27;t care. They do basically what needs to be done; get crud out from between your teeth. As long as they keep selling these, I&#x27;ll keep buying them!</li>
            <li> Nice item have been using them for three or four years and really like the convenience and ease of use compared to loose floss.</li>
            <li> Fit a Reach flosser handle perfectly.  not the widest version on the market, nor the strongest, but I have had only about a half-dozen breaks after going through the entire pack.</li>
            <li> Probably the best flosser I have ever used, and but it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers and think they do a much better job at getting all those hard to reach areas than regular floss does. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are great.  I have the older model battery operated handle and these are the flavor and strength of floss that makes it work so well.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly.  It is exactly what I needed, because these refills are virtually impossible for me to find in stores here.  Thank you very much!  :)</li>
            <li> This product is defective and unusable. 90% of the flosser string breaks. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have never experienced breakage such as this. Do not purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> These are affordable, they showed up on time, all went well.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see Amazon selling these flossers.  My mouth is small and using traditional floss is difficult and awkward.</li>
            <li> Loved these ever since I first tried them from the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;But the local stores stopped stocking them, so glad to able to get them from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they were a little cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;They make flossing truly painless..</li>
            <li> The work so great and are reusable. They last about a week or 2 before you have to replace it so the 28 count will go a long way</li>
            <li> Excellant service, great buy</li>
            <li> These things are great.  If only it was easier to consistently find a good price on them.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and no messing with floss wrapped around your fingers, that cuts into them, this is a great idea!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> these work well for me as i have arthritic fingers. much easier than regular floss</li>
            <li> Products arrived as described in good condition. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely cynical money making scheme. Compare this product with the Flossaid Floss Holder which doesn&#x27;t require purchasing overpriced refills. You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible. Don&#x27;t be fooled--by some saner floss holders.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it was old product since Listerine has now purchased the company, but this is a product that doesn&#x27;t have a shelf life and the price was great! I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I&#x27;ll have enough for many months.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Access flossers for months now. They are a far superior way to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not flossing regularly with conventional string floss due to the difficulty of getting my fat fingers to all the areas of my mouth.  In comes the Access flosser, and now it&#x27;s easy to get to every side of every tooth, including the 4 wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These refills cost way more than a container of string.  But, I actually use them daily and my oral hygeine has been greatly enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any difficulty in reaching areas with conventional floss, give them a try.  You&#x27;ll like them.</li>
            <li> You know you should.  Seriously, you&#x27;re not 20 anymore and you just can&#x27;t pretend you don&#x27;t know that plaque is bad for your teeth and your overall health.  So, invest the $3 in the Reach Floss stick and commit to buying refills of the snap-in packages and you can floss your teeth in under 1 minute without getting your hands all germy and without having string floss cut off the circulation in your fingers.  Happy to find the blue &amp;#34;clean paste&amp;#34; refills on Amazon (spearmint is icky and plain is, well, plain) as none of my local stores carry them anymore.  I have no idea why.  Just do it.  And you&#x27;ll get kudos from your dental hygeiist too.</li>
            <li> Great product, had trouble finding this anywhere else. And I won&#x27;t have to buy these for like a year now. But at $4.5 apiece, it&#x27;s a bit pricier than what Walmart carries it for (think Walmart has it for under $4). But works great, and tastes good too.</li>
            <li> Great price and easy way to pay. Thanks!</li>
            <li> packaged excellent-  great product</li>
            <li> This is the only flossing system that I have ever been able to use - I just can&#x27;t seem to manage regular floss effectively. The Reach Access flosser is easy to use and that means that I now floss every day. The dental technicians are now happy with me and I don&#x27;t have to sit in the chair while they scrape my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I use the Reach Access Flosser, but somehow these are a little bigger, and a bit less convenient to use, than the regular &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; variety. I don&#x27;t understand it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much for flossing, but after buying these, I&#x27;ve been doing it almost every day. Would highly recommend this product for those who aren&#x27;t as good at this important habit. I am a bit concerned about how food might get transferred from one tooth to the other because of how short the string is, but I haven&#x27;t had a huge problem with that; will have to ask my dentist next time I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> Husband uses these everyday. Likes them, it&#x27;s hard to find them in the stores, they&#x27;re always out of them.</li>
            <li> This was just the product I was looking for. I was not famililar with Pharmapack prior to this purchase. The had Speedy delivery and the price is right. Both Walgreen and RiteAid have spotty inventory on this type of product. Walgreen had a \\&quot;Kit\\&quot; for Den-Tek ( a Reach clone). It had a handle and a 50 count of snap-on heads for only $4.99. Never again. The first snap-on worked well enough, but the floss itself began to fray very quickly. I put in a new snap-on and it did not work at all. I&#x27;ll try to explain. These types of flossers are designed to clean between the teeth. I think almost everybody&#x27;s gaps between teeth vary and these flossers can get \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in the gaps if they are narrow. With Reach, no problem. They are heavy duty enough to extract in tight gaps and go on to the next gap. With DenTek. the flosser enters the gaps well enough,(the trick with these types of products; place the floss on the biting surface of your teeth at the location of the gap. Position the flosser handle on the biting surface of the oposite jaws teeth, and slowly bite the floss into place. to extract the flosser from between the teeth, slowly use a \\&quot;seesaw\\&quot; motion away from you gums. I found the DenTek  flosser refill part remaining behind, stuck in the gap. Not good. This event will cause you to fuss around in order to free it. This problem occured everytime with DenTes. With the Reach product, no problem. The Reach fillers are pricier, but believe me when I say I have a lot of uneven surfaces between my teeth, and I can re-use the Reach refills 3-4 times, making them very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up for Reach and Pharmapacks.</li>
            <li> They work really well. I have big finger so this helps me instead of fighting with regular floss.</li>
            <li> Love this over typical flossing.  My doctor gave me a sample to try.&lt;br /&gt;Makes flossing enjoyable.  You can&#x27;t get a better value- qty for the low price.</li>
            <li> The reach Snap on Snap on Heads make oral  care easier then ever. An excellent product. I really like the product and it has along with the Philips Sonicare tooth brush given me years of great dental care.</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier and less of a hassle to floss</li>
            <li> These are just as I had hoped, it is much easier to order from Amazon than to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and these make sure I get it done...</li>
            <li> I purchased this deal due to the fact that it came with 6 months worth of refills. For me this is the best way to floss. Before the Reach and the flosser refills flossing was a pain in the butt. With this purchase it is much easier to floss those teeth at the back of your mouth. I would definitely recommend this along with the Reach.</li>
            <li> They work well on both my manual and power flossers</li>
            <li> Perfect head for the Reach Access Flossers--the easiest way to reach all those difficult areas in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well, but they do tend to break sometimes while flossing.  The minty flavor is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Nice improvement over non-flavored floss.  This is a dread to use compared to normal floss dispensers.  This is the only product I can floss with.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Reach&#x27;s Snap-n Heads floss is the one type of floss I find quick, easy, and effective. You can still wrap around each individual tooth by pulling forward or pushing back when the floss is between teeth. For teeth tightly aligned the Access Flosser is the best, because you can use your upper or lower jaw to bite down gently and help the floss move into place. You can&#x27;t do that with floss and fingers! Rinse as often as you like and your disposable should last about 3 to 4 cleanings. Because of this nifty tool, I now floss with every brushing and it&#x27;s made a positive difference.</li>
