            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great if used with the Waterpik .</li>
            <li>I have already seen a 50% improvement in the receding, and it has also done a great  job reducing tartar buildup.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job at getting rid of tartar.  </li>
            <li>Im happy that it works</li>
            <li>I think adding some pressure with a Waterpik is great, because you have 1) a chemical breakdown of the tarter and 2)</li>
            <li>This stuff works great</li>
            <li>I think the product will be great to use as a preventative to tartar as well,</li>
            <li>Great concept.  </li>
            <li>The hygienist hesitantly told me that I had zero plaque/tartar and my pockets were greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li>Happy happy me.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t that happy.</li>
            <li>I got this 3 weeks before my dental cleaning &amp; I was so glad with my cleaning!!</li>
            <li>I was optimistic because of the many excellent reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>rather spend a month to get rid of it myself then an hour of someone else using power tools on me :P</li>
            <li>Dr. Keyes was nominated for a Nobel Prize, it does not appear to have been a successful nomination.  </li>
            <li>It is now pleasant to floss</li>
            <li>Very, very pleased and will continue this great addition to my dental routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July</li>
            <li>You get a great fresh feeling and superb plaque removal.</li>
            <li>good substitute for visiting dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep posting after I use it for a fair amount of time.    </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this product &amp; have been using it with my WaterPik water flosser for about a week &amp; my mouth has never felt so good.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for products that would aid in the growth of the alveolar bone and have referred to Wikipedia often for good info and for some reason I ended up searching for phosphorous.</li>
            <li>a good amount has migrated up the teeth.</li>
            <li>Is it really as good as all that?</li>
            <li>During that exam the hygienist said \\&quot;Your gums are not in good shape -- I will see you in four months\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I probably not buy again since price wise</li>
            <li>the product in good time too.</li>
            <li>Not as good as it is hyped up to be.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as Listerine in my opinion although Listerine gives you a fresher breath</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had good gums.  </li>
            <li>It felt so good.</li>
            <li>for the good side -- discounting the placebo effect, this stuff used in a WaterPik does a fair job of blasting the visible tartar at your gum line.  </li>
            <li>It appeared in good condition.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>This is kind of cool because it fizzes up like Alka Seltzer and makes you think this could do some real good on your teeth.</li>
            <li>The dentist also commented that my gums were improved and very healthy.</li>
            <li>I still use it every now and again to help keep my presently very healthy gums in tact</li>
            <li>takes all the stuff off your teeth,, amazing ,, try it  its works great,,, you will love it,, like nothing i have used before</li>
            <li>Leaving a real nice clean feeling to your teeth, like you have just had them professionaly cleaned.</li>
            <li>That toothbrush is excellent at removing tartar and really helps polish your teeth!</li>
            <li>If you want a fresher mouth and better looking teeth you need to get this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>With the amazing reviews, thought this woud work</li>
            <li>He cleaned my teeth and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>The procedure if you don&#x27;t have a Waterpik, is to put a spoonful of product (you are provided with a dosing spoon)into a glass of warm water.</li>
            <li>if products you can use at home are really effective they don&#x27;t stand to profit.  </li>
            <li>THE POCKET SEEMS TO BE FILLING IN NICELY</li>
            <li>I use two scoops of Periogen to one cup of warm water.</li>
            <li>I just follow the directions and place 1 scoop of Periogen into the WATER PIK reservoir along with warm water.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a cleaning in over 15 years because my children have always been my priority and to be honest</li>
            <li>Studies published in Indian dental journals have shown oil pulling to be as effective as some prescription mouthwashes in removing plaque and bacteria.  </li>
            <li>She smiled throughout the exam.</li>
            <li>Then I change the Waterpik tip to the Pocket pick, set speed to 2 and fill it with a cup of warm water with 2 \\&quot;cups\\&quot; of</li>
            <li>and he liked it..</li>
            <li>Kind of a fizzy type feeling.</li>
            <li>*Follow with a warm salt (or Epsom salts)</li>
            <li>After all, with this kind of markup, people have a lot of motivation to home brew</li>
            <li>person&#x27;s opinion, make your own call, and caveat emptor.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use it until it gets so popular that the prices skyrocket.</li>
            <li>Honestly...</li>
            <li>I am honestly amazed at how well this has worked.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the product is great!</li>
            <li>Together with the scrapers that I bought, I got rid if most of my plaque in my own home.</li>
            <li>remain cautious because this is just too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I am the kind of people who have tartar buildup easily.</li>
            <li>I have noticed since using this product that my teeth feel SO clean, like how they feel right after a good cleaning from the hygienist!</li>
            <li>we bought a 3 pack many months ago.</li>
            <li>For what you&#x27;re paying for this product you would expect to be getting something a lot stonger that produces notable results.</li>
            <li>but I can say that 2/3 of the tartar I could see are gone now and the gum looks completely healthy again.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I SURE HOPE THIS WORKS</li>
            <li>But I have to tell you that since using this product I don&#x27;t have that problem any more.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was reducing the tartar.</li>
            <li>My gumline on top seems a litte better after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>So now worrying even more...</li>
            <li>And I love the WaterPik-</li>
            <li>If you want faster results, youre going to have to spend more time over the bathroom sink.   </li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel so much better, and I attribute that to the trio of products I&#x27;m using - the Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush, the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, and the Periogen.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, you get the best results when you keep the WATER PIK tip as close as possible to the gum line.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m here to tell you about the Periogen</li>
            <li>How safe are these I wonder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been most of a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used a waterpik hoping for better results but that didn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the supposed hygienist who rips this product apart without even having tried it.</li>
            <li>cant be sure, but after doing some research I think the periogen is whats doing the softening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>sure you use it with a waterpik</li>
            <li>I will see better results.  </li>
            <li>During the periodontal check, I had mostly 4s and a couple of 5s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doing research for better solutions, I happened on Periogen.</li>
            <li>This product promised better dental visits by reducing&lt;br /&gt;tartar</li>
            <li>Plax pre-rinse (Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate), and most tartar control toothpastes have these compounds.  </li>
            <li>teeth have never felt smoother, and my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>everything is lovely.</li>
            <li>just please make sure your pet don t lake</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Wish I could rate it higher than a 5 star. :-p</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s more...</li>
            <li>I still use one more another oral brand wash for safety.</li>
            <li>product has changed my life in the best possible way.</li>
            <li>then placed identical amounts of tartar into both glass jars, made sure water was fill)ed all the way to the top (to minimize air contamination)</li>
            <li>I was more easily able to floss away any build up.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see :-))</li>
            <li>Then yesterday at my dentist appointment the hygienist and dentist were both amazed - NO PLAQUE on any teeth and perfectly healthy gums - no bleeding, no pockets.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I found an article that said the latest thinking in gingivitis is now using hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li>Thankyou for offering a better solution.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did not get better.  </li>
            <li>I felt so confident because of this</li>
            <li>I have struggled with periodontal inflammation for many years.</li>
            <li>I had to learn more.</li>
            <li>I use the second setting from the bottom as this seems to be best for me.</li>
            <li>Any more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Doctors don&#x27;t know about this any more than they know their receptionist acts snotty to a patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I read the reviews here and it seemed like this stuff could help get my mouth in better shape, before I went to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I was going to use her&#x27;s.  :-)</li>
            <li>Do not drink or eat anything else afterwards to make sure it stays on your teeth to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will love it.. and save on dental bills too.</li>
            <li>For me, I have a severe tartar problem mostly on my bottom front teeth (inside them).</li>
            <li>This development increased my interest in learning more.  </li>
            <li>In fact, most of the mentions I find of Dr. Keyes seem to come from the makers of this product, including 100% of those I found which mention a position of Director, or a Nobel nomination.  </li>
            <li>I use more at night...about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon.</li>
            <li>I use most days and I swish in my mouth like mouth wash as per instructions, most every day.</li>
            <li>If this keeps up, I may be able to stretch it to every six months and that&#x27;s a savings.)</li>
            <li>and I was on a mission to try to make my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t order any more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any chemical interaction going on, any more than there is when you turn a fire hose on to douse a house fire.  </li>
            <li>(Perhaps a better analogy would be adding detergent to a pressure washer used for cleaning your house?)  </li>
            <li>Of course, the smartest way to have begun this process would have just been to ask my dentist. :)</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this with the syringe that periogen sells in order to get in between the teeth and gums better.</li>
            <li>I used periogen&#x27;s syringe with the tip sliced on an angle to better inject the product in between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>-you mostly because a)</li>
            <li>I also use arm and hammer healthy gums toothpaste, smartmouth activated mouthwash, and listerene.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item and it did sound too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Great product and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>For me, this is a good investment in large dental bill prevention and better health.</li>
            <li>You have made an significant contribution to my oral health!</li>
            <li>The legal protection offered is the incentive to the inventor for sharing this information for the greater good of society.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so clean!</li>
            <li>ok it seems to work fine in removing the tarter from my teeth when I see the build up.</li>
            <li>Due to Periogen leaving your mouth with the perfect ph balance ( pH 7.5!), my dental reminerlization products (MI Paste Plus) work much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not that impressed with it after my hopes were</li>
            <li>Anything that gets you to focus on cleaning your teeth really well is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The scientific explanation is what really convinced me along with the good reviews I had read here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use this in between dentist visits and it helps keep my mouth clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Visit your dentist like you should &amp; quit trying to take the easy way out.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li>, they broke and decayed easily, so</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling of my teeth after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at how many good reviews this stuff has.</li>
            <li>me, the results so far are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>For me, this is a good investment in large dental bill prevention and better health.want to risk it not mixing right.</li>
            <li>I was suspicious of the wording, and upon a quick check I realized most of those 5 star reviews are just scam to advertise the product...    </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see how good this product work.</li>
            <li>Used more than half of bottle and results are very good.</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in the plack and the way my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well on my way to being tartar free.   </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li>Sodium bicarbonate - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  NaHCO3.&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste</li>
            <li>Citric acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  </li>
            <li>Sodium fluoride - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  NaF 0.04%&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fab feeling of cleanliness and smooth (un-tartared)teeth.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s dirt cheap too).  </li>
            <li>So I knew there had to a product available for humans.</li>
            <li>If you want to keep your teeth free of tartar and prevent or reverse gingivitis you must use this.</li>
            <li>I also have included an essentially free alternative from Dr. Keyes, of whom they seem to think so highly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that I can create a clicking sound as well doing this</li>
            <li>Periogen and the WaterPik are fantastic together</li>
            <li>think using the Periogen powder is a good supplement to professional cleanings at the dentist</li>
            <li>difference was really surprising, and certainly more than I set as my standard for a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow so far so good with the gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>Are they simply trying to persuade people that they can&#x27;t mix up an effective alternative on their own?  </li>
            <li>so stop harboring it in your mouth and get it cleaned quickly and easily instead of relying on this quackery treatment.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels pretty good and moist.</li>
            <li>should state that Dr. Keyes does appear to have been a talented and successful researcher, and I mean no disrespect to him in anything I say here.  </li>
            <li>I have an \\&quot;impressive set of choppers\\&quot; and need very little work.</li>
            <li>I noticed after using this I didn&#x27;t have as much build up as I normally had &amp; was hoping my dentist would be pleased!!</li>
            <li>They had a professional Clean Room for formulating their product, a room for presentations to dental professionals and a nice size loading dock that demonstrated strong product demand.</li>
            <li>not only does it dissolve tartar real well below gumline(once a day use for about 4-6 wks), it keeps great oral health, better than toothpaste.    </li>
            <li>Before my first bottle of Periogen was all used, there was for the most part no visible tartar on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a quick swish for a minute at the most right after brushing before bed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been 4 days since I&#x27;ve been using Periogen (twice a day, with newly purchased WaterPik, Pik Pocket attachment), and my teeth feel polished clean, the kind of clean</li>
            <li>my mouth feels soooo clean.  </li>
            <li>gums are healthier and my mouth feels wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and smoother against my tongue.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li>i used a pice of cotton to rabb the cat s teeth and then used the scaler i also baught from  amazon to clean the tartar and all worked together .</li>
            <li>But I do not feel clean after used it.</li>
            <li>They are all regulated as drugs by the FDA and contain one or more active ingredients proven safe and effective for the purpose listed on the product&#x27;s \\&quot;Drug Facts\\&quot; label.</li>
            <li>it makes my mouth feel clean without the alcohol feeling of mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Still my teeth are 90% tartar clean and it has been 4 months since I have had a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>Your teeth are squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>When used with the water pick, it maximizes the sensation of clean and sanitized in your mouth.</li>
            <li>because my mouth looks pretty good now and the tarter and calcium deposits seem pretty much resolved!</li>
            <li>it makes no sense that my teeth look great, my gums are still pink and taut as they always have been, with no bleeding, yet there is tons of tartar under them.  </li>
            <li>I never had such a good report.  </li>
            <li>However,  I wanted to see their operation and be sure they were a &#x27;real company&#x27;  and not some mom and pop operation working about of a bedroom or storage facility.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see that Periogen was a &#x27;REAL COMPANY&#x27;.</li>
            <li>After getting my braces off I finally got a good look at my gums</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through four full jars of Periogen and haven&#x27;t noticed the slightest decrease in the amount of tartar on my teeth</li>
            <li>The best thing you can do for your teeth is floss at least once a day, brush twice a day, and use something like this.</li>
            <li>She said that there was good improvement since the last visit and asked what I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>It took me about a month to finally be sure that I was really hitting the periodontal pockets correctly.  </li>
            <li>The Periogen works well for those who want better checkups at the dentist office as I do &amp; the Dentist wants to know about it</li>
            <li>After 3 months I noticed a tremendous improvement in the ease of keeping the spaces between my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>a full tartar removal procedure that would scrape under the gumline etc.</li>
            <li>used 2 full bottles, no effect</li>
            <li>Strong thanks!</li>
            <li>, i have mild gingivitis</li>
            <li>Studies also reveal that when people get older, the two things they wish they had taken better care of are their teeth and their feet.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars because I can see it is working, but not as quickly as stated.</li>
            <li>Then I brush with a famous brand of toothpaste followed by a final rinse with my favorite mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Now here is what I noticed about this SUPER Periogen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are just some of the things which concern me, but I think this is adequate to express my doubts about Periogen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main thing with this product it to make sure that you can get it to where the problems are.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking for their teeth to be cleaner and also your mouth feels much more refreshed.</li>
            <li>I REALLY FEEL MY TEETH CLEAN !&lt;</li>
            <li>next appointment will be very interesting and I will update again.</li>
            <li>though I used one other cleaner also that I think I may have liked more).</li>
            <li>They did a normal light cleaning and I was done!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>So I did decide to use it much more sparingly (and ordered a new hand piece for my waterpik).  </li>
            <li>Also, DO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY!  </li>
            <li>I will continue using this product every night and hopefully in six months my next appointment is even better!    </li>
            <li>I have been using products bought via Amazon for over 12 years, but this is my first review!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>I can feel my bare, clean tooth again!!</li>
            <li>Once each day before brushing I mix one tablespoon of Periogen in a one liter container of hot water from the tap and run all of it through my WaterPik WP60 unit to clean between my teeth and along my gumline.  </li>
            <li>I have been to the dentist twice since I started using this product and have had great check-ups with little to no scraping needed.</li>
            <li>In the end I would say if you have visible tartar on your teeth, you are really going to enjoy this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pricey, but it&#x27;s so worth not dumping thousands at a dentist and freaking out in the chair.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use a Waterpik oral irrigator; I just swish it around in my mouth in warm water for ten minutes while I&#x27;m doing something else.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not a shill, just a very pleased long time user of this product stating my opinion.</li>
            <li>Not only were these results better than my most recent exam, but we compared the latest results to an exam three years ago and there was still improvement.</li>
            <li>The key is to use warm water and follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>I like to use Periogen as a pre-rinse (warm water) while I am in the shower--just swishing it around... possibly using a toothbrush around the gumline.  </li>
            <li>Big difference in plague accumulation...must definitely maintain a good routine to have healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>Soon I&#x27;ll be able to talk and smile with people and not be conscious of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Received</li>
            <li>I spent quite a bit of time doing this to harvest a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The process is so spectacular in the beginning one begins to believe Rome actually was built in a day...</li>
            <li>Anyway...this product is unhoped for...marvellous...true to the many rave reviews and an absolute must if one doesn&#x27;t like teeth getting longer, larger and yellower (the receding gums leave a yellowed top of tooth visible) with age.</li>
            <li>After 4 more days the redness is completely gone and I can eat again without the pain caused by getting food matter under the gum.  </li>
            <li>I am 73 and retired and rarely review anything</li>
            <li>Then run fresh water through the Pik to prevent salt</li>
            <li>My breath is fresh.</li>
            <li>The periodontist wanted to perform $7500 worth of  work on my gums because of an infection that I had.</li>
            <li>After a month&#x27;s use my gums were really healthy and the tartar was almost completely dissolved.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it but strongly advise against misuse as I don&#x27;t know what the gasses could do you your respiratory system.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend that they be used together as I think this makes a significant difference in results.  </li>
            <li>After a few days use (still using the Gum Pocket Accessory), my teeth and gums look wonderful, gums pink and my teeth look very clean like they do right after a cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use of many tartar control preparations results in gradual softening of tartar (particularly the pre rinses, as I have not had that much luck with toothpastes).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 4 days, so I reserve full judgment until I see continuedimprovement, or chalk up the early good results to my having been under the influence of the honeymoon period of a placebo effect.  </li>
            <li>Started using the product right after a cleaning as prescribed.  </li>
            <li>Oh right the bone&#x27;s nutrients are calcium, phosphorous, A, C, D vitamins.</li>
            <li>I produce saliva with the right calcium-types of content to help tartar</li>
            <li>/&gt;Others have written that you can make this yourself, but frankly I don&#x27;t have the time and don&#x27;t want to risk it not mixing right.</li>
            <li>I knew right at the start that this was going to work as advertised.</li>
            <li>I knew they must be doing something right.</li>
            <li>I knew they must be doing something right.</li>
            <li>Yes, you got that right, fall off.</li>
            <li>(floss slips right through my teeth -- no tartar to get stuck on)and</li>
            <li>Periogen makes my teeth and gums feel so clean and look so much healthier - whiter teeth and pinker/firmer gums.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this product makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>A month later, the gum looks exactly like all the other gum tissue and feels perfect.</li>
            <li>I dissolved a very large amount of Periogen into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s essentially just an mild abrasive that is safe to use under the gum-</li>
            <li>I bought this product with the intent of taking better care of my mouth in general.</li>
            <li>albeit gums now cover teeth by a good full millimeter more (ie long horsey teeth nearly back to normal) and look the way they did over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Most of my pockets have been reduced to mostly 3&#x27;s and4&#x27;s, a few 5&#x27;s and one 7 still.  </li>
            <li>the claim for this product was correct, I should have seen the periogen solution either completely dissolve the tartar over time or soften it up to the point of easy mush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li>I squirt some hydrogen peroxide on my toothbrush and brush with it prior to going to bed and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>for the most part, my teeth and gums looked fine above the gum line, except for the backsides of the bottom front teeth where tarter was clearly visible.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time about a week ago.  </li>
            <li>I deleted first because I felt that I had written the review before trying the product</li>
            <li>Well, my experience was pretty anti-climatic.</li>
            <li>I put hot water to the 9 in the water reservoir, used the Dental Attachment, and one scoop of Periogen.</li>
            <li>After my first time using it my Tartar started to break off.</li>
            <li>I’m not a dentist, but this works and as always consult someone qualified first.</li>
            <li>a couple of problem areas in my gums where one or two areas were somewhat sensitive and would occasionally lightly bleed.  </li>
            <li>Nothing after that first week changed...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on April 23, 2012 along with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, so I&#x27;ve been using it for going on two months, but I have to admit I haven&#x27;t been consistent with my usage.</li>
            <li>But even so, I have some pretty stubborn tartar build up on the backs of my lower front teeth, which seems to be a problem area for a lot of people.</li>
            <li>However, I also recommend going to periogen.com to read their exact directions for whatever dental problems you&#x27;re confronting.  </li>
            <li>I had my first post braces cleaning two weeks after getting the product and the hygienist was amazed.</li>
            <li>I just brushed more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly rinsed with it as the bulk of the tartar is above the gum line.</li>
            <li>but from my personal experience, this stuff is nothing more than snake oil.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I started researching to get my teeth in better condition to just get that one filling and then on to regular cleanings.</li>
            <li>that I cant find more research on it, and it weirds me out that I dont see dentists recommending it left</li>
            <li>and I was told all my life I had pretty teeth</li>
            <li>This works pretty well</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>when I remember or when I can, I know it&#x27;ll help more if you floss daily.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t matter how many times or how carefully I brushed with my dentist-recommended Sonic Care tooth brush and flossed each day</li>
            <li>She checked first with her dentist, who urged her to start the Waterpic at the lowest setting, but said the Periogen couldn&#x27;t hurt her - go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li>With Periogen, it seems that the ingredients are in higher concentrations, and you can truly feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>I used exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>containing sodium bicarbonate has in several studies shown to have a better whitening  and plaque removal effect than toothpastes without it.&lt;br /&gt;Sodium bicarbonate is also used as an ingredient in some mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to write a glowing review saying how this actually removes tartat.</li>
            <li>(I used the higher recommended dose).</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I had given it every chance possible.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I was told by my hygienist that I had ZERO tarter and almost no plaque.</li>
            <li>After 6-12 months of consistent use, along with a Waterflosser, my hygienist was amazed at my progress.</li>
            <li>I, for one, won&#x27;t be buying any more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>in spite of using the periogen and xylitol, i suspect that the tartar below my gumline that neither of them can get to because of having no pockets might continue to grow like a coral in ocean waters, so under the gumline it may just keep getting more massive, just a guess.  </li>
            <li>This product claims to prevent and treat gum disease and combat plaque and tartar buildup, both drug claims under the Federal Food and Drug Act and regulated as such in any reputable oral hygiene product.</li>
            <li>She was interested because she had never heard of the oral rinse product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the water pik you will be able to get this periogen deep in gum line and dissolve tartar build up.</li>
            <li>Started using the rinse and tooth pick as explained recently by an Amazon reviewer (most explicit and helpful...</li>
            <li>This product is the first I have seen than addresses that issue.</li>
            <li>exactly once.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;No con to using this product holds a candle to the peace of mind in knowing that my gums are ok, that my teeth aren&#x27;t going to fall out anymore, and that the only dental cost I will have going forward are my biannual cleanings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;No con to using this product holds a candle to the peace of mind in knowing that my gums are ok, that my teeth aren&#x27;t going to fall out anymore, and that the only dental cost I will have going forward are my biannual cleanings.  </li>
            <li>When I first came across this product I was intriqued.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a week now since I first tried the product.</li>
            <li>The water pik does the same thing but is more concentrated with the detachable nozzles I call them.</li>
            <li>I have to say that after the first use of the Periogen product though my teeth did feel like I had just gotten out of the hygenist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soooo if you bleed...for any reason, bacteria is more likely to get in.  </li>
            <li>First, I followed the instructions and added this to my WaterPik Water Flosser.</li>
            <li>began researching this product because I was interested in using it on my dog.  </li>
            <li>I would love to have the patent number for further research.  </li>
            <li>The first week my gums bled and were sore.</li>
            <li>Bought the first bottle to try it out.</li>
            <li>After the first exam (after using for a month or so and not every day) she was amazed.</li>
            <li>I have had a prolonged condition which has kept me bedridden through many surgeries over several years.</li>
            <li>This really works but TOO PRICEY!</li>
            <li>I used this product daily for six months and more and then followed up with waterpik every day and periogen about once a week.</li>
            <li>Used with the water flosser, this product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with the rinse..</li>
            <li>I used this consistently, and my dentist didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>However, I had not gone to the dentist in ages, probably four years or more, so I did have a noticeable amount of tartar, especially on the bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had severe plaque forming on my teeth and got really scared!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have any issues per say, but I just wanted to be a more responsible adult.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a heavy coffee drinker, I always need a good dental cleaning every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Dr. Keyes&#x27; most significant professional achievement was reportedly in regard to the formation of caries, and if there was a nomination it would likely have been in this arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in a water pick, I just use it in a cup with warm water and swish with it every other day.</li>
            <li>Other than that, as far as I&#x27;ve researched so far, periogen is a safe, effective way to combat tartar buildup, gingivitis/gum-pockets/gum-inflammation, among others.  </li>
            <li>I have big teeth and even though I have good dental hygiene and brush and floss regularly, I still get tartar buildup.  </li>
            <li>At night, Brush as usual, Waterpik with full tank of warm water (just water) at max speed (10).</li>
            <li>I probably would be a little more entusiatistic about this product because you can tell it&#x27;s trying to do something, but the price is completely over the top and a rip off.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t say anything positive.  </li>
            <li>My opinion; this pretty much sums up the efficacy of the product.</li>
            <li>I had some minor bleeding before I started the Periogen, a sure sign of some gingivitis going on.</li>
            <li>I tried this first, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>I have a family member who has the same issue, only with more advanced gum disease.</li>
            <li>far I give it 5 starts, let&#x27;s see how it goes in the upcoming weeks as I plan to go through a full 90 days of Periogen.</li>
            <li>I squirted a couple of teaspoons into my waterpik along with about 1/3 a tank of warm water and used the pik pocket tip to force the solution down into the areas below the gum line.  </li>
            <li>Works great -- just a small spoonful in a small glass of warm water -- really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use about 12ozs of warm water in the WaterPik along with a scoop and a half of the Periogen  almost every night before bed (sometimes I miss a night or two) and after brushing my teeth with Biotene.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s the Periogen</li>
            <li>I do use the Watts- large syringe oral Irrigators because I couldn&#x27;t affored the waterpik.</li>
            <li>I got smart and turned to the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical before purchasing this product, but i&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Periogen had a very acid PH in the 3 range, strong enough to harm the tooth enamel like lemon juice will.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting some kind of miracle but a little improvement.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling right after using the water pik as it makes my gums feel tight against my teeth.</li>
            <li>She said for just having my braces off my gums looked amazing, still a few problems but way better than expected.</li>
            <li>really cannot say it did anything and used it as directed with a water flosser</li>
            <li>Thanks Periogen.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really give a hoot what any dentist has to say.</li>
            <li>Anyway, upon some research it looked like periogen was one of the promising products in the market, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>My prayer is, it really works as they say &amp; reverses the receding gums problem I inherited from my grandmother &amp; her ancestors.  </li>
            <li>Also my teeth are much wider now.</li>
            <li>Plus the stains that were there, were much easier to take off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have that much tarter built up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this the whole time and still no results.</li>
            <li>If something existed that really got rid of tartar without a visit to the dentist and worked</li>
            <li>very gradually.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use the plastic scoop that comes with it because this is to make one cup of solution to use with an oral irrigator, which is way too much for swishing around in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not take much powder, so</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t use it like I should</li>
            <li>I removed as much plaque with a dental probe (see [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I bought this for someone I know who hasn&#x27;t been to a dentist in 10 years and had so much tartar on his teeth.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for him and he was astounded on how much it is removing.  </li>
            <li>Cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Also would dip my toothbrush in and use it straight out of the bottle and apply to those problem areas.</li>
            <li>this product really works.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, I REALLY wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>Arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>This product really work, but you have to use it with a water pik.  </li>
            <li>I think I paid $.78 for the bottle of hydrogen peroxide so you can see it is also a real money saver.  </li>
            <li>It did not seem to do much.</li>
            <li>I had so much tartar and infection beneath the surface of my gumline that my roots were deteriorating.  </li>
            <li>I am a real person and this is my story.  </li>
            <li>I am a real person and this is my story.  </li>
            <li>This will do absolutely nothing to remove tarter.</li>
            <li>Gums have way better color, not the desired pink but getting closer&lt;</li>
            <li>This product really has done wonders for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Periogen really is working for me.  </li>
            <li>The product, when used with the Waterpik WP100 really does seem to reduce swollen gums and reduce plaque.</li>
            <li>AND THE PLAQUE AROUND MY GUMS FEELS  MUCH LOOSER TO REMOVE WIH MY FLOSSER</li>
            <li>(it really did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I started to recover from the  treatment I noticed I could not see where it had removed much of the tartar(if any).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>this product really works at keeping tartar under control</li>
            <li>This really worked the strengthen my teeth as well as soften the plaque.</li>
            <li>It was noticeable to me, but probably not so much to someone standing in front of me at conversation distance.  </li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t stand a dental hygienist scraping tartar off my teeth --</li>
            <li>Having some force behind the water is best -- i.e. a waterpik vs. simply swishing.</li>
            <li>For the cost of a couple pounds of coffee, or gasoline saved by riding my bicycle more to run local erands, I can avoid far larger dental bills and have far better health.</li>
            <li>For the cost of a couple pounds of coffee, or gasoline saved by riding my bicycle more to run local erands, I can avoid far larger dental bills and have far better health.</li>
            <li>I want to suggest that anyone considering purchasing this product, which is presently selling for roughly 10USD an ounce, (although it appears to be made up of common and cheap ingredients) do their own research and draw their own conclusions, but here are the things I think I have learned.</li>
            <li>I thought it was easier to clean my own tartar instead of being judged by a dentist on my poor dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>Ended up with more cavities like other users said.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this back in January of 2012.  </li>
            <li>Today I went for my clean and the last 2 years</li>
            <li>I also have a WaterPik but find the small amount of water (1 cup) goes by too fast, so I use the WaterPik with warm water after the rinse.  </li>
            <li>No deep cleaning needed, just the normal 15 mintues of light scraping</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s supposed to work in the long term, I&#x27;ve noticed huge improvements after just one week of usage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Periogen 3 times/day for a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually put it in between 9-12 ounces of warm water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As directed, I used 2 &amp;#34;scoops&amp;#34; of product in a full reservoir of water, twice daily.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any huge visual difference, but I&#x27;m not a dental professional.</li>
            <li>So the Periogen may be better for long-term use since it has much less taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i have a mild tartar formation in the back of my teeth  </li>
            <li>After using it for only a short period of time I went and saw my dentist who said my gums were looking better.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give myself at least 90 days to work with the Waterpik and Periogen, to see how much of an improvement I could make on my own before I went to the dentist.</li>
            <li>My last cleaning was quick and painless.  </li>
            <li>so researched many patents on such products with similar or also identical ingredients.</li>
            <li>I flossed it diligently every day and the gum around the crown remained super red and irritated and nothing seemed to improve it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be very interested to see what they say at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li>Make sure to mix the periogen powder in a small cup of warm water, and let it set for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so high reading the product description.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for defeating tartar.  </li>
            <li>Bleeding was still high at cleaning but not when I&#x27;m brushing or flossing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with Periogen and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Periogen.</li>
            <li>However, further research has indicated that certain products are used consistently in the dental industry to prevent tartar buildup.  </li>
            <li>(Other oils have too strong a taste).</li>
            <li>She gives me a choice of either that new method or the older.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The owners were very gracious and gave me a complete tour.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I know it said to repeat as many times as necessary, but nothing really happened and I decided to go back to my old trusty tartar scaler and pick after a week and scrape it off the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>I left that spot pretty much alone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways I&#x27;ll be interested to see how much time the Dental Hygenist spends on tartar during my next visit.  </li>
            <li>it does fizz a lot, the first time I used it the fizzing was so loud and unexpected</li>
            <li>I have been able to control trouble spots and I see tartar come and go,</li>
            <li>then I think it would be O.K. to mix in with whatever solution one normally uses in their WaterPik</li>
            <li>It is a good product not great.</li>
            <li>I used a little more than was recommended a little more frequently than was recommended.  </li>
            <li>My specific problem area has been around a crown that just never healed right.</li>
            <li>The heading above is exactly right.  </li>
            <li>The best way to achieve this is proper brushing, flossing, water irrigation and an oral rinse- DAILY, and regular dental cleanings and exams (at least 2x/ year).</li>
            <li>that seems to have reattached and is still loose but not nearly as bad as before I began using this product.</li>
            <li>I lucked out because I live in San Diego and Periogen was 4 miles from my beach apartment.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for 8 days, twice per day with my new waterpik.</li>
            <li>New info you might want to know though.</li>
            <li>The IS a noticeable non-build-up of new additional tartar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it in conjunction with a new Water PiK I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, new.</li>
            <li>but i saw its amazing results on my Cat&#x27;s tartar becuase mine was hard to get out because it was an old tartar</li>
            <li>Sadly, now my teeth are too stain free and healthy looking for there to be a before picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Inflammation, and particularly the inflamed gums that accompany gum disease, have far stronger links to heart disease than cholesterol.</li>
            <li>Within 4 weeks there was a vast improvement and within  3 months my gums were their healthy pink self again.</li>
            <li>They are very professional and try to build their business one customer at a time.</li>
            <li>All it really seemed to do is make your teeth feel a bit cleaner than usual, kind of like brushing for a really long time, but didn&#x27;t do anything to the visible tartar on my lower teeth.</li>
            <li>I actually saw some improvement in the first week of using Periogen.</li>
            <li>But i have receding gums on my bottom row due to having braces for over 7 years, which caused me to not be able to brush properly on the bottom row.</li>
            <li>Sunflower and sesame oil were apparently used as mouthwashes in India before the availability of modern chemical mouthwashes like Listerine.  </li>
            <li>Helps significantly with the irritation my lower front teeth get due to a permanent retainer.</li>
            <li>or maybe I am just more lazy in my treatment regiment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>our gums are pink, no pockets, no sensitivity and our breath has a clean, neutral smell, if not a slightly sweet smell, which one would expect when the oral cavity is free from organized anerobic bacteria.</li>
            <li>The Periogen Deep Cleaning Oral Rinse really does a decent job of whitening teeth.</li>
            <li>the progress continues steadily but more slowly now.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it is meant to replace a solid foundation of consistent brushing/flossing/appointments, but it has specifically helped me fight the tartar accumulation between professional cleanings.  </li>
            <li>Dissolving a Tums tablet in your mouth periodically during the day would likely do much more tomaintain a favorable average oral pH, and will provide your body with calcium in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The concept of this regimen was reportedly greeted with some controversy, but there were reportedly also positive indicators in the short term studies.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it for whiter, cleaner teeth with no more sensitivity or light occasional bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was pretty mild tartar, but now I have slick enamel</li>
            <li>the waterpic is an excellant tool and you should own and use one after everything you eat, using just plain old water to flush out the pockets, but the periogen lasts a vary long time when using the syringe instead of using the waterpic.</li>
            <li>it is even more expensive and way less effective than just going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s so stuck together in it&#x27;s plastic jar I have to chop at it with an ice pick every night to get the top surface to break into enough semi-powder to fill one little scoop, I guess it picks up moisture just from the air after it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>After 8 days, I knew it was working because I could see the spaces between my teeth, and feel every tooth surface and crevice, much the same as what it feels like after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>Using this product with a regular waterpik really turned my mouth around after using it for three weeks twice a day.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>so far i dont see any tartar dissolved (yes i use it correctly)</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a week now, so don&#x27;t have much to share yet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any bleeding whatsoever or any sensitive areas as well.  </li>
            <li>But Periogen still made a difference after a week which I was surprised to see.</li>
            <li>Near the end of my use I was scheduled to visit my Periodontist.  </li>
            <li>far... I&#x27;m not as amazed as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Results are a direct result of time x efficiency.</li>
            <li>The bleeding has completely stopped since using the Periogen.</li>
            <li>Had to set the Waterpik on the lowest because my pockets were rather sensitive.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m 43 now  and decided to suck it up and go for x rays with a practice that offers sedation.</li>
            <li>As to where I can&#x27;t speak of its oral hygiene, I use the product every day and my teeth are considerably whiter.</li>
            <li>After losing one tooth to the neglect of not having my teeth professionally cleaned at age 55</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see all that much difference in the decrease of tartar possibly using it longer</li>
            <li>because I use to bleed from my gums like every 20minutes, or when I would lick my teeth but so far that hasn&#x27;t happens.</li>
            <li>Wow, Works as described.</li>
            <li>published?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished some dental professional would take a close look at this product.is &amp;#62;1,000</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fluoride salts are used to enhance the strength of teeth by the formation of fluorapatite, a naturally occurring component of tooth enamel.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen its effect.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li>Expecting to see real improvement in oral health by next dentist exam.  </li>
            <li>In spite of this, I shelled out for 3 bottles, and followed the instructions diligently, never missing a treatment.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my gingivitis completely.  </li>
            <li>there was considerable tarter below the gum line, but no pockets.  </li>
            <li>a bit of progress so far, just not that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is working  so far  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether the stuff caused the waterpik problem or not as the unit is fairly old.  </li>
            <li>It could be a case of old age and may not be the hydrogen</li>
            <li>I did not notice much in the way of deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I hypothesize that they were so deep that nothing I was doing at the time could really help.  </li>
            <li>results so far are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have started using it, but it&#x27;s too early to tell yet if its working as I hope it will.</li>
            <li>and it makes my gums ache or sensitive.</li>
            <li>I realized that all of the money I had spent on Periogen at $25.00 a bottle could have been spent on two professional cleanings per year by a competent dental professional.  </li>
            <li>Between cleanings, and just before a professional cleaning, this loosens plaque and tartar like nothing else.</li>
            <li>two of my teeth had been bleeding before I started to use this product and stopped bleeding completely even with an oral pic brush.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>I have seen a marked improvement, and my gums and teeth just feel cleaner and look healthier.  </li>
            <li>My dentist noticed an improvement in my early periodontal disease as well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this rinse to children over 12 years old and adults.  </li>
            <li>It is worth noting that Dr. Keyes expected that the patient would be working with a dentist.  </li>
            <li>It is also worth noting that this seems to have been intended as a therapy for existing disease, possibly in combination with short term use of antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>I have actually forgotten to keep using it, mostly because I&#x27;ve tried other products like ACT restoring mouthwash to try and remineralize my enamel (can&#x27;t grow it back), but I might start using this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go there and be told I needed a deep cleaning; or for them to mess with my teeth when my gums were swollen and easy to get</li>
            <li>Even so, I am definitely seeing a difference, enough so that I purchased a refill two-pack before my first bottle ran out.</li>
            <li>then I took my time and went into each gum pocket (mine are small at 3 to 4 at the most) and I could feel the combination of the Periogen and the WaterPik seemed to perform a DEEP CLEANING these pockets!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this product, along with the Water Pik for proper application.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use until the bottle is gone (might as well, I paid a ridiculous amount of money for it) and will update with something more positive if by chance I haven&#x27;t given it enough time to work properly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I filled up two identical, small glass jars with lids with water.</li>
            <li>I really like using the Periogen powder in my Waterpik because I don&#x27;t have to spend as long flossing my teeth</li>
            <li>Yeah, yuck bitter taste but was willing to give it a whirl for any results.</li>
            <li>But I had just lost my first adult tooth due to tooth decay</li>
            <li>To make this product work better, apparently you need to up the amount of fluoride considerably, which has negative consequences, especially if you swallow the solution.  </li>
            <li>A small blue plastic scoop is included in the bottle; this amount nearly equals 1/4 teaspoon of standard measuring spoons, perhaps slightly more.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t know how to review this product since it&#x27;s only one part of a new oral hygiene regime I have started.  </li>
            <li>Bought this because I have periodontal disease and it really affected me when I started having a gum infection in my upper back molars.  </li>
            <li>It is nearly tasteless - kind of salty/sweet, depending on how much you put in the water.  </li>
            <li>My gums haven&#x27;t bled since the first month or so on Periogen and none of my other teeth are showing any signs of tooth decay.</li>
            <li>Most of it is small amounts near the gum line, but between the center two teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m putting one scoop (the little blue scoop in the bottle) into a half coffee-mug of warm water and then swishing it my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If your on the fence on trying it, particularly if dental insurance is not affordable to you or if like me you find the dentist chair most uncomfortable then there seems there isn&#x27;t that much to lose and a lot to gain, especially with the money back</li>
            <li>With the tartar on the affected teeth forming a new line, extending down perhaps as much as 5-10% from the gumline.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Anyway the feeling after using the Periogen made my teeth feel slick and clean.</li>
            <li>First of all the active ingredients are: Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Tripolyphosphate, Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate and Citric Acid along with Sodium Fluoride .04%</li>
            <li>But the gum line behind the teeth on the lower front ((which was my major concern) seems to have receded even more.</li>
            <li>Periogen is a must to keep my gums healthy, tight and with pockets of 4 or less.  </li>
            <li>My teeth in general feel smoother and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I generally use the amount of time in the Dental chair for cleaning to give me an idea</li>
            <li>I only get after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since yesterday, I have brushed 3 times and my tooth bleeding has completely vanished.</li>
            <li>This tooth was almost completely knocked out but through oral surgery put back in position with the warning that it would eventually be lost.  </li>
            <li>am only 22 years old.</li>
            <li>Perhaps those experiencing results used it while the tartar was still soft or maybe they don&#x27;t even know what tartar actually is.</li>
            <li>In desperation I finally scheduled an appointment with a professional dental hygienist and had my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though my teeth look nice, I can tell I am in the starting stages of periodontal disease, behind the lower front teeth especially, bleeding gums, receding gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It took the tarter right off my teeth after as little as a week.</li>
            <li>So far, my gums feel slightly healthier but I can&#x27;t really tell if it is periogen or the waterpik itself.</li>
            <li>There may have been some of the tarter that was dissolved due to the process, but I did not notice any real change.  </li>
            <li>other reviews are very misleading and frankly uninformed (focusing on baking soda or other ingredients that probably have absolutely nothing to do with the way the product works).  </li>
            <li>he also said that not a single tooth bled when he cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li>So in short it works but it is also kind of scary.</li>
            <li>I found no other product that claimed to remove tartar (They have the only product that has ever been found to work?</li>
            <li>Put this down to beginner&#x27;s luck and resolved not to write a review before being certain not to mislead anyone.</li>
            <li>The Periogen success continues: I just had another routine exam/cleaning and my dentist said he found very little build-up on my teeth.</li>
            <li>the advertisement years ago, when an exuberant child emerges from the dentist, grinning because of &amp;#34;No cavities&amp;#34; I felt the same pride and satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I was scared of dentists and ended up believing in the false promises of this company due to my own lack of confidence.</li>
            <li>Makes it super hard to floss well in that spot and this helps reduce the tartar and inflammation.</li>
            <li>The new sand (it&#x27;s not really sand</li>
            <li>She noted that my teeth were much cleaner than in previous visits.</li>
            <li>I have hope for the first time since I was 15, when my stupid birth mother had the dentist pull 6 of my baby teeth daily for 4 consecutive days because they had not come out on their own yet.  </li>
            <li>its just using the waterpik on high and some of the other products I bought actually doing the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before my dental hygienist began working on my teeth, I asked her to pay special attention to tartar build up so that she could determine if there was less during this visit (as compared with my previous appointment three months ago).</li>

            <li> Been using Periogen for 3 or 4 years and feel I have made very good progress on my neglected teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> She said my mouth looked great and that she was impressed.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased &amp; will continue to be pleased as I continue to use Periogen!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel great and I am thankful that I did decide to go to a dentist in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great if used with the Waterpik .</li>
            <li> I have already seen a 50% improvement in the receding, and it has also done a great  job reducing tartar buildup.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job at getting rid of tartar.  </li>
            <li> Im happy that it works</li>
            <li> I think adding some pressure with a Waterpik is great, because you have 1) a chemical breakdown of the tarter and 2)</li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> I think the product will be great to use as a preventative to tartar as well,</li>
            <li> Great concept.  </li>
            <li> The hygienist hesitantly told me that I had zero plaque/tartar and my pockets were greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> This product works great.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li> Happy happy me.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that happy.</li>
            <li> I got this 3 weeks before my dental cleaning &amp; I was so glad with my cleaning!!</li>
            <li> I was optimistic because of the many excellent reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> rather spend a month to get rid of it myself then an hour of someone else using power tools on me :P</li>
            <li> Dr. Keyes was nominated for a Nobel Prize, it does not appear to have been a successful nomination.  </li>
            <li> It is now pleasant to floss</li>
            <li> Very, very pleased and will continue this great addition to my dental routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July</li>
            <li> You get a great fresh feeling and superb plaque removal.</li>
            <li> good substitute for visiting dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep posting after I use it for a fair amount of time.    </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this product &amp; have been using it with my WaterPik water flosser for about a week &amp; my mouth has never felt so good.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for products that would aid in the growth of the alveolar bone and have referred to Wikipedia often for good info and for some reason I ended up searching for phosphorous.</li>
            <li> a good amount has migrated up the teeth.</li>
            <li> Is it really as good as all that?</li>
            <li> During that exam the hygienist said \\&quot;Your gums are not in good shape -- I will see you in four months\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I probably not buy again since price wise</li>
            <li> the product in good time too.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it is hyped up to be.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Listerine in my opinion although Listerine gives you a fresher breath</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good gums.  </li>
            <li> It felt so good.</li>
            <li> for the good side -- discounting the placebo effect, this stuff used in a WaterPik does a fair job of blasting the visible tartar at your gum line.  </li>
            <li> It appeared in good condition.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is kind of cool because it fizzes up like Alka Seltzer and makes you think this could do some real good on your teeth.</li>
            <li> The dentist also commented that my gums were improved and very healthy.</li>
            <li> I still use it every now and again to help keep my presently very healthy gums in tact</li>
            <li> takes all the stuff off your teeth,, amazing ,, try it  its works great,,, you will love it,, like nothing i have used before</li>
            <li> Leaving a real nice clean feeling to your teeth, like you have just had them professionaly cleaned.</li>
            <li> That toothbrush is excellent at removing tartar and really helps polish your teeth!</li>
            <li> If you want a fresher mouth and better looking teeth you need to get this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> With the amazing reviews, thought this woud work</li>
            <li> He cleaned my teeth and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> The procedure if you don&#x27;t have a Waterpik, is to put a spoonful of product (you are provided with a dosing spoon)into a glass of warm water.</li>
            <li> if products you can use at home are really effective they don&#x27;t stand to profit.  </li>
            <li> THE POCKET SEEMS TO BE FILLING IN NICELY</li>
            <li> I use two scoops of Periogen to one cup of warm water.</li>
            <li> I just follow the directions and place 1 scoop of Periogen into the WATER PIK reservoir along with warm water.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a cleaning in over 15 years because my children have always been my priority and to be honest</li>
            <li> Studies published in Indian dental journals have shown oil pulling to be as effective as some prescription mouthwashes in removing plaque and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> She smiled throughout the exam.</li>
            <li> Then I change the Waterpik tip to the Pocket pick, set speed to 2 and fill it with a cup of warm water with 2 \\&quot;cups\\&quot; of</li>
            <li> and he liked it..</li>
            <li> Kind of a fizzy type feeling.</li>
            <li> *Follow with a warm salt (or Epsom salts)</li>
            <li> After all, with this kind of markup, people have a lot of motivation to home brew</li>
            <li> person&#x27;s opinion, make your own call, and caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use it until it gets so popular that the prices skyrocket.</li>
            <li> Honestly...</li>
            <li> I am honestly amazed at how well this has worked.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product is great!</li>
            <li> Together with the scrapers that I bought, I got rid if most of my plaque in my own home.</li>
            <li> remain cautious because this is just too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I am the kind of people who have tartar buildup easily.</li>
            <li> I have noticed since using this product that my teeth feel SO clean, like how they feel right after a good cleaning from the hygienist!</li>
            <li> we bought a 3 pack many months ago.</li>
            <li> For what you&#x27;re paying for this product you would expect to be getting something a lot stonger that produces notable results.</li>
            <li> but I can say that 2/3 of the tartar I could see are gone now and the gum looks completely healthy again.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I SURE HOPE THIS WORKS</li>
            <li> But I have to tell you that since using this product I don&#x27;t have that problem any more.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was reducing the tartar.</li>
            <li> My gumline on top seems a litte better after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> So now worrying even more...</li>
            <li> And I love the WaterPik-</li>
            <li> If you want faster results, youre going to have to spend more time over the bathroom sink.   </li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel so much better, and I attribute that to the trio of products I&#x27;m using - the Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush, the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, and the Periogen.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, you get the best results when you keep the WATER PIK tip as close as possible to the gum line.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m here to tell you about the Periogen</li>
            <li> How safe are these I wonder.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been most of a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used a waterpik hoping for better results but that didn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the supposed hygienist who rips this product apart without even having tried it.</li>
            <li> cant be sure, but after doing some research I think the periogen is whats doing the softening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> sure you use it with a waterpik</li>
            <li> I will see better results.  </li>
            <li> During the periodontal check, I had mostly 4s and a couple of 5s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doing research for better solutions, I happened on Periogen.</li>
            <li> This product promised better dental visits by reducing&lt;br /&gt;tartar</li>
            <li> Plax pre-rinse (Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate), and most tartar control toothpastes have these compounds.  </li>
            <li> teeth have never felt smoother, and my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> everything is lovely.</li>
            <li> just please make sure your pet don t lake</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Wish I could rate it higher than a 5 star. :-p</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s more...</li>
            <li> I still use one more another oral brand wash for safety.</li>
            <li> product has changed my life in the best possible way.</li>
            <li> then placed identical amounts of tartar into both glass jars, made sure water was fill)ed all the way to the top (to minimize air contamination)</li>
            <li> I was more easily able to floss away any build up.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see :-))</li>
            <li> Then yesterday at my dentist appointment the hygienist and dentist were both amazed - NO PLAQUE on any teeth and perfectly healthy gums - no bleeding, no pockets.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I found an article that said the latest thinking in gingivitis is now using hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Thankyou for offering a better solution.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not get better.  </li>
            <li> I felt so confident because of this</li>
            <li> I have struggled with periodontal inflammation for many years.</li>
            <li> I had to learn more.</li>
            <li> I use the second setting from the bottom as this seems to be best for me.</li>
            <li> Any more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Doctors don&#x27;t know about this any more than they know their receptionist acts snotty to a patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews here and it seemed like this stuff could help get my mouth in better shape, before I went to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I was going to use her&#x27;s.  :-)</li>
            <li> Do not drink or eat anything else afterwards to make sure it stays on your teeth to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will love it.. and save on dental bills too.</li>
            <li> For me, I have a severe tartar problem mostly on my bottom front teeth (inside them).</li>
            <li> This development increased my interest in learning more.  </li>
            <li> In fact, most of the mentions I find of Dr. Keyes seem to come from the makers of this product, including 100% of those I found which mention a position of Director, or a Nobel nomination.  </li>
            <li> I use more at night...about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon.</li>
            <li> I use most days and I swish in my mouth like mouth wash as per instructions, most every day.</li>
            <li> If this keeps up, I may be able to stretch it to every six months and that&#x27;s a savings.)</li>
            <li> and I was on a mission to try to make my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t order any more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any chemical interaction going on, any more than there is when you turn a fire hose on to douse a house fire.  </li>
            <li> (Perhaps a better analogy would be adding detergent to a pressure washer used for cleaning your house?)  </li>
            <li> Of course, the smartest way to have begun this process would have just been to ask my dentist. :)</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this with the syringe that periogen sells in order to get in between the teeth and gums better.</li>
            <li> I used periogen&#x27;s syringe with the tip sliced on an angle to better inject the product in between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> -you mostly because a)</li>
            <li> I also use arm and hammer healthy gums toothpaste, smartmouth activated mouthwash, and listerene.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and it did sound too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Great product and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> For me, this is a good investment in large dental bill prevention and better health.</li>
            <li> You have made an significant contribution to my oral health!</li>
            <li> The legal protection offered is the incentive to the inventor for sharing this information for the greater good of society.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean!</li>
            <li> ok it seems to work fine in removing the tarter from my teeth when I see the build up.</li>
            <li> Due to Periogen leaving your mouth with the perfect ph balance ( pH 7.5!), my dental reminerlization products (MI Paste Plus) work much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not that impressed with it after my hopes were</li>
            <li> Anything that gets you to focus on cleaning your teeth really well is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The scientific explanation is what really convinced me along with the good reviews I had read here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this in between dentist visits and it helps keep my mouth clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Visit your dentist like you should &amp; quit trying to take the easy way out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li> , they broke and decayed easily, so</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling of my teeth after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at how many good reviews this stuff has.</li>
            <li> me, the results so far are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> For me, this is a good investment in large dental bill prevention and better health.want to risk it not mixing right.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious of the wording, and upon a quick check I realized most of those 5 star reviews are just scam to advertise the product...    </li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see how good this product work.</li>
            <li> Used more than half of bottle and results are very good.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in the plack and the way my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well on my way to being tartar free.   </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li> Sodium bicarbonate - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  NaHCO3.&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste</li>
            <li> Citric acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  </li>
            <li> Sodium fluoride - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  NaF 0.04%&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fab feeling of cleanliness and smooth (un-tartared)teeth.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s dirt cheap too).  </li>
            <li> So I knew there had to a product available for humans.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your teeth free of tartar and prevent or reverse gingivitis you must use this.</li>
            <li> I also have included an essentially free alternative from Dr. Keyes, of whom they seem to think so highly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that I can create a clicking sound as well doing this</li>
            <li> Periogen and the WaterPik are fantastic together</li>
            <li> think using the Periogen powder is a good supplement to professional cleanings at the dentist</li>
            <li> difference was really surprising, and certainly more than I set as my standard for a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow so far so good with the gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> Are they simply trying to persuade people that they can&#x27;t mix up an effective alternative on their own?  </li>
            <li> so stop harboring it in your mouth and get it cleaned quickly and easily instead of relying on this quackery treatment.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels pretty good and moist.</li>
            <li> should state that Dr. Keyes does appear to have been a talented and successful researcher, and I mean no disrespect to him in anything I say here.  </li>
            <li> I have an \\&quot;impressive set of choppers\\&quot; and need very little work.</li>
            <li> I noticed after using this I didn&#x27;t have as much build up as I normally had &amp; was hoping my dentist would be pleased!!</li>
            <li> They had a professional Clean Room for formulating their product, a room for presentations to dental professionals and a nice size loading dock that demonstrated strong product demand.</li>
            <li> not only does it dissolve tartar real well below gumline(once a day use for about 4-6 wks), it keeps great oral health, better than toothpaste.    </li>
            <li> Before my first bottle of Periogen was all used, there was for the most part no visible tartar on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a quick swish for a minute at the most right after brushing before bed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been 4 days since I&#x27;ve been using Periogen (twice a day, with newly purchased WaterPik, Pik Pocket attachment), and my teeth feel polished clean, the kind of clean</li>
            <li> my mouth feels soooo clean.  </li>
            <li> gums are healthier and my mouth feels wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and smoother against my tongue.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li> i used a pice of cotton to rabb the cat s teeth and then used the scaler i also baught from  amazon to clean the tartar and all worked together .</li>
            <li> But I do not feel clean after used it.</li>
            <li> They are all regulated as drugs by the FDA and contain one or more active ingredients proven safe and effective for the purpose listed on the product&#x27;s \\&quot;Drug Facts\\&quot; label.</li>
            <li> it makes my mouth feel clean without the alcohol feeling of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Still my teeth are 90% tartar clean and it has been 4 months since I have had a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> Your teeth are squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> When used with the water pick, it maximizes the sensation of clean and sanitized in your mouth.</li>
            <li> because my mouth looks pretty good now and the tarter and calcium deposits seem pretty much resolved!</li>
            <li> it makes no sense that my teeth look great, my gums are still pink and taut as they always have been, with no bleeding, yet there is tons of tartar under them.  </li>
            <li> I never had such a good report.  </li>
            <li> However,  I wanted to see their operation and be sure they were a &#x27;real company&#x27;  and not some mom and pop operation working about of a bedroom or storage facility.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to see that Periogen was a &#x27;REAL COMPANY&#x27;.</li>
            <li> After getting my braces off I finally got a good look at my gums</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through four full jars of Periogen and haven&#x27;t noticed the slightest decrease in the amount of tartar on my teeth</li>
            <li> The best thing you can do for your teeth is floss at least once a day, brush twice a day, and use something like this.</li>
            <li> She said that there was good improvement since the last visit and asked what I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> It took me about a month to finally be sure that I was really hitting the periodontal pockets correctly.  </li>
            <li> The Periogen works well for those who want better checkups at the dentist office as I do &amp; the Dentist wants to know about it</li>
            <li> After 3 months I noticed a tremendous improvement in the ease of keeping the spaces between my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> a full tartar removal procedure that would scrape under the gumline etc.</li>
            <li> used 2 full bottles, no effect</li>
            <li> Strong thanks!</li>
            <li> , i have mild gingivitis</li>
            <li> Studies also reveal that when people get older, the two things they wish they had taken better care of are their teeth and their feet.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I can see it is working, but not as quickly as stated.</li>
            <li> Then I brush with a famous brand of toothpaste followed by a final rinse with my favorite mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Now here is what I noticed about this SUPER Periogen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are just some of the things which concern me, but I think this is adequate to express my doubts about Periogen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main thing with this product it to make sure that you can get it to where the problems are.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking for their teeth to be cleaner and also your mouth feels much more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I REALLY FEEL MY TEETH CLEAN !&lt;</li>
            <li> next appointment will be very interesting and I will update again.</li>
            <li> though I used one other cleaner also that I think I may have liked more).</li>
            <li> They did a normal light cleaning and I was done!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> So I did decide to use it much more sparingly (and ordered a new hand piece for my waterpik).  </li>
            <li> Also, DO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY!  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this product every night and hopefully in six months my next appointment is even better!    </li>
            <li> I have been using products bought via Amazon for over 12 years, but this is my first review!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> I can feel my bare, clean tooth again!!</li>
            <li> Once each day before brushing I mix one tablespoon of Periogen in a one liter container of hot water from the tap and run all of it through my WaterPik WP60 unit to clean between my teeth and along my gumline.  </li>
            <li> I have been to the dentist twice since I started using this product and have had great check-ups with little to no scraping needed.</li>
            <li> In the end I would say if you have visible tartar on your teeth, you are really going to enjoy this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, but it&#x27;s so worth not dumping thousands at a dentist and freaking out in the chair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use a Waterpik oral irrigator; I just swish it around in my mouth in warm water for ten minutes while I&#x27;m doing something else.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not a shill, just a very pleased long time user of this product stating my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not only were these results better than my most recent exam, but we compared the latest results to an exam three years ago and there was still improvement.</li>
            <li> The key is to use warm water and follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> I like to use Periogen as a pre-rinse (warm water) while I am in the shower--just swishing it around... possibly using a toothbrush around the gumline.  </li>
            <li> Big difference in plague accumulation...must definitely maintain a good routine to have healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> Soon I&#x27;ll be able to talk and smile with people and not be conscious of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Received</li>
            <li> I spent quite a bit of time doing this to harvest a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The process is so spectacular in the beginning one begins to believe Rome actually was built in a day...</li>
            <li> Anyway...this product is unhoped for...marvellous...true to the many rave reviews and an absolute must if one doesn&#x27;t like teeth getting longer, larger and yellower (the receding gums leave a yellowed top of tooth visible) with age.</li>
            <li> After 4 more days the redness is completely gone and I can eat again without the pain caused by getting food matter under the gum.  </li>
            <li> I am 73 and retired and rarely review anything</li>
            <li> Then run fresh water through the Pik to prevent salt</li>
            <li> My breath is fresh.</li>
            <li> The periodontist wanted to perform $7500 worth of  work on my gums because of an infection that I had.</li>
            <li> After a month&#x27;s use my gums were really healthy and the tartar was almost completely dissolved.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it but strongly advise against misuse as I don&#x27;t know what the gasses could do you your respiratory system.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend that they be used together as I think this makes a significant difference in results.  </li>
            <li> After a few days use (still using the Gum Pocket Accessory), my teeth and gums look wonderful, gums pink and my teeth look very clean like they do right after a cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use of many tartar control preparations results in gradual softening of tartar (particularly the pre rinses, as I have not had that much luck with toothpastes).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 4 days, so I reserve full judgment until I see continuedimprovement, or chalk up the early good results to my having been under the influence of the honeymoon period of a placebo effect.  </li>
            <li> Started using the product right after a cleaning as prescribed.  </li>
            <li> Oh right the bone&#x27;s nutrients are calcium, phosphorous, A, C, D vitamins.</li>
            <li> I produce saliva with the right calcium-types of content to help tartar</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have written that you can make this yourself, but frankly I don&#x27;t have the time and don&#x27;t want to risk it not mixing right.</li>
            <li> I knew right at the start that this was going to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I knew they must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> I knew they must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> Yes, you got that right, fall off.</li>
            <li> (floss slips right through my teeth -- no tartar to get stuck on)and</li>
            <li> Periogen makes my teeth and gums feel so clean and look so much healthier - whiter teeth and pinker/firmer gums.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this product makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> A month later, the gum looks exactly like all the other gum tissue and feels perfect.</li>
            <li> I dissolved a very large amount of Periogen into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s essentially just an mild abrasive that is safe to use under the gum-</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the intent of taking better care of my mouth in general.</li>
            <li> albeit gums now cover teeth by a good full millimeter more (ie long horsey teeth nearly back to normal) and look the way they did over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Most of my pockets have been reduced to mostly 3&#x27;s and4&#x27;s, a few 5&#x27;s and one 7 still.  </li>
            <li> the claim for this product was correct, I should have seen the periogen solution either completely dissolve the tartar over time or soften it up to the point of easy mush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li> I squirt some hydrogen peroxide on my toothbrush and brush with it prior to going to bed and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> for the most part, my teeth and gums looked fine above the gum line, except for the backsides of the bottom front teeth where tarter was clearly visible.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time about a week ago.  </li>
            <li> I deleted first because I felt that I had written the review before trying the product</li>
            <li> Well, my experience was pretty anti-climatic.</li>
            <li> I put hot water to the 9 in the water reservoir, used the Dental Attachment, and one scoop of Periogen.</li>
            <li> After my first time using it my Tartar started to break off.</li>
            <li> I’m not a dentist, but this works and as always consult someone qualified first.</li>
            <li> a couple of problem areas in my gums where one or two areas were somewhat sensitive and would occasionally lightly bleed.  </li>
            <li> Nothing after that first week changed...</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on April 23, 2012 along with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, so I&#x27;ve been using it for going on two months, but I have to admit I haven&#x27;t been consistent with my usage.</li>
            <li> But even so, I have some pretty stubborn tartar build up on the backs of my lower front teeth, which seems to be a problem area for a lot of people.</li>
            <li> However, I also recommend going to periogen.com to read their exact directions for whatever dental problems you&#x27;re confronting.  </li>
            <li> I had my first post braces cleaning two weeks after getting the product and the hygienist was amazed.</li>
            <li> I just brushed more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly rinsed with it as the bulk of the tartar is above the gum line.</li>
            <li> but from my personal experience, this stuff is nothing more than snake oil.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I started researching to get my teeth in better condition to just get that one filling and then on to regular cleanings.</li>
            <li> that I cant find more research on it, and it weirds me out that I dont see dentists recommending it left</li>
            <li> and I was told all my life I had pretty teeth</li>
            <li> This works pretty well</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> when I remember or when I can, I know it&#x27;ll help more if you floss daily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t matter how many times or how carefully I brushed with my dentist-recommended Sonic Care tooth brush and flossed each day</li>
            <li> She checked first with her dentist, who urged her to start the Waterpic at the lowest setting, but said the Periogen couldn&#x27;t hurt her - go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li> With Periogen, it seems that the ingredients are in higher concentrations, and you can truly feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> I used exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> containing sodium bicarbonate has in several studies shown to have a better whitening  and plaque removal effect than toothpastes without it.&lt;br /&gt;Sodium bicarbonate is also used as an ingredient in some mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to write a glowing review saying how this actually removes tartat.</li>
            <li> (I used the higher recommended dose).</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I had given it every chance possible.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I was told by my hygienist that I had ZERO tarter and almost no plaque.</li>
            <li> After 6-12 months of consistent use, along with a Waterflosser, my hygienist was amazed at my progress.</li>
            <li> I, for one, won&#x27;t be buying any more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> in spite of using the periogen and xylitol, i suspect that the tartar below my gumline that neither of them can get to because of having no pockets might continue to grow like a coral in ocean waters, so under the gumline it may just keep getting more massive, just a guess.  </li>
            <li> This product claims to prevent and treat gum disease and combat plaque and tartar buildup, both drug claims under the Federal Food and Drug Act and regulated as such in any reputable oral hygiene product.</li>
            <li> She was interested because she had never heard of the oral rinse product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the water pik you will be able to get this periogen deep in gum line and dissolve tartar build up.</li>
            <li> Started using the rinse and tooth pick as explained recently by an Amazon reviewer (most explicit and helpful...</li>
            <li> This product is the first I have seen than addresses that issue.</li>
            <li> exactly once.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;No con to using this product holds a candle to the peace of mind in knowing that my gums are ok, that my teeth aren&#x27;t going to fall out anymore, and that the only dental cost I will have going forward are my biannual cleanings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;No con to using this product holds a candle to the peace of mind in knowing that my gums are ok, that my teeth aren&#x27;t going to fall out anymore, and that the only dental cost I will have going forward are my biannual cleanings.  </li>
            <li> When I first came across this product I was intriqued.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week now since I first tried the product.</li>
            <li> The water pik does the same thing but is more concentrated with the detachable nozzles I call them.</li>
            <li> I have to say that after the first use of the Periogen product though my teeth did feel like I had just gotten out of the hygenist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Soooo if you bleed...for any reason, bacteria is more likely to get in.  </li>
            <li> First, I followed the instructions and added this to my WaterPik Water Flosser.</li>
            <li> began researching this product because I was interested in using it on my dog.  </li>
            <li> I would love to have the patent number for further research.  </li>
            <li> The first week my gums bled and were sore.</li>
            <li> Bought the first bottle to try it out.</li>
            <li> After the first exam (after using for a month or so and not every day) she was amazed.</li>
            <li> I have had a prolonged condition which has kept me bedridden through many surgeries over several years.</li>
            <li> This really works but TOO PRICEY!</li>
            <li> I used this product daily for six months and more and then followed up with waterpik every day and periogen about once a week.</li>
            <li> Used with the water flosser, this product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with the rinse..</li>
            <li> I used this consistently, and my dentist didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> However, I had not gone to the dentist in ages, probably four years or more, so I did have a noticeable amount of tartar, especially on the bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had severe plaque forming on my teeth and got really scared!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have any issues per say, but I just wanted to be a more responsible adult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a heavy coffee drinker, I always need a good dental cleaning every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Dr. Keyes&#x27; most significant professional achievement was reportedly in regard to the formation of caries, and if there was a nomination it would likely have been in this arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in a water pick, I just use it in a cup with warm water and swish with it every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that, as far as I&#x27;ve researched so far, periogen is a safe, effective way to combat tartar buildup, gingivitis/gum-pockets/gum-inflammation, among others.  </li>
            <li> I have big teeth and even though I have good dental hygiene and brush and floss regularly, I still get tartar buildup.  </li>
            <li> At night, Brush as usual, Waterpik with full tank of warm water (just water) at max speed (10).</li>
            <li> I probably would be a little more entusiatistic about this product because you can tell it&#x27;s trying to do something, but the price is completely over the top and a rip off.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t say anything positive.  </li>
            <li> My opinion; this pretty much sums up the efficacy of the product.</li>
            <li> I had some minor bleeding before I started the Periogen, a sure sign of some gingivitis going on.</li>
            <li> I tried this first, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> I have a family member who has the same issue, only with more advanced gum disease.</li>
            <li> far I give it 5 starts, let&#x27;s see how it goes in the upcoming weeks as I plan to go through a full 90 days of Periogen.</li>
            <li> I squirted a couple of teaspoons into my waterpik along with about 1/3 a tank of warm water and used the pik pocket tip to force the solution down into the areas below the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Works great -- just a small spoonful in a small glass of warm water -- really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use about 12ozs of warm water in the WaterPik along with a scoop and a half of the Periogen  almost every night before bed (sometimes I miss a night or two) and after brushing my teeth with Biotene.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s the Periogen</li>
            <li> I do use the Watts- large syringe oral Irrigators because I couldn&#x27;t affored the waterpik.</li>
            <li> I got smart and turned to the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical before purchasing this product, but i&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Periogen had a very acid PH in the 3 range, strong enough to harm the tooth enamel like lemon juice will.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting some kind of miracle but a little improvement.  </li>
            <li> I love the feeling right after using the water pik as it makes my gums feel tight against my teeth.</li>
            <li> She said for just having my braces off my gums looked amazing, still a few problems but way better than expected.</li>
            <li> really cannot say it did anything and used it as directed with a water flosser</li>
            <li> Thanks Periogen.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really give a hoot what any dentist has to say.</li>
            <li> Anyway, upon some research it looked like periogen was one of the promising products in the market, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> My prayer is, it really works as they say &amp; reverses the receding gums problem I inherited from my grandmother &amp; her ancestors.  </li>
            <li> Also my teeth are much wider now.</li>
            <li> Plus the stains that were there, were much easier to take off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have that much tarter built up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this the whole time and still no results.</li>
            <li> If something existed that really got rid of tartar without a visit to the dentist and worked</li>
            <li> very gradually.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use the plastic scoop that comes with it because this is to make one cup of solution to use with an oral irrigator, which is way too much for swishing around in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not take much powder, so</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t use it like I should</li>
            <li> I removed as much plaque with a dental probe (see [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone I know who hasn&#x27;t been to a dentist in 10 years and had so much tartar on his teeth.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for him and he was astounded on how much it is removing.  </li>
            <li> Cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Also would dip my toothbrush in and use it straight out of the bottle and apply to those problem areas.</li>
            <li> this product really works.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, I REALLY wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> Arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> This product really work, but you have to use it with a water pik.  </li>
            <li> I think I paid $.78 for the bottle of hydrogen peroxide so you can see it is also a real money saver.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem to do much.</li>
            <li> I had so much tartar and infection beneath the surface of my gumline that my roots were deteriorating.  </li>
            <li> I am a real person and this is my story.  </li>
            <li> I am a real person and this is my story.  </li>
            <li> This will do absolutely nothing to remove tarter.</li>
            <li> Gums have way better color, not the desired pink but getting closer&lt;</li>
            <li> This product really has done wonders for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Periogen really is working for me.  </li>
            <li> The product, when used with the Waterpik WP100 really does seem to reduce swollen gums and reduce plaque.</li>
            <li> AND THE PLAQUE AROUND MY GUMS FEELS  MUCH LOOSER TO REMOVE WIH MY FLOSSER</li>
            <li> (it really did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I started to recover from the  treatment I noticed I could not see where it had removed much of the tartar(if any).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> this product really works at keeping tartar under control</li>
            <li> This really worked the strengthen my teeth as well as soften the plaque.</li>
            <li> It was noticeable to me, but probably not so much to someone standing in front of me at conversation distance.  </li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t stand a dental hygienist scraping tartar off my teeth --</li>
            <li> Having some force behind the water is best -- i.e. a waterpik vs. simply swishing.</li>
            <li> For the cost of a couple pounds of coffee, or gasoline saved by riding my bicycle more to run local erands, I can avoid far larger dental bills and have far better health.</li>

            <li> I want to suggest that anyone considering purchasing this product, which is presently selling for roughly 10USD an ounce, (although it appears to be made up of common and cheap ingredients) do their own research and draw their own conclusions, but here are the things I think I have learned.</li>
            <li> I thought it was easier to clean my own tartar instead of being judged by a dentist on my poor dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Ended up with more cavities like other users said.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this back in January of 2012.  </li>
            <li> Today I went for my clean and the last 2 years</li>
            <li> I also have a WaterPik but find the small amount of water (1 cup) goes by too fast, so I use the WaterPik with warm water after the rinse.  </li>
            <li> No deep cleaning needed, just the normal 15 mintues of light scraping</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s supposed to work in the long term, I&#x27;ve noticed huge improvements after just one week of usage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Periogen 3 times/day for a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually put it in between 9-12 ounces of warm water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As directed, I used 2 &amp;#34;scoops&amp;#34; of product in a full reservoir of water, twice daily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any huge visual difference, but I&#x27;m not a dental professional.</li>
            <li> So the Periogen may be better for long-term use since it has much less taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have a mild tartar formation in the back of my teeth  </li>
            <li> After using it for only a short period of time I went and saw my dentist who said my gums were looking better.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give myself at least 90 days to work with the Waterpik and Periogen, to see how much of an improvement I could make on my own before I went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> My last cleaning was quick and painless.  </li>
            <li> so researched many patents on such products with similar or also identical ingredients.</li>
            <li> I flossed it diligently every day and the gum around the crown remained super red and irritated and nothing seemed to improve it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be very interested to see what they say at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> Make sure to mix the periogen powder in a small cup of warm water, and let it set for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so high reading the product description.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for defeating tartar.  </li>
            <li> Bleeding was still high at cleaning but not when I&#x27;m brushing or flossing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with Periogen and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Periogen.</li>
            <li> However, further research has indicated that certain products are used consistently in the dental industry to prevent tartar buildup.  </li>
            <li> (Other oils have too strong a taste).</li>
            <li> She gives me a choice of either that new method or the older.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The owners were very gracious and gave me a complete tour.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I know it said to repeat as many times as necessary, but nothing really happened and I decided to go back to my old trusty tartar scaler and pick after a week and scrape it off the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> I left that spot pretty much alone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;ll be interested to see how much time the Dental Hygenist spends on tartar during my next visit.  </li>
            <li> it does fizz a lot, the first time I used it the fizzing was so loud and unexpected</li>
            <li> I have been able to control trouble spots and I see tartar come and go,</li>
            <li> then I think it would be O.K. to mix in with whatever solution one normally uses in their WaterPik</li>
            <li> It is a good product not great.</li>
            <li> I used a little more than was recommended a little more frequently than was recommended.  </li>
            <li> My specific problem area has been around a crown that just never healed right.</li>
            <li> The heading above is exactly right.  </li>
            <li> The best way to achieve this is proper brushing, flossing, water irrigation and an oral rinse- DAILY, and regular dental cleanings and exams (at least 2x/ year).</li>
            <li> that seems to have reattached and is still loose but not nearly as bad as before I began using this product.</li>
            <li> I lucked out because I live in San Diego and Periogen was 4 miles from my beach apartment.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for 8 days, twice per day with my new waterpik.</li>
            <li> New info you might want to know though.</li>
            <li> The IS a noticeable non-build-up of new additional tartar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it in conjunction with a new Water PiK I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, new.</li>
            <li> but i saw its amazing results on my Cat&#x27;s tartar becuase mine was hard to get out because it was an old tartar</li>
            <li> Sadly, now my teeth are too stain free and healthy looking for there to be a before picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Inflammation, and particularly the inflamed gums that accompany gum disease, have far stronger links to heart disease than cholesterol.</li>
            <li> Within 4 weeks there was a vast improvement and within  3 months my gums were their healthy pink self again.</li>
            <li> They are very professional and try to build their business one customer at a time.</li>
            <li> All it really seemed to do is make your teeth feel a bit cleaner than usual, kind of like brushing for a really long time, but didn&#x27;t do anything to the visible tartar on my lower teeth.</li>
            <li> I actually saw some improvement in the first week of using Periogen.</li>
            <li> But i have receding gums on my bottom row due to having braces for over 7 years, which caused me to not be able to brush properly on the bottom row.</li>
            <li> Sunflower and sesame oil were apparently used as mouthwashes in India before the availability of modern chemical mouthwashes like Listerine.  </li>
            <li> Helps significantly with the irritation my lower front teeth get due to a permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> or maybe I am just more lazy in my treatment regiment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> our gums are pink, no pockets, no sensitivity and our breath has a clean, neutral smell, if not a slightly sweet smell, which one would expect when the oral cavity is free from organized anerobic bacteria.</li>
            <li> The Periogen Deep Cleaning Oral Rinse really does a decent job of whitening teeth.</li>
            <li> the progress continues steadily but more slowly now.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it is meant to replace a solid foundation of consistent brushing/flossing/appointments, but it has specifically helped me fight the tartar accumulation between professional cleanings.  </li>
            <li> Dissolving a Tums tablet in your mouth periodically during the day would likely do much more tomaintain a favorable average oral pH, and will provide your body with calcium in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The concept of this regimen was reportedly greeted with some controversy, but there were reportedly also positive indicators in the short term studies.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it for whiter, cleaner teeth with no more sensitivity or light occasional bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was pretty mild tartar, but now I have slick enamel</li>
            <li> the waterpic is an excellant tool and you should own and use one after everything you eat, using just plain old water to flush out the pockets, but the periogen lasts a vary long time when using the syringe instead of using the waterpic.</li>
            <li> it is even more expensive and way less effective than just going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s so stuck together in it&#x27;s plastic jar I have to chop at it with an ice pick every night to get the top surface to break into enough semi-powder to fill one little scoop, I guess it picks up moisture just from the air after it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> After 8 days, I knew it was working because I could see the spaces between my teeth, and feel every tooth surface and crevice, much the same as what it feels like after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Using this product with a regular waterpik really turned my mouth around after using it for three weeks twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> so far i dont see any tartar dissolved (yes i use it correctly)</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week now, so don&#x27;t have much to share yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any bleeding whatsoever or any sensitive areas as well.  </li>
            <li> But Periogen still made a difference after a week which I was surprised to see.</li>
            <li> Near the end of my use I was scheduled to visit my Periodontist.  </li>
            <li> far... I&#x27;m not as amazed as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Results are a direct result of time x efficiency.</li>
            <li> The bleeding has completely stopped since using the Periogen.</li>
            <li> Had to set the Waterpik on the lowest because my pockets were rather sensitive.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m 43 now  and decided to suck it up and go for x rays with a practice that offers sedation.</li>
            <li> As to where I can&#x27;t speak of its oral hygiene, I use the product every day and my teeth are considerably whiter.</li>
            <li> After losing one tooth to the neglect of not having my teeth professionally cleaned at age 55</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see all that much difference in the decrease of tartar possibly using it longer</li>
            <li> because I use to bleed from my gums like every 20minutes, or when I would lick my teeth but so far that hasn&#x27;t happens.</li>
            <li> Wow, Works as described.</li>
            <li> published?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished some dental professional would take a close look at this product.is &amp;#62;1,000</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fluoride salts are used to enhance the strength of teeth by the formation of fluorapatite, a naturally occurring component of tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen its effect.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li> Expecting to see real improvement in oral health by next dentist exam.  </li>
            <li> In spite of this, I shelled out for 3 bottles, and followed the instructions diligently, never missing a treatment.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my gingivitis completely.  </li>
            <li> there was considerable tarter below the gum line, but no pockets.  </li>
            <li> a bit of progress so far, just not that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is working  so far  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the stuff caused the waterpik problem or not as the unit is fairly old.  </li>
            <li> It could be a case of old age and may not be the hydrogen</li>
            <li> I did not notice much in the way of deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> I hypothesize that they were so deep that nothing I was doing at the time could really help.  </li>
            <li> results so far are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have started using it, but it&#x27;s too early to tell yet if its working as I hope it will.</li>
            <li> and it makes my gums ache or sensitive.</li>
            <li> I realized that all of the money I had spent on Periogen at $25.00 a bottle could have been spent on two professional cleanings per year by a competent dental professional.  </li>
            <li> Between cleanings, and just before a professional cleaning, this loosens plaque and tartar like nothing else.</li>
            <li> two of my teeth had been bleeding before I started to use this product and stopped bleeding completely even with an oral pic brush.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> I have seen a marked improvement, and my gums and teeth just feel cleaner and look healthier.  </li>
            <li> My dentist noticed an improvement in my early periodontal disease as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this rinse to children over 12 years old and adults.  </li>
            <li> It is worth noting that Dr. Keyes expected that the patient would be working with a dentist.  </li>
            <li> It is also worth noting that this seems to have been intended as a therapy for existing disease, possibly in combination with short term use of antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> I have actually forgotten to keep using it, mostly because I&#x27;ve tried other products like ACT restoring mouthwash to try and remineralize my enamel (can&#x27;t grow it back), but I might start using this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go there and be told I needed a deep cleaning; or for them to mess with my teeth when my gums were swollen and easy to get</li>
            <li> Even so, I am definitely seeing a difference, enough so that I purchased a refill two-pack before my first bottle ran out.</li>
            <li> then I took my time and went into each gum pocket (mine are small at 3 to 4 at the most) and I could feel the combination of the Periogen and the WaterPik seemed to perform a DEEP CLEANING these pockets!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this product, along with the Water Pik for proper application.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use until the bottle is gone (might as well, I paid a ridiculous amount of money for it) and will update with something more positive if by chance I haven&#x27;t given it enough time to work properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I filled up two identical, small glass jars with lids with water.</li>
            <li> I really like using the Periogen powder in my Waterpik because I don&#x27;t have to spend as long flossing my teeth</li>
            <li> Yeah, yuck bitter taste but was willing to give it a whirl for any results.</li>
            <li> But I had just lost my first adult tooth due to tooth decay</li>
            <li> To make this product work better, apparently you need to up the amount of fluoride considerably, which has negative consequences, especially if you swallow the solution.  </li>
            <li> A small blue plastic scoop is included in the bottle; this amount nearly equals 1/4 teaspoon of standard measuring spoons, perhaps slightly more.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t know how to review this product since it&#x27;s only one part of a new oral hygiene regime I have started.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because I have periodontal disease and it really affected me when I started having a gum infection in my upper back molars.  </li>
            <li> It is nearly tasteless - kind of salty/sweet, depending on how much you put in the water.  </li>
            <li> My gums haven&#x27;t bled since the first month or so on Periogen and none of my other teeth are showing any signs of tooth decay.</li>
            <li> Most of it is small amounts near the gum line, but between the center two teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting one scoop (the little blue scoop in the bottle) into a half coffee-mug of warm water and then swishing it my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If your on the fence on trying it, particularly if dental insurance is not affordable to you or if like me you find the dentist chair most uncomfortable then there seems there isn&#x27;t that much to lose and a lot to gain, especially with the money back</li>
            <li> With the tartar on the affected teeth forming a new line, extending down perhaps as much as 5-10% from the gumline.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Anyway the feeling after using the Periogen made my teeth feel slick and clean.</li>
            <li> First of all the active ingredients are: Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Tripolyphosphate, Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate and Citric Acid along with Sodium Fluoride .04%</li>
            <li> But the gum line behind the teeth on the lower front ((which was my major concern) seems to have receded even more.</li>
            <li> Periogen is a must to keep my gums healthy, tight and with pockets of 4 or less.  </li>
            <li> My teeth in general feel smoother and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I generally use the amount of time in the Dental chair for cleaning to give me an idea</li>
            <li> I only get after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since yesterday, I have brushed 3 times and my tooth bleeding has completely vanished.</li>
            <li> This tooth was almost completely knocked out but through oral surgery put back in position with the warning that it would eventually be lost.  </li>
            <li> am only 22 years old.</li>
            <li> Perhaps those experiencing results used it while the tartar was still soft or maybe they don&#x27;t even know what tartar actually is.</li>
            <li> In desperation I finally scheduled an appointment with a professional dental hygienist and had my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though my teeth look nice, I can tell I am in the starting stages of periodontal disease, behind the lower front teeth especially, bleeding gums, receding gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took the tarter right off my teeth after as little as a week.</li>
            <li> So far, my gums feel slightly healthier but I can&#x27;t really tell if it is periogen or the waterpik itself.</li>
            <li> There may have been some of the tarter that was dissolved due to the process, but I did not notice any real change.  </li>
            <li> other reviews are very misleading and frankly uninformed (focusing on baking soda or other ingredients that probably have absolutely nothing to do with the way the product works).  </li>
            <li> he also said that not a single tooth bled when he cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li> So in short it works but it is also kind of scary.</li>
            <li> I found no other product that claimed to remove tartar (They have the only product that has ever been found to work?</li>
            <li> Put this down to beginner&#x27;s luck and resolved not to write a review before being certain not to mislead anyone.</li>
            <li> The Periogen success continues: I just had another routine exam/cleaning and my dentist said he found very little build-up on my teeth.</li>
            <li> the advertisement years ago, when an exuberant child emerges from the dentist, grinning because of &amp;#34;No cavities&amp;#34; I felt the same pride and satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I was scared of dentists and ended up believing in the false promises of this company due to my own lack of confidence.</li>
            <li> Makes it super hard to floss well in that spot and this helps reduce the tartar and inflammation.</li>
            <li> The new sand (it&#x27;s not really sand</li>
            <li> She noted that my teeth were much cleaner than in previous visits.</li>
            <li> I have hope for the first time since I was 15, when my stupid birth mother had the dentist pull 6 of my baby teeth daily for 4 consecutive days because they had not come out on their own yet.  </li>
            <li> its just using the waterpik on high and some of the other products I bought actually doing the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before my dental hygienist began working on my teeth, I asked her to pay special attention to tartar build up so that she could determine if there was less during this visit (as compared with my previous appointment three months ago).</li>
            <li> also haven&#x27;t seen a dentist since i was about 15 years old or so due to financial reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All had decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> Its not very old, certainly not a year old as claimed in the \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture.</li>
            <li> My one problem area is the back of my front, lower teeth, which I understand is pretty common.    </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea if this really did anything, and it&#x27;s super expensive.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased my second bottle as it last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B 3D Excel electric toothbrush for just as long, as well as having a borderline psychotic flossing routine and about 3 months ago I switched from Crest to Squigle xylitol toothpaste, which I LOVE and also reviewed about a month ago .</li>
            <li> Then after using the product a couple times, I went back and re-read the reviews, as well as the company&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science behind Periogen is more than a little on the skimpy side.  </li>
            <li> And for the life of me, reading the ingredients, I can&#x27;t see why this small bottle costs so much.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole bottle but cannot see any improvement in my excessive tarter buildup.</li>
            <li> Long story short, it works --</li>
            <li> Long story short...</li>
            <li> AND the person doing the cleaning doesn&#x27;t know how to use the disinfectants correctly and so do not leave the solutions on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; long enough to disinfect the surfaces.</li>
            <li> Furthermore,this nomination is supposed to have occurred 56 years ago, and was therefore apparently not for this product or the research or theories of this product.  </li>
            <li> Patent protection is given in exchange for revealing the fundamental details of an invention in the belief that such an exchange furthers progress in the long run.  </li>
            <li> , it is expensive, but if you are just going to swish it rather than use an oral irrigator, you only need to use a tiny amount of the powder (just a pinch) dissolved in a small amount of warm water to make enough to swish around.</li>
            <li> C6H8O7.&lt;br /&gt;It is a natural preservative/conservative and is also used to add an acidic or sour taste to foods and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Am only sorry it will gradually put all those sweet hygenist teeth cleaning ladies out of work (here in Switzerland they are hired in Canada because they do such a great -tho very expensive- job!</li>
            <li> Frequently they just wipe down the tops of things but not the sides, not the arm rests and so on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is suggested that although the ingredient list has been shared with you in the product description, there is (apparently) some magic ratio of ingredients, which if altered, even slightly, will render the formula useless.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product (the 3-pack) due to major tartar issues that are affecting my gum.</li>
            <li> I am due to go back in a few weeks for a cleaning and believe that I will received a MUCH IMPROVED DENTAL report from my dentist and</li>
            <li> noted.[1] Salts of polyphosphate anions are moderately irritating to skin and mucous membrane because they are mildly alkaline.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am also regularly using xylitol to kill bacteria that causes plaque that turns to tarter and causes cavities to ensure that no new tartar forms.  </li>
            <li> You have nothing to loose by trying this product as I believe that they offer a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I spent the summer with 4 permanent teeth, sucking everything thru a straw, being driven wild with itchy inflamed swollen gums - &amp; the taunts of other kids.  </li>
            <li> will note that I know other people who have seen similar effects using \\&quot;oil swishing\\&quot; (or called \\&quot;oil pulling\\&quot; in India) where you swish with sunflower oil for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have gum disease and have cleanings every three months lasting a solid hour due to plaque and tartar.  </li>
            <li> It does other things too, I have a cracked tooth that gets sensitive to cold sometimes, the dentist filled it but the tiny crack is still there.</li>
            <li> However, as I continued to use it over the course of a year it became apparent that it really wasn&#x27;t removing calculus or getting at the really tough stains like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> Mix two tablespoons of baking soda (or, for people with high blood pressure, Epsom salts) with enough hydrogen peroxide to form a thick</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s where I really believe this product shines - at least for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that Dr. Keyes had in fact developed the underlying concept used in this product late in his career, but he apparently did not do a lot of research on it, reportedly stating that he didn&#x27;t have time to do long term research.  </li>
            <li> (there may be other non-published applications, but they won&#x27;t show up in a general search), one in June 2008, and the other in June 2011, by the same applicant, who I suppose is the company&#x27;s owner or chief scientist or some executive.  </li>
            <li> esperience is that my gums are healthier (pink versus inflamed red) and that my tartar is being dissolved.  </li>
            <li> I had begun to have some receding gums which I let go for too long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how I got by without one for so long.  </li>
            <li> I still have baby teeth that I need to preserve as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Will continue using this for as long as it does its job.</li>
            <li> Finally, after about three months, I opened both jars up, carefully drained the water, and felt the consistency of both sets of tartar chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the next morning when I went to empty and refresh the waterpik the water tank had etched and fused to the waterpik .After</li>
            <li> If Dr. Keyes is living, and if he in fact endorsed this product, we have no idea if he was compensated for the endorsement, or if, at age 97, he still has the mental acuity and currency of expertise to make such an endorsement meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dissolved 1 heaping spoonfull of Periogen into one 6 oz glass of water and swished, and rinsed for a long time every morning.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used these on and off for a while, with no clear indication whether it was working or not.</li>
            <li> But the pH of a rinse such as this would not be expected to have any long term effect on ambient oral pH.  </li>
            <li> After all these months of periogen the tartar is clearly not dissolved.</li>
            <li> And I was tired of dealing with the tartar, the excessive brushing and flossing every day with detail attention to exact angles, and a condescending attitude from dental hygienists that implied I must somehow not be doing what I said, or being really bad it despite my ability to demonstrate the technique in my efforts to make sure I got it right.</li>
            <li> but I also started using other products at the same time which also reduce tartar and prevent it&#x27;s buildup.  </li>
            <li> Years later I still have a little bit left.  </li>
            <li> Just use it daily or every other day, It might take longer but it works</li>
            <li> Has a very strange scent like that CLR stuff for limescale.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been to a dentist in a very long time</li>
            <li> i have resumed using periogen in the water pik, hoping it will make the second and final round in the hygienist chair easier.crumbly</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s doing a little preventive but not yet apparently reducing existing tartar.</li>
            <li> Now I can go a single time per year and the dentist was amazed by the change in my gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me i&#x27;d need to undergo an expensive procedure where they rip your gums down, scrape everything clean, then sew your gums back together.  </li>
            <li> Periogen and the sunflower oil apparently dissolve the plaque to some extent and, over a few weeks use, even some of the hardened tartar on the teeth and at the gum line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a front tooth with a pus pocket, loose teeth, and tender gums that bleed eating bread.</li>
            <li> My teeth then started feeling loose and I was panicking.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of continued use, I saw the tarter breaking down that had formed on my teeth, and combined with regular flossing and brushing, my teeth and gums are healthier!</li>
            <li> Placebo or not, for now it is FACT, that without scraping or a dental visit, big red swollen throbbing bleeding painful gums around my molars have deflated, are light pink, don&#x27;t bleed, and don&#x27;t hurt one bit.  </li>
            <li> For less than 3 dollars I could get some Arm &amp; Hammer and lemon juice and mix it with some toothpaste and produce the same results.</li>
            <li> NOT MAIN LINE DENTISTRY BUT HOLISTIC APPROACH.</li>
            <li> The entire cleaning procedure took less than thirty minutes, and once again, measurements of 2/3 all around.</li>
            <li> i use other dental and mouth wash products and saw no VAST improvements using this than using just the other stuff.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but given the potential payoff, I was willing to invest in a bottle to test it.</li>
            <li> The second week less.</li>
            <li> It felt kinda like a fine sand stabbing away at my gums.</li>
            <li> My gums had gotten so bad that sometimes I could feel the blood pumping through them, a sure sign of infection.  </li>
            <li> and things are even better; I am truly shocked thatthis works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a no brainer for the consumer.  </li>
            <li> but now after 8 days of using Periogen my gums seem to be clearing up (turning pink)     </li>
            <li> I HAVE SPENT A FORTUNE</li>
            <li> The instructions say \\&quot;for aged and tenacious tartar use 2 scoops twice a day\\</li>
            <li> There are a few chemicals used, but they all have similar names.  </li>
            <li> used a dental pick to carefully chip out the biggest chips of tartar I could yield</li>
            <li> I used it in a waterpik for about a week and tartar did come off easier,but one night I forgot to empty the waterpik</li>
            <li> This means that the (softer) plaque didn&#x27;t get a chance to turn into the (harder) tartar, which the hygienist has to remove.</li>
            <li> Also initially i had some trouble wielding the 90 degree pik pocket attachment for the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> After using for a few days the plaque starting disintegrating.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s kick gum disease one person at a time!nd (it&#x27;s not really sand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moving on from the Dr. Keyes material, there are some things in the product description, and in some of the comments left in reply to angainor&#x27;s review which trouble me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also alot of flaky reviews after someone has only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions but it seems like a waste of time - especially since this item is rather pricey.</li>
            <li> I did take the trouble to do a brief patent search, but found nothing which seemed to remotely resemble this product.  </li>
            <li> It becomes obvious when you look at their other reviews: half the time they don&#x27;t have any other reviews.  </li>
            <li> definitely agree with some of the other reviewers on here, that using it might take a little bit of time if you think about what it is doing.  </li>
            <li> I was completely wrong and eventually did the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As part of my treatment I have had to take medications which have caused dry mouth and cavities with the appearance of dark brown tartar at the gumline.</li>
            <li> I will say my mouth felt really clean, but when I visited my dentist, I got a cold dose of reality.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to be careful with the flossing and such</li>
            <li> thats very little time to determine whether or not its actually working    </li>
            <li> I had my regular visit and there was very little for the hygienist to remove.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using the Periogen and the other products that in combination to this point have caused the reduction of tartar.  </li>
            <li> First of all, beware of all the fake comments.</li>
            <li> Now I just use it to control the Tartar on my teeth, so I maybe use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Usually I’m being told I’m not doing enough to help my gums.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have gum bleeding after brushing or other waterpik appliance use; the itching is gone - I&#x27;ve had that for something like 40 years..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m due to see the Hygenist in about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> post this review on the other products, and update after another 2 or so weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Periogen once a day with a Waterpic and the Waterpic pocket tool I use every other day.</li>
            <li> Try it or try the other products that help control tartar as well.  </li>
            <li> Other areas have also tightened up and are now normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviews I read before purchase talked about tarter peeling off your teeth.</li>
            <li> I continued my usual routine of going around all the gum line of the upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li> Keyes was apparently a staffer at the NIDR (National Institute of Dental Research), however, at least in my searches, I found no evidence that he had been its director.  </li>
            <li> Believe this is due in part to the citric acid.</li>
            <li> It would seem the tartar which came back in extremely small amounts has been harderto deal with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it and research other things to put in my WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> I think it works very slow as a mouth wash and would only recommend it for keeping plaque from coming back.</li>
            <li> Based on my previous review of the product, I expected some beneficial results.  </li>
            <li> just an average amount (I imagine) -- nor do I have cavities or other dental problems.  </li>
            <li> For the past few months I&#x27;ve continued daily brushing and flossing as usual, but then began daily use of Periogen in my WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, while flossing, the large piece of tartar behind my bottom front tooth flew out of my mouth!</li>
            <li> Product worked well; my pockets are now less than 3 millimeters due to the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> For some reason the ingredients were hard to find anywhere on the net, so here they are for a reference.  </li>
            <li> There are products that DO decrease the bacteria such as Chlorhexadine rinse, without compromising hard structures in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t comfortable, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad, either.  </li>
            <li> Well if it is useless, I guess it doesn&#x27;t help much to realize that after spending 100 bucks and wasting all that time.</li>
            <li> The past few days I stopped using this product and started &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34; and after just a couple of days, my gums started healing and the tarter on the back of my teeth is softening.  </li>
            <li> and I must conclude that it is not really worth the price one pays for it.  </li>
            <li> A lot of seeding their remarks with reasons why a customer has to be very patient and go through a lot of bottles of unbelievably expensive product before they can even think about claiming it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> , I dont think it would work as well without the force and percision to help it direct the mix where the tarter is worse for</li>
            <li> At 55 have watched gums recede irrevocably...a slow but seemingly definite calamity!</li>
            <li> While the product did not work for me you should still take into consideration that the company does stand behind their product and offers this guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t discover this product years ago as it has been a struggle to keep my teeth and gums healthy since I hate going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Using periogen and a water pik and pik pocket extension, I&#x27;m starting to see a slow shift.</li>
            <li> AND THE  INFLAMATION IS DOWN.</li>
            <li> am now down to once a day for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tartar build-up didn&#x27;t happen over night, and it makes sense that stripping it down is going to take some time as well.  </li>
            <li> and I set them down to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed after 4 days of use that the hold pressure button on the handle of my waterpik became stuck in the down position after I press it while under pressure</li>
            <li> When I use Periogen for a time, the sensitivity diminishes alot, down to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> Also, had a bottom front tooth that has been loose for several years (and getting worse as time went by)</li>
            <li> other stuff helps, and I would reccomend them all, but I think this periogen is the heavy artillery out of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a money back guarantee which they take seriously.</li>
            <li> dentists will not like this, as it will give them less business.</li>
            <li> that spot was tartar and the redness probably had nothing to do with the previous injury.  </li>
            <li> how well I have taken care of my teeth during the previous 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hygienist compared my existing condition with information recorded from previous visits</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about a month and a half, I do believe the Parogen Plaque and Tartar Dissoving Oral Rinse is workng.</li>
            <li> I am seeng much less residue on my teeth.</li>
            <li> have less then half of the plauque</li>
            <li> I had used plaque disclosing tablets from the dentist previously, and now I have less plaque and tartar showing up with the tablets.</li>
            <li> (Or has it slowed because I&#x27;m lazier and don&#x27;t do the rinse 2x per day as previously?)</li>
            <li> After one day the redness was less and the pain was gone.  </li>
            <li> blasting method is quicker and a lot less messier I find.</li>
            <li> blasting method is quicker and a lot less messier I find.</li>
            <li> Black spots started decreasing in size after 7th or 8th use.</li>
            <li> Tartar is less visible.</li>
            <li> But then Periogen becomes a drug, and is subject to a lot closer monitoring by the FDA.  </li>
            <li> This is a game changer because THERE IS NO OTHER PRODUCT OUT THERE</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean, a bottle lasts me well over one and a half months which is affordable for what it gives back, that being no continuous trips to the dentist for those god awful scraping sessions and the hefty bills after.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a professional cleaning every six months without fail for at least the last 30 years.  </li>
            <li> When keep using for a while cold and hot water gives toothaches..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical, but figured that, unless it does harm (I found no reports of that), my wallet can take a $30 gamble while I test something new and supposedly revolutionary.  </li>
            <li> only use a very small amount of water and 1/2 or less of the included small spoon.</li>
            <li> It was bad enough that I had the antibiotic insert, which only made a minor difference.</li>
            <li> I tried other products in the past but none of them worked in comparison to this product.</li>
            <li> [I visit the Periodontist every six months] and indicated that there was no significant</li>
            <li> it scared me a little.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of plaque on my bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li> Some people suggest also adding a little bit of Listerine to the oil to kill the oral bacteria.</li>
            <li> Also my bleeding gums have stopped a little bit,</li>
            <li> I also have seen the tar on my teeth has been going away little buy little.</li>
            <li> Works, but some of the ingredients are a little sketchy,look them up.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my gum line was started to receed a little bit</li>
            <li> We use a little baking soda now in the water pik and works well and alot cheaper than this product...</li>
            <li> I began with two of the little scoops in my water pik appliance.</li>
            <li> I keep a record in one of those little memo books on my dresser.</li>
            <li> was having slight gum tenderness and very slight bleeding in a couple spots when I flossed.  </li>
            <li> Will update this review in a few months.  </li>
            <li> Periogen saves me all the trouble.</li>
            <li> Had trouble sleeping that night because I grind my teeth and woke me up.</li>
            <li> since I just had my teeth debridement a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I notice Periogen&#x27;s few ingredients contain 2 phosphates known as detergents.</li>
            <li> The hygienist did not mention any heavy plaque build up</li>
            <li> It does nothing but waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but neither is a dentist.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> These chemicals release the ionic bond of calcium salts (dead, calcified dental plaque, aka dead bacteria) that attach to the dental enamel.  </li>
            <li> I am continuing with the Periogen and the tip a few times a week and do not see any buildup at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i gave it a few months to work.  </li>
            <li> Do your research, don&#x27;t believe the fake 5-star reviews these con-men have planted all over the web, and stay away from this FDA enforcement action waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> lets see what it will be in a few months</li>
            <li> Very painful as they had to stop and inject more Novacaine twice during the treatment.</li>
            <li> Given my already psychotic phobia of the dentists&#x27; chair, the last thing in the world I could tolerate is someone digging into my painful/tender gum line with a sharp implement.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is just plain junk.  </li>
            <li> The only way tartar can be removed is by having a dental professional scape it off or a periodontist performing gum surgery, which is expensive, painful and often brings mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sunflower oil, though it has a mild taste, still isn&#x27;t tasteless, and some people may get tired of the taste using it often.  </li>
            <li> only problem I have is that I&#x27;ve developed an annoying habit of licking my front teeth as a person would do immediately after an office cleaning.</li>
            <li> Too small of a bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> , even the small spots haven&#x27;t changed a bit.</li>
            <li> Okay, lemme start by stating that I have a HORRIBLE fear of the dental chair and all the anti-perks that stroll along with it.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product works,&lt;br /&gt;maybe</li>
            <li> I anxiously awaited the results of my periodontal check and ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product works.</li>
            <li> No more pain waking me up during the night or after eating.  </li>
            <li> Usually the probing for pocket depth made my gums bleed.  </li>
            <li> Morning after breakfast, brush as usual and rinse with Listerine</li>
            <li> After lunch, brush as usual and rinse with Listerine</li>
            <li> No more bleeding gums (I used to bleed on</li>
            <li> I can always tell too if I&#x27;m past a week because my gums will feel like they are being attacked by something and they begin to bother me.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the product is expensive at about twenty-five dollars for a three ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> The product MIGHT have some small benefit, but I see lots of smoke and mirrors in play.  </li>
            <li> My grip with Periogen is its too expensive and it looks like they raised the price since I used it last, oh well......</li>
            <li> However over time I could see small traces returning</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I would find a small piece of tarter/plaque/calculus in my mouth so it was performing just as the manufacturer said it would.</li>
            <li> If it was not opened i would be anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> So I scoured the internet in search of home remedies, just to keep the tender spots from getting worse, and hopefully to improve them to the point where I could submit to the sharp steel claw&#x27;s punishment without paralyzing anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price - a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Instead of killing off  all bacteria with an antibacterial, Periogen is dissolving my calcium phosphate (tartar) environment that the bad bacteria live on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that was a result of brushing too hard or flossing too hard or what.  </li>
            <li> my body overcompensated with the permanent teeth, which came in super-hard, hard to even drill.  </li>
            <li> I hardly had some tartar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have a hard time recommending this to anyone...especially at its price.</li>
            <li> I was saving my review after the dental trip to help others understand that Periogen does a little at a time each day!!</li>
            <li> so I have developed this really bad habit that I cannot seem to control.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say I am skeptical of some of the bad reviews on here, especially since using this for two months myself and seeing that it definitely worked, and worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So regardless of product quality, I&#x27;m not thrilled with their customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think some people who are giving this negative reviews are just using it like mouthwash and swishing it for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think using this is going to change your life, but at least it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I want to believe the reviewers here, but tartar should be tartar and if it worked at all, I should have seen at least some improvement, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> What do they all have in common?</li>
            <li> My routine is to do this cleaning once a week at the least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PLUS have you looked at doctor&#x27;s and dentist&#x27;s offices lately.</li>
            <li> In fact, I could see in my basin icky stuff coming out from my gums</li>
            <li> I was terrified to go because I found out that I&#x27;d probably need a &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; and be handed a bill for at least $500.</li>
            <li> But for me at least it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> After it had grown to cover about 50% of the tooth surface, was quite thick, and had penetrated beneath the gumline, I started to worry.</li>
            <li> some of tartar on my tooth slowly gone , I like that.</li>
            <li> Let me emphasize SLOW.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure whether it was the Periogen or the Waterpik, but the combination of the two blasted away the tartar build-up on every single tooth that was affected.  </li>
            <li> Btw, it is not a cheap product for the size of the bottle and they suggest you to use it for at least 2-3 months to see any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> but I mean when you don&#x27;t have dental insurance and want something to work until you can get the money I would say try this product.</li>
            <li> does that mean the tartar that forms on them is super-hard as well?  </li>
            <li> i mean, why buy three at a time if it doesn&#x27;t save me any money?</li>
            <li> I had a very small amount of tartar and decided to try this before going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> By now I would expect that tartar could be removed from teeth by some method less barbaric than blind, manual scraping.  </li>
            <li> As a result, the second I left my parents&#x27; house at the age of 18 I stopped going to the dentist to avoid the terrible pain.  </li>
            <li> I have such terrible tartar that if you actually look you can see it</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this online, but read others reviews and thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, it appears that this product results in de calcification of enamel and the exposed root surfaces resulting in an increase in cavities, that is not a good trade off.</li>
            <li> It is not a good alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [...] which they&#x27;ve put in a weak attempt to cover their behind from the FDA</li>
            <li> And since I hate going 3 or 4 times a year for dental cleaning, I decided to prepare so that next cleaning won&#x27;t be as long and painful in the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> The bad taste tells me I need to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> The tartar got worse and the gum started receeding.</li>
            <li> I hate people who only see dollar signs when it comes to health.    </li>
            <li> have used the maximum dosage twice a day since, and my tarter is worse than ever.</li>
            <li> but if you look at what&#x27;s in it and look at the science behind what those minerals do, it makes sense that it works.</li>
            <li> This was approximately a 10 month span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an implication that the product is based on a trade secret, but to my understanding, the concept of trade secrets and patents are antithetical.  </li>
            <li> So, which is it, patent or secret formula?  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any noticeable difference or change on my teeth</li>
            <li> (I do brush twice a day; flossing was just something I unfortunately picked up on late in the game).</li>
            <li> I figured I would give it a try, at the worst I lose 27 bucks, at the most I don&#x27;t have to see the evil hygienist, and b) half the time people that make bad comments in the reviews seem to have some weird personal vendetta with the seller or maker of a product.  </li>
            <li> (I am a bit dramatic)</li>
            <li> for those who write reviews and who say it didn&#x27;t work for them, or they had poor results, you did it wrong.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was at the beginning of the end and on a slow march to dentures.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed and a little scared to use .</li>
            <li> it is a tough situation, and i will stick with periogen for a long time to give it a chance to do the job, because the alternative is too terrible to contemplate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, In a month, my plauque/tarter has gone from painful and difficult to chip off with a scaler, to breaking off while eating hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I go to the dentist all the time to have my teeth cleaned and checked and they were unable to remove the totter on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat expensive</li>
            <li> Getting it mechanically removed would have been expensive, so I searched, found Periogen, and decided to give it a try.   </li>
            <li> I hope to not be dependable on this product because it is rather expensive, and because the idea of having detergent in my mouth not be organic, and one day phosphorous will be scarce.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptical shopper and can spot a fake review from a mile away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious of some of the reviews here, and the vague information on the product.</li>
            <li> Being a Chemical Engineer I tried to figure out what was wrong with the product</li>
            <li> I am angry that my &amp;#34;dentists&amp;#34; have never suggested this product to me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for no results that I can see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not risk your teeth or your health because some marketer is trying to convince you that buying their product will cure a progressive and complicated disease-</li>
            <li> This seems to me to be absolutely absurd, and sounds like the patter of a carnival pitch man to my ears.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was expensive</li>
            <li> Thus the Periogen people make an awful lot of money selling what&#x27;s essentially 3-ounce bottles of salt for $30</li>
            <li> I consider the product dangerous to the tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> That in itself is a DANGEROUS suggestion and places people at risk for a variety of systemic diseases including immune system disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, pancreatic and colon cancer, heart disease, and of course tooth loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are dirty.</li>
            <li> It is tasteless, and without side effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also expensive!</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was using their recommendation for bad tarter, two scoops rather then one.</li>
            <li> I think anyone that is having problems with there gums or teeth should try Periogen it does make your mouth cleaner, but if you have bad breath you might want to get an anti mouthwash which kills germs, and freshens breath.</li>
            <li> i never say product bad if it didnt work on me</li>
            <li> The dentist thought she was eating all kinds of bad food</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 2 years ago my gums were hurting so badly that I decided to go to a dentist.  </li>
            <li> Removes any plaque with ease and you should notice a difference in any tartar (hardened plaque) within a couple of uses depending on how bad it is.</li>
            <li> I would suggest being patient if it is really bad.</li>
            <li> My teeth are in bad shape</li>
            <li> I had two areas around my molars that were painful, bleeding and swollen, which I attributed to tartar buildup beneath the gum line.  </li>
            <li> But I have always been frustrated by the lack of advancements in the dental/periodontal field.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had this issue, went to the dentists which has proven to be a painful process, so that when I saw this</li>
            <li> Her dentist was shocked because she doesn&#x27;t get cavities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a laboratory scientist, but I was fairly disappointed by the results.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed that periogen is no longer offering a discount for ordering three bottles at a time, so i just ordered one bottle.  </li>
            <li> but you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> and I was VERY unhappy.</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff while looking for a scraper, for some annoying Tartar on my front lower teeth.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a bottle of this of course hoping for a miracle because I hate going to the dentist,</li>
            <li> and I read the reviews I was indeed doubtful, but I can shout it from the mountain tops</li>
            <li> I HATE flossing as my teeth are close together, so</li>
            <li> This was a horrible and painful experience, but I was told that with a strict regimen of brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash that everything would get better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated how my front lower teeth stained</li>
            <li> My result is healthier gums, fewer cavities and an opportunity to control the horrible progression of my Gum Disease.  </li>
            <li> Tasted terrible and noticed no difference</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was super skeptical before purchasing this product, but i&#x27;m happy with the results. Using this product with a regular waterpik really turned my mouth around after using it for three weeks twice a day. Due to Periogen leaving your mouth with the perfect ph balance ( pH 7.5!), my dental reminerlization products (MI Paste Plus) work much better.</li>
            <li> Very good product, my teeth feel real good after using , there was no after taste/bad taste in my mouth after use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about one month after a cleaning.  I used it for the first time about a week ago.  I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked.  I used it as a toothpaste, and then I dissolved it in fluoride and water to water pik my teeth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know yet if it works</li>
            <li> it works, period. i have no reason to lie. it worked for me and it worked for my mom. neither one of us had been to a dentist in 2 decades. we had plaque and we had tarter. between us, we saved $12,000 in laser treatments to remove the tarter. for those who write reviews and who say it didn&#x27;t work for them, or they had poor results, you did it wrong. don&#x27;t give up. call periogen and ask them, they will help you. i used the product with a syringe, not the waterpic. the waterpic is an excellant tool and you should own and use one after everything you eat, using just plain old water to flush out the pockets, but the periogen lasts a vary long time when using the syringe instead of using the waterpic. we bought a 3 pack many months ago. our gums are pink, no pockets, no sensitivity and our breath has a clean, neutral smell, if not a slightly sweet smell, which one would expect when the oral cavity is free from organized anerobic bacteria. if you have oral cavity issues and can&#x27;t afford thousands at the dentist, get the periogen, a waterpic and check out mizer5.com and get the binder from dr. nara where you will learn how to become dentally self-sufficient. we did and we couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> really cannot say it did anything and used it as directed with a water flosser</li>
            <li> Today I went for my clean and the last 2 years I never had such a good report.  I will not be without periogen.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> Periogen, as advertised, dissolves tartar.  This is a game changer because THERE IS NO OTHER PRODUCT OUT THERE THAT DISSOLVES TARTAR!  The only way tartar can be removed is by having a dental professional scape it off or a periodontist performing gum surgery, which is expensive, painful and often brings mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I learned about Periogen in January of 2012 I was optimistic because of the many excellent reviews on Amazon.  However,  I wanted to see their operation and be sure they were a &#x27;real company&#x27;  and not some mom and pop operation working about of a bedroom or storage facility.  I lucked out because I live in San Diego and Periogen was 4 miles from my beach apartment.  I visited them immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owners were very gracious and gave me a complete tour.  I was glad to see that Periogen was a &#x27;REAL COMPANY&#x27;. They had a professional Clean Room for formulating their product, a room for presentations to dental professionals and a nice size loading dock that demonstrated strong product demand. I was impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that Periogen dissolves tartar.  If you do not get these results call their Customer Service.  They are very professional and try to build their business one customer at a time. They have a money back guarantee which they take seriously. It&#x27;s really a no brainer for the consumer.  Try Periogen with a Water Pik, call them if you have ANY questions and know that if you cannot get the desired results your money will be refunded. However, if used properly I doubt that will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My esperience is that my gums are healthier (pink versus inflamed red) and that my tartar is being dissolved.  I have Periodontal Disease.  Periogen is a must to keep my gums healthy, tight and with pockets of 4 or less.  I suggest that you read the Gum Disease information on the Periogen site.  Instead of killing off  all bacteria with an antibacterial, Periogen is dissolving my calcium phosphate (tartar) environment that the bad bacteria live on.  My result is healthier gums, fewer cavities and an opportunity to control the horrible progression of my Gum Disease.  Thanks Periogen.  You have made an significant contribution to my oral health!</li>
            <li> good substitute for visiting dentist. not only does it dissolve tartar real well below gumline(once a day use for about 4-6 wks), it keeps great oral health, better than toothpaste.    i highly recommend this product. dentists will not like this, as it will give them less business.</li>
            <li> I purchased Periogen after reading the rave reviews here.  I&#x27;m skeptical, but figured that, unless it does harm (I found no reports of that), my wallet can take a $30 gamble while I test something new and supposedly revolutionary.  I had two areas around my molars that were painful, bleeding and swollen, which I attributed to tartar buildup beneath the gum line.  Given my already psychotic phobia of the dentists&#x27; chair, the last thing in the world I could tolerate is someone digging into my painful/tender gum line with a sharp implement.  So I scoured the internet in search of home remedies, just to keep the tender spots from getting worse, and hopefully to improve them to the point where I could submit to the sharp steel claw&#x27;s punishment without paralyzing anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been 4 days since I&#x27;ve been using Periogen (twice a day, with newly purchased WaterPik, Pik Pocket attachment), and my teeth feel polished clean, the kind of clean I only get after a professional cleaning.  The tender swollen spots are 100% gone.  I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re clinically gone (as in massive periodontal disease is present, and I just don&#x27;t feel it), but by the second day all pain, tenderness, bleeding and swelling were gone.  I can dig in there with whatever I want with no sensitivity or cringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remain cautious because this is just too good to be true.  The number of steel claw wielding professionals this would put out of business, if Periogen actually delivers on its promise, is mind boggling. But I have always been frustrated by the lack of advancements in the dental/periodontal field.  It&#x27;s a field that seems stuck in the middle ages and has not kept up with the rest of technological advancements of our digital age.  By now I would expect that tartar could be removed from teeth by some method less barbaric than blind, manual scraping.  Could this be it?  I will temper my enthusiasm.  It&#x27;s only been 4 days, so I reserve full judgment until I see continuedimprovement, or chalk up the early good results to my having been under the influence of the honeymoon period of a placebo effect.  Placebo or not, for now it is FACT, that without scraping or a dental visit, big red swollen throbbing bleeding painful gums around my molars have deflated, are light pink, don&#x27;t bleed, and don&#x27;t hurt one bit.  My teeth in general feel smoother and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping my fingers crossed.  Will update this review in a few months.  I hope the others here will do likewise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that there are two published patent applications filed on this product (there may be other non-published applications, but they won&#x27;t show up in a general search), one in June 2008, and the other in June 2011, by the same applicant, who I suppose is the company&#x27;s owner or chief scientist or some executive.  I have not found any issued patents.</li>
            <li> This is my second review of this product. I deleted first because I felt that I had written the review before trying the product extensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for over a year, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on the tartar levels in my teeth. I still had visible calculus towards the back of my teeth and my gums kept bleeding like always. Yesterday, I mustered up the courage and went to a dentist who suggested dental scaling to remove the hardened tartar. To my surprise, it just took them 20 minutes to remove the tartar via ultrasonic cleaning. When I saw my teeth in the mirror, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. All the tartar was gone in just one brief session. The total cost of the cleaning (including X-rays, consultation) was around $200 and my insurance paid 80% so I had to just pay $40 to get rid of all the plague in just 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since yesterday, I have brushed 3 times and my tooth bleeding has completely vanished. My teeth feel great and I am thankful that I did decide to go to a dentist in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a joke. Even if it worked, it would take years to have any noticeable difference. I was scared of dentists and ended up believing in the false promises of this company due to my own lack of confidence. I thought it was easier to clean my own tartar instead of being judged by a dentist on my poor dental hygiene. I was completely wrong and eventually did the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tartar on your teeth, do yourself a favor and go to a dentist. Any form of tartar can be removed within minutes even by a dental nurse. Tartar is just hardened bacteria so stop harboring it in your mouth and get it cleaned quickly and easily instead of relying on this quackery treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not that impressed with it after my hopes were so high reading the product description. From the description, I thought that as soon as I was done rinsing out my mouth with this stuff, I would have tartar coming off in chunks and into my sink. In reality however it was nothing of the sort. First of all the active ingredients are: Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Tripolyphosphate, Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate and Citric Acid along with Sodium Fluoride .04% For some reason the ingredients were hard to find anywhere on the net, so here they are for a reference.  The procedure if you don&#x27;t have a Waterpik, is to put a spoonful of product (you are provided with a dosing spoon)into a glass of warm water. This is kind of cool because it fizzes up like Alka Seltzer and makes you think this could do some real good on your teeth. You are instructed to swish around the liquid mixture until it is all gone and repeat if necessary. Well, my experience was pretty anti-climatic. All it really seemed to do is make your teeth feel a bit cleaner than usual, kind of like brushing for a really long time, but didn&#x27;t do anything to the visible tartar on my lower teeth. Yeah, I know it said to repeat as many times as necessary, but nothing really happened and I decided to go back to my old trusty tartar scaler and pick after a week and scrape it off the old fashioned way.  I probably would be a little more entusiatistic about this product because you can tell it&#x27;s trying to do something, but the price is completely over the top and a rip off. For what you&#x27;re paying for this product you would expect to be getting something a lot stonger that produces notable results. Instead you pay upwards to $30 for a 3 oz. bottle of powdered baking soda and citric acid!? For less than 3 dollars I could get some Arm &amp; Hammer and lemon juice and mix it with some toothpaste and produce the same results.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t know how to review this product since it&#x27;s only one part of a new oral hygiene regime I have started.  I have a tooth that was severely damaged in an accident almost 30 years ago.  This tooth was almost completely knocked out but through oral surgery put back in position with the warning that it would eventually be lost.  I started to notice what I now realize was tartar and redness in the gum surrounding that tooth.  Thinking that this was it...the tooth was finally going to fall out I left that spot pretty much alone.  The tartar got worse and the gum started receeding. Don&#x27;t remember why but I was looking at some photos of tartar and suddenly it hit me...that spot was tartar and the redness probably had nothing to do with the previous injury.  I did tons of research and found this product which from the chemistry seems to make sense....but I also started using other products at the same time which also reduce tartar and prevent it&#x27;s buildup.  I can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s the Periogen but I can say that 2/3 of the tartar I could see are gone now and the gum looks completely healthy again.  Not only that but the gumline that looked like it was receeding has \\&quot;grown back\\&quot;.  I know that these things are not supposed to be possible according to the dental profession however I also take their view with a grain of salt...if products you can use at home are really effective they don&#x27;t stand to profit.  I will continue using the Periogen and the other products that in combination to this point have caused the reduction of tartar.  I don&#x27;t really give a hoot what any dentist has to say.</li>
            <li> my mouth feels soooo clean.  has stopped the bleeding i was experiencing with my gums. i put it in my waterpik and use it as a pre-rinse.  gums are healthier and my mouth feels wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 3 weeks,2 times a day.  It does not work.No change in dissolving tartar.  sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of people who have tartar buildup easily. I used to have to scrape my teeth once in a while. Periogen saves me all the trouble. Great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> okay so i bought this product 8 days ago, i use it 2 times a day and i have a mild tartar formation in the back of my teeth  so far i dont see any tartar dissolved (yes i use it correctly) but i do see my gums clearing up, i have mild gingivitis i kept seeing my gums as a red color  but now after 8 days of using Periogen my gums seem to be clearing up (turning pink)     of course its only been 8 days (1 week 1 day) thats very little time to determine whether or not its actually working    but i would suggest using a &#x27;Water pik Ultra&#x27; while using this product it will speed up the process</li>
            <li> Checked out the reviews and decided to give the product a shot.  Started using the product right after a cleaning as prescribed.  I&#x27;m a big vegi and fruit eater, brush, floss, and waterpik twice a day after my meals.  Yes, I only eat twice a day.  Four weeks later I am seeing a buildup of tartar on my lower teeth.  My opinion; this pretty much sums up the efficacy of the product. Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. It took the tarter right off my teeth after as little as a week. I highly recommend. I will be buying it again. I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I SAW THIS AD AND THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY AS I HAD NOTHING TO LOSE. I AM ALMOST DONE WITH THE BOTTLE AND HAVE USED IT AS DIRECTED. THE POCKET SEEMS TO BE FILLING IN NICELY AND THE  INFLAMATION IS DOWN. I SURE HOPE THIS WORKS BECAUSE I DON&#x27;T WANT TO LOSE THIS TOOTH. IT&#x27;S ONE OF THOSE I HAVE SPENT A FORTUNE ON OVER THE YEARS AND THEY WANT TO PULL IT.  THIS IS A LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE IT. NOT MAIN LINE DENTISTRY BUT HOLISTIC APPROACH. SEEMS TO BE WORKING AND I WOULD TRY IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> First of all, beware of all the fake comments. I was suspicious of the wording, and upon a quick check I realized most of those 5 star reviews are just scam to advertise the product...    Anyway, upon some research it looked like periogen was one of the promising products in the market, so I decided to give it a shot. I have only been using it for a week now, so don&#x27;t have much to share yet. So far, my gums feel slightly healthier but I can&#x27;t really tell if it is periogen or the waterpik itself. I&#x27;ll keep posting after I use it for a fair amount of time.    Btw, it is not a cheap product for the size of the bottle and they suggest you to use it for at least 2-3 months to see any dramatic changes. Well if it is useless, I guess it doesn&#x27;t help much to realize that after spending 100 bucks and wasting all that time. So please share your experiences...</li>
            <li> The name says it all &amp;#34;Hygienist Clean&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m ashamed to say I waited several years before getting my recent check up and cleaning. There was nothing on my teeth. Dentist couldn&#x27;t believe it. I owe it all to this product. I do use it every night with my waterpik and I still do floss every day. I&#x27;ll never go without.</li>
            <li> Product worked well; my pockets are now less than 3 millimeters due to the effectiveness of this product. I tried other products in the past but none of them worked in comparison to this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great if used with the Waterpik . They have a Waterpik Combo with 2 bottles of Periogen for $99. I discovered this stuff while looking for a scraper, for some annoying Tartar on my front lower teeth. I put hot water to the 9 in the water reservoir, used the Dental Attachment, and one scoop of Periogen. After my first time using it my Tartar started to break off. Now I just use it to control the Tartar on my teeth, so I maybe use it every other day. I&#x27;ve been Price Watching this stuff on Amazon, and now that it&#x27;s finally dropped from $29.95 to $19.95 I bought 3 bottles to keep me supplied encase the price should go back up.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me and I got it because I have receding gums.  After using it for only a short period of time I went and saw my dentist who said my gums were looking better.  Usually I’m being told I’m not doing enough to help my gums.  I’m not a dentist, but this works and as always consult someone qualified first.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this product &amp; have been using it with my WaterPik water flosser for about a week &amp; my mouth has never felt so good.  My prayer is, it really works as they say &amp; reverses the receding gums problem I inherited from my grandmother &amp; her ancestors.  I no longer have gum bleeding after brushing or other waterpik appliance use; the itching is gone - I&#x27;ve had that for something like 40 years..  I have hope for the first time since I was 15, when my stupid birth mother had the dentist pull 6 of my baby teeth daily for 4 consecutive days because they had not come out on their own yet.  I spent the summer with 4 permanent teeth, sucking everything thru a straw, being driven wild with itchy inflamed swollen gums - &amp; the taunts of other kids.  I can&#x27;t see I ever needed that!  Bring this product back, Periogen!  Bring it back here!  Wopila tanka! / Strong thanks!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see how good this product work. Within two weeks of using it once a day every day, the tartar her on my teeth is almost gone.of course you need to use a WaterPik with this product. I go to the dentist all the time to have my teeth cleaned and checked and they were unable to remove the totter on my teeth. Also my teeth are much wider now. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking for their teeth to be cleaner and also your mouth feels much more refreshed.</li>

            <li> I have been using a waterpik for years and just recently started using this product with my waterpik.  And I do notice a difference since using the product.  After the first one to two weeks, my teeth looked whiter than they usually do.  I had whitened my teeth about 4 years ago and this product has seemed to return my teeth to the way they always look after I visit the dental hygenist.  I&#x27;m due to see the Hygenist in about 2 weeks and I generally use the amount of time in the Dental chair for cleaning to give me an idea how well I have taken care of my teeth during the previous 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s where I really believe this product shines - at least for me.  I use to have -on occasion- a couple of problem areas in my gums where one or two areas were somewhat sensitive and would occasionally lightly bleed.  I don&#x27;t know if that was a result of brushing too hard or flossing too hard or what.  But I have to tell you that since using this product I don&#x27;t have that problem any more.  I don&#x27;t see any bleeding whatsoever or any sensitive areas as well.  My bleeding index is usually 0 or 1 (such as my last visit) anyways but for the week or two before I go to the Hygenist I usually have to be careful with the flossing and such so I don&#x27;t bleed as I&#x27;m always looking for that 0 score.  But that doesn&#x27;t seem a concern now leading up to my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;ll be interested to see how much time the Dental Hygenist spends on tartar during my next visit.  I&#x27;ll try to give an update here after my visit concerning feedback from the Hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and will continue to purchase it.  It is somewhat expensive but I think it is worth it for whiter, cleaner teeth with no more sensitivity or light occasional bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make one additional note here.  I also use Listerines pre-brushing whitening product while brushing my teeth and have been for some time.  But Periogen still made a difference after a week which I was surprised to see.</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month with my waterpik my mouth felt cleaner and healthier but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was reducing the tartar. Yesterday, while flossing, the large piece of tartar behind my bottom front tooth flew out of my mouth! So I guess it does work! I will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> Based on my previous review of the product, I expected some beneficial results.  However, the results were lacking.  I used it twice per day in accord with the instructions.  There may have been some of the tarter that was dissolved due to the process, but I did not notice any real change.  Near the end of my use I was scheduled to visit my Periodontist.  The hygienist compared my existing condition with information recorded from previous visits [I visit the Periodontist every six months] and indicated that there was no significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not consider using it again.</li>
            <li> I have had gum problems and I am hoping the hygienist will see a difference when she looks at them again in April</li>
            <li> With the amazing reviews, thought this woud work miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though my teeth look nice, I can tell I am in the starting stages of periodontal disease, behind the lower front teeth especially, bleeding gums, receding gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 4 products to battle this: This Dr. Katz toothpaste, his gum mouthwash, a bottle of some powder that you add to a water pick that eats tartar bellow the gumline, and a water pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far... I&#x27;m not as amazed as I had hoped. Nothing after that first week changed... My gumline on top seems a litte better after 2 weeks. But the gum line behind the teeth on the lower front ((which was my major concern) seems to have receded even more. So now worrying even more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will post this review on the other products, and update after another 2 or so weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about a month and a half, I do believe the Parogen Plaque and Tartar Dissoving Oral Rinse is workng. I am seeng much less residue on my teeth. (considering changing toothpastes though, from the Dr. Katz line to a differant Periodantal disease focused line, as I believe it is causing sensitivity. Suggestions welcome!).</li>
            <li> Been using Periogen for 2 months. Today, I saw my dentist for my regular checkup. She noted that my teeth were much cleaner than in previous visits. Plus the stains that were there, were much easier to take off. She said that whatever I&#x27;m doing, keep it up because it is working.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and am very impressed! I had begun to have some receding gums which I let go for too long. I read about this and thought I&#x27;d try it before going to the dentist (I am a dentist-phobe.) I have already seen a 50% improvement in the receding, and it has also done a great  job reducing tartar buildup. I use it with the recommended WaterPik which I ordered at the same time. I will definitely be ordering more. And I love the WaterPik- don&#x27;t know how I got by without one for so long.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using for 8 days, twice per day with my new waterpik. I don&#x27;t see any improvement at all. None. And for the life of me, reading the ingredients, I can&#x27;t see why this small bottle costs so much. Unless I&#x27;m just being milked for my money. I will continue to use until the bottle is gone (might as well, I paid a ridiculous amount of money for it) and will update with something more positive if by chance I haven&#x27;t given it enough time to work properly. The thing is, they say up to 8 weeks. I would need to purchase a second bottle to do that. Hmmmm.</li>
            <li> I had ignored a buildup of tartar on three of my teeth for awhile, always thinking that I would deal with it \\&quot;later\\&quot;. After it had grown to cover about 50% of the tooth surface, was quite thick, and had penetrated beneath the gumline, I started to worry. Getting it mechanically removed would have been expensive, so I searched, found Periogen, and decided to give it a try.   Long story short, it works -- I&#x27;m well on my way to being tartar free.   Having some force behind the water is best -- i.e. a waterpik vs. simply swishing. And adding in some Sonicare to knock the neutralized layer away may help. Based on the description of how it works, Periogen is like dissolving the cement between stones. Even with the cement dissolved, however, you still need some kinetic force to remove it, and get at the next layer. The force of a waterpik is one source -- throwing in Sonicare could be another.   Results are a direct result of time x efficiency. If you want faster results, youre going to have to spend more time over the bathroom sink.   But it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on April 23, 2012 along with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, so I&#x27;ve been using it for going on two months, but I have to admit I haven&#x27;t been consistent with my usage. Some days I&#x27;ve used it twice a day, some days only once, and I&#x27;ve skipped some days entirely for various reasons. Even so, I am definitely seeing a difference, enough so that I purchased a refill two-pack before my first bottle ran out. I actually saw some improvement in the first week of using Periogen. I don&#x27;t have dental insurance, so I try to do everything I can to take care of my teeth at home. I have to say that the one product that has made the biggest difference for me with my teeth has been the Sonicare toothbrush I purchased in January 2010. That toothbrush is excellent at removing tartar and really helps polish your teeth! But even so, I have some pretty stubborn tartar build up on the backs of my lower front teeth, which seems to be a problem area for a lot of people. I wanted to give myself at least 90 days to work with the Waterpik and Periogen, to see how much of an improvement I could make on my own before I went to the dentist. I had some minor bleeding before I started the Periogen, a sure sign of some gingivitis going on. The bleeding has completely stopped since using the Periogen. I use two scoops of Periogen to one cup of warm water. My teeth look and feel so much better, and I attribute that to the trio of products I&#x27;m using - the Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush, the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, and the Periogen. I will update my review once I come to the end of my third bottle of Periogen in another month. But for now, I have to say this product does seem to be making a difference. It softens the tartar and makes it easier to brush or scrape away and seems to help keep the plaque at bay.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for defeating tartar.  However, I also recommend going to periogen.com to read their exact directions for whatever dental problems you&#x27;re confronting.  Also, DO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY!  Make sure to mix the periogen powder in a small cup of warm water, and let it set for a few seconds.  It boils in a chemical reaction and you don&#x27;t want this in your mouth until it&#x27;s finished because breathing in the gases will cause pain in your lungs.  Other than that, as far as I&#x27;ve researched so far, periogen is a safe, effective way to combat tartar buildup, gingivitis/gum-pockets/gum-inflammation, among others.  I would highly recommend it but strongly advise against misuse as I don&#x27;t know what the gasses could do you your respiratory system.</li>
            <li> I started using Periogen about a month ago. Seems to be working as advertised!  The gum pain, redness, and bleeding are gone.  I just follow the directions and place 1 scoop of Periogen into the WATER PIK reservoir along with warm water. I work the WATER PIK tip along the gum line until the liquid is used up.  From what I can tell, you get the best results when you keep the WATER PIK tip as close as possible to the gum line. That insures the water jets are getting into any gum pockets.</li>
            <li> I use this in between dentist visits and it helps keep my mouth clean and healthy. I use it with a Water Pic and I can tell a huge difference in the plack and the way my mouth feels. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I only have it for a short  period of time, but the tarter is definitely easier to remove after using the product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> After getting my braces off I finally got a good look at my gums and I was VERY unhappy. My gums were all red and swollen and bleeding (I know, it was gross). I bought this product and started using it every night. I had my first post braces cleaning two weeks after getting the product and the hygienist was amazed. She said for just having my braces off my gums looked amazing, still a few problems but way better than expected. I have noticed since using this product that my teeth feel SO clean, like how they feel right after a good cleaning from the hygienist! I will continue using this product every night and hopefully in six months my next appointment is even better!    By the way, when this product is mixed with water it does fizz a lot, the first time I used it the fizzing was so loud and unexpected it scared me a little. (I am a bit dramatic)</li>
            <li> Purchase this product because of reviews. It is a good product not great. Too small of a bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I have periodontal disease and it really affected me when I started having a gum infection in my upper back molars.  I already bought the Waterpik and have used hydrogen peroxide to floss in the deep pockets to possibly heal the gums. Had to set the Waterpik on the lowest because my pockets were rather sensitive. Had trouble sleeping that night because I grind my teeth and woke me up. It wasn&#x27;t until I put a teabag to keep myself from biting while I was trying to get some sleep.  The teabag took away the majority of the inflammation as well as the pain.  I think the rinsing with the peroxide worked.    Ok I&#x27;m here to tell you about the Periogen I just tried for 3 days now. I don&#x27;t think I have that much tarter built up since I just had my teeth debridement a few months ago.  Anyway the feeling after using the Periogen made my teeth feel slick and clean. My whole mouth feels pretty good and moist. I would not know if this product has done its job until my next appointment.    New info you might want to know though. I have been looking for products that would aid in the growth of the alveolar bone and have referred to Wikipedia often for good info and for some reason I ended up searching for phosphorous. Oh right the bone&#x27;s nutrients are calcium, phosphorous, A, C, D vitamins. I notice Periogen&#x27;s few ingredients contain 2 phosphates known as detergents. How safe are these I wonder.  That is why they tell you not to swallow it.  My thoughts. I hope to not be dependable on this product because it is rather expensive, and because the idea of having detergent in my mouth not be organic, and one day phosphorous will be scarce.  Let see some bone growing products out here. I have been religious with my dental care now. I just hope the dentists aren&#x27;t out to damage them just so they can continue to make money off me.  update: The last check up and cleaning I had which was over 2 weeks ago was so so.  Most of my pockets have been reduced to mostly 3&#x27;s and4&#x27;s, a few 5&#x27;s and one 7 still.  The hygienist did not mention any heavy plaque build up so I&#x27;m thinking the product helped or I just brushed more.  Bleeding was still high at cleaning but not when I&#x27;m brushing or flossing.  Because periogen is recommended by Judy Carroll maybe it is a must product after all.</li>
            <li> Raised my gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only 22 years old. But i have receding gums on my bottom row due to having braces for over 7 years, which caused me to not be able to brush properly on the bottom row. On the 22th birthday, my bottom row teeth were wobbly when i bit into a piece sushi at the buffet. I also had gum pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t seen a dentist since i was about 15 years old or so due to financial reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, i diluted 3% hydorgen peroxide with water to make a 1.5% hydrogen peroxide solution. I used that as mouthwash, premade in a 16 oz bottle. Using this twice a day helped the gumpain go away. However, the gumline did not return, so i started using this periogen product. I put 3 - 4 scoops of this stuff into my 1.5 % hydrogen peroxide solution, some peppermint oil to taste, and i noticed that gumline has started to come up! I use just one mouthful of this stuff after each time i brush, unlike the recommended usage of repeatedly doing mouthfuls of this stuff until a cup of water is gone. This way, it will last longer too. Plus, i don&#x27;t have time and patience to do as suggested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a bottle, bought it a while ago, don&#x27;t know if it came with instructions or not because I don&#x27;t have the box (if it came in a box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle says go to the web page for instructions how to use, but the web page has no instructions! I&#x27;ve been all over the web page, just sales talk.  And an \\&quot;instructions\\&quot; video I couldn&#x27;t get to play past the first minute (which was sales talk, not instructions).  (A video wouldn&#x27;t be something I could print out and put next to the bottle so I don&#x27;t have to memorize!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sent an email asking for instructions - they claim to monitor emails daily.  It&#x27;s been most of a week. No response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the product works or not because I don&#x27;t know how to use it and searching has not brought any solid information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Dec 2013 - they did finally answer the email, saying they had been gone on vacation - I can&#x27;t fault that, everybody needs a break.  But the email answer didn&#x27;t address the stated questions/problems.  So regardless of product quality, I&#x27;m not thrilled with their customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the product, I am using it as a mouthwash after brushing my teeth, figuring the only way to test it is on tartar I can see. Back of the front lower teeth have brown (tea &amp; food stained) tartar. I&#x27;m putting one scoop (the little blue scoop in the bottle) into a half coffee-mug of warm water and then swishing it my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing this mouthwash for over a month.  There is no seeming decrease in tartar.  The IS a noticeable non-build-up of new additional tartar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say the product works to prevent tartar, I have no experience yet with it working to reduce existing tartar. Maybe a month is not enough time to see&#x60; any effects?  Maybe one spoon-full once a day is not enough product?  Maybe it lost potency when I opened it a year before trying it?  (It&#x27;s so stuck together in it&#x27;s plastic jar I have to chop at it with an ice pick every night to get the top surface to break into enough semi-powder to fill one little scoop, I guess it picks up moisture just from the air after it&#x27;s opened?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s doing a little preventive but not yet apparently reducing existing tartar.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of plaque on my bottom front teeth. Most of it is small amounts near the gum line, but between the center two teeth a good amount has migrated up the teeth. Its not very old, certainly not a year old as claimed in the \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture. I&#x27;ve gone through four full jars of Periogen and haven&#x27;t noticed the slightest decrease in the amount of tartar on my teeth, even the small spots haven&#x27;t changed a bit. I&#x27;ve mostly rinsed with it as the bulk of the tartar is above the gum line. I&#x27;ve also used a waterpik hoping for better results but that didn&#x27;t change a thing. The instructions say \\&quot;for aged and tenacious tartar use 2 scoops twice a day\\&quot; instead of just one as recommended by default. I&#x27;ve been doing this the whole time and still no results. I&#x27;m really surprised at how many good reviews this stuff has. Perhaps those experiencing results used it while the tartar was still soft or maybe they don&#x27;t even know what tartar actually is. Or maybe they were paid, I don&#x27;t know, but from my personal experience, this stuff is nothing more than snake oil.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in hopes that it would help me out with some dental issues that needed taking care of.  Used it in conjunction with a new Water PiK I purchased.  This stuff is just plain junk.  I think it is just baking soda.  Did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Okay, lemme start by stating that I have a HORRIBLE fear of the dental chair and all the anti-perks that stroll along with it. I haven&#x27;t had a cleaning in over 15 years because my children have always been my priority and to be honest, I think I&#x27;ve used that reason to support my fear of the chair.  I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B 3D Excel electric toothbrush for just as long, as well as having a borderline psychotic flossing routine and about 3 months ago I switched from Crest to Squigle xylitol toothpaste, which I LOVE and also reviewed about a month ago . My one problem area is the back of my front, lower teeth, which I understand is pretty common.    Well, I&#x27;m 43 now  and decided to suck it up and go for x rays with a practice that offers sedation. Long story short...I have an \\&quot;impressive set of choppers\\&quot; and need very little work. One cavity, the tartar on my bottom front teeth and a couple of spots that require scaling...for FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS!! Yeah, no.    Anyway, I started researching to get my teeth in better condition to just get that one filling and then on to regular cleanings. I&#x27;m a skeptical shopper and can spot a fake review from a mile away. My favorite is the supposed hygienist who rips this product apart without even having tried it. Gimme a break! I hate people who only see dollar signs when it comes to health.    Now, I got my Water Pik Thursday, 1/22, my bottle of Periogen Friday, 1/23 and today is Tuesday, 1/27. Been using 3 scoops with the pik pocket tip of the Water Pik, twice a day.  This morning, lo and behold, a substantially impressive shank of tartar came off as I flossed!! I can feel my bare, clean tooth again!! I can&#x27;t believe it!!    This stuff is pricey, but it&#x27;s so worth not dumping thousands at a dentist and freaking out in the chair. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this product, along with the Water Pik for proper application.</li>
            <li> If something existed that really got rid of tartar without a visit to the dentist and worked so well it would make headlines. Tried this and it simply does NOT work. It does nothing but waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have big teeth and even though I have good dental hygiene and brush and floss regularly, I still get tartar buildup.  This product does a great job at getting rid of tartar.  My teeth are whiter and my gums look healthier.  I don&#x27;t use it in a water pick, I just use it in a cup with warm water and swish with it every other day.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product works,&lt;br /&gt;maybe its just using the waterpik on high and some of the other products I bought actually doing the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, In a month, my plauque/tarter has gone from painful and difficult to chip off with a scaler, to breaking off while eating hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have less then half of the plauque I did when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bough this product (periogen),&lt;br /&gt;biotene pbf plauque loostening toothpaste,&lt;br /&gt;A basic dental scaler pick,&lt;br /&gt;and eucryl toothpowder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant be sure, but after doing some research I think the periogen is whats doing the softening.&lt;br /&gt;The other stuff helps, and I would reccomend them all, but I think this periogen is the heavy artillery out of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use it with a waterpik, I dont think it would work as well without the force and percision to help it direct the mix where the tarter is worse for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was using their recommendation for bad tarter, two scoops rather then one. 2 times a day. I usually put it in between 9-12 ounces of warm water.&lt;br /&gt;I am now down to once a day for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bugs me that I cant find more research on it, and it weirds me out that I dont see dentists recommending it left and right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I can stave off the dentist a bit longer with this regiment though,&lt;br /&gt;Id rather spend a month to get rid of it myself then an hour of someone else using power tools on me :P</li>
            <li> I have been using the Periogen powder for several weeks now on a daily basis and it works as advertised.  I had used plaque disclosing tablets from the dentist previously, and now I have less plaque and tartar showing up with the tablets. My teeth feel clean and smoother against my tongue.  And my gums also feel firmer.  This is not just a placebo effect.  Things are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use a Waterpik oral irrigator; I just swish it around in my mouth in warm water for ten minutes while I&#x27;m doing something else.  It is nearly tasteless - kind of salty/sweet, depending on how much you put in the water.  You can also brush with some of the solution after swishing, which I think helps to remove tartar at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think some people who are giving this negative reviews are just using it like mouthwash and swishing it for 30 seconds.  I tried this first, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  To dissolve the plaque and tartar, you have to leave it in your mouth for several minutes swishing it around vigorously or use an oral irrigator like the Waterpik.  It takes a couple of weeks of once (or twice) daily usage to start to see and feel any results on your teeth. I think it removes the surface plaque but the hardened tartar only gets loosened very gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is expensive, but if you are just going to swish it rather than use an oral irrigator, you only need to use a tiny amount of the powder (just a pinch) dissolved in a small amount of warm water to make enough to swish around. Used this way, once a day, I&#x27;d estimate one bottle will probably last about six months. You don&#x27;t need to use the plastic scoop that comes with it because this is to make one cup of solution to use with an oral irrigator, which is way too much for swishing around in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think using the Periogen powder is a good supplement to professional cleanings at the dentist every 6-12 months, especially if you&#x27;ve got some gum recession or tend to buildup tartar at the gum line (despite regular brushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I know other people who have seen similar effects using \\&quot;oil swishing\\&quot; (or called \\&quot;oil pulling\\&quot; in India) where you swish with sunflower oil for several minutes.  (Other oils have too strong a taste). Some people suggest also adding a little bit of Listerine to the oil to kill the oral bacteria. Studies published in Indian dental journals have shown oil pulling to be as effective as some prescription mouthwashes in removing plaque and bacteria.  Sunflower and sesame oil were apparently used as mouthwashes in India before the availability of modern chemical mouthwashes like Listerine.  There is lots of info on this on the Net by just searching on \\&quot;oil pulling.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Periogen and the sunflower oil apparently dissolve the plaque to some extent and, over a few weeks use, even some of the hardened tartar on the teeth and at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower oil, though it has a mild taste, still isn&#x27;t tasteless, and some people may get tired of the taste using it often.  So the Periogen may be better for long-term use since it has much less taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the intent of taking better care of my mouth in general. I didn&#x27;t really have any issues per say, but I just wanted to be a more responsible adult. As to where I can&#x27;t speak of its oral hygiene, I use the product every day and my teeth are considerably whiter. Let me make that statement clearer....I&#x27;ve considered teeth whitening for years*.....after using one bottle every day until it was gone, I no longer consider getting a teeth whitening. It&#x27;s that drastic of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known that would happen, I would have taken a before picture and an after picture. Sadly, now my teeth are too stain free and healthy looking for there to be a before picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review upon my second purchase. It may be $29 a bottle, but I feel it&#x27;s money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not smoke but I am a daily coffee drinker. You could tell before....you cannot tell now. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Is it really as good as all that? No, &amp; the added fluoride is an unnescessary annoyance. The bad taste tells me I need to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> bought this about 6 months ago. two bottles. have used the maximum dosage twice a day since, and my tarter is worse than ever. I don&#x27;t think it does what it says on the tin so to speak!</li>
            <li> Works great -- just a small spoonful in a small glass of warm water -- really cleans my teeth.  Does not take much powder, so this jar with last you awhile</li>
            <li> This was my second order so do I think it works well I must have thought so because I would not have ordered again, believe me I am like you I don&#x27;t like waisting money.After years of neglect on my teeth I was starting to see the tarter build up and I was told all my life I had pretty teeth but not anymore so I ordered a bottle of this of course hoping for a miracle because I hate going to the dentist, well I did not recieve a miracle but I definitly saw a difference after years of build up I could see a decrease,so when I ran out it took awhile but I ordered another bottle and I really don&#x27;t use it like I should but I can actually see a difference it has helped.But if you want a miracle dissapearance this is not for you but you should see some differance over time but you have to be vigilant.It&#x27;s not cheap but neither is a dentist.</li>
            <li> Been using Periogen for 3 or 4 years and feel I have made very good progress on my neglected teeth and gums. After losing one tooth to the neglect of not having my teeth professionally cleaned at age 55 I decided to give Periogen a try and while I have still not gone back to the dentist since getting that tooth pulled 4 years ago the rest of my teeth appear to be doing quite well. My gums haven&#x27;t bled since the first month or so on Periogen and none of my other teeth are showing any signs of tooth decay. I fully realize this review is not based on anything scientific in that I haven&#x27;t gone back to the dentist since the removal of that one tooth for an exam. I use Periogen once a day with a Waterpic and the Waterpic pocket tool I use every other day. My teeth feel very clean, a bottle lasts me well over one and a half months which is affordable for what it gives back, that being no continuous trips to the dentist for those god awful scraping sessions and the hefty bills after. If your on the fence on trying it, particularly if dental insurance is not affordable to you or if like me you find the dentist chair most uncomfortable then there seems there isn&#x27;t that much to lose and a lot to gain, especially with the money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;PS, I&#x27;m not a shill, just a very pleased long time user of this product stating my opinion.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well I couldn&#x27;t see all that much difference in the decrease of tartar possibly using it longer I will see better results.  A.L.</li>
            <li> I guess you will see a lot of results if you have a lot of tartar bulilt up. I had a very small amount of tartar and decided to try this before going to the dentist. It took about 2 months for my tartar to almost dissipear. Im happy that it works but it takes a while.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews, but this product deserves one.  I was a little skeptical about buying this online, but read others reviews and thought I would give it a try.  It does exactly what it says it does.  After 2 weeks of continued use, I saw the tarter breaking down that had formed on my teeth, and combined with regular flossing and brushing, my teeth and gums are healthier!</li>
            <li> So I started to have receeding gums on my bottom front 4 teeth. I used this for maybe 4 weeks and they haven&#x27;t receeded since then. I have actually forgotten to keep using it, mostly because I&#x27;ve tried other products like ACT restoring mouthwash to try and remineralize my enamel (can&#x27;t grow it back), but I might start using this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to work and do what it says. I read some reviews of people saying that it doesn&#x27;t work but if you look at what&#x27;s in it and look at the science behind what those minerals do, it makes sense that it works. I took off a star because while I am a scientist, I&#x27;m not a dentist. I don&#x27;t know 100% what the things in Periogen actually do, but after doing research it seems legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that there is no &#x27;cure-all&#x27;. The best thing you can do for your teeth is floss at least once a day, brush twice a day, and use something like this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Periogen for about 6 days and I have seen some improvment in my gum line. Also my bleeding gums have stopped a little bit, well alot because I use to bleed from my gums like every 20minutes, or when I would lick my teeth but so far that hasn&#x27;t happens. I also have seen the tar on my teeth has been going away little buy little. I do use the Watts- large syringe oral Irrigators because I couldn&#x27;t affored the waterpik. What I think is helping to is that I have been using Crest gum protection tooth paste. I floss when I remember or when I can, I know it&#x27;ll help more if you floss daily. I think anyone that is having problems with there gums or teeth should try Periogen it does make your mouth cleaner, but if you have bad breath you might want to get an anti mouthwash which kills germs, and freshens breath. I know it&#x27;s a lot of work but I mean when you don&#x27;t have dental insurance and want something to work until you can get the money I would say try this product. Just use it wisly because it is power, I&#x27;m already running low so I have to get another one.</li>
            <li> I had a routine dental cleaning and exam six - seven months ago, brushing and flossing are part of my daily routine. During that exam the hygienist said \\&quot;Your gums are not in good shape -- I will see you in four months\\&quot;. During the periodontal check, I had mostly 4s and a couple of 5s. Instead of returning for a \\&quot;deep cleaning\\&quot; as suggested, I studied tartar/calculus formation online and came across Periogen. For the past few months I&#x27;ve continued daily brushing and flossing as usual, but then began daily use of Periogen in my WaterPik. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any huge visual difference, but I&#x27;m not a dental professional. Today, however, I visited my dentist for an exam and cleaning. I anxiously awaited the results of my periodontal check and ... all 2s and 3s!  Not only were these results better than my most recent exam, but we compared the latest results to an exam three years ago and there was still improvement. Sounds to me like dental pockets, etc., are reversible -- with Periogen. I&#x27;m a fan!    Update on 10.10.2014: The Periogen success continues: I just had another routine exam/cleaning and my dentist said he found very little build-up on my teeth. The entire cleaning procedure took less than thirty minutes, and once again, measurements of 2/3 all around. I&#x27;m sticking with Periogen and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help get rid of some of the tartar build up in my periodontal pockets.  Not going to lie, I was worried about spending ~$30 on something that wasn&#x27;t going to work.  I also bought this with a waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure whether it was the Periogen or the Waterpik, but the combination of the two blasted away the tartar build-up on every single tooth that was affected.  It was pretty mild tartar, but now I have slick enamel surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely agree with some of the other reviewers on here, that using it might take a little bit of time if you think about what it is doing.  The tartar build-up didn&#x27;t happen over night, and it makes sense that stripping it down is going to take some time as well.  I think adding some pressure with a Waterpik is great, because you have 1) a chemical breakdown of the tarter and 2) a mechanical breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is meant to replace a solid foundation of consistent brushing/flossing/appointments, but it has specifically helped me fight the tartar accumulation between professional cleanings.  Just my 2c.</li>
            <li> This product will not be repurchased - It&#x27;s claims are bigger than it&#x27;s accomplishments. It just doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your time. Visit your dentist like you should &amp; quit trying to take the easy way out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think using this is going to change your life, but at least it can&#x27;t hurt. Anything that gets you to focus on cleaning your teeth really well is a good thing. I did not notice any appreciable results though.</li>
            <li> Still under evaluation</li>
            <li> i use other dental and mouth wash products and saw no VAST improvements using this than using just the other stuff. I probably not buy again since price wise it wasn&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me not to ever stop using this product.  My last cleaning was quick and painless.  My entire family is now using this.  I would recommend this to a friend.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price - a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t matter how many times or how carefully I brushed with my dentist-recommended Sonic Care tooth brush and flossed each day, I still had problems with tartar. I still have baby teeth that I need to preserve as long as I can. And I was tired of dealing with the tartar, the excessive brushing and flossing every day with detail attention to exact angles, and a condescending attitude from dental hygienists that implied I must somehow not be doing what I said, or being really bad it despite my ability to demonstrate the technique in my efforts to make sure I got it right. It&#x27;s a chemical thing. I produce saliva with the right calcium-types of content to help tartar have a field day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing research for better solutions, I happened on Periogen. I was skeptical, but given the potential payoff, I was willing to invest in a bottle to test it. Inflammation, and particularly the inflamed gums that accompany gum disease, have far stronger links to heart disease than cholesterol. Studies also reveal that when people get older, the two things they wish they had taken better care of are their teeth and their feet. For me, this provided additional motivation to solve the problem and test a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference was really surprising, and certainly more than I set as my standard for a repeat purchase. I can feel the difference. Can&#x27;t remember the last time, when going in for my next teeth cleaning, that I could still feel all the individual lower teeth with my tongue. My teeth are so clean! I have a family member who has the same issue, only with more advanced gum disease. After a couple months of testing, I sent off a Waterpic and Periogen to her too. She checked first with her dentist, who urged her to start the Waterpic at the lowest setting, but said the Periogen couldn&#x27;t hurt her - go ahead and give it a try. She&#x27;s experiencing similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have written that you can make this yourself, but frankly I don&#x27;t have the time and don&#x27;t want to risk it not mixing right. For the cost of a couple pounds of coffee, or gasoline saved by riding my bicycle more to run local erands, I can avoid far larger dental bills and have far better health. For me, this is a good investment in large dental bill prevention and better health.want to risk it not mixing right.

            <li> Dental cleaning continues to need a lot of descaling. This product promised better dental visits by reducing&lt;br /&gt;tartar and plaque. According to hygienist my plaque had not changed after 6 months!  We&#x27;re all not same, it may&lt;br /&gt;improve some situations, but no mine.</li>
            <li> used daily for a week together with waterpik set at 6. I removed as much plaque with a dental probe (see [[ASIN:B001JE32HY B001JE32HY]] as prior to using Periogen.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again. Works as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great give it a try what you got to lose besides your teeth and gum health but remember what works for someone might not work for you i never say product bad if it didnt work on me cause there reason it on market cause it works might not be for you but for others it might best wishes</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months. I was not expecting some kind of miracle but a little improvement.  I have seen no results whatsoever.  I have been following the directions.  I have been using it twice a day, every day.  I would recommend going to the dentist and not using this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and it did sound too good to be true.  However, further research has indicated that certain products are used consistently in the dental industry to prevent tartar buildup.  These chemicals release the ionic bond of calcium salts (dead, calcified dental plaque, aka dead bacteria) that attach to the dental enamel.  There are a few chemicals used, but they all have similar names.  Sensodyne tartar control (Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate), Lysterine Whitening pre-rinse (sodium phosphate), Plax pre-rinse (Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate), and most tartar control toothpastes have these compounds.  Periogen has Sodium Tripolyphosphate and Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviews are very misleading and frankly uninformed (focusing on baking soda or other ingredients that probably have absolutely nothing to do with the way the product works).  Use of many tartar control preparations results in gradual softening of tartar (particularly the pre rinses, as I have not had that much luck with toothpastes).  With Periogen, it seems that the ingredients are in higher concentrations, and you can truly feel the difference.  The key is to use warm water and follow the directions.  I have been able to control trouble spots and I see tartar come and go, depending on how often I use Periogen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt smoother, and my gums healthy.  I like to use Periogen as a pre-rinse (warm water) while I am in the shower--just swishing it around... possibly using a toothbrush around the gumline.  I also have a WaterPik but find the small amount of water (1 cup) goes by too fast, so I use the WaterPik with warm water after the rinse.  The WaterPik is only indicated for deep pockets with tartar buildup.  I don&#x27;t have any deep pockets but I did have nuisance tartar around the gum line in the lower front teeth--it&#x27;s gone now.  Try it or try the other products that help control tartar as well.  Think of this one as a concentrated version.</li>
            <li> Five stars but...I used Periogen for year in my water-pik.  I did not see any difference in plaque.  The  I ordered the Periogen 90 tip for my water-pik.  I have gotten a professional cleaning every six months without fail for at least the last 30 years.  There was always a lot of tarter buildup and for a while, I went to three times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the tip about a month before my next scheduled cleaning and started using the tip with the Periogen.  After a week, the plaque just can out in big chucks.  I had my regular visit and there was very little for the hygienist to remove.  I am continuing with the Periogen and the tip a few times a week and do not see any buildup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next appointment will be very interesting and I will update again.</li>
            <li> I use this a couple of time a week to ensure no tartar build-up.  I just purchased my second bottle as it last a long time.  I have been to the dentist twice since I started using this product and have had great check-ups with little to no scraping needed.</li>
            <li> I have only had the product for about 2 weeks. I am seeing improvement in the tartar buildup already.  The water pick that I have does not have a resevoir so I use the mouth rinse method, which you can actually feel fizzing around your mouth.  The directions are included on the package.  My mouth feels really clean. I think the product will be great to use as a preventative to tartar as well, once, I have all the tartar removed.</li>
            <li> Big difference in plague accumulation...must definitely maintain a good routine to have healthy gums.  I also purchase a portable waterpik rinser from CVS that was there brand it everything is lovely.</li>
            <li> Great concept.  My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner, and my dentist didn&#x27;t notice a difference from visit to visit.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my teeth and it helps disolve  Tartar but i saw its amazing results on my Cat&#x27;s tartar becuase mine was hard to get out because it was an old tartar so ihad to go to the dentist get it cleaned. but when i cleaned my cat s teeth with it it worked! just please make sure your pet don t lake it i used a pice of cotton to rabb the cat s teeth and then used the scaler i also baught from  amazon to clean the tartar and all worked together . I love it .</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone I know who hasn&#x27;t been to a dentist in 10 years and had so much tartar on his teeth.  Dentist told him it would cost close to $1,00 for all the treatments to remove it.  I purchased this for him and he was astounded on how much it is removing.  he hasn&#x27;t used it every day, but it has made an enormous difference!! it is chipping away.  don&#x27;t be reluctant to purchase this product, it works.</li>
            <li> Wow, Works as described. Cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li> I use Periogen with my waterpik. Works great!</li>
            <li> Just used the last of this bottle. I used exactly as directed. Also would dip my toothbrush in and use it straight out of the bottle and apply to those problem areas. Yeah, yuck bitter taste but was willing to give it a whirl for any results. Still the same amount of tartar i would scrape off weekly with my scrapping tool. Did not see any results. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> We need to study the ingredients to answer these questions&lt;br /&gt;a) Is it safe?&lt;br /&gt;b) Does It help?&lt;br /&gt;c) Is it expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;1)  tetrapotassium pyrophosphate&lt;br /&gt;2) sodium tripolyphosphat&lt;br /&gt;3) sodium bicarbonate&lt;br /&gt;4) citric acid,&lt;br /&gt;5) sodium fluoride 0.04%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions:&lt;br /&gt;1) Why is there no ADA endorsement?&lt;br /&gt;2) Why is it not FDA approved?&lt;br /&gt;3) Why are there no clinical studies published?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished some dental professional would take a close look at this product.is &amp;#62;1,000 mg/kg body weight.[1][clarification needed] Similarly, no mutagenic or carcinogenic effects nor reproductive effects have been noted.[1] Salts of polyphosphate anions are moderately irritating to skin and mucous membrane because they are mildly alkaline.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Sodium bicarbonate - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  NaHCO3.&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste containing sodium bicarbonate has in several studies shown to have a better whitening  and plaque removal effect than toothpastes without it.&lt;br /&gt;Sodium bicarbonate is also used as an ingredient in some mouthwashes.

            <li> I have a feeling that any improvement in tartar control is related to the water pik use. It&#x27;s mostly baking soda and hydrogen peroxide. Cheaper to buy those two items in the store and use that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for only 5 days and already I&#x27;m seeing results. For years I&#x27;ve had this issue, went to the dentists which has proven to be a painful process, so that when I saw this and I read the reviews I was indeed doubtful, but I can shout it from the mountain tops this product really works. I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s been only 5 days and I&#x27;m seeing results. Soon I&#x27;ll be able to talk and smile with people and not be conscious of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product in good time too. I&#x27;m extremely pleased. Wish I could rate it higher than a 5 star. :-p</li>
            <li> I order from amazon.com a lot, but this is only the second review I&#x27;ve written.  This product really does work.  I have gum disease and have cleanings every three months lasting a solid hour due to plaque and tartar.  I used Periogen for about a month and went five months between cleanings.  The hygienist hesitantly told me that I had zero plaque/tartar and my pockets were greatly improved.  Periogen makes my teeth and gums feel so clean and look so much healthier - whiter teeth and pinker/firmer gums.  I told the hygienist that I had been using this product and she wanted to research it.  I highly recommend Periogen.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I will continue to purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I recently went to the hygienist and she measured my gum pockets. All had decreased significantly. Deepest pockets had been 7 mm had now reduced to 5 mm. She was so impressed she wanted the name of the product and was going to research it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Periogen Deep Cleaning Tartar Dissolving Oral Rinse for only a couple of weeks. So far I haven&#x27;t seen its effect. Perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell. I&#x27;ll give an update later on.</li>
            <li> Expecting to see real improvement in oral health by next dentist exam.  Easy to use with oral irrigator.  Recommend to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I REALLY wanted this to work. I wanted to be able to write a glowing review saying how this actually removes tartat. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I have been patient, and have used three bottles over a 2.5 month or so period (I used the higher recommended dose). I wanted to make sure that I had given it every chance possible. After using this dose for this period of time, I have no reduction in tartar and the tartar that&#x27;s there isn&#x27;t easier to remove than it was before. I was suspicious of some of the reviews here, and the vague information on the product. Their website lists one dose as a maximum recommended for each use, adn the label has a different amount, but a 33% difference. That&#x27;s a red flag, adn is indicative of a \\&quot;But wait...there&#x27;s more...order in the next 10 minutes and get two for one, with extra P&amp;H\\&quot; type of scam. I found no other product that claimed to remove tartar (They have the only product that has ever been found to work? Another suspicious claim and a red flag). In spite of this, I shelled out for 3 bottles, and followed the instructions diligently, never missing a treatment. About 3 months later, I&#x27;m just a hundred dollars poorer. I want to believe the reviewers here, but tartar should be tartar and if it worked at all, I should have seen at least some improvement, but I didn&#x27;t. For these reasons, I have to say save your money and avoid this product. It just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> When I use water floss, I put it some... But I do not feel clean after used it. I still use one more another oral brand wash for safety.</li>
            <li> Have had a problem with tarter all of my life. For the first time in my life, I was told by my hygienist that I had ZERO tarter and almost no plaque. I had been using the Periogen for about six months before my last visit. Will continue using this for as long as it does its job.</li>
            <li> A small blue plastic scoop is included in the bottle; this amount nearly equals 1/4 teaspoon of standard measuring spoons, perhaps slightly more. As directed, I used 2 &amp;#34;scoops&amp;#34; of product in a full reservoir of water, twice daily. After 8 days, I knew it was working because I could see the spaces between my teeth, and feel every tooth surface and crevice, much the same as what it feels like after a professional cleaning. The product delivers as promised. Very, very pleased and will continue this great addition to my dental routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2015 Update&lt;br /&gt;This product has changed my life in the best possible way. After 6-12 months of consistent use, along with a Waterflosser, my hygienist was amazed at my progress. She smiled throughout the exam. A stubborn area which was 6mm deep for years, is now 4mm. Other areas have also tightened up and are now normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the advertisement years ago, when an exuberant child emerges from the dentist, grinning because of &amp;#34;No cavities&amp;#34; I felt the same pride and satisfaction. The dentist also commented that my gums were improved and very healthy. Two gold stars for me!</li>
            <li> Well, following directions and have used for about two weeks.  I do not notice or feel any difference. For what I paid for this product, will use until the end.  Doubt I will buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this product (the 3-pack) due to major tartar issues that are affecting my gum. I used these on and off for a while, with no clear indication whether it was working or not. So with my last bottle, I decided to do an experiment to test this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filled up two identical, small glass jars with lids with water. I dissolved a very large amount of Periogen into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a dental pick to carefully chip out the biggest chips of tartar I could yield (yeah, I know I was grossed out too). I spent quite a bit of time doing this to harvest a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then placed identical amounts of tartar into both glass jars, made sure water was fill)ed all the way to the top (to minimize air contamination) and I set them down to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the claim for this product was correct, I should have seen the periogen solution either completely dissolve the tartar over time or soften it up to the point of easy mush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days went by. Nothing changed. Weeks went by nothing changed. Finally, after about three months, I opened both jars up, carefully drained the water, and felt the consistency of both sets of tartar chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both felt identical! They were a bit softer, but neither melted or dissolved away at my finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a laboratory scientist, but I was fairly disappointed by the results. I, for one, won&#x27;t be buying any more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> My gums had gotten so bad that sometimes I could feel the blood pumping through them, a sure sign of infection.  But I was unemployed at the time, no insurance.  I water flossed and brushed.  I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I came across this on Amazon and purchased it.  Years later I still have a little bit left.  It worked within weeks.  Cleared up my gingivitis completely.  I used a little more than was recommended a little more frequently than was recommended.  I still use it every now and again to help keep my presently very healthy gums in tact and I still feel a difference after.  Whatever it&#x27;s supposed to be doing, it totally does it!</li>
            <li> It works at begining. When keep using for a while cold and hot water gives toothaches..&lt;br /&gt;Am i the only one experiencing this ?</li>
            <li> Works, but some of the ingredients are a little sketchy,look them up. Has a very strange scent like that CLR stuff for limescale.I used it in a waterpik for about a week and tartar did come off easier,but one night I forgot to empty the waterpik and the next morning when I went to empty and refresh the waterpik the water tank had etched and fused to the waterpik .After seeing this stuff do that I decided to suspend use.So in short it works but it is also kind of scary.</li>
            <li> I was told I needed a deep cleaning, tried periogen, used it for 6 months, just got a check up and my pockets went from 4 &amp; 5s to 2 &amp; 3s, I&#x27;m so happy. This stuff works!!</li>
            <li> Just started using, can&#x27;t rate the product yet. Arrived really fast. I&#x27;m using this product with the waterpik flossed system.</li>
            <li> i ordered the periogen to try to avoid having a deep dental cleaning.  it had been 30 years since my last cleaning in Fall 1983.  for the most part, my teeth and gums looked fine above the gum line, except for the backsides of the bottom front teeth where tarter was clearly visible.  there was considerable tarter below the gum line, but no pockets.  when i found out about this almost a year ago, i looked into finding something to help my problem and ran across periogen.  i was hoping that using it would prevent the need for the deep dental cleaning.  although it might have helped, it wasn&#x27;t enough to carry the day.  and i gave it a few months to work.  it seemed to reduce but didn&#x27;t eliminate the visible tarter on my lower front teeth.  finally, i accepted my fate and scheduled the dreaded cleaning.  it wasn&#x27;t comfortable, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad, either.  no numbing agent or shots were necessary.  part one of two is done.  i have resumed using periogen in the water pik, hoping it will make the second and final round in the hygienist chair easier.crumbly, they broke and decayed easily, so my body overcompensated with the permanent teeth, which came in super-hard, hard to even drill.  does that mean the tartar that forms on them is super-hard as well?  all i know is that the dentist&#x27;s office is going to have to flay my gums to remove massive tartar beneath the gumline.  it makes no sense that my teeth look great, my gums are still pink and taut as they always have been, with no bleeding, yet there is tons of tartar under them.  how is that possible?  it is a tough situation, and i will stick with periogen for a long time to give it a chance to do the job, because the alternative is too terrible to contemplate.  a bit of progress so far, just not that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am also regularly using xylitol to kill bacteria that causes plaque that turns to tarter and causes cavities to ensure that no new tartar forms.  in spite of using the periogen and xylitol, i suspect that the tartar below my gumline that neither of them can get to because of having no pockets might continue to grow like a coral in ocean waters, so under the gumline it may just keep getting more massive, just a guess.  i was disappointed that periogen is no longer offering a discount for ordering three bottles at a time, so i just ordered one bottle.  i mean, why buy three at a time if it doesn&#x27;t save me any money?</li>
            <li> Look on the back of your toothpaste, mouthwash, or anti-dandruff shampoo. What do they all have in common? They are all regulated as drugs by the FDA and contain one or more active ingredients proven safe and effective for the purpose listed on the product&#x27;s \\&quot;Drug Facts\\&quot; label. This product claims to prevent and treat gum disease and combat plaque and tartar buildup, both drug claims under the Federal Food and Drug Act and regulated as such in any reputable oral hygiene product. If you go to this company&#x27;s website and look at their \\&quot;fda statement\\&quot;[...] which they&#x27;ve put in a weak attempt to cover their behind from the FDA, you&#x27;ll see that the product is supposedly not meant to \\&quot;treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\\&quot; And yet, they&#x27;re making claims about treating gingivitis.     Do your research, don&#x27;t believe the fake 5-star reviews these con-men have planted all over the web, and stay away from this FDA enforcement action waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> I used the Periogen powder in my Waterpik for 90 days prior to my last dental appointment. Before my dental hygienist began working on my teeth, I asked her to pay special attention to tartar build up so that she could determine if there was less during this visit (as compared with my previous appointment three months ago). She said that there was good improvement since the last visit and asked what I&#x27;d been using. I told her I now use a Waterpik with the Periogen oral rinse product. She was interested because she had never heard of the oral rinse product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By using the Periogen powder in my Waterpik, I also noticed a difference in plaque build up in that I was more easily able to floss away any build up. This means that the (softer) plaque didn&#x27;t get a chance to turn into the (harder) tartar, which the hygienist has to remove. I really like using the Periogen powder in my Waterpik because I don&#x27;t have to spend as long flossing my teeth each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that with continued use I can reduce my teeth cleaning dental visits from every three months to every six months. We&#x27;ll see :-))</li>
            <li> I used the product over 6 months and it did decrease the calculus according to the dental hygienist in low pocket depth areas. The problem was I got 3 cavities and I haven&#x27;t had any cavities in 6 years. A friend who I convinced to also try the product at the same time got about 6 cavities. Her dentist was shocked because she doesn&#x27;t get cavities. The dentist thought she was eating all kinds of bad food but her diet has not changed or her dental habits. Being a Chemical Engineer I tried to figure out what was wrong with the product so researched many patents on such products with similar or also identical ingredients. I found out all products had a final PH of between 7-8 in the alkaline range. Periogen had a very acid PH in the 3 range, strong enough to harm the tooth enamel like lemon juice will. I consider the product dangerous to the tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately my teeth felt smoother, cleaner as the plaque just seem to rinse away. I recommended using once daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my gum line was started to receed a little bit and I had some tartar build up. This product really work, but you have to use it with a water pik.  With the water pik you will be able to get this periogen deep in gum line and dissolve tartar build up. You have to used it consistenly to  see result, I will say around 2 weeks. My gum has stop bleeding and receeding as halt. I recommend this product to anybody who want to impove their oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product works. I used it for 4 months. Then yesterday at my dentist appointment the hygienist and dentist were both amazed - NO PLAQUE on any teeth and perfectly healthy gums - no bleeding, no pockets. Happy happy me.</li>
            <li> Love it. I saw improvement from the beginning. Just use it daily or every other day, It might take longer but it works</li>
            <li> At 55 have watched gums recede irrevocably...a slow but seemingly definite calamity! Bought this product solely on the rave reviews on Amazon, and had 6 Powder concentrate 45 day supply sent overseas. Perfect and prompt arrival of the product in Switzerland within a week. Bought a tooth pick locally.Started using the rinse and tooth pick as explained recently by an Amazon reviewer (most explicit and helpful...thank-you!)and lo and behold began to see an improvement within 4 days! Gums seemed actually to be reversing their disappearing act. Put this down to beginner&#x27;s luck and resolved not to write a review before being certain not to mislead anyone. Today 1 month later, the trend continues...albeit gums now cover teeth by a good full millimeter more (ie long horsey teeth nearly back to normal) and look the way they did over 10 years ago. The process is so spectacular in the beginning one begins to believe Rome actually was built in a day...the progress continues steadily but more slowly now. (Or has it slowed because I&#x27;m lazier and don&#x27;t do the rinse 2x per day as previously?) Anyway...this product is unhoped for...marvellous...true to the many rave reviews and an absolute must if one doesn&#x27;t like teeth getting longer, larger and yellower (the receding gums leave a yellowed top of tooth visible) with age. Not to mention the fab feeling of cleanliness and smooth (un-tartared)teeth. Am only sorry it will gradually put all those sweet hygenist teeth cleaning ladies out of work (here in Switzerland they are hired in Canada because they do such a great -tho very expensive- job! Dental insurances in my country are optional,so familys have enourmous expenditure on dental medcine.) I have been using products bought via Amazon for over 12 years, but this is my first review! This product warrants it. Use it!&lt;br /&gt;PS Just read the product is phosphat concentrated. Not wanting to intentionally add to environmental problems, I will rinse over a plastic washbasin and use proceeds(diluted) to water my collection of potted orchids.(Use only on flowering plants in containers, not leafy ones.)</li>
            <li> it is working  so far  lets see what it will be in a few months</li>
            <li> I purchased this off the website and used it for my sore bleeding gums with no appreciable change after 2 months.  I found an article that said the latest thinking in gingivitis is now using hydrogen peroxide.  I had a bottle on hand (it&#x27;s dirt cheap too).  I squirted a couple of teaspoons into my waterpik along with about 1/3 a tank of warm water and used the pik pocket tip to force the solution down into the areas below the gum line.  After one day the redness was less and the pain was gone.  After 4 more days the redness is completely gone and I can eat again without the pain caused by getting food matter under the gum.  I noticed after 4 days of use that the hold pressure button on the handle of my waterpik became stuck in the down position after I press it while under pressure (if I turn the unit off the button comes back out).  So I did decide to use it much more sparingly (and ordered a new hand piece for my waterpik).  I squirt some hydrogen peroxide on my toothbrush and brush with it prior to going to bed and so far so good.  I don&#x27;t know whether the stuff caused the waterpik problem or not as the unit is fairly old.  It could be a case of old age and may not be the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow so far so good with the gingivitis.  No more pain waking me up during the night or after eating.  I think I paid $.78 for the bottle of hydrogen peroxide so you can see it is also a real money saver.  And it works!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as it is hyped up to be. Works just as good as Listerine in my opinion although Listerine gives you a fresher breath</li>
            <li> I used this product with the waterpik system. It did not seem to do much. I did not notice much in the way of deep cleaning. In fact I still had to have a deep cleaning with my dentist.</li>
            <li> some of tartar on my tooth slowly gone , I like that.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued my entire life by tenacious tarter. This product is the first I have seen than addresses that issue. I am angry that my &amp;#34;dentists&amp;#34; have never suggested this product to me. All they have insinuated is that I don&#x27;t take proper care of my teeth. Thankyou for offering a better solution.</li>
            <li> Does not appear to work. May need second bottle. Not impressed at all. Probably will not purchase second bottle. Too expensive for no results that I can see.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling of my teeth after using this product.  Although it is an abrasive cleanser, if used correctly and diluted in the water pik, you won&#x27;t feel the grains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good gums.  They&#x27;ve always bled.  As a result, the second I left my parents&#x27; house at the age of 18 I stopped going to the dentist to avoid the terrible pain.  During a span of 10 years i&#x27;d gone in for a cleaning exactly once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago my gums were hurting so badly that I decided to go to a dentist.  I had so much tartar and infection beneath the surface of my gumline that my roots were deteriorating.  I was logging 6s and 7s in the dental probing.  I immediately got a scaling and planing.  This was a horrible and painful experience, but I was told that with a strict regimen of brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash that everything would get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not get better.  My gums would keep getting infected.  My dental pockets kept getting bigger.  I hypothesize that they were so deep that nothing I was doing at the time could really help.  My dentist told me i&#x27;d need to undergo an expensive procedure where they rip your gums down, scrape everything clean, then sew your gums back together.  I could not afford this.  I got smart and turned to the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my gum issues I was supposed to get a cleaning every 3 months.  After starting Periogen I noticed a decrease in infection within one week.  I felt so confident because of this (and because of the glowing reviews for this product here on amazon), that I did not go in for my next cleaning until today, the day I write this review.  This was approximately a 10 month span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist was quite impressed.  Usually the probing for pocket depth made my gums bleed.  They did not at all, and my pocket depths were between 3 and 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that you MUST be vigilant.  I use Periogen 5 times per week.  Also initially i had some trouble wielding the 90 degree pik pocket attachment for the waterpik.  It took me about a month to finally be sure that I was really hitting the periodontal pockets correctly.  I set the waterpik pressure to a smidgeon above 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No con to using this product holds a candle to the peace of mind in knowing that my gums are ok, that my teeth aren&#x27;t going to fall out anymore, and that the only dental cost I will have going forward are my biannual cleanings.  I am a real person and this is my story.  I declare this product to be a life-changing product.to a smidgeon above 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No con to using this product holds a candle to the peace of mind in knowing that my gums are ok, that my teeth aren&#x27;t going to fall out anymore, and that the only dental cost I will have going forward are my biannual cleanings.

            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I can see it is working, but not as quickly as stated. They say you can use this as a mouth wash, or with a waterpik. I think it works very slow as a mouth wash and would only recommend it for keeping plaque from coming back. I plan to buy a water pik to speed it up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but it definitely alleviates my guilt about spacing out my dentist visits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer. My gums weren&#x27;t the worst, but not the best either. My specific problem area has been around a crown that just never healed right. It was bad enough that I had the antibiotic insert, which only made a minor difference. I flossed it diligently every day and the gum around the crown remained super red and irritated and nothing seemed to improve it. I got the waterflosser for Christmas and started using it, and shortly thereafter ordered the Periogen. It was maybe a week before there was a noticeable difference around the crown. A month later, the gum looks exactly like all the other gum tissue and feels perfect. The rest of my gum tissue is also improved. I&#x27;ll be very interested to see what they say at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> The only thing this product will remove is money from your wallet.  This will do absolutely nothing to remove tarter. I used three bottles of this stuff and nothing .  Nobody from the company responded to my emails.  The product is a total scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/12/13.  As you can see below, a representative from Periogen contacted me and let me know about their satisfaction guarantee with this product.  Yesterday, I received a refund through Amazon for my purchase price.  While the product did not work for me you should still take into consideration that the company does stand behind their product and offers this guarantee.  For this reason I bumped my review up from one star to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised and even though it&#x27;s supposed to work in the long term, I&#x27;ve noticed huge improvements after just one week of usage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Periogen 3 times/day for a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Morning after breakfast, brush as usual and rinse with Listerine + one \\&quot;cup\\&quot; of Periogen for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- After lunch, brush as usual and rinse with Listerine + one \\&quot;cup\\&quot; of Periogen for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- At night, Brush as usual, Waterpik with full tank of warm water (just water) at max speed (10). Then I change the Waterpik tip to the Pocket pick, set speed to 2 and fill it with a cup of warm water with 2 \\&quot;cups\\&quot; of Periogen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results so far are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No more bleeding gums (I used to bleed on every brush)&lt;br /&gt;- Gums have way better color, not the desired pink but getting closer&lt;br /&gt;- Fresher breath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I give it 5 starts, let&#x27;s see how it goes in the upcoming weeks as I plan to go through a full 90 days of Periogen.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple of months now. Don&#x27;t see any difference in the tartar, bleeding gums or tooth pockets. Use it nightly in my water pik. Do like that it makes my mouth feel clean without the alcohol feeling of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Other reviews I read before purchase talked about tarter peeling off your teeth. Garbage! If this product works, I can not tell. Have been using for 20 days-have not noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it did work, but it doesnt seem to. I guess nothing replaces the dental assistant.</li>
            <li> I like this product ok it seems to work fine in removing the tarter from my teeth when I see the build up. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I got this 3 weeks before my dental cleaning &amp; I was so glad with my cleaning!! I noticed after using this I didn&#x27;t have as much build up as I normally had &amp; was hoping my dentist would be pleased!! He was!! The regular time for a tooth cleaning is 45 minutes to 1 hour &amp; this only took 20 minutes tops!! I was saving my review after the dental trip to help others understand that Periogen does a little at a time each day!! The Periogen works well for those who want better checkups at the dentist office as I do &amp; the Dentist wants to know about it so he can learn about it&#x27;s value &amp; contents!! I was very pleased &amp; will continue to be pleased as I continue to use Periogen!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon.I followed the directions but  I did not notice any results. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have started using it, but it&#x27;s too early to tell yet if its working as I hope it will.</li>
            <li> Tasted terrible and noticed no difference</li>
            <li> This product really has done wonders for my mouth.  After using for a few days the plaque starting disintegrating.  I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> My husband used this for a while and he liked it.. He took it to the dentist and she did not have any comment on the product.. We use a little baking soda now in the water pik and works well and alot cheaper than this product...</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - my gums are pinker than they have been in years. I have struggled with periodontal inflammation for many years. I was a 4 time a year teeth cleaning person. Now I can go a single time per year and the dentist was amazed by the change in my gums. Also, had a bottom front tooth that has been loose for several years (and getting worse as time went by) that seems to have reattached and is still loose but not nearly as bad as before I began using this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I HAD excess tarter and with insurance it was going to cost over $400 for the dentist to do a &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34;.  I used it 10 days (approx) with no results.  The past few days I stopped using this product and started &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34; and after just a couple of days, my gums started healing and the tarter on the back of my teeth is softening.  Instead of paying for this product, pay $2-5 bucks for some sunflower oil and do oil pulling...</li>
            <li> When I first came across this product I was intriqued. I had to learn more. I found a link to the company website so I click on it and began to read everything about it. The scientific explanation is what really convinced me along with the good reviews I had read here on Amazon. It just made perfect sense. I bought two bottles. It&#x27;s been about a week now since I first tried the product. I began with two of the little scoops in my water pik appliance. As soon as I felt the water pulsing against my gums I could feel the added ingredient of Periogen. It felt kinda like a fine sand stabbing away at my gums. I knew right at the start that this was going to work as advertised. I continued my usual routine of going around all the gum line of the upper and lower teeth. It takes me maybe five minutes total. I use the second setting from the bottom as this seems to be best for me. Any more and it makes my gums ache or sensitive. My routine is to do this cleaning once a week at the least. I keep a record in one of those little memo books on my dresser. Sunday night is my night but I stray sometimes as I might not take the time or I&#x27;ll just forget to stay on track. I can always tell too if I&#x27;m past a week because my gums will feel like they are being attacked by something and they begin to bother me. I love the feeling right after using the water pik as it makes my gums feel tight against my teeth. I can remember as a kid playing with a water hose and sticking the end of the hose in my mouth and feeling the force of the water on my gums. It felt so good. The water pik does the same thing but is more concentrated with the detachable nozzles I call them. I&#x27;ll add to my review if there is any difference or change. I have to say that after the first use of the Periogen product though my teeth did feel like I had just gotten out of the hygenist&#x27;s chair. My hygenist uses the sand blasting method on my teeth now. She gives me a choice of either that new method or the older. The new sand (it&#x27;s not really sand I&#x27;m sure but I don&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called) blasting method is quicker and a lot less messier I find. Anyway, if you are still with me here and are thinking about trying this stuff, just do it. Once I saw the size of the building of this company on their website I knew they must be doing something right. Spread the word! Let&#x27;s kick gum disease one person at a time!nd (it&#x27;s not really sand I&#x27;m sure but I don&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called) blasting method is quicker and a lot less messier I find.

            <li> Let me start by stating I am a registered dental hygienist. My greatest concern about this product is the claim this will eliminate the need for dental visits.  That in itself is a DANGEROUS suggestion and places people at risk for a variety of systemic diseases including immune system disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, pancreatic and colon cancer, heart disease, and of course tooth loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will NOT cure periodontal disease, nothing can cure it. Reducing plaque bacteria biofilm, which calcifies to form tartar is the goal. The best way to achieve this is proper brushing, flossing, water irrigation and an oral rinse- DAILY, and regular dental cleanings and exams (at least 2x/ year). You can raise your oral pH by simply swishing with water following eating or drinking inbetween thorough home cleanings. You can also try chewing sugar-free gum and try gums and mints with xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, it appears that this product results in de calcification of enamel and the exposed root surfaces resulting in an increase in cavities, that is not a good trade off. There are products that DO decrease the bacteria such as Chlorhexadine rinse, without compromising hard structures in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers are suggesting HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, but research shows that hydrogen peroxide causes permanent tissue changes resulting to oral cancer in some patients. It is not a good alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not risk your teeth or your health because some marketer is trying to convince you that buying their product will cure a progressive and complicated disease- it WILL NOT.</li>
            <li> What is it supposed to fix?  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, except gums bleed occasionally (not enough to be alarmed).</li>
            <li> Used more than half of bottle and results are very good. Black spots started decreasing in size after 7th or 8th use. It works</li>
            <li> I hardly had some tartar. I just needed it as a supplement for deep cleaning my teeth... it did not work.</li>
            <li> September 2015 -- FOLLOW UP:  I have been using Periogen for almost a year now and I must conclude that it is not really worth the price one pays for it.  Initially, Periogen, mixed in solution and applied with a WaterPik WP60 every day removed quite a bit of the stains that were in the crevices between my front teeth.  However, as I continued to use it over the course of a year it became apparent that it really wasn&#x27;t removing calculus or getting at the really tough stains like I thought it would.  Remember I used it twice a day every day.  In desperation I finally scheduled an appointment with a professional dental hygienist and had my teeth cleaned.  I realized that all of the money I had spent on Periogen at $25.00 a bottle could have been spent on two professional cleanings per year by a competent dental professional.  If Periogen sold for five to ten dollars a bottle then I think it would be O.K. to mix in with whatever solution one normally uses in their WaterPik but it&#x27;s not going to replace routine cleanings at the dentist or dental hygienist and at $25.00 to $30.00 a bottle it is even more expensive and way less effective than just going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for me.  Once each day before brushing I mix one tablespoon of Periogen in a one liter container of hot water from the tap and run all of it through my WaterPik WP60 unit to clean between my teeth and along my gumline.  Then I brush with a famous brand of toothpaste followed by a final rinse with my favorite mouthwash.  In the four weeks since I have started using Periogen I have seen the stained tarter built up around my gumline recede.  The tarter is actually coming off.  Periogen really is working for me.  It is a shame I didn&#x27;t discover this product years ago as it has been a struggle to keep my teeth and gums healthy since I hate going to the dentist.  The only issue I have is that the product is expensive at about twenty-five dollars for a three ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been to a dentist in a very long time and I knew I had calculus build up on my teeth.  I didn&#x27;t want to go there and be told I needed a deep cleaning; or for them to mess with my teeth when my gums were swollen and easy to get hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS have you looked at doctor&#x27;s and dentist&#x27;s offices lately. They are dirty. Frequently they just wipe down the tops of things but not the sides, not the arm rests and so on. Who needs an infection with all these resistant bugs around?  AND the person doing the cleaning doesn&#x27;t know how to use the disinfectants correctly and so do not leave the solutions on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; long enough to disinfect the surfaces. Doctors don&#x27;t know about this any more than they know their receptionist acts snotty to a patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo if you bleed...for any reason, bacteria is more likely to get in.  So I read the reviews here and it seemed like this stuff could help get my mouth in better shape, before I went to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it did help (though I used one other cleaner also that I think I may have liked more). And I am still procrastinating about going to the dentist...because my mouth looks pretty good now and the tarter and calcium deposits seem pretty much resolved! Hurah!</li>
            <li> Save on Dental Cleanings while looking better.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helps prevent gum disease also, but only because my dentist seems to \\&quot;indicate\\&quot; tartar can cause that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a heavy coffee drinker, I always need a good dental cleaning every 6 months. I hated how my front lower teeth stained so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Tartar preventer and remover for my German Shepherd for a year, and her teeth are pearl white.  So I knew there had to a product available for humans. Otherwise, I was going to use her&#x27;s.  :-) Heck, it is just a chemical.  Of course your Dentist Will Never Tell You About This Product.!  They will not even sale it to you, like they should if they were \\&quot;Professionals\\&quot; caring for your teeth.  They&#x27;d prefer to milk you for office visits. That is the nature of health care today ! $ $ $...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching Amazon I came across this and knew it would work wonders. I don&#x27;t even use it every day. Maybe twice a week, and often only 2-4 times a month.  Still my teeth are 90% tartar clean and it has been 4 months since I have had a dental cleaning. I&#x27;d guess I could go 9-12 months between cleanings by using this Periogen \\&quot;Hygienist-clean\\&quot; Tartar Removing Oral Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use a very small amount of water and 1/2 or less of the included small spoon. 1/3 ed of the spoon would probably work, as it seems to thicken in the water. Kind of a fizzy type feeling. It has a baking soda taste to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick swish for a minute at the most right after brushing before bed. Do not drink or eat anything else afterwards to make sure it stays on your teeth to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait... Try this product especially if your are a coffee or tea drinker.  You will love it.. and save on dental bills too.</li>
            <li> Between cleanings, and just before a professional cleaning, this loosens plaque and tartar like nothing else. If you want to keep your teeth free of tartar and prevent or reverse gingivitis you must use this.</li>
            <li> this product took the shine off of my teeth and it did not appear to work.</li>
            <li> The product, when used with the Waterpik WP100 really does seem to reduce swollen gums and reduce plaque. It is tasteless, and without side effects.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT I REALLY FEEL MY TEETH CLEAN !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST STARTED USING  AND THE PLAQUE AROUND MY GUMS FEELS  MUCH LOOSER TO REMOVE WIH MY FLOSSER AND  PIC  THANSK</li>
            <li> Been using this for about two months and it is showing results. I would say that you should expect it to do it&#x27;s job well after about 5-6 months of use.Every one has different oral needs.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for what it is, but works. Buy thhe &amp;#34;3 pack&amp;#34;, you will use it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do a darn thing for me.  That&#x27;s $40 I&#x27;ll never get back!  Water is all that&#x27;s necessary with the strength of a waterpik.</li>
            <li> For me, I have a severe tartar problem mostly on my bottom front teeth (inside them). Also, I have Gingivitis with reddish gums.  And since I hate going 3 or 4 times a year for dental cleaning, I decided to prepare so that next cleaning won&#x27;t be as long and painful in the dentist&#x27;s chair. Now here is what I noticed about this SUPER Periogen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First, I followed the instructions and added this to my WaterPik Water Flosser. And as instructed, I used the Gum Pocket accessory tool with this. Because my gums are tender, I started on the WaterPik at 3 and gradually went to to 5 because of my gum tenderness.&lt;br /&gt;And then I took my time and went into each gum pocket (mine are small at 3 to 4 at the most) and I could feel the combination of the Periogen and the WaterPik seemed to perform a DEEP CLEANING these pockets! In fact, I could see in my basin icky stuff coming out from my gums (it really did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) After just a few days, I placed a dental mirror and looked to see the tartar and much of the tartar was GONE and my teeth look whiter that yellowish film is also GONE from my teeth, front and all of my teeth are whiter each day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) After a few days use (still using the Gum Pocket Accessory), my teeth and gums look wonderful, gums pink and my teeth look very clean like they do right after a cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am due to go back in a few weeks for a cleaning and believe that I will received a MUCH IMPROVED DENTAL report from my dentist and hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the results so far are AMAZING! While I cannot say what your results will be, I believe in this product as for me, it works so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Helps significantly with the irritation my lower front teeth get due to a permanent retainer. Makes it super hard to floss well in that spot and this helps reduce the tartar and inflammation.</li>
            <li> I have been to two different dentists that said I needed the deep cleaning which is about $1000.00. I saw this advertised on amazon and noticed immediately a big difference. two of my teeth had been bleeding before I started to use this product and stopped bleeding completely even with an oral pic brush. I just went to the dentist yesterday and he told me that not only do I not need the deep cleaning but I also do not have gingivitus or any sort of gum disease. He says only one in 80 people need the deep cleaning. he also said that not a single tooth bled when he cleaned my teeth and I felt no pain at all in the cleaning process. I am 73 and retired and rarely review anything but you will not be disappointed with this product. they should give a 200% guarantee on this because they would never have to honor it. I use 3 capfuls instead of one. Luke</li>
            <li> What follows is my opinion after studying the claims surrounding this product.  I also have included an essentially free alternative from Dr. Keyes, of whom they seem to think so highly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began researching this product because I was interested in using it on my dog.  I noticed \\&quot;angainor\\&quot;&#x27;s review containing a suggestion that shill reviews and comments in favor of this product had been placed.  This development increased my interest in learning more.  I want to suggest that anyone considering purchasing this product, which is presently selling for roughly 10USD an ounce, (although it appears to be made up of common and cheap ingredients) do their own research and draw their own conclusions, but here are the things I think I have learned. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They assert that the product is recommended by Dr. Paul Keyes, Former US Dental Director, NIH.  Here is what I read about him in my research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Keyes was apparently a staffer at the NIDR (National Institute of Dental Research), however, at least in my searches, I found no evidence that he had been its director.  I&#x27;m not saying that he wasn&#x27;t, only that I can&#x27;t find evidence that he was.  Dr. Keyes retired from NIDR in 1981, and the article in which this is mentioned refers to him only as an NIDR staffer (People,February 14, 1983,Vol. 19,No. 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Keyes was 66 when he retired, making his current age (if he is still living) 97 years.  If Dr. Keyes is living, and if he in fact endorsed this product, we have no idea if he was compensated for the endorsement, or if, at age 97, he still has the mental acuity and currency of expertise to make such an endorsement meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Dr. Keyes was nominated for a Nobel Prize, it does not appear to have been a successful nomination.  In fact, most of the mentions I find of Dr. Keyes seem to come from the makers of this product, including 100% of those I found which mention a position of Director, or a Nobel nomination.  Furthermore,this nomination is supposed to have occurred 56 years ago, and was therefore apparently not for this product or the research or theories of this product.  Dr. Keyes&#x27; most significant professional achievement was reportedly in regard to the formation of caries, and if there was a nomination it would likely have been in this arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should state that Dr. Keyes does appear to have been a talented and successful researcher, and I mean no disrespect to him in anything I say here.  Whether he has had anything to do with this product, and if so what the circumstances were, are questions for which I have no answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that Dr. Keyes had in fact developed the underlying concept used in this product late in his career, but he apparently did not do a lot of research on it, reportedly stating that he didn&#x27;t have time to do long term research.  Their were two short term studies, one in 1973 and one in 1981.  The concept of this regimen was reportedly greeted with some controversy, but there were reportedly also positive indicators in the short term studies.  It is worth noting that Dr. Keyes expected that the patient would be working with a dentist.  It is also worth noting that this seems to have been intended as a therapy for existing disease, possibly in combination with short term use of antibiotics.  It does not seem it was intended as a prophylaxis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is Dr. Keyes&#x27; formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Dr. Keyes \\&quot;salt-and-soda\\&quot; regimen, which he stresses should be supervised by a dentist, consists of four simple steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *Mix two tablespoons of baking soda (or, for people with high blood pressure, Epsom salts) with enough hydrogen peroxide to form a thick paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *Work the paste around teeth with the rubber tip on the handle of a soft-bristle toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *Massage the gums and gum margins with the tips, then brush teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *Follow with a warm salt (or Epsom salts) water rinse done with a Water Pik. Then run fresh water through the Pik to prevent salt damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on from the Dr. Keyes material, there are some things in the product description, and in some of the comments left in reply to angainor&#x27;s review which trouble me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a claim of a patent for this product, but the patent number is not offered.  I would love to have the patent number for further research.  I did take the trouble to do a brief patent search, but found nothing which seemed to remotely resemble this product.  Perhaps Periogen will respond with the patent number - if there is one.  If they do, it is a development I will welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an implication that the product is based on a trade secret, but to my understanding, the concept of trade secrets and patents are antithetical.  Patent protection is given in exchange for revealing the fundamental details of an invention in the belief that such an exchange furthers progress in the long run.  The legal protection offered is the incentive to the inventor for sharing this information for the greater good of society.  So, which is it, patent or secret formula?  Are they simply trying to persuade people that they can&#x27;t mix up an effective alternative on their own?  After all, with this kind of markup, people have a lot of motivation to home brew a substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much mention is made in the product information of pH levels.  It is indicated in the description that low oral pH may adversely impact dental health.  And, a lot is said about the pH of the product itself.  It appears that we are supposed to infer that the pH of this product will improve our oral health by raising ambient oral pH.  But the pH of a rinse such as this would not be expected to have any long term effect on ambient oral pH.  Anything you eat or drink may temporarily impact oral pH in either direction, but such changes are transient.  Dissolving a Tums tablet in your mouth periodically during the day would likely do much more tomaintain a favorable average oral pH, and will provide your body with calcium in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is suggested that although the ingredient list has been shared with you in the product description, there is (apparently) some magic ratio of ingredients, which if altered, even slightly, will render the formula useless.  This seems to me to be absolutely absurd, and sounds like the patter of a carnival pitch man to my ears.  Besides, if the product is (supposedly) under patent, why not share these details?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just some of the things which concern me, but I think this is adequate to express my doubts about Periogen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is my overall take?  The product MIGHT have some small benefit, but I see lots of smoke and mirrors in play.  A lot of seeding their remarks with reasons why a customer has to be very patient and go through a lot of bottles of unbelievably expensive product before they can even think about claiming it doesn&#x27;t work.  I see a lot of word games that evoke images of carnival barkers trying to part a \\&quot;rube\\&quot; from their money.  If I wanted to try the concept, I would use the Dr. Keyes&#x27; regimen.  One thing I personally would not do is shell out 30 times the value of the ingredients for something which appears to be vastly over-hyped.  The description and comments from Periogen feel disingenuous to me at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person&#x27;s opinion, make your own call, and caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 15 minutes a day for about 2 months.  I used 1 1/2 bottles.  As far as I can tell, this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I am just one of the unlucky ones.  I dissolved 1 heaping spoonfull of Periogen into one 6 oz glass of water and swished, and rinsed for a long time every morning.  I will say my mouth felt really clean, but when I visited my dentist, I got a cold dose of reality.  This stuff did not work for me. My dentist says there is nothing that dissolves plaque / tartar.</li>
            <li> Periogen works...this is my third week of use. Tartar is less visible. The first week my gums bled and were sore. The second week less. I swish and brush with Periogen..my teeth are whiter and mouth is cleaner. My breath is fresh. Wow...I use twice a day..swish for about 5 to 10 minutes after brushing my teeth. I use more at night...about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon. Do not eat or drink afterwards for best results...and I will buy a Waterpik for optimal results...</li>
            <li> I have seen a marked improvement, and my gums and teeth just feel cleaner and look healthier.  You must follow the instructions and use it as directed for the results.  Do not cut corners when it comes to your dental health!</li>
            <li> There seems alot of attempts to debunk this product by those who have never used it. Also alot of flaky reviews after someone has only been using it a few weeks. This stuff takes TIME to do its job. My experience? I hadn&#x27;t seen a dentist in 15 years back about 4 years ago. I was terrified to go because I found out that I&#x27;d probably need a &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; and be handed a bill for at least $500. I knew I had tartar too. I ordered Periogen and used it for several months, then got up the nerve to go to the dentist. Well guess what? They did a normal light cleaning and I was done! No deep cleaning needed, just the normal 15 mintues of light scraping and I was out of the dentist&#x27;s chair. What else do you need to know, IT WORKS, it will save you big bucks in cleaning and dental problems. It does other things too, I have a cracked tooth that gets sensitive to cold sometimes, the dentist filled it but the tiny crack is still there. When I use Periogen for a time, the sensitivity diminishes alot, down to almost nothing. My grip with Periogen is its too expensive and it looks like they raised the price since I used it last, oh well......</li>
            <li> Bought the first bottle to try it out. Wanted to see what my hygienist said after seeing my teeth after using the product. After the first exam (after using for a month or so and not every day) she was amazed. I have not told her what I have been using. She said my mouth looked great and that she was impressed. Bear in mind that I battle gum disease so this was wonderful to hear. I waited before giving a review to see if the 2nd exam at the dentist went as well. Everything looks great! So I ordered another bottle. I use most days and I swish in my mouth like mouth wash as per instructions, most every day. (Because of my gum disease, I get periodontal cleanings every 4 months. If this keeps up, I may be able to stretch it to every six months and that&#x27;s a savings.)</li>
            <li> Ended up with more cavities like other users said. Believe this is due in part to the citric acid. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this with a water-pik to help reduce periodontal disease. After 3 months I noticed a tremendous improvement in the ease of keeping the spaces between my teeth clean. My dentist noticed an improvement in my early periodontal disease as well.</li>
            <li> I have had a prolonged condition which has kept me bedridden through many surgeries over several years. As part of my treatment I have had to take medications which have caused dry mouth and cavities with the appearance of dark brown tartar at the gumline. With the tartar on the affected teeth forming a new line, extending down perhaps as much as 5-10% from the gumline.&lt;br /&gt; The dreaded dental visit came after the breaking of a tooth. I was \\&quot;sold\\&quot; by the hygienist a full tartar removal procedure that would scrape under the gumline etc. Very painful as they had to stop and inject more Novacaine twice during the treatment. My mouth was swollen and I was given a prescription for pain pills by the dentist. After I started to recover from the  treatment I noticed I could not see where it had removed much of the tartar(if any).&lt;br /&gt; It was about two weeks when I came across an ad for Periogen on the web and decided to try it. I thought it was expensive and when I realized I would have to buy a Waterpik to use it properly I wasn&#x27;t that happy. But I had just lost my first adult tooth due to tooth decay and I was on a mission to try to make my teeth healthy. I was afraid I was at the beginning of the end and on a slow march to dentures. So I got with the program but used the Periogen only once a day because of the expense. After I used it for about a week to 10 days I could see that the tartar was starting to fall off my teeth. Yes, you got that right, fall off. In fact during one blasting session with the Waterpik, a big piece fell off into the sink. I saved it. I wanted to keep it as proof, I just could not believe it. Before my first bottle of Periogen was all used, there was for the most part no visible tartar on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;  I thought I was done so I didn&#x27;t order any more. However over time I could see small traces returning and I bought a 3 pack to keep the tartar at bay forever. It would seem the tartar which came back in extremely small amounts has been harderto deal with or maybe I am just more lazy in my treatment regiment.&lt;br /&gt; In the end I would say if you have visible tartar on your teeth, you are really going to enjoy this stuff.</li>
            <li> this product really works at keeping tartar under control</li>
            <li> The heading above is exactly right.  i was looking to get an extra WaterPik (travel version), and looked closely at Amazon&#x27;s list of things people buy with the WaterPiks.  This was the most-promoted water solution, as opposed to buying specialty tips.  So after extensively reading through a zillion reviews, I bought a bottle of Periogen.  Then after using the product a couple times, I went back and re-read the reviews, as well as the company&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science behind Periogen is more than a little on the skimpy side.  You can tell by reading the homeopathic-type gushing reviews on their home page.  OTOH, it doesn&#x27;t seem there&#x27;s anything terribly WRONG with the product, just that it&#x27;s been weakened to the point that most consumers without OCD can&#x27;t hurt themselves with it (and sue Periogen).  To make this product work better, apparently you need to up the amount of fluoride considerably, which has negative consequences, especially if you swallow the solution.  But then Periogen becomes a drug, and is subject to a lot closer monitoring by the FDA.  so the amount of fluoride is deliberately kept low.  Thus the Periogen people make an awful lot of money selling what&#x27;s essentially 3-ounce bottles of salt for $30 a pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good side -- discounting the placebo effect, this stuff used in a WaterPik does a fair job of blasting the visible tartar at your gum line.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because there are ultrafine particles in solution, or what.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any chemical interaction going on, any more than there is when you turn a fire hose on to douse a house fire.  (Perhaps a better analogy would be adding detergent to a pressure washer used for cleaning your house?)  This product also doesn&#x27;t do anything to whiten your teeth.  That&#x27;s a different product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy a second bottle of Periogen, but I won&#x27;t return this one.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and research other things to put in my WaterPik.  Of course, the smartest way to have begun this process would have just been to ask my dentist. :)</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, was tricked into buying this product a lot of paid reviews.</li>
            <li> Great product and I recommend it highly. Removes any plaque with ease and you should notice a difference in any tartar (hardened plaque) within a couple of uses depending on how bad it is. I would suggest being patient if it is really bad. Still I would assume a difference should be noted by 1-1/2 weeks. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that I&#x27;ve developed an annoying habit of licking my front teeth as a person would do immediately after an office cleaning. I have found that I can create a clicking sound as well doing this so I have developed this really bad habit that I cannot seem to control. I have to be conscience that I am doing it, and care that I am as well lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it works rather well and I will continue to use it until it gets so popular that the prices skyrocket.</li>
            <li> This really works but TOO PRICEY!</li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole bottle but cannot see any improvement in my excessive tarter buildup. I followed the instructions but it seems like a waste of time - especially since this item is rather pricey.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily for six months and more and then followed up with waterpik every day and periogen about once a week. You get a great fresh feeling and superb plaque removal. Bottom line I think its the waterpik and not the periogen that makes the biggest difference. My conclusion is based on a tiny bit of tartar missed by the hygienist a year ago. After all these months of periogen the tartar is clearly not dissolved.</li>
            <li> Used with the water flosser, this product does exactly what it advertises.  Your teeth are squeaky clean.  I would recommend this rinse to children over 12 years old and adults.  I recently purchased both a water flosser and the rinse at the same time.  This is my first experience with the rinse..</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product makes my teeth feel so clean. It does a great job! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> takes all the stuff off your teeth,, amazing ,, try it  its works great,,, you will love it,, like nothing i have used before</li>
            <li> Have used this product of over a year now, and I have to say it works when used properly. The periodontist wanted to perform $7500 worth of  work on my gums because of an infection that I had. I used this with the syringe that periogen sells in order to get in between the teeth and gums better. Within 4 weeks there was a vast improvement and within  3 months my gums were their healthy pink self again. The main thing with this product it to make sure that you can get it to where the problems are. I used periogen&#x27;s syringe with the tip sliced on an angle to better inject the product in between my teeth and gums. the bleeding stopped within days, that&#x27;s how I know it was working. Every once in a while I would find a small piece of tarter/plaque/calculus in my mouth so it was performing just as the manufacturer said it would. You have nothing to loose by trying this product as I believe that they offer a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I did not feel difference. Used for six months</li>
            <li> Im still using this product with the waterpik about 2 weeks now. I have had some tarter break off. My teeth are in bad shape but I believe this product is helping.  Not a miracle but not a total rip off either,</li>
            <li> This really worked the strengthen my teeth as well as soften the plaque. Together with the scrapers that I bought, I got rid if most of my plaque in my own home.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time. Recommended by my hygenist. Arrived quickly, new.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea if this really did anything, and it&#x27;s super expensive.  I used this consistently, and my dentist didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  Honestly...I think it&#x27;s just BAKING SODA...I think it&#x27;s essentially just an mild abrasive that is safe to use under the gum-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have a hard time recommending this to anyone...especially at its price.</li>
            <li> used 2 full bottles, no effect</li>
            <li> The Periogen Deep Cleaning Oral Rinse really does a decent job of whitening teeth. I not only use it as a rinse,&lt;br /&gt;but sometimes brush my teeth with the product. I noticed a difference in under a week. You just have to keep&lt;br /&gt;using it as you would your toothpaste it to keep your teeth looking their best.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any noticeable difference or change on my teeth so can&#x27;t say anything positive.  Have been using this for over a month.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again since it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Leaving a real nice clean feeling to your teeth, like you have just had them professionaly cleaned. has improved my tartar</li>
            <li> I originally bought this back in January of 2012.  Didn&#x27;t actually start using it until I purchased a WaterPik a couple of months ago.  I am honestly amazed at how well this has worked.  I don&#x27;t tend to accumulate massive amounts of tartar on my teeth -- just an average amount (I imagine) -- nor do I have cavities or other dental problems.  However, I had not gone to the dentist in ages, probably four years or more, so I did have a noticeable amount of tartar, especially on the bottom teeth.  It was noticeable to me, but probably not so much to someone standing in front of me at conversation distance.  If you had looked me in the mouth like a gift horse it would have been obvious that I had tartar.  Regardless, I was determined to find a solution to this since I don&#x27;t have dental insurance and I really can&#x27;t stand a dental hygienist scraping tartar off my teeth -- yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this despite the reviews stating that \\&quot;this is a scam/ripoff\\&quot; or what-have-you mostly because a) I figured I would give it a try, at the worst I lose 27 bucks, at the most I don&#x27;t have to see the evil hygienist, and b) half the time people that make bad comments in the reviews seem to have some weird personal vendetta with the seller or maker of a product.  It becomes obvious when you look at their other reviews: half the time they don&#x27;t have any other reviews.  Suffice it to say I am skeptical of some of the bad reviews on here, especially since using this for two months myself and seeing that it definitely worked, and worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having slight gum tenderness and very slight bleeding in a couple spots when I flossed.  I HATE flossing as my teeth are close together, so I don&#x27;t do it as often as I should (maybe once or twice a week, for shame!)  Within a week the tenderness/bleeding had resolved.  After a month&#x27;s use my gums were really healthy and the tartar was almost completely dissolved.  Two months later and things are even better; I am truly shocked thatthis works so well.  It is now pleasant to floss (floss slips right through my teeth -- no tartar to get stuck on)and my teeth even look whiter.  Periogen and the WaterPik are fantastic together and I would certainly recommend that they be used together as I think this makes a significant difference in results.  I use about 12ozs of warm water in the WaterPik along with a scoop and a half of the Periogen  almost every night before bed (sometimes I miss a night or two) and after brushing my teeth with Biotene.</li>
            <li> The greatest everyone should get some, taking my tarter off my teeth.....</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! If you want a fresher mouth and better looking teeth you need to get this stuff! The shipping was fast and the product is great!</li>
            <li> It was not sealed. Open product. Was disappointed and a little scared to use . It appeared in good condition. but it being opened i would not chance using it. If it was not opened i would be anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. When used with the water pick, it maximizes the sensation of clean and sanitized in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college kid who can&#x27;t afford dental. I have a front tooth with a pus pocket, loose teeth, and tender gums that bleed eating bread. I have such terrible tartar that if you actually look you can see it (I do brush twice a day; flossing was just something I unfortunately picked up on late in the game). Using periogen and a water pik and pik pocket extension, I&#x27;m starting to see a slow shift. Let me emphasize SLOW. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure. But for me at least it seems to be working. I also use arm and hammer healthy gums toothpaste, smartmouth activated mouthwash, and listerene.</li>
            <li> I had severe plaque forming on my teeth and got really scared! I tried periogen, gengigel, oil pulling, tumeric. My teeth then started feeling loose and I was panicking. I hadn&#x27;t been dentist for years and I thought these home remedies will cure things. I was mistake, I finally plucked up the courage and went to the dentist. He cleaned my teeth and it worked amazingly. Periogen won&#x27;t help if you have a hardened plaque build up. It&#x27;s also expensive! Hope this helps.</li>
