            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Joico Restorative Oil works like magic when used with leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It adds shine and strength, eliminates static and frizz and helps prevent split ends.</li>
            <li>I love Joico and I LOVE this oil</li>
            <li>So glad it is sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I knew that I would need to find and invest in better products.</li>
            <li>and I am SOOO glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a bit of my favorite volumizing mousse to my roots</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look healthy and even adds a lot of body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>but I found it:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Joico products for many years now and LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I love Joico products already, but the [[ASIN:B002NYERPU</li>
            <li>This product did not aid or restore my hair to a healthy shine or texture.</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It is really great, made my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>I am not quite sure if it works as leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li>my favorite.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how these guys did it, but this oil gives you the benefit of shine and healthy look without the oily feel.</li>
            <li>Thank you Joico for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Love this......</li>
            <li>Used it with my flat iron and the results are just as great!</li>
            <li>Smell is great and it is now a product i can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>Although I have always had strong healthy hair and have been able to perm it as well as color, the aging process was having its effects.  </li>
            <li>Love this product works excellent on my hair which is very dry from all the chemicals I use</li>
            <li>My hair retained it&#x27;s glistening shine and softness and almost seemed like it shaped and styled more easily somehow.</li>

            <li>Good shine without too much of a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Originally purchased it from my hair stylist, but she was out when I needed more.</li>
            <li>After applying my hair felt softer and more hydrated even though it was still significantly</li>
            <li>I was in love with the original version</li>
            <li>the price and the amount you are getting for it its just right and worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair easy to comb and it does not have an oily/greasy feeling.  </li>

            <li>It is a great product and the vender I will use in the future</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing and will change your life!sse doesn&#x27;t really count here)</li>
            <li>It is a couple of dollars more but sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Great product if you have curly Hair and want to straighten with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s worth trying it out!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure at first about an oil.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I am so grateful to Joico for coming up with this awesome product that I have decided to do so.</li>
            <li>Just clean, silky shine and manageability....</li>
            <li>Wow, it leaves my hair super shiny and very healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and seller shipped it super fast!</li>
            <li>This serum is not that good, I saw better results with other products...</li>
            <li>Even when using multiple products to fight frizz and dryness, my hair has NEVER looked as good as it did with just this one (okay 2, but the mousse doesn&#x27;t really count here)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft &amp; adds nice shine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t color my hair, but I do have super curly hair that I keep super curly.</li>
            <li>My hair was shedding, but this product had provided tremendous help.</li>
            <li>I think it makes my hair feel softer and it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>My new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>using this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner will be my new regiment for years to come :)</li>
            <li>Luckily I was right</li>
            <li>It is very helpful for my wavy hair during humid days, I like the smell and the fact that is light</li>
            <li>so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put about 8 pumps&#x27; worth in my hands, rub them together and spread it through my hair</li>
            <li>Some squirts of this stuff through my hair and it stays soft and touchable all day, plus I now have women telling me they love how my hair smells.</li>
            <li>I add 2 pumps of the Joico oil to the styling product &amp; it gives my hair a more natural  &amp; relaxed shine.</li>
            <li>Joico is by far my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my hair soft and shiny, it has also helped my split ends.</li>
            <li>and I hope they will not reformulate or do anything that will take this feature away that is so rare for hair products.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant but the smell completely goes away after the hair is dry (which is fine by me).  </li>
            <li>It also has a light pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of hair oils and serums and like this one the best.</li>
            <li>My hair slid through my flat iron MUCH more smoothly.</li>
            <li>My hair slid through my flat iron MUCH more smoothly.</li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>It can be hard to keep hair that long in good condition, and people constantly tell me how beautiful and healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original, soft, comb friendly condition.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I dry my hair and am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading reviews and my own personal experience with the line (just not this particular product).</li>
            <li>feels smooth, hydrated, soft  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll leave your hair soft, silky, smooth, shiny, &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li>It took me a year to use up the first bottle I had.</li>
            <li>My hair is not damaged, but i need to take care of it more than my regular hair.</li>
            <li>love this item and especially the price!!!!</li>
            <li>Tames the fly aways, and last a long time!</li>
            <li>I have used other oils for my hair and this one compares nicely.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t explain the natural unique aroma</li>
            <li>My hair no longer feels heavy and matted down even though it gets a great conditioning; plus the shiny, healthy look.</li>
            <li>then 1 more pump after I have dried my hair to help give a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Based on all the positive reviews across the web, I decided to try it out</li>
            <li>I have long processed hair that is not fully responsive to the overwhelming # of oils out there.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great product for my type (4a) and will continue to purchase this in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and very curly, this oil helps my hair looks better after blow dry it.</li>
            <li>It really does protect against heat styling and seems to help my hair recover from coloring and heat styling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Given the price, I expected better results.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it helps to smooth the frizzies.</li>
            <li>the whole line really..</li>
            <li>A friend let me try hers before I purchased it which really sold me on it.  </li>
            <li>; like I said, it&#x27;s really a multifaceted product.</li>
            <li>It works really really well.</li>
            <li>it really is everything I had read about it.as</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper on Amazon than it is to buy it from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>but when I started using this product it has made my hair look much healthier</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any different than the cheap stuff I purchase at the grocery store</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter in law who really loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really even better than I expected, and I&#x27;ve been using Joico for almost 30 years.</li>
            <li>I apply it after it is dried soft and smells good .</li>
            <li>I have liked the smell of other oils a little better.  </li>
            <li>The scent is reminiscent of Argan oil but much softer and clean than the tropical and coconut scent I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever cause a little goes a long way, and just makes my hair look and feel GREAT.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look so lucious and healthy without leaving it with a lot of grease and residue like other products</li>
            <li>so, I am certain when I receive my new version</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Love this, but don&#x27;t use too much as it can be heavy.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>I thought the hairdresser was kidding when she said my hair was frizzy, but when I washed it later and looked she was right as it was really frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I did high lights over box cooled hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my little magic bottle for hair</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d a small gift pack last year with various products by JOICO and immediately liked how it made my fine</li>
            <li>I have thin hair with rough ends but this makes it silky smooth, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is truly worth every penny, and I always have several on hand</li>
            <li>And, with most serums and oils, they leave my hands with and odd oily feel, but not with this!</li>
            <li>And, with most serums and oils, they leave my hands with and odd oily feel, but not with this!</li>
            <li>I discovered a new (-&gt; to ME)</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t think I could live without it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hooked all my friends on it, and non of us can live without it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to receive my new bottle.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it where I live and was worried it had been discontinued -</li>
            <li>I like this product very much, this is the second time I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Obviously I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I was bleeching my hair few years ago, now i&#x27;m dying my hair light blonde or ash blonde or anything Light or ExLight....</li>
            <li>First time use... added it to damp hair right of the shower and air dried.</li>
            <li>I bought more on Amazon for half the price of my local walk-in stylists shop.</li>
            <li>I recently got highlights and my hair felt dry, with only one use of this serum my hair looks and feels so much better....</li>
            <li>I really like this product with damp or dry hair, it does tame my frizz :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any clear difference in shine or manageability.  </li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone especially if you have straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and looked healthier after using it.</li>
            <li>It helps keep your hair soft but you have to use ALOT</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and it controls the frizz of my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls soft and separate, and color doesn&#x27;t fade between visits to my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>(obviously, if your hair is shorter, you won&#x27;t need as much).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several Joico products, and I don&#x27;t really like any of them.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The results were immediate (shine, soft and managable)  </li>
            <li>Starting at my ends on towel dried hair, I worked my way upwards so that the ends and lengths received more product than my roots.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and silky and really shiny after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to use to much of it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This particular product has just restored my trust back into hair care</li>
            <li>I have tried many different oils, but they usually leave your hair feeling and looking oily.</li>
            <li>I had had fantastic results with Joico&#x27;s K Pak conditioning treatment in the past, so I was looking to repurchase when I came across this product.</li>
            <li>Every time I try something new, I run back to this product.</li>
            <li>I have coarse asian hair that gets dry on the ends, and this Joico product works better than all other hair oils I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and less dry.</li>
            <li>scalp is very greasy, so I have to be careful when applying oils to my hair.  </li>
            <li>And I gladly tell them my secret - Joico Restorative Oil.  </li>
            <li>product has since taken the place of all the other serums and oils I have, and I really can&#x27;t imagine ever going without it.</li>

            <li>lot of breakage, helps prevent new split ends and dry ends too.</li>
            <li>It took 4 bleaching sessions as the red stained my natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I am not really sure if it works any better than your typical hair oil.  </li>
            <li>Four pumps in long hair makes blowdrying faster, heat protected and soft.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing uglier than long stringy, two-day old hair.</li>
            <li>A few months ago, I went blonde for the first time and fried my bangs.</li>
            <li>My hair was a fragile, processed hot mess!</li>

            <li> So glad it is sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I knew that I would need to find and invest in better products.</li>
            <li> and I am SOOO glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a bit of my favorite volumizing mousse to my roots</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look healthy and even adds a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> but I found it:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joico products for many years now and LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I love Joico products already, but the [[ASIN:B002NYERPU</li>
            <li> This product did not aid or restore my hair to a healthy shine or texture.</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It is really great, made my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure if it works as leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> my favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how these guys did it, but this oil gives you the benefit of shine and healthy look without the oily feel.</li>
            <li> Thank you Joico for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Love this......</li>
            <li> Used it with my flat iron and the results are just as great!</li>
            <li> Smell is great and it is now a product i can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> Although I have always had strong healthy hair and have been able to perm it as well as color, the aging process was having its effects.  </li>
            <li> Love this product works excellent on my hair which is very dry from all the chemicals I use</li>
            <li> My hair retained it&#x27;s glistening shine and softness and almost seemed like it shaped and styled more easily somehow.</li>

            <li> Good shine without too much of a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Originally purchased it from my hair stylist, but she was out when I needed more.</li>
            <li> After applying my hair felt softer and more hydrated even though it was still significantly</li>
            <li> I was in love with the original version</li>
            <li> the price and the amount you are getting for it its just right and worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair easy to comb and it does not have an oily/greasy feeling.  </li>

            <li> It is a great product and the vender I will use in the future</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing and will change your life!sse doesn&#x27;t really count here)</li>
            <li> It is a couple of dollars more but sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Great product if you have curly Hair and want to straighten with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s worth trying it out!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure at first about an oil.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I am so grateful to Joico for coming up with this awesome product that I have decided to do so.</li>
            <li> Just clean, silky shine and manageability....</li>
            <li> Wow, it leaves my hair super shiny and very healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and seller shipped it super fast!</li>
            <li> This serum is not that good, I saw better results with other products...</li>
            <li> Even when using multiple products to fight frizz and dryness, my hair has NEVER looked as good as it did with just this one (okay 2, but the mousse doesn&#x27;t really count here)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft &amp; adds nice shine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair, but I do have super curly hair that I keep super curly.</li>
            <li> My hair was shedding, but this product had provided tremendous help.</li>
            <li> I think it makes my hair feel softer and it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product.  </li>
            <li> using this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner will be my new regiment for years to come :)</li>
            <li> Luckily I was right</li>
            <li> It is very helpful for my wavy hair during humid days, I like the smell and the fact that is light</li>
            <li> so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put about 8 pumps&#x27; worth in my hands, rub them together and spread it through my hair</li>
            <li> Some squirts of this stuff through my hair and it stays soft and touchable all day, plus I now have women telling me they love how my hair smells.</li>
            <li> I add 2 pumps of the Joico oil to the styling product &amp; it gives my hair a more natural  &amp; relaxed shine.</li>
            <li> Joico is by far my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair soft and shiny, it has also helped my split ends.</li>
            <li> and I hope they will not reformulate or do anything that will take this feature away that is so rare for hair products.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant but the smell completely goes away after the hair is dry (which is fine by me).  </li>
            <li> It also has a light pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of hair oils and serums and like this one the best.</li>
            <li> My hair slid through my flat iron MUCH more smoothly.</li>
            <li> My hair slid through my flat iron MUCH more smoothly.</li>
            <li> She was right.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to keep hair that long in good condition, and people constantly tell me how beautiful and healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original, soft, comb friendly condition.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I dry my hair and am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews and my own personal experience with the line (just not this particular product).</li>
            <li> feels smooth, hydrated, soft  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll leave your hair soft, silky, smooth, shiny, &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> It took me a year to use up the first bottle I had.</li>
            <li> My hair is not damaged, but i need to take care of it more than my regular hair.</li>
            <li> love this item and especially the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Tames the fly aways, and last a long time!</li>
            <li> I have used other oils for my hair and this one compares nicely.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t explain the natural unique aroma</li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels heavy and matted down even though it gets a great conditioning; plus the shiny, healthy look.</li>
            <li> then 1 more pump after I have dried my hair to help give a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Based on all the positive reviews across the web, I decided to try it out</li>
            <li> I have long processed hair that is not fully responsive to the overwhelming # of oils out there.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great product for my type (4a) and will continue to purchase this in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and very curly, this oil helps my hair looks better after blow dry it.</li>
            <li> It really does protect against heat styling and seems to help my hair recover from coloring and heat styling.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Given the price, I expected better results.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it helps to smooth the frizzies.</li>
            <li> the whole line really..</li>
            <li> A friend let me try hers before I purchased it which really sold me on it.  </li>
            <li> ; like I said, it&#x27;s really a multifaceted product.</li>
            <li> It works really really well.</li>
            <li> it really is everything I had read about it.as</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper on Amazon than it is to buy it from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> but when I started using this product it has made my hair look much healthier</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any different than the cheap stuff I purchase at the grocery store</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law who really loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really even better than I expected, and I&#x27;ve been using Joico for almost 30 years.</li>
            <li> I apply it after it is dried soft and smells good .</li>
            <li> I have liked the smell of other oils a little better.  </li>
            <li> The scent is reminiscent of Argan oil but much softer and clean than the tropical and coconut scent I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever cause a little goes a long way, and just makes my hair look and feel GREAT.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look so lucious and healthy without leaving it with a lot of grease and residue like other products</li>
            <li> so, I am certain when I receive my new version</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Love this, but don&#x27;t use too much as it can be heavy.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> I thought the hairdresser was kidding when she said my hair was frizzy, but when I washed it later and looked she was right as it was really frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I did high lights over box cooled hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my little magic bottle for hair</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d a small gift pack last year with various products by JOICO and immediately liked how it made my fine</li>
            <li> I have thin hair with rough ends but this makes it silky smooth, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is truly worth every penny, and I always have several on hand</li>
            <li> And, with most serums and oils, they leave my hands with and odd oily feel, but not with this!</li>
            <li> And, with most serums and oils, they leave my hands with and odd oily feel, but not with this!</li>
            <li> I discovered a new (-&gt; to ME)</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t think I could live without it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hooked all my friends on it, and non of us can live without it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to receive my new bottle.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it where I live and was worried it had been discontinued -</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, this is the second time I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Obviously I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was bleeching my hair few years ago, now i&#x27;m dying my hair light blonde or ash blonde or anything Light or ExLight....</li>
            <li> First time use... added it to damp hair right of the shower and air dried.</li>
            <li> I bought more on Amazon for half the price of my local walk-in stylists shop.</li>
            <li> I recently got highlights and my hair felt dry, with only one use of this serum my hair looks and feels so much better....</li>
            <li> I really like this product with damp or dry hair, it does tame my frizz :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any clear difference in shine or manageability.  </li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone especially if you have straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft and looked healthier after using it.</li>
            <li> It helps keep your hair soft but you have to use ALOT</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and it controls the frizz of my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls soft and separate, and color doesn&#x27;t fade between visits to my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> (obviously, if your hair is shorter, you won&#x27;t need as much).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Joico products, and I don&#x27;t really like any of them.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The results were immediate (shine, soft and managable)  </li>
            <li> Starting at my ends on towel dried hair, I worked my way upwards so that the ends and lengths received more product than my roots.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and silky and really shiny after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to use to much of it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This particular product has just restored my trust back into hair care</li>
            <li> I have tried many different oils, but they usually leave your hair feeling and looking oily.</li>
            <li> I had had fantastic results with Joico&#x27;s K Pak conditioning treatment in the past, so I was looking to repurchase when I came across this product.</li>
            <li> Every time I try something new, I run back to this product.</li>
            <li> I have coarse asian hair that gets dry on the ends, and this Joico product works better than all other hair oils I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and less dry.</li>
            <li> scalp is very greasy, so I have to be careful when applying oils to my hair.  </li>
            <li> And I gladly tell them my secret - Joico Restorative Oil.  </li>
            <li> product has since taken the place of all the other serums and oils I have, and I really can&#x27;t imagine ever going without it.</li>

            <li> lot of breakage, helps prevent new split ends and dry ends too.</li>
            <li> It took 4 bleaching sessions as the red stained my natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure if it works any better than your typical hair oil.  </li>
            <li> Four pumps in long hair makes blowdrying faster, heat protected and soft.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing uglier than long stringy, two-day old hair.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I went blonde for the first time and fried my bangs.</li>
            <li> My hair was a fragile, processed hot mess!</li>
            <li> have very long, straight hair, almost down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> This product is most definitely a MUST for anyone who colors their hair, has dry hair, dull hair, split ends, curly or wavy hair (sections of my hair are wavy, and other section are stick straight and nothing has worked like this to get the sections in sync), breaking hair, frizzy hair, hard to manage and style hair.</li>

            <li> I flat iron and color my hair regularly and</li>
            <li> next test was the flat iron.</li>

            <li> I wanted to see how it would hold up without using my flat iron heat protecting spray.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how it would hold up without using my flat iron heat protecting spray.</li>
            <li> sometimes even a moisturizing conditioner will make my hair look greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li> No major improvements were seen.</li>
            <li> (this is not a lot), especially in the front where it is usually dry and fly-away.</li>
            <li> I recently had my already dry and over processed hair cut into an A-line bob with balayage highlights.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to refresh my dry roots and on damp hair before blowdrying.</li>
            <li> next day, my hair was still shiny, still soft, and the styling had held up with no sign of being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Also, the pump twists to a an open and closed position, which is a BIG plus for me.</li>

            <li> Also, the pump twists to a an open and closed position, which is a BIG plus for me.</li>
            <li> When I wear weave I add a pump or two to add some shine ( I buy natural remi hair with little to no luster).</li>
            <li> It adds shine and makes your feel a bit softer, just like any other similar product .</li>
            <li> It actually somehow makes my hair dry faster, which I was reminded of one day not to long ago when I forgot to apply it, and was wondering what was wrong with my hair as I was blowdrying it because it just didn&#x27;t feel right and was taking forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add li&#x27;l after when its dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, finicky hair.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my hair when damp and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I use 15-20 pups every time I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> We all have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t read the ingredients, it must not contain a lot of alcohol because it doen&#x27;t dry out our hair.</li>
            <li> massage four or five good-sized squirts on my hair before I blow dry</li>
            <li> my hair looks so dry but</li>
            <li> My hair looks so frizzled and dry because I take medication which dries out my skin and my hair, age(I&#x27;m 46), plus I have my hair highlighted every 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I would braid, pre-wet, condition her hair in hopes of getting it into comb-able condition once again.&lt;br /&gt;After trying all my hair repair products on my daughter&#x27;s impossibly dry and perma-tangled hair, I found a bottle of Joice K Pak Restorative Oil that I bought a couple years ago and used it on her her.</li>
            <li> the ends of my hair were dry</li>
            <li> It does not work as well on dry hair as it tends to make it too oily.</li>
            <li> so my hair is naturally dry.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and use this every day when I blow dry, I use 5 pumps.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with loose cap and had leaked quite a bit in transit.</li>
            <li> I thru the entire bottle down the drain...along with my money.</li>
            <li> You can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair &amp; the styling product sometimes looks very rigid.  </li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every oil  - nothing does all of the things joico has packed in-to this complex oil treatment.</li>
            <li> very damaged hair, exhausted, and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> No doubt  - this works on a wide range of hair types +</li>
            <li> I use 3 pumps while my hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> I put 2 drops into my palms and rub into wet hair.  </li>
            <li> so I use 3-4 pumps on my wet hair and</li>
            <li> The post-swim shower was almost enough for us to give up swimming (think raking through strawlike, wet cotton balls and add screaming, crying, and threats of hair cuts).</li>
            <li> I usually use 3 pumps and apply it to the ends of my hair, and whatever is left I appy to my roots.</li>
            <li> I used other products before but this is the one for me</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to friends as well as other products in the line: the shampoo and the conditioner for color treated hair,</li>
            <li> Other brands I have tried are organix, agadir, and sedu.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from my local TJ Maxx store for around 10 dollars I ran out of it and found out Amazon sold it.</li>
            <li> Started using this about a year ago instead of \\&quot;hair food\\&quot; or other greasy products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Add a little to damp hair.blow dry, curl, iron its amazingy silky.</li>
            <li> Obviously, if you have short or thin hair, then, no problem.  </li>
            <li> (Bed Head Totally Baked Volumizing and Prepping Hair Meringue) and blow dried my hair with a round boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Four stars not because anything is wrong with it, but I didn&#x27;t see much difference in it any other serum products.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I was extremely worried about the bleaching due to a previous experience which took a few years to grow out and correct, but since I had my bf&#x27;s cousin ( a Master Colorist and Stylist at Aveda) doing my hair, I trusted she wouldn&#x27;t screw up.</li>
            <li> But even though this is an oil, it never makes my hair greasy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t way down your hair and adds lots of shine.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and manageable without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you to all the other reviewers!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even gotten close to half the bottle yet</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even gotten close to half the bottle yet</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll be relieved to have this back in my life ( seriously)</li>
            <li> The consistency is quite thick and similar to other oils I have, but is not overly greasy or slick like products with dimethicone.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair tame without the price of some other name brands in which I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It does weigh my hair down after a day of not washing it, but nothing a little waterless shampoo won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re going to have a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; mess if it gets too close to your scalp.</li>
            <li> Three small pumps smoothed through wet hair after a shower makes it manageable, sleek, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Product works wonders on my long thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was looking dry and dull.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 months.</li>
            <li> provides a nice finish especially in cold air winter Michiga,.</li>
            <li> My daughter is in the water for approximately 4-6 hours a week at the local (heavily chlorinated) pool and has kept that routine for over a year.</li>
            <li> I have a dry and unhealthy hair , I used hair color lot .This</li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;ve used all the hair oils and serums out there, and they usually leave my hair greasy and dont help at all.</li>

            <li> No more fuzz.</li>
            <li> No more breakage.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this forever. Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I would like to start with a sentence :  I Cant speak for everyone! cause u know that all of us have different hair types, etc. ...&lt;br /&gt;anyway, I had to write a review about the Joico K Pak Color Therapy Restorative Oil 3.4 oz!&lt;br /&gt;I was trying many oils, even the expensive (to me) Moroccan Oil - where I have purchased 0.85oz (Not even 1 OZ!!!!) for around $15-$16!&lt;br /&gt;smell Is nice - vanilla somewhat...very pleasant...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried HSI oil 2 oz for I think $15 or so... was ok and I cant add anything else!&lt;br /&gt; between those two hair oils and how they work on my hair ---&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I was bleeching my hair few years ago, now i&#x27;m dying my hair light blonde or ash blonde or anything Light or ExLight....&lt;br /&gt;Still,.. those two oils TO ME work the same...&lt;br /&gt;Yet I discovered a new (-&gt; to ME) Joico Oil! and works wonders to my hair! feels smooth, hydrated, soft  just awesome! i&#x27;m enjoing my hair a hell lot more with the Joico Oil, than the Moroccan Oil or HSI...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not cheap, I just want to find a good oil for my hair and with HSI or MO I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but this one its so great, gosh!&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders to my hair! And it&#x27;s worth trying it out! the price and the amount you are getting for it its just right and worth it!!! so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I know for sure - I will be re-purchasing this one!</li>
            <li> I adore this product! It is a beauty must have for me! I get stopped all the time for the shine in my hair and I always tell them about this product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. It really does protect against heat styling and seems to help my hair recover from coloring and heat styling. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a product that works so well it&#x27;s truly amazing. The product is called Joico K-Pak Color Therapy Oil. It&#x27;s my little magic bottle for hair that&#x27;s what I named it. A small amount goes a long ways. Why don&#x27;t you try a bottle for yourself. It&#x27;ll leave your hair soft, silky, smooth, shiny, &amp; manageable. This particular product has just restored my trust back into hair care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gladys&lt;br /&gt;Orange County, CA</li>
            <li> Four pumps in long hair makes blowdrying faster, heat protected and soft. Smell is great and it is now a product i can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> Product arrived with loose cap and had leaked quite a bit in transit. When packaged it was not secured to prevent leaking.</li>
            <li> I love this! Originally purchased it from my hair stylist, but she was out when I needed more. I put about 8 pumps&#x27; worth in my hands, rub them together and spread it through my hair (this is not a lot), especially in the front where it is usually dry and fly-away. This makes my hair look shiny and smooth--takes away the dryness. I use it every time I dry my hair and am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the Joico shampoo and conditioner.  I am not really sure if it works any better than your typical hair oil.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any clear difference in shine or manageability.  Given the price, I expected better results.</li>
            <li> 1WK of use.in love with it. Add a little to damp hair.blow dry, curl, iron its amazingy silky.I have colored curly thin hair but a lot of it.so shinny like out of a salon.I add li&#x27;l after when its dry. So impressed!! Happy  me.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful for my wavy hair during humid days, I like the smell and the fact that is light</li>
            <li> I have used other oils for my hair and this one compares nicely.  I have liked the smell of other oils a little better.  However, there is nothing wrong with this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since my hair was severely burned at a bad salon.  Now I don&#x27;t think I could live without it.</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, finicky hair. Trust me, I&#x27;ve used all the hair oils and serums out there, and they usually leave my hair greasy and dont help at all. This is the first product that has made my hair shiny and beautiful without leaving it greasy. I usually use 3 pumps and apply it to the ends of my hair, and whatever is left I appy to my roots. Plus, my haircolor lasts longer! And, with most serums and oils, they leave my hands with and odd oily feel, but not with this! Its truly amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. My hair has improved a lot. I used other products before but this is the one for me</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I see no difference in product quality between buying it in a beauty store or on amazon. Great product for smoothing, shine and overall hair health.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioner at all anymore, this is all you need!</li>
            <li> It adds shine and makes your feel a bit softer, just like any other similar product . No major improvements were seen.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I apply it to my hair when damp and then blow dry.  My hair always looks fabulous I get so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without it now.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone especially if you have straight hair.</li>
            <li> I flat iron and color my hair regularly and this oil makes my hair feel SO smooth and helps control my fly-aways. A few months ago, I went blonde for the first time and fried my bangs. After one week of using this product and the same shampoo/conditioner, my bangs feel wonderful. I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair, but I do have super curly hair that I keep super curly. Some squirts of this stuff through my hair and it stays soft and touchable all day, plus I now have women telling me they love how my hair smells. Double bonus!</li>
            <li> good morning! today when I looked in the making of my credit card , this charging twice the $ 10.46 Joico oil , you delivered two? or charged 2 ? I look back .</li>
            <li> Love my Joico Therapy Oil and was glad to order on line cheaper then in beauty supply. I have been using it for years and love the shine for my blond hair.</li>
            <li> Liquid gold! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 years now. I did high lights over box cooled hair. Some of you know what this means- very damaged hair, exhausted, and unmanageable. My hair drinks this oil and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy. I use 15-20 pups every time I dry my hair. It turns it into silk. I&#x27;ve hooked all my friends on it, and non of us can live without it. Try it, you will love it too. Nothing else even compares to it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product with damp or dry hair, it does tame my frizz :)</li>
            <li> Love this, but don&#x27;t use too much as it can be heavy.  My favorite brand for hair care.  Try the silk result shampoo and conditioner too-my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of hair oils and serums and like this one the best. I have thin hair with rough ends but this makes it silky smooth, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Wow, it leaves my hair super shiny and very healthy looking.  It&#x27;s really even better than I expected, and I&#x27;ve been using Joico for almost 30 years.</li>
            <li> I thought the hairdresser was kidding when she said my hair was frizzy, but when I washed it later and looked she was right as it was really frizzy.  She said the oil does it, and she said it takes about 3 months to wear off.  She was right.  I thru the entire bottle down the drain...along with my money.</li>
            <li> Four stars not because anything is wrong with it, but I didn&#x27;t see much difference in it any other serum products.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair &amp; the styling product sometimes looks very rigid.  I add 2 pumps of the Joico oil to the styling product &amp; it gives my hair a more natural  &amp; relaxed shine.</li>
            <li> My hair is med. length and semi course and curly. I apply it after it is dried soft and smells good .</li>
            <li> Product works wonders on my long thick curly hair. I always apply it prior to any use with a heated tool. It does weigh my hair down after a day of not washing it, but nothing a little waterless shampoo won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Does not make your hair feel oily and it has a nice smell.  My hair felt so soft and looked healthier after using it.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever cause a little goes a long way, and just makes my hair look and feel GREAT.  Even in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I posted a review already on this vender and product. It is a great product and the vender I will use in the future</li>
            <li> Amazing Product and Customer Service!</li>
            <li> It helps keep your hair soft but you have to use ALOT</li>
            <li> If you need a great restorative hair oil, this one will do everything you need it to; Restore, shine and moisturize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, use it and ENJOY!!! This stuff ROCKS!!!!</li>
            <li> This product gives amazing results in my hair. I had bought it before and couldn&#x27;t find it again. Thank goodness I found it on Amazon. It makes my hair feel soft and it controls the frizz of my curly hair. I bought my daughters and my sister a bottle. We all have dry hair. I haven&#x27;t read the ingredients, it must not contain a lot of alcohol because it doen&#x27;t dry out our hair. You can use it on wet or dry hair. I use it both ways. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Joico Restorative Oil works like magic when used with leave-in conditioner.  It keeps my curls soft and separate, and color doesn&#x27;t fade between visits to my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Love this product works excellent on my hair which is very dry from all the chemicals I use but this restores the look and the shine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about two years.  It is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, straight hair, almost down to my waist.  It can be hard to keep hair that long in good condition, and people constantly tell me how beautiful and healthy my hair is.  And I gladly tell them my secret - Joico Restorative Oil.  And they are always amazed at how well it works for them too - all different hair types seem to benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I massage four or five good-sized squirts on my hair before I blow dry (obviously, if your hair is shorter, you won&#x27;t need as much).  It smells pleasant but the smell completely goes away after the hair is dry (which is fine by me).  It actually somehow makes my hair dry faster, which I was reminded of one day not to long ago when I forgot to apply it, and was wondering what was wrong with my hair as I was blowdrying it because it just didn&#x27;t feel right and was taking forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is very greasy, so I have to be careful when applying oils to my hair.  But even though this is an oil, it never makes my hair greasy or weighed down.  It adds shine and strength, eliminates static and frizz and helps prevent split ends. I tried the mega-hyped Moroccan Oil (another argan oil product) but it cannot hold a candle to this Joico oil.  Plus, Joico is cheaper too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly worth every penny, and I always have several on hand so I never run out.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Does what it says it will do.  I use this daily and it helps to smooth the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I love Joico and I LOVE this oil..I can&#x27;t say enough about it! It makes my hair feel soft and silky and really shiny after flat ironing it. It is an incredible product...the whole line really..AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Great conditioning benefits. My hair was shedding, but this product had provided tremendous help. I have recommended it to friends as well as other products in the line: the shampoo and the conditioner for color treated hair,</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I rec&#x27;d a small gift pack last year with various products by JOICO and immediately liked how it made my fine, color treated hair look.  I have a supply of hundreds of various products which claim to do the &#x27;trick...but none even come close. So glad it is sold on Amazon.  I could not find it sold in any of the stores/malls in my area. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a week as it lasts through daily hair shampooing.  A friend let me try hers before I purchased it which really sold me on it.  Highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> Taking off two stars because altho&#x27; this serum is \\&quot;okay\\&quot;, you&#x27;re going to have a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; mess if it gets too close to your scalp. IF you have an oily scalp, you&#x27;ll have to wash your hair the next day. Obviously, if you have short or thin hair, then, no problem.  Just plan to wash your hair daily.  For us longer haired gals .. yuck!  There&#x27;s nothing uglier than long stringy, two-day old hair. The product doesn&#x27;t actually make my hair oily the 2nd day, but it does look stringy.  I may have to put this serum on the back-burner. I&#x27;ve tried several Joico products, and I don&#x27;t really like any of them.  Unremarkable.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum/oil I have ever used, hands down! I recently had my already dry and over processed hair cut into an A-line bob with balayage highlights. I was extremely worried about the bleaching due to a previous experience which took a few years to grow out and correct, but since I had my bf&#x27;s cousin ( a Master Colorist and Stylist at Aveda) doing my hair, I trusted she wouldn&#x27;t screw up. Luckily I was right and she did a MIRACULOUS job that took about 6 hours. I knew that I would need to find and invest in better products. I had had fantastic results with Joico&#x27;s K Pak conditioning treatment in the past, so I was looking to repurchase when I came across this product. Based on all the positive reviews across the web, I decided to try it out and I am SOOO glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got it, I needed to try it out. I washed and conditioned my hair, dispensed 2 pumps into the palm of my hand and rubbed my hands together to emulsify. Starting at my ends on towel dried hair, I worked my way upwards so that the ends and lengths received more product than my roots. The scent is reminiscent of Argan oil but much softer and clean than the tropical and coconut scent I was expecting. The consistency is quite thick and similar to other oils I have, but is not overly greasy or slick like products with dimethicone. After applying my hair felt softer and more hydrated even though it was still significantly wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a bit of my favorite volumizing mousse to my roots (Bed Head Totally Baked Volumizing and Prepping Hair Meringue) and blow dried my hair with a round boar bristle brush. I couldn&#x27;t believe the shine and softness of my hair. I didn&#x27;t even think it was possible for bleached hair to look and feel like that! It was as though the clouds had parted and angels were singing....seriously. It&#x27;s that good. Even when using multiple products to fight frizz and dryness, my hair has NEVER looked as good as it did with just this one (okay 2, but the mousse doesn&#x27;t really count here) product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next test was the flat iron. I wanted to see how it would hold up without using my flat iron heat protecting spray. My hair slid through my flat iron MUCH more smoothly. My hair retained it&#x27;s glistening shine and softness and almost seemed like it shaped and styled more easily somehow. I was really impressed and happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my hair was still shiny, still soft, and the styling had held up with no sign of being greasy or heavy. My hair had body, and bounce. My hair is extremely thick, so this was rather miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has since taken the place of all the other serums and oils I have, and I really can&#x27;t imagine ever going without it. I have had no problems with product build up, however, I clarify once a week anyway (which I recommend if you use products in general).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since started using the correlating shampoo and conditioner in this Joico line and my results have been even better! This product is most definitely a MUST for anyone who colors their hair, has dry hair, dull hair, split ends, curly or wavy hair (sections of my hair are wavy, and other section are stick straight and nothing has worked like this to get the sections in sync), breaking hair, frizzy hair, hard to manage and style hair. A little goes a long way with this stuff, and the bottle is quite decent in size. I haven&#x27;t even gotten close to half the bottle yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 months. Also, the pump twists to a an open and closed position, which is a BIG plus for me. No oozing product leaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, it&#x27;s amazing and will change your life!sse doesn&#x27;t really count here) product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next test was the flat iron.

            <li> I toss this in after washing my hair (with Joico of course!).  It makes my hair super soft &amp; adds nice shine.  You will not be dissapointed with Joico products.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older my hair looks so dry but therapy restorative oil makes my hair feel and look great and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This restorative oil exceeds expectations. It detangles, moisturizes, adds shine ,protection, smooths the cuticle as it nourishes and fills in chipped pourus hair. I have tried nearly every oil  - nothing does all of the things joico has packed in-to this complex oil treatment. I see that they recently enhanced it &amp; changed the shape of the bottle. No matter which bottle you receive your hair will thank you for it! I was in love with the original version so, I am certain when I receive my new version , I&#x27;ll be relieved to have this back in my life ( seriously) I have long processed hair that is not fully responsive to the overwhelming # of oils out there. i can&#x27;t explain the natural unique aroma but I love it! It does not smell like flowers or chemicals - just good!  My hair has suffered after not using this for a year.  It stops a- lot of breakage, helps prevent new split ends and dry ends too. Joico means it when they named it &amp;#34; restorative&amp;#34; like I said, it&#x27;s really a multifaceted product. Can&#x27;t wait to receive my new bottle. Bye bye tangles - which tears your hair up. Joico oil does aid in styling protection. I only use it with hairspray &amp; sometimes root lifting hair powder.  No doubt  - this works on a wide range of hair types + it soaks into the hair while still leaving a protective layer. Hope you love it! Amazon appears to have the best deals so give it a try. In the salons &amp; stores it is pricey then you add tax on top of that! Thank god for online shopping or I would be dis----tressed !</li>
            <li> This is a great product. If you have not tried it, now is the time.</li>
            <li> A small amount (fingernail) eliminates frizzes and adds texture to my hair.</li>
            <li> It works really really well. Tames the fly aways, and last a long time! Leaves your hair smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so frizzled and dry because I take medication which dries out my skin and my hair, age(I&#x27;m 46), plus I have my hair highlighted every 4 months.  I read a lot of good review on this product so I ordered it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  It makes my hair look so lucious and healthy without leaving it with a lot of grease and residue like other products I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to all the other reviewers!</li>
            <li> So happy with this product...leaves my hair  so shiny and soft..it really is everything I had read about it.as my hair is dyed it is difficult  to keep it from drying out ,this product is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This hair oil is awesome. Make sure not to use to much of it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I wasn&#x27;t so sure at first about an oil.  My hair is very fine and sometimes even a moisturizing conditioner will make my hair look greasy and flat.  I use 3 pumps while my hair is still wet.  It makes my hair look healthy and even adds a lot of body.</li>
            <li> Great for giving hair a bit of a sheen as well as helping with any dryness.</li>
            <li> When I received the product it was opened in a plastic baggie and had spilled out. The product itself works well, just beware of who is selling it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t way down your hair and adds lots of shine.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair that is difficult to brush like I do, you will want some of this oil.  Three small pumps smoothed through wet hair after a shower makes it manageable, sleek, and shiny.  One bottle lasts for months and months.  It took me a year to use up the first bottle I had.</li>
            <li> This product has given me lustrous, healthy, silky hair that has people stopping me in the store to tell me how beautiful my hair is. That is a surprise - I&#x27;m 58! Even my hairdresser, who introduced me to this product, is amazed at the health of my hair after continued use. No more fuzz. No more breakage. Just clean, silky shine and manageability.... and I don&#x27;t even color my hair.  PS - It is so much cheaper on Amazon than it is to buy it from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair easy to comb and it does not have an oily/greasy feeling.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter is in the water for approximately 4-6 hours a week at the local (heavily chlorinated) pool and has kept that routine for over a year. I couldn&#x27;t get her to keep a swim cap on and the damage began to set in. The post-swim shower was almost enough for us to give up swimming (think raking through strawlike, wet cotton balls and add screaming, crying, and threats of hair cuts). I would braid, pre-wet, condition her hair in hopes of getting it into comb-able condition once again.&lt;br /&gt;After trying all my hair repair products on my daughter&#x27;s impossibly dry and perma-tangled hair, I found a bottle of Joice K Pak Restorative Oil that I bought a couple years ago and used it on her her. What a difference! I bought more on Amazon for half the price of my local walk-in stylists shop. It&#x27;s as close as I can get to having her hair back to it&#x27;s original, soft, comb friendly condition.</li>
            <li> the ends of my hair were dry but when I started using this product it has made my hair look much healthier</li>
            <li> My beautician used this and with my permed hair it is the perfect product for shine and manageability I highly recommend</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever used on my hair!  It takes away the frizz, fly a ways, and makes it smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with thin/medium frizzy hair. This is the best hair oil!! Leaves hair silky and manageable without weighing it down. I apply it to my wet hair before blow drying for the best results. It does not work as well on dry hair as it tends to make it too oily. Other brands I have tried are organix, agadir, and sedu. Joico is by far my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Lots of shine and moisture.  I put this on under a plastic cap and sit in the sun for an hour.  My hair is super soft and less dry.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from my local TJ Maxx store for around 10 dollars I ran out of it and found out Amazon sold it. It is a couple of dollars more but sooo worth it. I literally use two to three pumps rub my hands together and massage it in my hair... When I wear weave I add a pump or two to add some shine ( I buy natural remi hair with little to no luster). Overall, it is a great product for my type (4a) and will continue to purchase this in the near future.</li>
            <li> This oil dissolves wonderfully and will not leave your hair greasy. It also has a light pleasant scent that is not overwhelming. However, it did not provide the shine I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years, love it!! I couldn&#x27;t find it where I live and was worried it had been discontinued - but I found it:)</li>
            <li> I have a dry and unhealthy hair , I used hair color lot .This is the first product that has made my hair shiny and beautiful without leaving it greasy. It can reach even  to my roots. Plus, my hair-color lasts longer! And, with most serums and oils, they leave my hands with and odd oily feel, but not with this! Its truly amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I recommended to use this product especially after shower before using hair drier.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product.  Leaves hair straight, shiny and frizz free!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joico products for many years now and LOVE them. I recently had my hair dyed red for spring, and now that fall is here went back to blonde. It took 4 bleaching sessions as the red stained my natural blonde hair. My hair was a fragile, processed hot mess! I bought this after reading reviews and my own personal experience with the line (just not this particular product). AMAZING results! The brittle feel is gone. Product goes on easy and leaves hair silky and shiney. I will keep a bottle in the house from now on, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair oil I&#x27;ve been using for 5-6 years. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different kinds and keep going back to this one. I have coarse asian hair that gets dry on the ends, and this Joico product works better than all other hair oils I&#x27;ve tried (moroccan oil, biolage, biosilk, drugstore brands, etc). I used to work in a salon so I&#x27;ve tried a huge range of products but still love this one. This is the only hair oil that I would ever recommend to anyone. I use this daily to refresh my dry roots and on damp hair before blowdrying. It smells heavenly. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  I put 2 drops into my palms and rub into wet hair.  I think it makes my hair feel softer and it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> First time use... added it to damp hair right of the shower and air dried. results... incredible hair I haven&#x27;t seen in years!!! Used it with my flat iron and the results are just as great! I love Joico products already, but the [[ASIN:B002NYERPU Joico K Pak Color Therapy Restorative Oil, 3.4 Fluid Ounce]] has sealed the deal! using this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner will be my new regiment for years to come :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am a bleached, blond tinted...My hair is not damaged, but i need to take care of it more than my regular hair. This serum is not that good, I saw better results with other products...</li>
            <li> love this item and especially the price!!!! I will definitely order from here again.  Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product did not aid or restore my hair to a healthy shine or texture. I will not purchase a again.</li>
            <li> Started using this about a year ago instead of \\&quot;hair food\\&quot; or other greasy products. Totally pleased with the results. My hair no longer feels heavy and matted down even though it gets a great conditioning; plus the shiny, healthy look. Especially good to use with straightening iron.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and amazing products!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of shampoos and conditioner, so I decided to try the oil.  It is really great, made my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any different than the cheap stuff I purchase at the grocery store</li>
            <li> Love this product and seller shipped it super fast!</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair soft and shiny, it has also helped my split ends.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Makes my hair tame without the price of some other name brands in which I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Good shine without too much of a greasy feel.  I am not quite sure if it works as leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay nothing spectacular.  I probably would not purchase again. It Actually makes my hair oily just a litle bit.</li>
            <li> Every time I try something new, I run back to this product. It is not greasy/oily in my hair; however, it definitely helps it in humidity. Great product.... my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so my hair is naturally dry. I love this product, one drop is all you need for frizz free and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, this is the second time I ordered it.  I have a lot of hair and very curly, this oil helps my hair looks better after blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Great product if you have curly Hair and want to straighten with a flat iron.  A little goes a long way! Sender was great!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law who really loves it.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I am so grateful to Joico for coming up with this awesome product that I have decided to do so. I have tried many different oils, but they usually leave your hair feeling and looking oily. I don&#x27;t know how these guys did it, but this oil gives you the benefit of shine and healthy look without the oily feel. It is truly amazing and I hope they will not reformulate or do anything that will take this feature away that is so rare for hair products. I wash my hair every day and use this every day when I blow dry, I use 5 pumps. Thank you Joico for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> In caring for color treated hair this product is great. It leaves the hair feeling smooth and silky. My daughter loves her gift.</li>
            <li> Love this......I use it on my ends and does not make it oily at all.....provides a nice finish especially in cold air winter Michiga,.</li>
            <li> Although I have always had strong healthy hair and have been able to perm it as well as color, the aging process was having its effects.  My hair was looking dry and dull. The Joico Therapy Oil along with the Joico Shampoo and Conditioner have worked wonders!!  The results were immediate (shine, soft and managable)  My hair is thick so I use 3-4 pumps on my wet hair and then 1 more pump after I have dried my hair to help give a smooth finish. Obviously I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I recently got highlights and my hair felt dry, with only one use of this serum my hair looks and feels so much better....</li>
