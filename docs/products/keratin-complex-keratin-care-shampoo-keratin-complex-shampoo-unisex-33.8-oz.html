            <li>I use this stuff for my Keratin treated hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It has the nastiest smell, but it works the best for this kind of treated hair.</li>

            <li>The shampoo works great for my hair.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very very nice.</li>
            <li>this shampoo great for keeping your hair healthy and doesn&#x27;t strip your hair which is great</li>
            <li>The price is fair.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I will be trying it and give it a fair review despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been duped and feel mislead.</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>It cleans but does not strip your hair and it smells good  too.  </li>
            <li>He was right, I love it!!!</li>
            <li>They should be more careful,with the packaging!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am very happy and will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a great scent, lathers easily without having to use very much of the product - and what I loved  </li>
            <li>I could have bought a cheap drugstore brand that was sulfate free...disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>my hair is more relaxed and when styled with an iron looks so much more healthier and my hair is still growing in length</li>
            <li>but it is NOT the Coppola brand that I love.</li>
            <li>I would buy more of these for sure.</li>
            <li>Pump top had already been opened and the bottle arrived covered in the shampoo that had spilled out of it.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>The large bottle is a good value.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shinning and with a great aroma.</li>
            <li>The pump makes it easy to use the product.  </li>
            <li>Great, I love this product, it really works very well.</li>
            <li>Smells great and hair feels clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the original Coppola Keratin.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, rinses clean.</li>
            <li>and this is not the right stuff!</li>
            <li>Very good, nice smell and makes even thick hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>Still seems to be quite full though</li>
            <li>What I got looks pretty darn cheap if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>the most is that it feels relatively chemical free.</li>
            <li>I read everything and picked what should have been the right product..</li>
            <li>It lathers to a very luxurious foam and rinses clean..</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This keratin shampoo makes hair feel strong and smooth at the same time.  </li>
            <li>far the best product to ensure that the keratin remain for as long as possible in your hair.</li>
            <li>It smells nice compared to other products of its kind, but doesnt lather up too well or keep your hair smelling fresh for very long.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy on here than in stores!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product at the salon where I have my hair done, and have now used it and the matching Keratin conditioner for years.</li>
            <li>Has a great lather, leaves hair smooth, no that weird sticky feeling that happens with some shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love Coppola products - this shampoo keeps my hair from frizzing out or being dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>My husband like it too, so now we buy the large size.</li>
            <li>Can not say how it works  but would suggest that when shipping item should be packaged more carefully.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived more than 1/2 empty.  </li>
            <li>Really like how the Keratin makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I get Keratin treatments for my hair so prefer to use sulfate free shampoo to help the treatment last longer</li>
            <li>It is definitely not Coppola and is NOT sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>This absolutely fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Keratin complex shampoo smells good.</li>
            <li>The only downfall of this shampoo is that it stays clean for a day and after that it becomes greasy.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that my hair feels like it is getting clean while I am washing it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the fuzziness down and leaves your hair feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is truly worth the money especially when you spend so much for a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>My hair shines after it and is very soft and straight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and fully intend to also try the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have also seen that along with the conditioner it seems to prolong the keratin treatment better than most other keratin shampoo/conditioners I have bought in the past.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back</li>
            <li>I recommend it for first or second time treatment users, but after 3 treatments I do not think it helps anymore .</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a lot of lather but do expect soft hair after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that after keratin shampoos clean hair as well as ordinary professional shampoos.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that said that this is not the real product, and since buying it from the drugstore is a lot more expensive</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and full, very few frizzies.</li>
            <li>Other than losing a quater or the shampoo it was exactly what I wanted it was packed</li>
            <li>This product seems thicker than the last I ordered in the old packaging.</li>
            <li>Lid was not closed all they way</li>
            <li>Part of the shampoo was at the bag and the top was broken.</li>
            <li>The bottles top was broken either prior or during shipment.  </li>
            <li>(first few inches from the scalp) after about 2 weeks, but</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Coppola did not remodel their packaging and did not completely remove their name.</li>
            <li> Since I have natural unprocessed Black hair, I needed a product that would not be drying.</li>
            <li> These brands tended to leave my hair dry and tangly.</li>
            <li> The Keratin Complex bottle has cursive writing on it -- &amp;#34;Smoothing Therapy.&amp;#34; Below that in regular font it says, &amp;#34;Keratin Complex.&amp;#34; Nowhere on this bottle do I see anything about Coppola.</li>
            <li> And trust me I have tried a wide range of the products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I never really used product.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product from other online retailers (other than amazaon) and spent a lot of money for this product line.  </li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, I do recommend using a clarifying shampoo ONCE every other week when using this product..</li>
            <li> OR I RECEIVED AN IMITATION, BECAUSE THE POTTLE WAS DIFERENT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might not be the same, but it&#x27;s the real product.</li>
            <li> However, what they actually sent me was the Keratin Complex brand.</li>
            <li> so it made a mess in the box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> it was still about 5 dollars less than going and getting it across town!</li>
            <li> I ordered (2) 32 oz bottles of Keratin Complex product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not supposed to frizz when I use this but either my stylists did a bad job or this product does not work well in my hair anymore because I have been using it for quite a few years and after this last treatment my hair is frizzing anyway.</li>
            <li> Which means it&#x27;s actually stripping my hair of the expensive treatment and making it look worse.</li>
            <li> I have thin frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s false advertisement and should not be allowed.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating and actually false advertising!!</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.....</li>

    <ol>
            <li> If your hair is straightened you have to use this type of shampoo to maintain.  The price is fair.  That is it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while. Even with the shipping (gulp!) it was still about 5 dollars less than going and getting it across town! Very good, nice smell and makes even thick hair very manageable. Cleans well!</li>
            <li> I have the Keratin Straightening Treatment done regularly and my stylist uses this product line - so it is what is recommended for maintenance. It works great and the prices on Amazon are the best around!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for my Keratin treated hair and it works great.  It has the nastiest smell, but it works the best for this kind of treated hair. Much cheaper to buy on here than in stores!</li>
            <li> Keratin complex shampoo smells good. My hair shines after it and is very soft and straight. The only downfall of this shampoo is that it stays clean for a day and after that it becomes greasy. I don&#x27;t think that after keratin shampoos clean hair as well as ordinary professional shampoos.This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5.</li>
            <li> I love Coppola products - this shampoo keeps my hair from frizzing out or being dry and unmanageable.  Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Has a great lather, leaves hair smooth, no that weird sticky feeling that happens with some shampoos. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I RECEIVE WHAT I PAY FOR OR I RECEIVED AN IMITATION, BECAUSE THE POTTLE WAS DIFERENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product at the salon where I have my hair done, and have now used it and the matching Keratin conditioner for years. My husband like it too, so now we buy the large size.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo.  I haven&#x27;t bought anything else since I came across this shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and full, very few frizzies.</li>
            <li> And trust me I have tried a wide range of the products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by far the best product to ensure that the keratin remain for as long as possible in your hair.</li>
            <li> Since I got this item the pump never worked so I never really used product. Can not say how it works  but would suggest that when shipping item should be packaged more carefully.</li>
            <li> I ordered (2) 32 oz bottles of Keratin Complex product.  The bottles were shipped in a standard US Postal Service packaging box without any bubble wrap or protection.  The packaging box was too small/tight around the bottles and they were sqeezed during shipping.  The bottles top was broken either prior or during shipment.  The bottle arrived more than 1/2 empty.  I lost over $100.00.  I contacted the seller/shipper and they did not respond at all.</li>
            <li> Part of the shampoo was at the bag and the top was broken. They should be more careful,with the packaging!</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.....I read everything and picked what should have been the right product..then it arrives and 1) is not Coppola....and 2) has  the ingredients in it that I was specifically trying to avoid!  Ie sulfates....and it is listed as the second ingrediant.  I had a keratin treatment and now I have big bottle of stuff I won&#x27;t use.  Amazon should look into this....it&#x27;s false advertisement and should not be allowed.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.... I could have bought a cheap drugstore brand that was sulfate free...disappointed!  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my dogs...since they didn&#x27;t have a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and pulled it out of the box. What attracted me to Amazon was the picture of the Coppola brand. However, what they actually sent me was the Keratin Complex brand. I wanted the actual Coppola brand...I thought I was getting what I paid for. The Keratin Complex bottle has cursive writing on it -- &amp;#34;Smoothing Therapy.&amp;#34; Below that in regular font it says, &amp;#34;Keratin Complex.&amp;#34; Nowhere on this bottle do I see anything about Coppola. Coppola did not remodel their packaging and did not completely remove their name. What I got looks pretty darn cheap if you ask me. HOWEVER, I will be trying it and give it a fair review despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been duped and feel mislead.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this after my straightening.  Lathers well, rinses clean. Keeps my hair from frizzing.  Smells good.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use the product on the instruction of my hair stylist.  I have a straightening product on my hair and he said it is the only product to use for color treated straightened hair.  It stopped frizzing and my hair feels and looks great. He was right, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair and also helps prolong the color of my color treated hair</li>
            <li> This product seems thicker than the last I ordered in the old packaging.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is recommended by hair stylists to be used by people who have just gotten the Keratin treament done. My hair is not supposed to frizz when I use this but either my stylists did a bad job or this product does not work well in my hair anymore because I have been using it for quite a few years and after this last treatment my hair is frizzing anyway. It smells nice compared to other products of its kind, but doesnt lather up too well or keep your hair smelling fresh for very long. I recommend it for first or second time treatment users, but after 3 treatments I do not think it helps anymore .</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair soft, shinning and with a great aroma. Excellent product to use after using the pool.</li>
            <li> The pump makes it easy to use the product.  The large bottle is a good value.  Really like how the Keratin makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I get Keratin treatments for my hair so prefer to use sulfate free shampoo to help the treatment last longer and this is not the right stuff! It is definitely not Coppola and is NOT sulfate free. Which means it&#x27;s actually stripping my hair of the expensive treatment and making it look worse. Very frustrating and actually false advertising!!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo if you have had a keratin treatment on your hair.  Keeps the fuzziness down and leaves your hair feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the brazilian blowout I got.  It works very well.  I especially like the fact that my hair feels like it is getting clean while I am washing it.  Not all the shampoos for the blowout feel like that.</li>
            <li> I used to have wavy frizzy hair but since I started using this shampoo and its conditioner my hair is more relaxed and when styled with an iron looks so much more healthier and my hair is still growing in length</li>
            <li> Lid was not closed all they way so it made a mess in the box. Other than losing a quater or the shampoo it was exactly what I wanted it was packed really well the lid just wasn&#x27;t screwed on don&#x27;t know how that was missed but it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back</li>
            <li> What was pictured and what I ordered was not what I received!  This has never happened to me before.  I DID receive a keratin shampoo but it is NOT the Coppola brand that I love.</li>
            <li> If you have had a keratin treatment this is the go to shampoo.  It cleans but does not strip your hair and it smells good  too.  Don&#x27;t expect a lot of lather but do expect soft hair after shampooing.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> Great, I love this product, it really works very well. I would buy more of these for sure. will tell my friends</li>
            <li> Pump top had already been opened and the bottle arrived covered in the shampoo that had spilled out of it.  Still seems to be quite full though so I won&#x27;t return it in this instance.  It does makes you wonder if the seller is trustworthy though so would not  purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Smells great and hair feels clean and not dried out. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos I have ever  bought.  This keratin shampoo makes hair feel strong and smooth at the same time.  It lathers to a very luxurious foam and rinses clean.. I have also seen that along with the conditioner it seems to prolong the keratin treatment better than most other keratin shampoo/conditioners I have bought in the past.  It is truly worth the money especially when you spend so much for a keratin treatment.  This shampoo is very very nice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a great scent, lathers easily without having to use very much of the product - and what I loved  the most is that it feels relatively chemical free. By contrast to, for example, the Redken line or the pricier Phyto products which I have been using for several years. These brands tended to leave my hair dry and tangly. Since I have natural unprocessed Black hair, I needed a product that would not be drying. This absolutely fits the bill. Great value for the money! I highly recommend it and fully intend to also try the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works great for my hair. I got the Keritan treatment done and they recommended this shampoo.  It leaves my hair very soft and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said that this is not the real product, and since buying it from the drugstore is a lot more expensive I was afraid it might not be the same, but it&#x27;s the real product. I immediately recognized the smell and it does the same wanders for my hair so it&#x27;s definitely a great buy. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I have my hair straightened every 6 months and this shampoo has no sodium or no sulfates in it which helps prolong the life of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original Coppola Keratin.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product from other online retailers (other than amazaon) and spent a lot of money for this product line.  I purchased this at a fraction of the cost.  Same product!  I am very happy and will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, I do recommend using a clarifying shampoo ONCE every other week when using this product.. this shampoo great for keeping your hair healthy and doesn&#x27;t strip your hair which is great.. I did notice buildup in my hair (first few inches from the scalp) after about 2 weeks, but clarifying the scalp took care of it..</li>
            <li> I have thin frizzy hair. This shampoo has worked a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had discovered it years ago! Love it!</li>
