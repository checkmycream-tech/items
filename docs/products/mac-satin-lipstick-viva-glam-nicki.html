            <li>This color is very unique.</li>

            <li>everyone will fall for the super nice pinkness of this lipstick but one thing i don&#x27;t like is after hours of wearing leaves you a cracked &amp; peeling lip.</li>
            <li>Great color very soft and matte with pigment  </li>
            <li>Vibrant for tan tones, and evreryone loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Nicki fan</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this lipstick, since its sold out everywere.  </li>
            <li>If u bought the original fom the mac counter you will know the difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light, nice feeling lipstick that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or synthetic like most drugstore lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color smells like vanilla and it comes in the black lipstick bullet</li>
            <li>The color is great and it doesn&#x27;t chap your lips or clump up it last for a long time I love it</li>
            <li>But the sheer, neon, bright, smooth color seriously looks amazing on any skin tone!</li>
            <li>I sort of have fair, but slightly tanned skin</li>
            <li>I first wanted to order this lipstick from Amazon</li>
            <li>THEY ARE AWARE THEY ARE SELLING FAKES</li>
            <li>My lipstick is a beautiful pink and this lipstick is red.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it does not smell like Mac lipstick.  </li>
            <li>the way the picture shows the lipstick, its exactly how it was delivered.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty for olive skin complexions and peach skin stones.  </li>
            <li>Its a pretty color, but once I put it on I realized I wouldn&#x27;t be wearing it as much as i thought I would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lipstick is a very light, cotton-candy pink color.  </li>
            <li>This MAC color is so pretty and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I love the look of this pink hue</li>
            <li>Not the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a good lipstick for everyday wear, but it is absolutely perfect for those special occasions when no other color will do except for a light, cotton-candy pink.</li>
            <li>(But a warning, this is not a simple, sheer pink, it&#x27;s more like a bright neon pink.)</li>
            <li>The funny thing is, that it is Mac, a brand new tube, and the exact same name.</li>
            <li>This is clearly a knockoff!  </li>
            <li>Rotten and old and not the lipstick I ordered, refused to refund money</li>
            <li>I had to get used to how it looked on me, though, for a bit, because I&#x27;m used to simple brownish nudes, simple pinks or reds, but this pop of color really is a step up.</li>
            <li>Wet &amp; Wild has an exact dupe for a buck called Pinkerbell, but you won&#x27;t get the same smell as MAC.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try somehing different , and wow is it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this lipstick is nearly $30 when the regular price is $16 at the Mac store.</li>

            <li> This seller sells fake products and hopes that you don&#x27;t investigate for yourself to ensure they are real.</li>
            <li> I have worn it alone or sometimes put a softer color underneath and used this one to make it pop a little.  </li>

            <li> With $30 ill rather just go to the Mac store and get 2 and pay a little tax</li>
            <li> Viva glamI was not happy about that</li>
            <li> Fake Fake fake  don&#x27;t buy .color</li>
            <li> The tube itself looked legit, but the formula was weird and runny and melted away like coconut oil.</li>

            <li> Perfect beach/summer color. Wet &amp; Wild has an exact dupe for a buck called Pinkerbell, but you won&#x27;t get the same smell as MAC. Love this shade for it&#x27;s pinky Peach color!!!</li>
            <li> Great value my daughter loved it</li>
            <li> I just received my MAC Viva Glam Nicki yesterday and I was so pleased at the beautiful pinky coral shade and how satiny it applied on my lips. My skin is a cool medium and it looks gorgeous, this one will look beautiful on all skin tones! I now plan to go back and purchase the Viva Glam editions I missed out on, MAC lipsticks are some of the best out there :)</li>
            <li> One thing I love about MAC is the amount of gorgeous colors they have, whether its eyeshadow, eyeliner, or in this case, lipstick. I love the look of this pink hue and i also know when I buy this lipstick it will go to a good cause. That&#x27;s the beauty of MAC;they always try to give back.</li>
            <li> I sort of have fair, but slightly tanned skin and I was hesitant for buying this....But the sheer, neon, bright, smooth color seriously looks amazing on any skin tone! I had to get used to how it looked on me, though, for a bit, because I&#x27;m used to simple brownish nudes, simple pinks or reds, but this pop of color really is a step up. And don&#x27;t even get me started on the amazing quality of this! It&#x27;s a very light, nice feeling lipstick that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or synthetic like most drugstore lipsticks. Overall, a great buy! (But a warning, this is not a simple, sheer pink, it&#x27;s more like a bright neon pink.)</li>
            <li> Wanted to try somehing different , and wow is it. I love this color,its so retro glam and make my lips tremble with hottness!!!!! Mac Attack!!!!!!! OMG</li>
            <li> Rotten and old and not the lipstick I ordered, refused to refund money</li>
            <li> I first wanted to order this lipstick from Amazon but my gut keep telling me there was better price out there so I listen and am glad I did.I when to Macys.com it was $14.50 I when to d Mall at Mac counter just incase it was there.I bought it $14.50 &amp; going to buy 4 more soon cuz it limited edition and so they say..Am dark skin so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it look on me but eceryone telling me to buy more cuz it d best lipstick I ever wore yet..</li>
            <li> Fake Fake fake  don&#x27;t buy .color ,texture is not even close . doesn&#x27;t stay on  ,smudge all over .</li>
            <li> I knew the second I opened it that this product was fake. The tube itself looked legit, but the formula was weird and runny and melted away like coconut oil. I have no idea what was in it, it occurred to me that since the product was fake it could be dangerous to apply to my skin. Took it to a M.A.C. Counter to confirm, color was not at ALL the Viva Glam Nicki color. I was very disappointed. Seller pretended as though she did not know it was fake-- this is a lie. This seller sells fake products and hopes that you don&#x27;t investigate for yourself to ensure they are real. DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER THEY ARE AWARE THEY ARE SELLING FAKES BUT CHARGE YOU JUST THE SAME.</li>
            <li> I happen to have a partial tube of Niki Viva glam lipstick and it is entirely  different than the color I was sent.  The funny thing is, that it is Mac, a brand new tube, and the exact same name. My lipstick is a beautiful pink and this lipstick is red.  I put it on and it came off in 15 minutes.  Needless to say I will be asking for a refund.  How did someone pull this off.  I will check with Mac and see if they have two Viva Glams. Niki.</li>
            <li> I was sent and wrong colorit was not the right colorit was not Viva glamI was not happy about that</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this lipstick, since its sold out everywere.  Lipstick came on time, but its totally fake.  First of all, it does not smell like Mac lipstick.  Second of all, the consistency is oily, does not apply well.  The case is flimsy too.  The product is GARBAGE!!!</li>
            <li> This color is very unique. It reminds me of mermaid, barbie like color! It brightens the face and makes you look younger!</li>
            <li> This is clearly a knockoff!  Before purchasing, my cousin let me borrow her MAC Viva Glam Nicki and I fell in love with it!  It is sold out EVERYWHERE!  I knew I was taking a gamble by buying it  online, especially since 1 review said this product was fake.  I went ahead and bought it because &amp;#34;Amazon verified&amp;#34; reviews said it was a good product.  I tried it on and the lipstick had a weird oily consistency.  It made my lips looked cracked!  I wish I could upload a picture of difference between how my lips look with the one my cousin has and this one.  I was sooooo disappointed.  Save your money, honey!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this lipstick is nearly $30 when the regular price is $16 at the Mac store. And I know this because have this lipstick . With $30 ill rather just go to the Mac store and get 2 and pay a little tax this is a rip off</li>
            <li> The color is great and it doesn&#x27;t chap your lips or clump up it last for a long time I love it</li>
            <li> Not the real deal. Trust me. If u bought the original fom the mac counter you will know the difference. It is extremely oily and does not hold the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Nicki fan so when I found out about this lipstick I simply had to have it! Beautiful color smells like vanilla and it comes in the black lipstick bullet I absolutly adore this lipstick just don&#x27;t over do it your lips will stick out and not in a good way other than that worth the money :D</li>
            <li> This MAC color is so pretty and vibrant. I have worn it alone or sometimes put a softer color underneath and used this one to make it pop a little.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> everyone will fall for the super nice pinkness of this lipstick but one thing i don&#x27;t like is after hours of wearing leaves you a cracked &amp; peeling lip. maybe for someone else&#x27; it won&#x27;t, but for me, that&#x27;s how it is. this product isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> the way the picture shows the lipstick, its exactly how it was delivered. And the pigment from this lipstick was beautiful on tan skin.</li>
            <li> Product was a fake!!!!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is insane its the prettiest coral redish color, if you like bright lipstick get this is limited edition get it before its gone</li>
            <li> Got here promptly as estimated and as described in the product detail. Thanks, I am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This was a fake MAC product and I would like a refund.  The packaging looks legitimate but the consistency of the of lipstick is oily and cracks. It has a awful taste as well.</li>
            <li> Great color very soft and matte with pigment  I have olive skin and it warms my complexion!&lt;br /&gt;True color as seen in review .</li>
            <li> It also clumps around your lip crease after an hour or so making it so you need to wipe it off and reapply it. Its a pretty color, but once I put it on I realized I wouldn&#x27;t be wearing it as much as i thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;The perfect lipstick was made by Chanel &#x27;&#x27; Splender&#x27;&#x27; was the name....try to find That color. Vibrant for tan tones, and evreryone loved it. Hard to find though....</li>
            <li> Great color and feel!!</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty for olive skin complexions and peach skin stones.  The only problem is completely reapplying it is a little annoying for me. I would want it to last a little longer than the hour it stays on. At this rate this is only going to last a week or so.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about ordering this lipstick but when it was no longer available in stores I decided to try it out and I love it! The shade is perfect and it&#x27;s definitely a MAC product. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase it came in a timely manner and I got exactly what I ordered!!!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a very light, cotton-candy pink color.  I love it.  It&#x27;s not a good lipstick for everyday wear, but it is absolutely perfect for those special occasions when no other color will do except for a light, cotton-candy pink.</li>
