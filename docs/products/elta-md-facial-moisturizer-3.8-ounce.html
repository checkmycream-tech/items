    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>product would be great for anyone with sebhorreic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or dry/flaky skin!</li>
            <li>Perfect for after Fraxal.</li>
            <li>Very good product for use..</li>
            <li>Also great on cuticles.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>This makes a fair night cream, but is TOO GREASY for day wear.</li>
            <li>would recomend this to all women that like to use product that give you a good peel.</li>
            <li>I liked it and would recommend to use it..</li>
            <li>Also I use a fine line cream twice a week that can make my skin peel so again this soothes!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I actually mix it in with the Elta MD body lotion and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for a nightly moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Best moisterizer I have ever used for really dry, does not leave a film or cause face to break out(dry skin) and make workes well with this product!</li>
            <li>The primary ingredient is petroleum and it feels just like Vasoline.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and my face is smooth and taught in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and the elta md moisturizer is great for my night time lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used ELTA MD MOISTURIZER SPF 30+ daily for a long time and LOVE that product, which is good for my skin and absorbs into  your skin easily so that your makeup glides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Used in the morning, it keeps my skin looking good all day long</li>
            <li>is very oily, it is Vaseline with paraffin in it and is great for the first several days after Fraxal.</li>
            <li>Feels like Vaseline, but Vaseline offers more moisture.</li>
            <li>this is not the right product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very greasy!</li>
            <li>So, it is not meant to be left on the skin like most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>It does moisturize well and its concentration means it will last longer than most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>So Much.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be really moisturizing without being oily or goopy.  </li>
            <li>would prefer the squeeze tube for ease of use, but the product itself is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is improving very well</li>
            <li>A little greasy for my normal to combination skin, but would be great for dry skin</li>
            <li>you have normal or oily skin...</li>
            <li>To be fair, the directions on the container (and on the Amazon product page) do say to pat dry the excess after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Definitely DO NOT use too much!</li>
            <li>At 67 yrs, my skin needs the protection this product offers</li>
            <li>This product was used by my would care professional</li>
            <li>If my skin looks dry during the day, I pat a little more on and my skin will look dewey, even with makeup.  </li>
            <li>Elta MD Facial Moisturizer, 3.8 Ounce, naturally hydrate skin of all types, no break outs, I have cystic acne and use it at night and before make up application.  </li>
            <li>However, I do apply it at night after cleansing my face, and in the morning, I am left with soft, dewey skin.</li>
            <li>I agree with other users - this is almost like putting straight Vaseline on your skin.</li>
            <li>I use the Elta MD am therapy next, the Clear sunscreen moisturer and lastly the tinted sunscreen.</li>

            <li> I definitely recommend this if you have dry, itchy skin.  </li>

            <li> Elta MD Facial Moisturizer, 3.8 Ounce, naturally hydrate skin of all types, no break outs, I have cystic acne and use it at night and before make up application.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Very greasy! Does not moisturize. Feels like Vaseline, but Vaseline offers more moisture. Would not recommend. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizer. I hope I can order it later. Thank You So Much.  I use it everyday. We have a cabin in Fla.so I have a extra one there for me to use.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that helps my severely dry skin without being greasy.  I actually mix it in with the Elta MD body lotion and it&#x27;s perfect. I definitely recommend this if you have dry, itchy skin.  Also great on cuticles.</li>
            <li> I was taken aback by how greasy this product was. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for its petroleum jelly-like consistency and feel.  To be fair, the directions on the container (and on the Amazon product page) do say to pat dry the excess after a few minutes.  So, it is not meant to be left on the skin like most moisturizers.  It does moisturize well and its concentration means it will last longer than most moisturizers.  But just be prepared for a product that feels almost like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> This is just an awful product. The primary ingredient is petroleum and it feels just like Vasoline. I was hesitant but gave it a shot and broke out all over. I love their tinted oil-free sunscreen but this stuff is awful. At least it was only $15.00.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item by mistake and should have sent it back.  IT IS TOO GREASY!  I have used ELTA MD MOISTURIZER SPF 30+ daily for a long time and LOVE that product, which is good for my skin and absorbs into  your skin easily so that your makeup glides on smoothly.  If my skin looks dry during the day, I pat a little more on and my skin will look dewey, even with makeup.  This makes a fair night cream, but is TOO GREASY for day wear.</li>
            <li> I agree with other users - this is almost like putting straight Vaseline on your skin. Even with patting off the excess, I&#x27;m not sure that I could wear makeup over this moisturizer. However, I do apply it at night after cleansing my face, and in the morning, I am left with soft, dewey skin. I only use it a couple of times a week - I have noticed that if I use it regularly, I will break out.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be really moisturizing without being oily or goopy.  It feels like you&#x27;re putting vaseline on your face.</li>
            <li> Best moisterizer I have ever used for really dry, does not leave a film or cause face to break out(dry skin) and make workes well with this product!</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and this does wonders for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a very small amount to cover my entire face and keeps it from drying/cracking/feeling tight all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it came in a cold cream style tub instead of a squeeze tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer the squeeze tube for ease of use, but the product itself is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal or oily skin... this is not the right product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be great for anyone with sebhorreic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or dry/flaky skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers...but this one tops them all.  Used in the morning, it keeps my skin looking good all day long and I like the way it feels when I wake up in the morning.  It was suggested by my dermatologist but I like the Amazon price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for after Fraxal. I ordered the 3.8 oz that is in a jar. I use wooden ice cream sticks to get it out and it doesn&#x27;t get under my nails.&lt;br /&gt;This is very oily, it is Vaseline with paraffin in it and is great for the first several days after Fraxal.</li>
            <li> Product came in a round jar shape vs. photo. A little greasy for my normal to combination skin, but would be great for dry skin</li>
            <li> This product was extremely greasy compared to what I had used at the dermatologists office (same brand). I will use it as my skin gets really dry in the winter but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6 mos., after facial surgery. I was only using it at night, but for the past month I&#x27;ve been applying a small amount over damp face &amp; neck in the mornings. I use the Elta MD am therapy next, the Clear sunscreen moisturer and lastly the tinted sunscreen. May seem a lot, but it works for me. At 67 yrs, my skin needs the protection this product offers and I like the results.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and the elta md moisturizer is great for my night time lotion. Also I use a fine line cream twice a week that can make my skin peel so again this soothes!</li>
            <li> This product was used by my would care professional and I continue to use it at home.  It is not greasy and you need only a little bit</li>
            <li> Not a moisturizer that can be worn daily.  When I used this and put on my makeup......my makeup slid if my face!  Lol. I use it at night and my face is smooth and taught in the morning.  Have to change pillowcase everyday though.  Definitely DO NOT use too much!</li>
            <li> Very good product for use..I liked it and would recommend to use it..I solved the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it for my wife wound and skin is improving very well</li>
            <li> i like the product. it was as i expected. but it does not come in a tube like that in the pic. i got a jar, which is hard to get product out of. i would have preferred a tube like that shown in the picture, where you can just squeeze the material out.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for friends too!&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this to all women that like to use product that give you a good peel.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for a nightly moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it melts into your skin! I would reccomend to all skin types</li>
            <li> Used this on my body. I did not realize it was for face. Found it a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;feeling. I think I preferred thrthe Elta lite.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
