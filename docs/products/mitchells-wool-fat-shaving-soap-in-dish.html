    <ol>
            <li>Simply Awesome!  </li>
            <li>Best shave soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bowl is perfectly sized for my needs and fits the part.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lubrication is superb.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is an excellent soap.</li>
            <li>This is the best soap in the world.</li>
            <li>Works best if the puck is soaked in water.</li>
            <li>Best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This is the best soap ever.</li>
            <li>After trying almost a dozen soaps, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>But then, I have been shaved by one of the street barbers in India; they may be the best in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely fantastic product!!!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent, great coverage, lather, moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27; just an adequte soap with a real nice jar.</li>
            <li>Great leather.</li>
            <li>I can also buy Tabula Rasa that has a great scent.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, has almost no scent, and allows a great shave.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaving soap in a really nice dish.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great performing soap with a lite sent this is your soap.</li>
            <li>comes in an attractive ceramic container with a lid.</li>
            <li>Great shave soap.</li>
            <li>Great packing by seller.</li>
            <li>The dish is very nice looking ceramic.</li>
            <li>It provides great lubrication and has a good scent.</li>
            <li>Its up there with the best for sure.  </li>
            <li>The bristles stay perfectly inside the edges while loading the brush and prevent the soap from getting all over the top or sides of the dish.  </li>
            <li>No worries, perfect creamy, easy to make lather in seconds.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, great lather and great shave.</li>
            <li>and the results weren&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have to try it for yourself (and I would encourage each person to give MWF a fair shake) but just know the risks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap is great, easy to lather and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased in the ceramic dish.</li>
            <li>I love it smells great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s producing much more and richer lather!</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a ton of bubble wrap to play with!?</li>
            <li>This is my first &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; shaving soap and I am so impressed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant change and feels very clean.</li>
            <li>There truly is no need for an aftershave product while using this soap, my skin felt amazing when done.  </li>
            <li>The performance is amazing, great razor glide, fantastic post shave.</li>
            <li>I just had to get it with the ceramic dish - liked the look of it to add to my collection.  </li>
            <li>That being said, there are many people who cannot get a good lather out of this soap.</li>
            <li>B&#x27;sB has a smell of citrus and bergamot which compliment this soap nicely.</li>
            <li>Okay, the soap seems to be very good and worth the purchase..</li>
            <li>The lather is pleasantly but lightly scented.</li>
            <li>The soap lathered very easily with my Semogue 1305 boar brush.</li>
            <li>The lanolin smell is very strong with Mitchell&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Packaging was very secure, and the bowl looks the business on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get all 3 passes without having to use more</li>
            <li>which was my favorite part of this purchase.</li>
            <li>Now my top choice.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better lather</li>
            <li>and I will surely be purchasing additional pucks from this company.</li>
            <li>Couple drops on top the fat and soaked the brush.</li>
            <li>Now go to town making your lather until most all bubbles are gone and it peaks.sounds like a lot but distilled water is a dollar a gallon</li>
            <li>I would use the lather that those products produce as my standard for what is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it being much better than this.</li>
            <li>Whip it up some more.</li>
            <li>Basically, this is the best soap possible.</li>
            <li>short, this product is one of the best out there, but it has a learning curve.</li>
            <li>It is classically handsome.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Most of the controversy revolves around the lathering.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I have ever had a barbershop shave that was any better.  </li>
            <li>all you need is to buy more soap when you need it.</li>
            <li>Shave Cream- a dab of B&#x27;sB on top and mix with Mitchell&#x27;s makes a nice lather, gives a close shave, rinses clean, and leaves the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is packaged nice and has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good quality soap.</li>
            <li>Love the clean unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li>The lather collapses very quickly before one side is done</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very mild and I did not even notice it.  </li>
            <li>Decent lather, but not as good as some others.</li>
            <li>First shave with the fat and its amazing.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a fine choice for a shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I realy love this soap and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>Lightly brush puck for about 15 / 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>The lubrication is pristine, and the skin is left in great condition.</li>
            <li>It is really light soap.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth.</li>
            <li>I will continue using MWF until it&#x27;s gone (because I&#x27;m cheap)</li>
            <li>The ceramic bowl is a nice touch, but really pushes the price point upwards.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lather lasted thru three passes; I rarely get more than one from Proraso.  </li>
            <li>I tried hot, warm, and cool water.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy to lather.</li>
            <li>shave was also more moisturizing, and the brand-new Feather blade in my Muhle R41 Grande was very, very</li>
            <li>soap smells fantastic and does a great job keeping the skin soft and moist, I have especially sensitive skin, which is why this caught my eye.</li>
            <li>First shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried, and I love it.</li>
            <li>But when you actually get a good lather going, this is silky smoothe and great lube for your facial fur.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant, subtle aroma, very clean, and very fresh.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel good and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>Start swirling the brush around on the softened soap and soon I have a brush full of lather.</li>
            <li>I pour out the water, put the lid on and it is good to the next day.  </li>
            <li>A solid soap with good lather.  </li>
            <li>This is good soap when I can actually get it to work...</li>
            <li>I did not find this to be at all true.  </li>
            <li>It requires a many number of &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to lather well that only an experienced wet shaver would be able to relate.</li>
            <li>but my puck exploded quickly.  </li>
            <li>It iprovides an adequate shave.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just buy the soap on its own in the future, but spending more for the dish was worth it for the first puck.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it headlines the product inside which is why we would have purchased it in the first place....</li>
            <li>The lather I created was like rich and thick whipped cream with a light and pleasant oily</li>
            <li>I ended up selling MWF on a forum because (for me) it just wasn&#x27;t worth all the effort.  </li>
            <li>I especially like it in its own dish.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get the same results from the refill puck and your own vessel.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dish and soap come in a cardboard box that I found nice enough to keep.</li>
            <li>Though I have only just started in the fine art of shaving with a classic razor style, this product is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>However, this product IS capable of some of the highest quality lather in the market if you learn those &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; (one may easily google search &amp;#34;MWF lather help&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>would rate this product more highly than Proraso; per above,the lather was both longer lasting and more moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a bit of time to get the lather right.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush was still warm after the first and second passes.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic lather was easily obtained by following instructions / tips suggested by Mantic on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>It lathers easily and I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the problems reported in other reviews related to building lather.</li>
            <li>Smells good and creates a rich lather with very little effort.</li>
            <li>The sent is a mild traditional soap sent, very clean.</li>
            <li>There are just too many other products out there that produce vastly superior lather with significantly less work than MWF, so while the scent is nice and the bowl looks classy, I won&#x27;t bother with The Fat again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and classic.  </li>
            <li>The scent is masculine, but light and fresh.</li>
            <li>The vendor shipped the item quickly and packed it very well.</li>
            <li>Extremely excited to use this new soap I opened the package to find layer upon layer upon layer of bubble wrap keeping the product beyond secured in the box.</li>
            <li>When I soak my badger hair brush for about 5+ minutes in hot water, I also pour hot water in the bowl to cover the soap.</li>
            <li>The extra time working it on your face instead of a bowl also softens your beard better.</li>
            <li>Hot shower followed by a splash of the hot DISTILLED water on face.</li>
            <li>The results were consistently airy, bubbly, foamy lather that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>okay I take it all back.  </li>
            <li>This product deserves all five stars, but the customer should be aware that there is a learning curve to lathering this</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t linger at all.</li>
            <li>It has a rabid following and probably just as many detractors.</li>
            <li>I put a tad of hot water on the soap and soaked my boars&#x27; bristle brush for about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>You will love it &amp; never go back.</li>
            <li>For me this is an everyday soap which will help to keep your skin in good nick.</li>
            <li>And, at least for me, the lather achieved a nice consistency very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not much water needed, and a super smooth shave!</li>
            <li>It leathers very well and has a light masculine scent to it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good soap - It does seem to offer better moisturizing / less drying of the skin than other soaps I use.  </li>
            <li>Taylor might be a bit better but this lasts twice as long</li>
            <li>After trying 5 soaps (awful to awesome), I finally purchased MWF after seeing so many great reviews on various shaving forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lots of other products that are better than this one as far as lather and smell are concerned,  handy container if you only need one</li>
            <li>I get a very clos</li>
            <li>Any ways, onto a real review of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it just really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of MWF.  </li>
            <li>The real difference with MWF is 4-5 hours after your shave.  </li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up very well.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and very well packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By this time, both the soap and brush were ready for use.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into scented soaps, this one will not do much for</li>
            <li>I would have saved time and money with trying so many other things.  </li>
            <li>I swirled the brush on the soap just long enough to get it started, and then worked up some really nice lather in a bowl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is a controversial product, at least controversial by wet shaving gear standards.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve just started using a brush to make lather, I&#x27;d suggest going with something soft and creamy at first.</li>
            <li>Instead of working that into my mug, I started face lathering, which I found to do a lot more with a lot less.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know why you would need more than one, should have put more into the soap than the expensive looking container.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this classic shaving soap.</li>
            <li>As a classic product, this is something that I would recommend everyone buy and keep around, but it is temperamental and requires some skill.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>For soap, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky and I highly recommend this to you.</li>
            <li>The container is fine, but is ceramic so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers quicker than Proraso, but not as fast as Taylor of old bond street.</li>
            <li>Up front, let me just say that my favorite soaps/creams are Tabac, Proraso Green, Castle Forbes Lime, and Oglalla Bay Rum.  </li>
            <li>What isn&#x27;t said though is that if you use moderately hot water, a second bowl, and a brush, you can get more lather from a tiny amount of soap than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I felt this product deserved some explanation.</li>
            <li>and once you get the technique down, it is really easy to make it work.</li>
            <li>I run hot water and soak the entire dish, razor and brush for maybe a minute, and the soap is soft and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>It has a very masculine soapy scent that lasts, but isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li>For cream I highly recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li>Being new the DE experience and ordering different soaps to try, I should have tried Mitchells wool fat soap first.</li>
            <li>I find this relatively scentless compared to my other soaps, which I love.</li>
            <li>Under the right conditions and with the right brush (stiff boar hair)</li>
            <li>Update - a couple of months later on, and lots of other soaps tried, and this is still my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Wool Fat sounds nice and slick but it is not slick enough.</li>
            <li>But it does not dry my face out at all and the scent is quite soapy, without much perfume at all.</li>
            <li>I live in Queensland and shave daily with a straight razor and collected rainwater.</li>
            <li>Though I have heard that many people have trouble getting it to lather, as it can be quite particular, I had no issues building a rich thick lather in virtually no time at all.</li>
            <li>I expected better for the money I spent.</li>
            <li>I have particularly sensitive skin and had no problems with this soap.  </li>
            <li>Has an old school barber shop smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I use it with Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men</li>
            <li>MWF demands a combination of soft, lukewarm water and a pre-soaking of the puck.</li>
            <li>Naturally, it&#x27;s the lanolin from the sheep that gives the soap its scent and cushion.</li>
            <li>Some skin is sensitive to lanolin, so proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>good tip is to grate the puck  with a course cheese grater (don&#x27;t tell the wife) back into the container and press it down with your thumbs then use a flat bottomed cup / glass to press it flat.</li>
            <li>you should be able to whip loads of creamy lather that is very slick and protective.</li>
            <li>Prior to shaving, I prepared my face by first washing it with Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cleanser (which I also recommend).  </li>
            <li>but if you live in a soft water area, or use rainwater which is the same thing then lathering is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Easily the hardest to lather soap I have ever used, if you have hard water, be prepared to do work.  </li>
            <li>BUT, then again, experimenting with this hobby is half the fun.  </li>
            <li>On the forums, most people either love or hate MWF.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first foray into anything other than store bought gels or foams.</li>
            <li>I have found this to be unusual, as boar&#x27;s bristle (unlike badger hair) does not normally retain heat too well.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I do not want people to give this product negative reviews because they were not able to achieve a good lather.</li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat (MWF) is a high quality product, a high end soap which the price does well to explain compared to other soaps (such as Conk).</li>
            <li>First I microwaved a bowl of DISTILLED water for a minute and a half.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely moisturizing and really don&#x27;t feel the need for any type of post shave.</li>
            <li>When I started DE wet shaving, I bought a lot of different creams before realizing the soaps work just as well (if not better) and tend to last a lot longer, for better value.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it&#x27;s so highly recommended from the wet shaving community.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Save the expensive stuff for special occasions but use this everyday for a bit of luxury at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MWF does lather really well with little effort.</li>

            <li> Excellent shaving soap in a really nice dish.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great performing soap with a lite sent this is your soap.</li>
            <li> comes in an attractive ceramic container with a lid.</li>
            <li> Great shave soap.</li>
            <li> Great packing by seller.</li>
            <li> The dish is very nice looking ceramic.</li>
            <li> It provides great lubrication and has a good scent.</li>
            <li> Its up there with the best for sure.  </li>
            <li> The bristles stay perfectly inside the edges while loading the brush and prevent the soap from getting all over the top or sides of the dish.  </li>
            <li> No worries, perfect creamy, easy to make lather in seconds.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, great lather and great shave.</li>
            <li> and the results weren&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have to try it for yourself (and I would encourage each person to give MWF a fair shake) but just know the risks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap is great, easy to lather and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased in the ceramic dish.</li>
            <li> I love it smells great</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s producing much more and richer lather!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a ton of bubble wrap to play with!?</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; shaving soap and I am so impressed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant change and feels very clean.</li>
            <li> There truly is no need for an aftershave product while using this soap, my skin felt amazing when done.  </li>
            <li> The performance is amazing, great razor glide, fantastic post shave.</li>
            <li> I just had to get it with the ceramic dish - liked the look of it to add to my collection.  </li>
            <li> That being said, there are many people who cannot get a good lather out of this soap.</li>
            <li> B&#x27;sB has a smell of citrus and bergamot which compliment this soap nicely.</li>
            <li> Okay, the soap seems to be very good and worth the purchase..</li>
            <li> The lather is pleasantly but lightly scented.</li>
            <li> The soap lathered very easily with my Semogue 1305 boar brush.</li>
            <li> The lanolin smell is very strong with Mitchell&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Packaging was very secure, and the bowl looks the business on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get all 3 passes without having to use more</li>
            <li> which was my favorite part of this purchase.</li>
            <li> Now my top choice.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better lather</li>
            <li> and I will surely be purchasing additional pucks from this company.</li>
            <li> Couple drops on top the fat and soaked the brush.</li>
            <li> Now go to town making your lather until most all bubbles are gone and it peaks.sounds like a lot but distilled water is a dollar a gallon</li>
            <li> I would use the lather that those products produce as my standard for what is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it being much better than this.</li>
            <li> Whip it up some more.</li>
            <li> Basically, this is the best soap possible.</li>
            <li> short, this product is one of the best out there, but it has a learning curve.</li>
            <li> It is classically handsome.</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Most of the controversy revolves around the lathering.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I have ever had a barbershop shave that was any better.  </li>
            <li> all you need is to buy more soap when you need it.</li>
            <li> Shave Cream- a dab of B&#x27;sB on top and mix with Mitchell&#x27;s makes a nice lather, gives a close shave, rinses clean, and leaves the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is packaged nice and has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very good quality soap.</li>
            <li> Love the clean unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li> The lather collapses very quickly before one side is done</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is very mild and I did not even notice it.  </li>
            <li> Decent lather, but not as good as some others.</li>
            <li> First shave with the fat and its amazing.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a fine choice for a shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I realy love this soap and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> Lightly brush puck for about 15 / 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The lubrication is pristine, and the skin is left in great condition.</li>
            <li> It is really light soap.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth.</li>
            <li> I will continue using MWF until it&#x27;s gone (because I&#x27;m cheap)</li>
            <li> The ceramic bowl is a nice touch, but really pushes the price point upwards.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lather lasted thru three passes; I rarely get more than one from Proraso.  </li>
            <li> I tried hot, warm, and cool water.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy to lather.</li>
            <li> shave was also more moisturizing, and the brand-new Feather blade in my Muhle R41 Grande was very, very</li>
            <li> soap smells fantastic and does a great job keeping the skin soft and moist, I have especially sensitive skin, which is why this caught my eye.</li>
            <li> First shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried, and I love it.</li>
            <li> But when you actually get a good lather going, this is silky smoothe and great lube for your facial fur.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant, subtle aroma, very clean, and very fresh.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel good and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> Start swirling the brush around on the softened soap and soon I have a brush full of lather.</li>
            <li> I pour out the water, put the lid on and it is good to the next day.  </li>
            <li> A solid soap with good lather.  </li>
            <li> This is good soap when I can actually get it to work...</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be at all true.  </li>
            <li> It requires a many number of &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to lather well that only an experienced wet shaver would be able to relate.</li>
            <li> but my puck exploded quickly.  </li>
            <li> It iprovides an adequate shave.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy the soap on its own in the future, but spending more for the dish was worth it for the first puck.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but it headlines the product inside which is why we would have purchased it in the first place....</li>
            <li> The lather I created was like rich and thick whipped cream with a light and pleasant oily</li>
            <li> I ended up selling MWF on a forum because (for me) it just wasn&#x27;t worth all the effort.  </li>
            <li> I especially like it in its own dish.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get the same results from the refill puck and your own vessel.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dish and soap come in a cardboard box that I found nice enough to keep.</li>
            <li> Though I have only just started in the fine art of shaving with a classic razor style, this product is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> However, this product IS capable of some of the highest quality lather in the market if you learn those &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; (one may easily google search &amp;#34;MWF lather help&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> would rate this product more highly than Proraso; per above,the lather was both longer lasting and more moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a bit of time to get the lather right.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush was still warm after the first and second passes.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic lather was easily obtained by following instructions / tips suggested by Mantic on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> It lathers easily and I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the problems reported in other reviews related to building lather.</li>
            <li> Smells good and creates a rich lather with very little effort.</li>
            <li> The sent is a mild traditional soap sent, very clean.</li>
            <li> There are just too many other products out there that produce vastly superior lather with significantly less work than MWF, so while the scent is nice and the bowl looks classy, I won&#x27;t bother with The Fat again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and classic.  </li>
            <li> The scent is masculine, but light and fresh.</li>
            <li> The vendor shipped the item quickly and packed it very well.</li>
            <li> Extremely excited to use this new soap I opened the package to find layer upon layer upon layer of bubble wrap keeping the product beyond secured in the box.</li>
            <li> When I soak my badger hair brush for about 5+ minutes in hot water, I also pour hot water in the bowl to cover the soap.</li>
            <li> The extra time working it on your face instead of a bowl also softens your beard better.</li>
            <li> Hot shower followed by a splash of the hot DISTILLED water on face.</li>
            <li> The results were consistently airy, bubbly, foamy lather that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> okay I take it all back.  </li>
            <li> This product deserves all five stars, but the customer should be aware that there is a learning curve to lathering this</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t linger at all.</li>
            <li> It has a rabid following and probably just as many detractors.</li>
            <li> I put a tad of hot water on the soap and soaked my boars&#x27; bristle brush for about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> You will love it &amp; never go back.</li>
            <li> For me this is an everyday soap which will help to keep your skin in good nick.</li>
            <li> And, at least for me, the lather achieved a nice consistency very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not much water needed, and a super smooth shave!</li>
            <li> It leathers very well and has a light masculine scent to it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good soap - It does seem to offer better moisturizing / less drying of the skin than other soaps I use.  </li>
            <li> Taylor might be a bit better but this lasts twice as long</li>
            <li> After trying 5 soaps (awful to awesome), I finally purchased MWF after seeing so many great reviews on various shaving forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lots of other products that are better than this one as far as lather and smell are concerned,  handy container if you only need one</li>
            <li> I get a very clos</li>
            <li> Any ways, onto a real review of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it just really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of MWF.  </li>
            <li> The real difference with MWF is 4-5 hours after your shave.  </li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and very well packaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By this time, both the soap and brush were ready for use.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into scented soaps, this one will not do much for</li>
            <li> I would have saved time and money with trying so many other things.  </li>
            <li> I swirled the brush on the soap just long enough to get it started, and then worked up some really nice lather in a bowl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is a controversial product, at least controversial by wet shaving gear standards.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve just started using a brush to make lather, I&#x27;d suggest going with something soft and creamy at first.</li>
            <li> Instead of working that into my mug, I started face lathering, which I found to do a lot more with a lot less.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why you would need more than one, should have put more into the soap than the expensive looking container.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this classic shaving soap.</li>
            <li> As a classic product, this is something that I would recommend everyone buy and keep around, but it is temperamental and requires some skill.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For soap, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky and I highly recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> The container is fine, but is ceramic so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers quicker than Proraso, but not as fast as Taylor of old bond street.</li>
            <li> Up front, let me just say that my favorite soaps/creams are Tabac, Proraso Green, Castle Forbes Lime, and Oglalla Bay Rum.  </li>
            <li> What isn&#x27;t said though is that if you use moderately hot water, a second bowl, and a brush, you can get more lather from a tiny amount of soap than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I felt this product deserved some explanation.</li>
            <li> and once you get the technique down, it is really easy to make it work.</li>
            <li> I run hot water and soak the entire dish, razor and brush for maybe a minute, and the soap is soft and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> It has a very masculine soapy scent that lasts, but isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li> For cream I highly recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> Being new the DE experience and ordering different soaps to try, I should have tried Mitchells wool fat soap first.</li>
            <li> I find this relatively scentless compared to my other soaps, which I love.</li>
            <li> Under the right conditions and with the right brush (stiff boar hair)</li>
            <li> Update - a couple of months later on, and lots of other soaps tried, and this is still my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Wool Fat sounds nice and slick but it is not slick enough.</li>
            <li> But it does not dry my face out at all and the scent is quite soapy, without much perfume at all.</li>
            <li> I live in Queensland and shave daily with a straight razor and collected rainwater.</li>
            <li> Though I have heard that many people have trouble getting it to lather, as it can be quite particular, I had no issues building a rich thick lather in virtually no time at all.</li>
            <li> I expected better for the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I have particularly sensitive skin and had no problems with this soap.  </li>
            <li> Has an old school barber shop smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I use it with Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men</li>
            <li> MWF demands a combination of soft, lukewarm water and a pre-soaking of the puck.</li>
            <li> Naturally, it&#x27;s the lanolin from the sheep that gives the soap its scent and cushion.</li>
            <li> Some skin is sensitive to lanolin, so proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> good tip is to grate the puck  with a course cheese grater (don&#x27;t tell the wife) back into the container and press it down with your thumbs then use a flat bottomed cup / glass to press it flat.</li>
            <li> you should be able to whip loads of creamy lather that is very slick and protective.</li>
            <li> Prior to shaving, I prepared my face by first washing it with Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cleanser (which I also recommend).  </li>
            <li> but if you live in a soft water area, or use rainwater which is the same thing then lathering is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Easily the hardest to lather soap I have ever used, if you have hard water, be prepared to do work.  </li>
            <li> BUT, then again, experimenting with this hobby is half the fun.  </li>
            <li> On the forums, most people either love or hate MWF.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first foray into anything other than store bought gels or foams.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be unusual, as boar&#x27;s bristle (unlike badger hair) does not normally retain heat too well.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I do not want people to give this product negative reviews because they were not able to achieve a good lather.</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat (MWF) is a high quality product, a high end soap which the price does well to explain compared to other soaps (such as Conk).</li>
            <li> First I microwaved a bowl of DISTILLED water for a minute and a half.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing and really don&#x27;t feel the need for any type of post shave.</li>
            <li> When I started DE wet shaving, I bought a lot of different creams before realizing the soaps work just as well (if not better) and tend to last a lot longer, for better value.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it&#x27;s so highly recommended from the wet shaving community.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Save the expensive stuff for special occasions but use this everyday for a bit of luxury at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MWF does lather really well with little effort.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Will likely try something else when it&#x27;s gone, but can see this ending up as what I use long term.</li>
            <li> and I believe will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> You can produce enough later for 3 or even 4 passes with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a long review.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I make a bigger mess with a larger and deeper soap dish</li>
            <li> Every one will have a different opinion based on skin type, beard, shaving style, the hardness of their water, scent, and other factors.</li>
            <li> Lathers decently even with the hard water I have.  </li>
            <li> but I wet the soap, wet the brush, swirl it around for about 10 seconds or so, enough</li>
            <li> I tried a wet brush, a damp brush, and a dry brush.  </li>
            <li> Its a given that your hands WILL BE WET and lathering with a badger brush things will be SLIPPERY even when careful.</li>
            <li> Just a wet face.  </li>
            <li> The lather is difficult but worth it.</li>
            <li> Every wet shaver should try MWF once in their life.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> main concern was some other relative noobs complaining of MWF being difficult to get a lather out of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be easier than my other soaps...</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve shave a small area of my face then there is no going back.</li>
            <li> the other side is sans lather.</li>
            <li> I have used other creams and had no problems using the DE razors though.</li>
            <li> These people are also the same people who negatively review this</li>
            <li> I would recommend this soap based on my personal experience, and the fact that it has been around since the late 1800s.</li>
            <li> Sad really.</li>
            <li> This stops the puck spinning and stops you loosing your water down beside and under the soap.</li>
            <li> Tried out a few other soaps.</li>
            <li> No skin irritation much less razor burn, and I quite like the scent.</li>
            <li> It will be less dense, but will perform toe-to-toe with any product on the market.  </li>
            <li> For me, I have a slight sensitivity to lanolin, so I bowl lather and strictly paint the lather on my face, without scrubbing.</li>
            <li> You can also choose to buy just the puck which is half the price, but I like the ceramic dish</li>
            <li> recommend getting the dish or one just like it because it makes loading the brush less messy.  </li>
            <li> You just have toresist the urge to add water except for little bits at a time as you work the lather.  </li>
            <li> The book of gourmet shaving kinda explained this up front but said you could add a drop or two of Trumper Skin Food to it to add a little lube.</li>
            <li> was a little pricy</li>
            <li> I am assuming that all the lanolin oil in this soap made for a very thick, viscous fluid that boosted heat and water retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I started DE wet shaving, I bought a lot of different creams before realizing the soaps work just as well (if not better) and tend to last a lot longer, for better value. After trying 5 soaps (awful to awesome), I finally purchased MWF after seeing so many great reviews on various shaving forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern was some other relative noobs complaining of MWF being difficult to get a lather out of. I&#x27;ve found it to be easier than my other soaps... and it&#x27;s producing much more and richer lather! How? When I soak my badger hair brush for about 5+ minutes in hot water, I also pour hot water in the bowl to cover the soap. When I shake my brush out, I pour the water back out of the soap bowl. Start swirling the brush around on the softened soap and soon I have a brush full of lather. Instead of working that into my mug, I started face lathering, which I found to do a lot more with a lot less. The extra time working it on your face instead of a bowl also softens your beard better. I&#x27;m able to get all 3 passes without having to use more soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this one runs out, it&#x27;ll be on my reorder list. Also, some might want to know... I find this relatively scentless compared to my other soaps, which I love. Nothing to interfere with the aftershave balm/skin food/etc.</li>
            <li> Great leather. Love the clean unobtrusive scent. I get a very clos</li>
            <li> Okay, the soap seems to be very good and worth the purchase.. However, I would not order this again based solely on the fragile container. I purchased this soap for the container itself so my wife wouldn&#x27;t want my shave contents in the drawer below my sink. Its a given that your hands WILL BE WET and lathering with a badger brush things will be SLIPPERY even when careful. I already  broke my lid which was my favorite part of this purchase. My fault but it was bound to happen eventually.</li>
            <li> Excellent, great coverage, lather, moisturizing.  Now my top choice.</li>
            <li> Simply Awesome!  I just received my order of this soap, and therefore have only shaved with it once, but what a shave! It has a very pleasant, subtle aroma, very clean, and very fresh. Though I have heard that many people have trouble getting it to lather, as it can be quite particular, I had no issues building a rich thick lather in virtually no time at all. Once lathered up, my razor coasted over my skin with ease. Nice smooth, close shave. There truly is no need for an aftershave product while using this soap, my skin felt amazing when done.  I believe I have finally found my shaving soap. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best shave soap I have ever used. No skin irritation much less razor burn, and I quite like the scent. Packaging was very secure, and the bowl looks the business on my bathroom counter.  Update - a couple of months later on, and lots of other soaps tried, and this is still my favorite by far. Lathers up well, stays slippery, and lather holds up well.  For perspective I use a Merkur 34c with either Derby or Astra blades.</li>
            <li> Purchased this soap on the 12th of April with an expected ship date of April 16-21, I just received the package today, April 15th, not too bad if I do say so myself. Extremely excited to use this new soap I opened the package to find layer upon layer upon layer of bubble wrap keeping the product beyond secured in the box. Who doesn&#x27;t love a ton of bubble wrap to play with!? Any ways, onto a real review of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is perfectly sized for my needs and fits the part. Nothing special, but it headlines the product inside which is why we would have purchased it in the first place....Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells fantastic and does a great job keeping the skin soft and moist, I have especially sensitive skin, which is why this caught my eye. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better lather and I will surely be purchasing additional pucks from this company.</li>
            <li> First shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried, and I love it. Do not need aftershave as the lanolin seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> First shave with the fat and its amazing.  It was super easy to lather. First I microwaved a bowl of DISTILLED water for a minute and a half.  Couple drops on top the fat and soaked the brush. Hot shower followed by a splash of the hot DISTILLED water on face. Lightly brush puck for about 15 / 20 seconds.  Dump water out of bowl and dump your woolfat soapy water into bowl. Now go to town making your lather until most all bubbles are gone and it peaks.sounds like a lot but distilled water is a dollar a gallon and it just really makes a difference. I usually just follow up with a splash of unscented witchhazel .wish I could give six stars!</li>
            <li> Lots of other products that are better than this one as far as lather and smell are concerned,  handy container if you only need one and I don&#x27;t know why you would need more than one, should have put more into the soap than the expensive looking container.</li>
            <li> Bought husband a safety razor, brush, and this wool fat shaving soap. He loves it! Shaves every morning</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is a controversial product, at least controversial by wet shaving gear standards.  On the forums, most people either love or hate MWF.  I had to try it for myself to decide....and the results weren&#x27;t good.  Up front, let me just say that my favorite soaps/creams are Tabac, Proraso Green, Castle Forbes Lime, and Oglalla Bay Rum.  I would use the lather that those products produce as my standard for what is excellent.  I&#x27;m looking for thick and slick lather with a yogurt-like viscosity that cushions and lubricates the blade as it reduces stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros of MWF: I really like the scent of MWF.  It&#x27;s clean and classic.  It has a very masculine soapy scent that lasts, but isn&#x27;t over-powering.  Also, I like the ceramic container.  It works wells and looks classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons of MWF: For me, I simply could not get a shave-worthy lather.  I tried hot, warm, and cool water.  I tried distilled water and tap water.  I tried a boar brush and a badger brush.  I tried a wet brush, a damp brush, and a dry brush.  I tried loading the brush for over a minute.  I tried face-lathering and bowl lathering.  The results were consistently airy, bubbly, foamy lather that didn&#x27;t work.  I got the worse razor burn of my life using MWF.  My neck looked like hamburger after a three pass shave.  I ended up selling MWF on a forum because (for me) it just wasn&#x27;t worth all the effort.  There are just too many other products out there that produce vastly superior lather with significantly less work than MWF, so while the scent is nice and the bowl looks classy, I won&#x27;t bother with The Fat again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have to try it for yourself (and I would encourage each person to give MWF a fair shake) but just know the risks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE ON MAY 20, 2014***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, okay I take it all back.  After several months of working MWF into my rotation, I&#x27;ve finally figured out how to get a proper lather from this behemoth of a soap.  You just have toresist the urge to add water except for little bits at a time as you work the lather.  That&#x27;s the key, I believe.  And you have to know that the lather won&#x27;t look like Tabac or Proraso.  It will be less dense, but will perform toe-to-toe with any product on the market.  The real difference with MWF is 4-5 hours after your shave.  Your face is still BBS with no signs of five o&#x27;clock shadow.  That must be the lanolin, I guess.  After quite a bit of work, MWF is now a product that I&#x27;ll never be without in my shave den.</li>
            <li> Switched to this from Proraso shaving soap (the green one). The Proraso irritated and dried out my skin very badly. Did some research and switched to this. The lubrication is pristine, and the skin is left in great condition. I can&#x27;t imagine it being much better than this.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a bit of time to get the lather right. Yes, it might take an additional bowl. Yes, this isn&#x27;t the easiest product to use. We know all of that. What isn&#x27;t said though is that if you use moderately hot water, a second bowl, and a brush, you can get more lather from a tiny amount of soap than I ever thought possible. Maybe my water just works with it but I wet the soap, wet the brush, swirl it around for about 10 seconds or so, enough so that soap is soapy on the block and brush, then shove all of those suds into a bowl. I whip the suds around and it forms a bit of a peak. Add water when necessary. Whip it up some more. You can produce enough later for 3 or even 4 passes with minimal effort. The trick is to add water very slowly and whip it up to produce the lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also. It is really light soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my very sensitive and dry skin. It has a neutral scent. Basically, this is the best soap possible. It seems to last forever as well. It&#x27;s lubrication is superb. For soap, I would highly recommend this. For cream I highly recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street. Taylor might be a bit better but this lasts twice as long and once you get the technique down, it is really easy to make it work. Use a big bowl though. It really helps.</li>
            <li> Pretty good soap - It does seem to offer better moisturizing / less drying of the skin than other soaps I use.  Lathers decently even with the hard water I have.  Was difficult the 1st 3-4 times I used it, then it seemed to loosen up and lather easier.  Fairly expensive soap, but it is hard as a rock and I believe will last a very long time.  After 8-10 uses, you can hardly tell any soap has been used.  I just had to get it with the ceramic dish - liked the look of it to add to my collection.  Overall, a very good quality soap.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Properly protected with copious bubble wrap.  I have particularly sensitive skin and had no problems with this soap.  Fantastic lather was easily obtained by following instructions / tips suggested by Mantic on YouTube.  Maybe it is just my water at my house but my puck exploded quickly.  I don&#x27;t usually face lather but as this was suggested I tried it.  It worked well.  And, at least for me, the lather achieved a nice consistency very quickly.  No burn or irritation. No need for an preshave lubricants.  Just a wet face.  If I had tried this (and the Tabac which is also terrific) I would have saved time and money with trying so many other things.  BUT, then again, experimenting with this hobby is half the fun.  Try it.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is an excellent soap. It provides great lubrication and has a good scent. It lathers easily and I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the problems reported in other reviews related to building lather. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I live in Queensland and shave daily with a straight razor and collected rainwater. Now I have heard that people struggle to get a lather but if you live in a soft water area, or use rainwater which is the same thing then lathering is a breeze. No worries, perfect creamy, easy to make lather in seconds. Cushions and protects. Shaving is a bit of a hobby for me, so this is not the only soap I use but Its up there with the best for sure.  For me this is an everyday soap which will help to keep your skin in good nick. Save the expensive stuff for special occasions but use this everyday for a bit of luxury at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good tip is to grate the puck  with a course cheese grater (don&#x27;t tell the wife) back into the container and press it down with your thumbs then use a flat bottomed cup / glass to press it flat. This stops the puck spinning and stops you loosing your water down beside and under the soap. It makes it so much easier to use.  I hope that tip helps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It lathers up very well. Not much water needed, and a super smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I felt this product deserved some explanation. Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat (MWF) is a high quality product, a high end soap which the price does well to explain compared to other soaps (such as Conk). That being said, there are many people who cannot get a good lather out of this soap. These people are also the same people who negatively review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here to tell everyone that this soap IS difficult to lather. It requires a many number of &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to lather well that only an experienced wet shaver would be able to relate. However, this product IS capable of some of the highest quality lather in the market if you learn those &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; (one may easily google search &amp;#34;MWF lather help&amp;#34;). Additionally, I do not want people to give this product negative reviews because they were not able to achieve a good lather. This product deserves all five stars, but the customer should be aware that there is a learning curve to lathering this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this product is one of the best out there, but it has a learning curve. So please don&#x27;t review it negatively if you couldn&#x27;t lather...</li>
            <li> I especially like it in its own dish.  I run hot water and soak the entire dish, razor and brush for maybe a minute, and the soap is soft and ready to go.  I pour out the water, put the lid on and it is good to the next day.  It will easily last 6 months.</li>
            <li> Wool Fat sounds nice and slick but it is not slick enough. It is packaged nice and has a mild scent. It iprovides an adequate shave. I expected better for the money I spent. For nine dollars I can buy Cremo Cream which is really slick. I can also buy Tabula Rasa that has a great scent. It&#x27; just an adequte soap with a real nice jar.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap in the world. The scent is masculine, but light and fresh. The shave is smooth. The lather is difficult but worth it. Start by prehydrating the puck and load a damp brush. Then add water mid lather.</li>
            <li> Though I have only just started in the fine art of shaving with a classic razor style, this product is simply amazing.  It leathers very well and has a light masculine scent to it.  Definitely a fine choice for a shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The soap is great, easy to lather and has a pleasant smell.  The container is fine, but is ceramic so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased in the ceramic dish. It is classically handsome. The soap lathered very easily with my Semogue 1305 boar brush. It created a thick, slick lather. The lather is pleasantly but lightly scented. I look forward to using this classic shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Tried several soaps. This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Shaving soap, as with anything having to do with shaving, is very personal. Every one will have a different opinion based on skin type, beard, shaving style, the hardness of their water, scent, and other factors. I would recommend this soap based on my personal experience, and the fact that it has been around since the late 1800s. It contains lanolin, so a very small percentage of people may have a sensitivity to it. It lathers well, has almost no scent, and allows a great shave. It comes in a ceramic bowl which adds a lot to the price.</li>
            <li> A solid soap with good lather.  Has an old school barber shop smell to it.  Works best if the puck is soaked in water.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap in a really nice dish. I&#x27;ll just buy the soap on its own in the future, but spending more for the dish was worth it for the first puck.</li>
            <li> This is not a product for beginners. If you&#x27;ve just started using a brush to make lather, I&#x27;d suggest going with something soft and creamy at first. However, if you&#x27;ve build up some skills, then you should give this a shot. Under the right conditions and with the right brush (stiff boar hair) you should be able to whip loads of creamy lather that is very slick and protective. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t linger at all. Once I&#x27;ve shave a small area of my face then there is no going back. I have to re-lather in order to shave that area again. But it does not dry my face out at all and the scent is quite soapy, without much perfume at all. It&#x27;s a pleasant change and feels very clean. As a classic product, this is something that I would recommend everyone buy and keep around, but it is temperamental and requires some skill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving. Tried out a few other soaps. But this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> Decent lather, but not as good as some others. The lather collapses very quickly before one side is done the other side is sans lather. Sad really.</li>
            <li> Smells good and creates a rich lather with very little effort. Going to keep the Dish and just order the soap in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now..and I will admit I am newer to DE Safety Razor shaving. I have used other creams and had no problems using the DE razors though. This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to lubricate as well and can cause some skipping. The book of gourmet shaving kinda explained this up front but said you could add a drop or two of Trumper Skin Food to it to add a little lube. That did improve it dramatically. MWF does lather really well with little effort. I will continue using MWF until it&#x27;s gone (because I&#x27;m cheap) and then I may try something else once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> my fave shave soap. I use it with Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men Shave Cream- a dab of B&#x27;sB on top and mix with Mitchell&#x27;s makes a nice lather, gives a close shave, rinses clean, and leaves the skin moisturized. The lanolin smell is very strong with Mitchell&#x27;s. B&#x27;sB has a smell of citrus and bergamot which compliment this soap nicely.</li>
            <li> The vendor shipped the item quickly and packed it very well. The soap lathers quicker than Proraso, but not as fast as Taylor of old bond street. The performance is amazing, great razor glide, fantastic post shave. If you are looking for a great performing soap with a lite sent this is your soap. The sent is a mild traditional soap sent, very clean. It is extremely moisturizing and really don&#x27;t feel the need for any type of post shave. This and Razorock P160 are my two favs!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and very well packaged. Best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble building a thick lather with a boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> This is good soap when I can actually get it to work... Easily the hardest to lather soap I have ever used, if you have hard water, be prepared to do work.  Lots of work.  But when you actually get a good lather going, this is silky smoothe and great lube for your facial fur.</li>
            <li> Being new the DE experience and ordering different soaps to try, I should have tried Mitchells wool fat soap first. Love this soap, great lather and great shave. I highly reccommend</li>
            <li> I realy love this soap and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first foray into anything other than store bought gels or foams. I like it. Took some time to learn to lather. Water an patience needed. Will likely try something else when it&#x27;s gone, but can see this ending up as what I use long term.</li>
            <li> The Fat is a common nickname among wet shaving enthusiasts for Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap. It has a rabid following and probably just as many detractors. Most of the controversy revolves around the lathering. MWF demands a combination of soft, lukewarm water and a pre-soaking of the puck. A dryish shaving brush loads a bit easier and whether you bowl or face lather, you have to watch the amount of water that is added.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; and hints of animal. Naturally, it&#x27;s the lanolin from the sheep that gives the soap its scent and cushion. Some skin is sensitive to lanolin, so proceed with caution. For me, I have a slight sensitivity to lanolin, so I bowl lather and strictly paint the lather on my face, without scrubbing. The ceramic bowl is a nice touch, but really pushes the price point upwards. You&#x27;ll get the same results from the refill puck and your own vessel. Every wet shaver should try MWF once in their life.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband decided to try it &amp; loves it. Lid was broken in packaging but a wooden shave bowl lid works.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a long review.  This is the best soap ever. It leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love it smells great makes my skin feel good and does not dry it out. I&#x27;m picky and I highly recommend this to you. You can also choose to buy just the puck which is half the price, but I like the ceramic dish</li>
            <li> After trying almost a dozen soaps, this one is the best. Wool Fat will always have a place in my shave routine.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product!!!!  I read the various reviews indicating that the Mitchell&#x27;s WFS is difficult to lather.  I did not find this to be at all true.  I put a tad of hot water on the soap and soaked my boars&#x27; bristle brush for about 10 minutes.  Prior to shaving, I prepared my face by first washing it with Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cleanser (which I also recommend).  After rinsing, I applied The Grooming Lounge&#x27;s shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time, both the soap and brush were ready for use.  I swirled the brush on the soap just long enough to get it started, and then worked up some really nice lather in a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather lasted thru three passes; I rarely get more than one from Proraso.  Also, the brush was still warm after the first and second passes.  I have found this to be unusual, as boar&#x27;s bristle (unlike badger hair) does not normally retain heat too well.  I am assuming that all the lanolin oil in this soap made for a very thick, viscous fluid that boosted heat and water retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was also more moisturizing, and the brand-new Feather blade in my Muhle R41 Grande was very, very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this product more highly than Proraso; per above,the lather was both longer lasting and more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I have ever had a barbershop shave that was any better.  But then, I have been shaved by one of the street barbers in India; they may be the best in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this review and still using goop from a can (like I did for decades), do yourself a favor and buy this product.  You will love it &amp; never go back.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; shaving soap and I am so impressed.  The lather I created was like rich and thick whipped cream with a light and pleasant oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting the dish or one just like it because it makes loading the brush less messy.  The bristles stay perfectly inside the edges while loading the brush and prevent the soap from getting all over the top or sides of the dish.  For some reason I make a bigger mess with a larger and deeper soap dish that I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very mild and I did not even notice it.  If you&#x27;re into scented soaps, this one will not do much for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dish and soap come in a cardboard box that I found nice enough to keep.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it&#x27;s so highly recommended from the wet shaving community. comes in an attractive ceramic container with a lid. was a little pricy but it&#x27;s a permanent home for the soap. all you need is to buy more soap when you need it.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Great shave soap. The dish is very nice looking ceramic. Delivered quickly. Great packing by seller.</li>
