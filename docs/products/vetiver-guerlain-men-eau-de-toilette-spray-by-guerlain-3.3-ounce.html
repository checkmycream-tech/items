    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best vetiver fragrance that i have ever smelled.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, not too strong.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent that can easily be worn by both men and women.</li>
            <li>Husband loved this gift.  </li>
            <li>It is indescribably erotic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sophisticated!</li>
            <li>Nice cologne , I like vetiver</li>
            <li>nice vintage mens scent..stays on</li>
            <li>Excellent, my husband love it so much, always I will bought it that product</li>
            <li>I think Guerlain&#x27;s example is best worn in the spring and early summer.  </li>
            <li>The transition from its initial &amp;#34;harsh, dirty&amp;#34; opening to the magnificent and smooth drydown is amazing!</li>
            <li>Well there&#x27;s just one thing about this cologne I didn&#x27;t care for too much as it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>I like much more as a better price point for starters.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll give Vetiver by Guerlain some credit it doesn&#x27;t turn into a creamy lemon musk powder scent throughout the hours it holds together more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll still use up this bottle of Vetiver as it&#x27;s differentials make it interesting.</li>
            <li>my ultimately favorite scent of all time.  </li>
            <li>For Terre d&#x27;Hermes lovers try this one I love it much better as lemon+vetiver  is much better combo for me</li>
            <li>Lovely bottle as well.</li>
            <li>this is my housband favorite</li>
            <li>Like it better than the Creed vetiver didn&#x27;t think I would.  </li>
            <li>Both my husband love it and it is one of our favs.</li>
            <li>I love the smell on men</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and this is about 30% cheaper than at the duty free at Charles de Gaulle airport.....and w/o the mobs!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is soft and unforgettable.  </li>
            <li>An excellent fragrance with a complexity and sophistication often lacking in vetiver-based offerings from other fragrance houses.  </li>
            <li>but I do get a light note in Tabac that occurs from time to time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light after sometime.</li>
            <li>Fantastic as always.  </li>
            <li>The best summer perfume a real man can put on himself early in the morning after a shower, it is so refreshing, uplifting and energising, love it, love it, this is probably the most natural scent I had ever smelled so far!!!</li>
            <li>Tabac Original came out in 1959</li>
            <li>) version of Tabac Original.</li>
            <li>This hard to  is perfect, I like to wear men;s colognes, etc</li>
            <li>Very true should have tried it first</li>
            <li>I like the clean fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a classic smell, in that it&#x27;s a example of the style of the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is my favorite; I would like it even more if it were longer lasting.  </li>
            <li>Plus I liked the vetiver note in Preferred Stock and Red For Men</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Pleasantly fresh and outdoorsy, this scent has an enticing mixture of wood, vetiver, tobacco, and spice.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering; it won&#x27;t smell like you chopped a can of air freshener in half when you pass through a room, but it has good longevity.</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t buy it again because it&#x27;s not expansive/different enough from a great $20 cologne from Germany that will last much longer.</li>
            <li>and I also love the smell on me (female).  </li>
            <li>and it used to be my late husbands favorite, so I was very excited to find it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more in the formal category as it is so unique and not something for everyday -- for myself.</li>
            <li>A very old vintage connotation if you are over 50, a fine old vintage.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent scent..</li>
            <li>Guerlain Vetiver EDT is rather uncomplicated straight forward fragrance.</li>
            <li>, I recomended for all people, thanKs</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely similar to Tabac Original cologne.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a clean, woody, spicy scent that is definitely masculine and unique, standing out from the typical musk-scented men&#x27;s colognes.  </li>
            <li>the classic eau de toilette for men from Guerlain....</li>
            <li>It has one dominating note, which is pretty strong and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The new version smells better than the previous one.</li>
            <li>why mention Tabac Original?&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the vetiver note and a little more bergamot in Guerlain&#x27;s formula...</li>
            <li>Tabac does have a little more promininent I feel closer to pipe tobacco.</li>
            <li>It is masculine without being overwhelming and applies easily as a final touch while you&#x27;re dressing for evening engagements such as a night at the theatre or a dinner</li>
            <li>It does have that spoil yourself scent, but you will want to sample this at a counter like at Saks or such to ensure that it is right for you before adding to your scent menagerie.</li>
            <li>The opening is a bit too strong, but the middle is lots of cedar and dry grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure and simple!  </li>
            <li>But I like that soft musky settle Tabac</li>
            <li>I think it smells like ancient old dude</li>
            <li>An old school smell and pure Guerlain as only Guerlain can.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like it, not sharp like Creed, not Tom Ford.</li>
            <li>I said it&#x27;s a mildly altered and less</li>
    </ol>

            <li> though and not in the same vein at L&amp;#34;Occitane en Provence Vetyver or Tom Ford&#x27;s Grey Vetiver.  </li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, a little too perfume-like.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this cologne has been around so long...</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s far from an unpleasant smell, to my nose.</li>
            <li> Tabac is in the late teens/early twenties for a 10.1 oz splash bottle...</li>
            <li> This is expansive and so complex, as stated, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Guerlain &amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I mean is</li>
            <li> Now before this review comes off as purely negative let me state that I did not regret buying Vetiver by Guerlain as a blind buy.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Now before this review comes off as purely negative let me state that I did not regret buying Vetiver by Guerlain as a blind buy.Very true should have tried it first but I&#x27;m open to the old-school scents as that&#x27;s what I grew up on.Plus I liked the vetiver note in Preferred Stock and Red For Men so I was optimistic to try Guerlain&#x27;s scent.Well there&#x27;s just one thing about this cologne I didn&#x27;t care for too much as it&#x27;s very light.Took me 5 to 6 sprays so that I can actually smell it trailing up from my shirt collar driving to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why mention Tabac Original?&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the vetiver note and a little more bergamot in Guerlain&#x27;s formula...it&#x27;s extremely similar to Tabac Original cologne.Flat out the Tabac I like much more as a better price point for starters.Tabac is in the late teens/early twenties for a 10.1 oz splash bottle...this is $45 for a 3.4oz spray bottle.I don&#x27;t get any wood from Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver but I do get a light note in Tabac that occurs from time to time.Tabac does have a little more promininent I feel closer to pipe tobacco.Vetiver has more of a stale cigarette tobacco smell to me,somewhat bitter.Really similar creamy soap character and lemon scent in Tabac as Vetiver.Now I&#x27;ll give Vetiver by Guerlain some credit it doesn&#x27;t turn into a creamy lemon musk powder scent throughout the hours it holds together more.But I like that soft musky settle Tabac has...after all both of these are a barbershop scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use up this bottle of Vetiver as it&#x27;s differentials make it interesting.But I won&#x27;t buy it again because it&#x27;s not expansive/different enough from a great $20 cologne from Germany that will last much longer.Tabac Original came out in 1959 Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver came out in 1961.Like I said it&#x27;s a mildly altered and less concentrated(on my skin) version of Tabac Original.</li>
            <li> my ultimately favorite scent of all time.  I have had it in my repertoire for longer than I want to admit to.</li>
            <li> The best summer perfume a real man can put on himself early in the morning after a shower, it is so refreshing, uplifting and energising, love it, love it, this is probably the most natural scent I had ever smelled so far!!! For Terre d&#x27;Hermes lovers try this one I love it much better as lemon+vetiver  is much better combo for me then TDH orange+vetiver .</li>
            <li> Guerlain Vetiver EDT is rather uncomplicated straight forward fragrance. It has one dominating note, which is pretty strong and last a long time. It is not a flattering note, rather a decisive one instead, which you will either like or not!</li>
            <li> Nice cologne , I like vetiver and it&#x27;s light after sometime. Goes well with my chemistry. I was suspicious due to its old origin but I don&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, a little too perfume-like.  Wore it a couple of times, and now it lives in a bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Masterpiece!  Pure and simple!  This is the best vetiver fragrance that i have ever smelled.  The transition from its initial &amp;#34;harsh, dirty&amp;#34; opening to the magnificent and smooth drydown is amazing!</li>
            <li> My husband loves. I think it smells like ancient old dude</li>
            <li> Wonderful, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Husband loved this gift.  I like the clean fresh fragrance.  Expensive fragrance, but worth every penny!  Lovely bottle as well.</li>
            <li> An excellent fragrance with a complexity and sophistication often lacking in vetiver-based offerings from other fragrance houses.  This one is a &amp;#34;light touch&amp;#34; though and not in the same vein at L&amp;#34;Occitane en Provence Vetyver or Tom Ford&#x27;s Grey Vetiver.  What I mean is I think Guerlain&#x27;s example is best worn in the spring and early summer.  It&#x27;s definitely not a fall/winter scent - it does not have the robustness to complement a man in these seasons.</li>
            <li> An old school smell and pure Guerlain as only Guerlain can.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like it, not sharp like Creed, not Tom Ford. This is expansive and so complex, as stated, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Guerlain &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Pleasantly fresh and outdoorsy, this scent has an enticing mixture of wood, vetiver, tobacco, and spice. It is masculine without being overwhelming and applies easily as a final touch while you&#x27;re dressing for evening engagements such as a night at the theatre or a dinner party.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It is more in the formal category as it is so unique and not something for everyday -- for myself. It does have that spoil yourself scent, but you will want to sample this at a counter like at Saks or such to ensure that it is right for you before adding to your scent menagerie. A very old vintage connotation if you are over 50, a fine old vintage.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids say this cologne makes me smell like a nursing home resident. I have to ratio this cologne 1:3 with another scent so I can use it up and move on. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent that can easily be worn by both men and women.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent scent..</li>
            <li> Is an excelent eau de toilet for men. this is my housband favorite</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a scent that was formulated in 1961, it&#x27;s not a surprise that this smells dated. I imagine this is what one of the Gibb brothers would smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far from an unpleasant smell, to my nose. The opening is a bit too strong, but the middle is lots of cedar and dry grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few men can wear this these days, though. Sure, it&#x27;s a classic smell, in that it&#x27;s a example of the style of the 60&#x27;s. Wearing this out today is just as bad as wearing vintage 60&#x27;s clothing, and you will get just as many odd glances.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is my favorite; I would like it even more if it were longer lasting.  The new version smells better than the previous one.</li>
            <li> Excellent, my husband love it so much, always I will bought it that product, I recomended for all people, thanKs</li>
            <li> nice vintage mens scent..stays on</li>
            <li> Fantastic as always.  Like it better than the Creed vetiver didn&#x27;t think I would.  Both my husband love it and it is one of our favs.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this cologne has been around so long...&lt;br /&gt;I did not like it... and I had asked several women comment on this also.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This hard to  is perfect, I like to wear men;s colognes, etc and it used to be my late husbands favorite, so I was very excited to find it</li>
            <li> This cologne has a clean, woody, spicy scent that is definitely masculine and unique, standing out from the typical musk-scented men&#x27;s colognes.  It is not overpowering; it won&#x27;t smell like you chopped a can of air freshener in half when you pass through a room, but it has good longevity.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is soft and unforgettable.  I love the smell on men and I also love the smell on me (female).  It is indescribably erotic.  (I believe this was James Bond&#x27;s preference as well....)</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s sophisticated!</li>
            <li> the classic eau de toilette for men from Guerlain....and this is about 30% cheaper than at the duty free at Charles de Gaulle airport.....and w/o the mobs!</li>
