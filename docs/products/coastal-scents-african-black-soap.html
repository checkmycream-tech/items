            <li>Love, love, LOVE this soap!  </li>
            <li>Great product that I have shared with others, I have received positive feedback after sharing with coworkers.</li>
            <li>its HUGE!  </li>
            <li>The soap does a great job but is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get 4 4oz bars.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer to use it as a bar soap as I can regulate it&#x27;s application better that way.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIOS AND WILL CONTINUE</li>
            <li>hAVE CONVERTED MANY PEOPLE..</li>
            <li>A healthy pH</li>
            <li>LOVE.  </li>
            <li>You have to be sure it does not sit in any water or it melts</li>
            <li>I also recommend that you get the unrefined shea butter to use as a moisturizer:)</li>
            <li>Love this soap</li>
            <li>(See how many o&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I love this soap and will never buy anything else, I plan on buying in bulk, but until then I have it set up to come, even if i dont need it because i do not want to run out, I have given all my family members pieces of this soap</li>
            <li>and they love it.</li>
            <li>This soap came quickly and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>As expected, a wonderful soap.</li>
            <li>It melts easy in the shower</li>
            <li>It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Love the soap, it kinda has a drying effect after so many washes, but I just moisturize right after.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, from my experience and my preference, this stuff isn&#x27;t as good as normal Dove or Dial body wash</li>
            <li>It makes my hair a little waxy feeling and tangly, but my skin is awesome.....</li>
            <li>Also, as stated, the brick is huge.</li>
            <li>face feels smooth after words.</li>
            <li>Like his, my husband and I have both noticed how bright and soft our skin has been since using this product.</li>
            <li>I think I may have found a new love :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over two years since my original review, and I still swear by it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s meant to imply a significant amount of time passing.</li>
            <li>I feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I have lumps from overactive oil glands and this soap is most certainly improving the look of the lumps.  </li>
            <li>Not sold on the miracle stories going on around the internet world but this soap has a nice lather and leaves your skin soft but that&#x27;s about it...</li>
            <li>and I feel super clean.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this if you are looking for a great scent - as it pretty much has a neutral or natural scent - and don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for a lot of suds and foam -</li>
            <li>This soap came fast but it&#x27;s really sticky and does not have a nice smell</li>
            <li>After the very first face wash, I found my face the smoothest</li>
            <li>More than you would normally have inferred from my statement.)</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural since I&#x27;ve been getting rid of un-natural and chemical-filled body products and beauty items.</li>
            <li>It smells earthy fresh, like nature</li>
            <li>you get your monies worth.</li>
            <li>So far, I do love the results.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for natural soap.  </li>
            <li>a nice nighttime moisturizer following the wash left me touching my skin all evening.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>There are still acne marks but much lighter an I don&#x27;t break out as often as I did before!</li>
            <li>It is unscented but has a odor when the package is first opened.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Smell - natural and light.</li>
            <li>Loved this soap, however I found that i can not use it everyday.</li>
            <li>:) And this is HUGE, so I cut it in half.</li>
            <li>Gets you very clean, leaves no residue, leaves me smelling fresh and clean without the heavily perfumed scents a lot of soaps have.  </li>
            <li>This black soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted to try black soap from the craze, but I think it&#x27;s honestly over hyped.</li>
            <li>(Mildly Oily and Sensitive Skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One 16oz pack lasts me about a month which is a shorter time period than a large bottle of Dr Bonners.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>My whole family now uses.</li>
            <li>It can be very drying.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap for years and was ready for a change.  </li>
            <li>after much research on this soap i decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The important thing to remember (especially if you are using this soap on your face) is that the soap itself has a pH of about 10.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t get as much for your money now.  </li>
            <li>I havent used this yet because i still have 3 more left from the old purchase i made with another company, but cant wait to use it</li>
            <li>There is not much as far as suds, thus easy to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>It is not pretty but the soaps works and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying that this soap is NOT a miracle soap, BUT it has worked better for me than any other soap I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne for as long as I can remember, and I think I have the most sensitive skin in the world.</li>
            <li>It is much healthier and works way better than the manufactured bars of black soap.</li>
            <li>and you have yourself some new skin!</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best african soap I purchased and the only one I will.</li>
            <li>It has made my pores tighter and my skin feels brighter, less oily and much more even looking.</li>
            <li>and it left my face feeling smooth and soft, not stripped at all.</li>
            <li>I know that this review has not sounded overly positive so far</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a very natural soap that has healing properties this is for you!</li>
            <li>I actually noticed a difference in my skin the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>It is such a large block that I cut it into three sections when I first got it.</li>
            <li>The outer layer of packing was open, but the inside wrap was just fine, washed my face the next day, this foamed really well</li>
            <li>If you have skin that already has a very high or low pH, it is important that you have a toner that can bring your face&#x27;s pH back to a normal level after using this</li>
            <li>It leaves me clean, not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>This is not a knockoff like many other so called authentic African black soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found it particularly useful as a direct facial cleanser 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>Sort of like very old vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>it has almost completely cleared my skin!</li>
            <li>soap lathers extremely well and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of soaps, etc.</li>
            <li>I keep the remainder in a zip lock bag to keep it soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend you do not rub it directly on your skin until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>No miracles thus far.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and helped even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Also, the ingredients are completely natural.  </li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin, rosecea this may not be the soap for you.  </li>
            <li>helps a ton with adult acne</li>
            <li>that is the natural ingredients creating the color.</li>
            <li>also use it directly on my scalp twice a week to combat seborrheic</li>
            <li>, I dissolve some in a container and use as a body wash, I also use this on my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is so refreshing to not have a pimple in site &amp; to have truly clear skin, only a few weeks after beginning this regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I rarely get any big or red acne anymore.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel tight and clean.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it was tight and squeaky clean but</li>
            <li>and i give it 4 stars because the first week i used it my face felt dry...</li>
            <li>I purchased quite a few brands (I think 3) when I purchased this soap to determine the best brand of black african soap and this brand won hands down!  </li>
            <li>It dried out my dry areas even more.</li>
            <li>Then I learned that the pH is about 10, and in order to make the skin back to normal</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and made with just a few ingredients that I can actually read and know that they are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like those other &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; that are grounded and filled with fragrance and other not so natural stuff.</li>
            <li>I have only had a few break outs, since I have been using this soap, but they clear up so quickly that I forget that they are there.</li>
            <li>I used to use a different kind, but I have always wanted to try the RAW black soap.</li>
            <li>I will order again, which will probably be at least a year because this bar is HUGE.</li>
            <li>Black soap can be drying, but the remedy for that is to apply it &amp; remove it quickly; I don&#x27;t let it dry on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a little off putting at first</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this soap based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews, but there are some very sharp small bits of something in my bar of soap.</li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks I applied the black soap in the morning and at night to clear my skin, and now apply the black soap just once at bedtime.</li>

            <li> It is not pretty but the soaps works and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that this soap is NOT a miracle soap, BUT it has worked better for me than any other soap I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for as long as I can remember, and I think I have the most sensitive skin in the world.</li>
            <li> It is much healthier and works way better than the manufactured bars of black soap.</li>
            <li> and you have yourself some new skin!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best african soap I purchased and the only one I will.</li>
            <li> It has made my pores tighter and my skin feels brighter, less oily and much more even looking.</li>
            <li> and it left my face feeling smooth and soft, not stripped at all.</li>
            <li> I know that this review has not sounded overly positive so far</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for a very natural soap that has healing properties this is for you!</li>
            <li> I actually noticed a difference in my skin the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> It is such a large block that I cut it into three sections when I first got it.</li>
            <li> The outer layer of packing was open, but the inside wrap was just fine, washed my face the next day, this foamed really well</li>
            <li> If you have skin that already has a very high or low pH, it is important that you have a toner that can bring your face&#x27;s pH back to a normal level after using this</li>
            <li> It leaves me clean, not overly dry.  </li>
            <li> This is not a knockoff like many other so called authentic African black soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it particularly useful as a direct facial cleanser 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Sort of like very old vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> it has almost completely cleared my skin!</li>
            <li> soap lathers extremely well and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of soaps, etc.</li>
            <li> I keep the remainder in a zip lock bag to keep it soft.</li>
            <li> I recommend you do not rub it directly on your skin until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> No miracles thus far.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and helped even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Also, the ingredients are completely natural.  </li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive skin, rosecea this may not be the soap for you.  </li>
            <li> helps a ton with adult acne</li>
            <li> that is the natural ingredients creating the color.</li>
            <li> also use it directly on my scalp twice a week to combat seborrheic</li>
            <li> , I dissolve some in a container and use as a body wash, I also use this on my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is so refreshing to not have a pimple in site &amp; to have truly clear skin, only a few weeks after beginning this regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I rarely get any big or red acne anymore.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel tight and clean.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was tight and squeaky clean but</li>
            <li> and i give it 4 stars because the first week i used it my face felt dry...</li>
            <li> I purchased quite a few brands (I think 3) when I purchased this soap to determine the best brand of black african soap and this brand won hands down!  </li>
            <li> It dried out my dry areas even more.</li>
            <li> Then I learned that the pH is about 10, and in order to make the skin back to normal</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and made with just a few ingredients that I can actually read and know that they are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like those other &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; that are grounded and filled with fragrance and other not so natural stuff.</li>
            <li> I have only had a few break outs, since I have been using this soap, but they clear up so quickly that I forget that they are there.</li>
            <li> I used to use a different kind, but I have always wanted to try the RAW black soap.</li>
            <li> I will order again, which will probably be at least a year because this bar is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Black soap can be drying, but the remedy for that is to apply it &amp; remove it quickly; I don&#x27;t let it dry on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little off putting at first</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this soap based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews, but there are some very sharp small bits of something in my bar of soap.</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks I applied the black soap in the morning and at night to clear my skin, and now apply the black soap just once at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Miracles?</li>
            <li> A single brick of this will last you moooooooooooooonths.</li>
            <li> i been leaving it on my face for too long, for like about 5-7 mins ...</li>
            <li> My sister recommended it for my extremely dry skin and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I purchased from the coastal scents website during their half off sale last month.</li>
            <li> I switched to Coastal Scents African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> Upon recommendation from my hair dresser I decided to try the African Black soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have tried numerous black soap manufacturers and this has stood out as highest in quality, not to mention its convenient bulk pricing.</li>
            <li> Coastal Scents African Black Soap is legit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand of black soap for at least 6 years now.</li>
            <li> The odor goes away as soon as you wet it.</li>
            <li> The soap also seems to condense quite a bit after you wet it.  </li>
            <li> There are small particles/fragments in the soap that can scrape you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used my Clarisonic because it was obnoxious to use with liquid cleansers.</li>
            <li> Comes on time and works as expected</li>
            <li> Recommend cutting it into half inch or slightly smaller squares since it lathers quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out what in the ingredients would be sharp.</li>
            <li> I shower 2-3 times per day and after using this soap there&#x27;s always dirt coming off of me that I didn&#x27;t realize with other soaps.  </li>
            <li> I simply sliced off a small slice with a kitchen knife.</li>
            <li> may dry out your face a little so use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use daily and at least 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will tone down.</li>
            <li> As well, after cleaning my skin with the black soap, I use an hypoallergenic moisturizer (Sebamed).</li>
            <li> it has a pH of about 3, which balances me out after using the black</li>
            <li> Part black soap to 4 parts Dr. Bronner&#x27;s (Tea Tree) to 5 parts purified water in a dispenser for body wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using black soap now since Feb 2012</li>
            <li> I use the Black Soap as a Bar all over on my face and hair and have dried dissolving it and using it like that</li>
            <li> My tone has evened out, the redness has decreased and my acne has definitely gone down.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate once a week with a little sugar added to the soap</li>
            <li> I just break a piece off and use it a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Found black hard sharp things in my soap as I was washing my face and it scratched me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an African secret, using cocoa ash and palm kernel.  </li>
            <li> I used this for two weeks and it dried my face out a ton.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this soap and used it for a few days - and it got rid of my razor burn bumps as well as bumps on my arm that I have been struggling with for a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using black soap for a few months and it has changed my skin!</li>
            <li> ( You will, however, need to remove your eye makeup your usual way.</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin for years, I have used everything on the market, they usually work for a while and stop.</li>
            <li> I still use a moisturizer after washing my face with anything, but this soap had the least drying effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my blackheads and this scar i have on my face are slowly fading away...</li>
            <li> Plus there were a few questionable curly hairs in there also.</li>
            <li> I still have an itchy forehead, my skin is worse than before.</li>
            <li> and besides it seemed old, broke me out like crazy !!!!</li>
            <li> The soap looks like a nasty old porkchop, but don&#x27;t be turned off.....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This had a weird smell, was difficult to handle and didn&#x27;t seem to help my rosacea.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry me out horribly like it did my skin, but wasn&#x27;t anything impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not normal and very disgusted.</li>
            <li> this soap keeps both from getting too bad.  </li>
            <li> I also never use toner, and this seems like an annoying part for having to use this</li>
            <li> Disgusted !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this on my face and it feels great, takes the makeup off...and I didn&#x27;t even need moisturizer...I think I may have found a new love :)</li>
            <li> I order because of my daughter ordered..It is not pretty but the soaps works and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this soap based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews, but there are some very sharp small bits of something in my bar of soap. I can&#x27;t figure out what in the ingredients would be sharp. Maybe I got a defective bar, but I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases ever. It leaves the skin soft and a delightful scent. The best soap ever.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. Worked wonders on my son&#x27;s problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Loved this soap, however I found that i can not use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this soap!  I have been using this soap for about a year now on my face and will not buy anything else!  I purchased quite a few brands (I think 3) when I purchased this soap to determine the best brand of black african soap and this brand won hands down!  I have sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of soaps, etc. on my face; however, this one did not cause breakouts and was not overly drying. I still use a moisturizer after washing my face with anything, but this soap had the least drying effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I break off a big piece and use daily. I keep the remainder in a zip lock bag to keep it soft.</li>
            <li> This soap came fast but it&#x27;s really sticky and does not have a nice smell</li>
            <li> i have both eczema and psoriasis... this soap keeps both from getting too bad.  My recommendation is to use it in the shower, not just beside the sink.  I use it in my hair too.  It makes my hair a little waxy feeling and tangly, but my skin is awesome..... I use a spray in conditioner to overcome the waxy hair.</li>
            <li> This black soap is amazing. I have suffered from acne for as long as I can remember, and I think I have the most sensitive skin in the world. It&#x27;s is so refreshing to not have a pimple in site &amp; to have truly clear skin, only a few weeks after beginning this regimen. For the first 2 weeks I applied the black soap in the morning and at night to clear my skin, and now apply the black soap just once at bedtime. Black soap can be drying, but the remedy for that is to apply it &amp; remove it quickly; I don&#x27;t let it dry on my skin. As well, after cleaning my skin with the black soap, I use an hypoallergenic moisturizer (Sebamed). I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Found freakin hair in this ! Disgusted ! I want my money back ! and besides it seemed old, broke me out like crazy !!!! Don&#x27;t do it, please don&#x27;t do it !</li>
            <li> This soap works wonders! I use it twice a day with unrefined Shea butter an it has almost completely cleared my skin! I have been using it for almost 2 months and has noticed a drastic change! There are still acne marks but much lighter an I don&#x27;t break out as often as I did before! The bar is so big it should last quite awhile but I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using black soap for a few months and it has changed my skin! My tone has evened out, the redness has decreased and my acne has definitely gone down. I would recommend this product to everyone! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  It is unscented but has a odor when the package is first opened. Sort of like very old vegetable oil. It is a little off putting at first and I considered not using it but gave it a try anyway.  The odor goes away as soon as you wet it. It is such a large block that I cut it into three sections when I first got it. The soap also seems to condense quite a bit after you wet it.  I know that this review has not sounded overly positive so far but it is the best soap I have ever used. Nothing cleans or lathers as well as this soap.  It is great for getting grease off of your hands and for washing poison ivy after being in the woods.  I would estimate that this package is equivalent to about 4 bars of regular soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased from the coastal scents website during their half off sale last month. About $6 for 16 ounce block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face for about a week. It dried out my dry areas even more. Then I learned that the pH is about 10, and in order to make the skin back to normal pH you have to use apple cedar vinegar as a toner. I a simplistic person, and don&#x27;t like too many beauty regimen steps if I can help it. I also never use toner, and this seems like an annoying part for having to use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I realized, what will happen if I use it all over my body and skin? Would I have to use apple cedar vinegar spray all over my skin to balance out the pH too? I tried it on skin and it didn&#x27;t dry me out horribly like it did my skin, but wasn&#x27;t anything impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard of others using it for hair. I wouldn&#x27;t dare let this stuff touch my AA coils, even if I had to do a vinegar rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, from my experience and my preference, this stuff isn&#x27;t as good as normal Dove or Dial body wash I&#x27;ve been using for years with no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted to try black soap from the craze, but I think it&#x27;s honestly over hyped.</li>
            <li> just got it like a week ago and i give it 4 stars because the first week i used it my face felt dry...but my blackheads and this scar i have on my face are slowly fading away... and my face kinda burned from the soap but i think its my fault i been leaving it on my face for too long, for like about 5-7 mins ...so i&#x27;m a stop doing that and just leave it on for 2-3 mins and hopefully it will tone down. iil come back in the next month to another review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand of black soap for at least 6 years now. I use it to bathe and wash my hair. My whole family now uses. Gets you very clean, leaves no residue, leaves me smelling fresh and clean without the heavily perfumed scents a lot of soaps have.  I recommend you do not rub it directly on your skin until you get used to it. There are small particles/fragments in the soap that can scrape you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I found this soap for alot cheaper from another seller, after I had order.  The soap does a great job but is very drying.  I don&#x27;t think I will be using it for my winter skin care regimen. I</li>
            <li> I have bought this twice now. Love it! It can be very drying. But a wonderful soap if you get blemishes. It melts easy in the shower so I keep mine in a travel soap container.  I exfoliate once a week with a little sugar added to the soap</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap.  My sister recommended it for my extremely dry skin and it works wonders.  Recommend cutting it into half inch or slightly smaller squares since it lathers quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the soap, it kinda has a drying effect after so many washes, but I just moisturize right after.  I&#x27;ve noticed I rarely get any big or red acne anymore.</li>
            <li> Smelled great and cleansed well. Great value for the price. I was able to get 4 4oz bars. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not sold on the miracle stories going on around the internet world but this soap has a nice lather and leaves your skin soft but that&#x27;s about it... No miracles thus far.</li>
            <li> The outer layer of packing was open, but the inside wrap was just fine, washed my face the next day, this foamed really well and it left my face feeling smooth and soft, not stripped at all. I apply my Rose water toner then Shea butter, and I was good to go.</li>
            <li> This soap exceeded my expectations. I used to use a different kind, but I have always wanted to try the RAW black soap. It is fragrance free and made with just a few ingredients that I can actually read and know that they are. It is much healthier and works way better than the manufactured bars of black soap. I just break a piece off and use it a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Exquisite foam, easy to wash.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick shipping! Leaves my face feeling soft and helped even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The soap is wonderful.  It makes my skin feel tight and clean.  There is not much as far as suds, thus easy to rinse off.  I will never use anything else.  Great product that I have shared with others, I have received positive feedback after sharing with coworkers.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!!! I have oily, acne prone skin and this is perfect for it. I even use it to shave my legs. I love that it&#x27;s all natural since I&#x27;ve been getting rid of un-natural and chemical-filled body products and beauty items. :) And this is HUGE, so I cut it in half.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap for years and was ready for a change.  I switched to Coastal Scents African Black Soap.  I really love this stuff.  I feel clean.  I shower 2-3 times per day and after using this soap there&#x27;s always dirt coming off of me that I didn&#x27;t realize with other soaps.  Basically, it works and works well.  Also, the ingredients are completely natural.  It&#x27;s really an African secret, using cocoa ash and palm kernel.  It smells earthy fresh, like nature and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use every day.  One 16oz pack lasts me about a month which is a shorter time period than a large bottle of Dr Bonners.  I use the Black Soap as a Bar all over on my face and hair and have dried dissolving it and using it like that but I prefer to use it as a bar soap as I can regulate it&#x27;s application better that way.  It lathers nicely and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for natural soap.  After you shower finish with some shea butter and you have yourself some new skin!</li>
            <li> its HUGE!  has an earthy smell to it but not over powering. face feels smooth after words. may dry out your face a little so use a moisturizer afterwards. you get your monies worth. I also use it as a bath soap and I feel super clean.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second brand i&#x27;ve gotten in this soap. I havent used this yet because i still have 3 more left from the old purchase i made with another company, but cant wait to use it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIOS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE.i BUY IT 5 POUNDS AT A TIME AND GIVE TO FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. hAVE CONVERTED MANY PEOPLE..</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best african soap I purchased and the only one I will. It&#x27;s not like those other &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; that are grounded and filled with fragrance and other not so natural stuff. This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> i have rosecea and always looking for a solution.  after much research on this soap i decided to give it a try.  on the 1st use my face became completely red.  so if you have sensitive skin, rosecea this may not be the soap for you.  however, my wife who has oily skin uses it with out any problems</li>
            <li> helps a ton with adult acne</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap! I use daily and at least 2 times a day. Great for blemishes and breakouts. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that this soap is NOT a miracle soap, BUT it has worked better for me than any other soap I have ever purchased. I have already ordered my second 16 ounces, and will probably use this soap the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing to remember (especially if you are using this soap on your face) is that the soap itself has a pH of about 10. A healthy pH for your face should be somewhere around 4 - 5. If you have skin that already has a very high or low pH, it is important that you have a toner that can bring your face&#x27;s pH back to a normal level after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;(I use apple cider vinegar with the mother in it as a toner. it has a pH of about 3, which balances me out after using the black soap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 2015 update: I use this soap religiously. It&#x27;s been over two years since my original review, and I still swear by it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used my Clarisonic because it was obnoxious to use with liquid cleansers. But this bar on a lovely dish is perfect for rubbing the bristles on and loading it up with cleanser.  The soap looks like a nasty old porkchop, but don&#x27;t be turned off.....it&#x27;s AMAZING.  I have lumps from overactive oil glands and this soap is most certainly improving the look of the lumps.  It leaves me clean, not overly dry.  LOVE.  I will order again, which will probably be at least a year because this bar is HUGE.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this soap because of all the great reviews. I started to get itchy bumps on my forehead and I was hoping this would help with them. I used this for two weeks and it dried my face out a ton. I still have an itchy forehead, my skin is worse than before. This is not for me what so ever. I thought I could mix this with some water and use it as hand soap. I started to break it apart and found lots of hair inside of the soap! GROSS! Plus there were a few questionable curly hairs in there also. I&#x27;m grossed out by this since I was using this on my face.</li>
            <li> I found the awesome comments are right on target. After the very first face wash, I found my face the smoothest it has ever felt after a simple wash. Yes, it was tight and squeaky clean but a nice nighttime moisturizer following the wash left me touching my skin all evening.&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers extremely well and rinses cleanly. Do not be discouraged by the brownish suds or water...that is the natural ingredients creating the color. No biggie. Smell - natural and light. Also, as stated, the brick is huge. I simply sliced off a small slice with a kitchen knife. This will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Miracles? Not sure...I&#x27;ll come back in a week or so. So far, I do love the results.</li>
            <li> This had a weird smell, was difficult to handle and didn&#x27;t seem to help my rosacea.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for children with eczema. You have to be sure it does not sit in any water or it melts</li>
            <li> Upon recommendation from my hair dresser I decided to try the African Black soap. He had been using it for about a month and I had noticed the difference in his complexion. Like his, my husband and I have both noticed how bright and soft our skin has been since using this product. I actually noticed a difference in my skin the first time I used it! It has saved me some money that I used to spend for makeup remover. ( You will, however, need to remove your eye makeup your usual way. You don&#x27;t want soap in your eyes.) LOVE IT! I also recommend that you get the unrefined shea butter to use as a moisturizer:)</li>
            <li> This soap did not work for me. After trying for several weeks, had to stop using it. It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this soap and used it for a few days - and it got rid of my razor burn bumps as well as bumps on my arm that I have been struggling with for a few years. Do not buy this if you are looking for a great scent - as it pretty much has a neutral or natural scent - and don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for a lot of suds and foam - but if you are looking for a very natural soap that has healing properties this is for you!</li>
            <li> Comes on time and works as expected</li>
            <li> Love this soap but you don&#x27;t get as much for your money now.  The soap bar is smaller&lt;br /&gt;than it was the last 2 times I purchased it.  Is this a bait and switch?  Seems to happen&lt;br /&gt;sometimes when I sign up for the auto ship.</li>
            <li> As expected, a wonderful soap. It has made my pores tighter and my skin feels brighter, less oily and much more even looking. This is not a miracle worker and I still get blemishes on my nose and I still suffer from POD but the non POD affected areas look perfect.</li>
            <li> We use this for all-things--bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it particularly useful as a direct facial cleanser 3 times a week. (Mildly Oily and Sensitive Skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it 1 Part black soap to 4 parts Dr. Bronner&#x27;s (Tea Tree) to 5 parts purified water in a dispenser for body wash. Extremely effective against seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it directly on my scalp twice a week to combat seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried numerous black soap manufacturers and this has stood out as highest in quality, not to mention its convenient bulk pricing. A single brick of this will last you moooooooooooooonths. (See how many o&#x27;s I used there? That&#x27;s meant to imply a significant amount of time passing. More than you would normally have inferred from my statement.)</li>
            <li> Found black hard sharp things in my soap as I was washing my face and it scratched me. Not normal and very disgusted. Going to doctor! I will stick to Butters N Bars!</li>
            <li> This soap came quickly and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now. Coastal Scents African Black Soap is legit. This is not a knockoff like many other so called authentic African black soaps. This along with Acne.org 2.5% benzoyl peroxide before bed is what works for me.</li>
            <li> Love this pack of soap! 👍</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin for years, I have used everything on the market, they usually work for a while and stop. I have been using black soap now since Feb 2012 and I absolutely love it, I dissolve some in a container and use as a body wash, I also use this on my 4 year old son. I have only had a few break outs, since I have been using this soap, but they clear up so quickly that I forget that they are there. I love this soap and will never buy anything else, I plan on buying in bulk, but until then I have it set up to come, even if i dont need it because i do not want to run out, I have given all my family members pieces of this soap and they love it. It lasts forever. I follow up with shea butter and always get wonderful compliments on how beautiful my skin and my son&#x27;s skin is.</li>
