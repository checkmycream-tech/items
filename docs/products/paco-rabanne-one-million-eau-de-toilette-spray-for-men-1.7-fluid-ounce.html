            <li>My opinion on this cologne, it wear off fast, and its a little bit over price.</li>

            <li> This is not authentic perfume I brought my dad one from macys and its potent an alot of men where it at my job you can smell this from a distance this one is verry faint</li>
            <li> Delivered sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews and some were positive and some were real negative.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand when you let it sit for half hr</li>
            <li> Its not original....</li>
            <li> But dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> I had some hesitations about blind buying this because I wanted to avoid the possibility of being sent a knockoff.</li>

            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent ,!!!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> When you first spray this, your nose gets ambushed by a ton of smelly ingredients at once. Which is okay but not my favourite part. On the other hand when you let it sit for half hr or so it ends up smelling soo!! Divine &amp; soo soft. You cant get enough of it. Ladies love it. Now compared to le male, le male is much smoother, much easier on the nose(when you first spray) &amp; much more softer smell. But dont get me wrong 1 million is a great buy ive gotten many compliments from friends, co workers, &amp; people i dont know. All great</li>
            <li> excellent quality, I got exactly what I bought, very happy. Recommended. 5 stars because it is what I wanted 100 % original</li>
            <li> son muy atentos y responsables gracias me in dhb dfh  dfgbf fhuj fhyf fbfhhf gffgf fh  fujf hf fyuf hh</li>

            <li> Its not original.... I lose my money</li>
            <li> No problems or komplaints..THANXX! It was exactly what we were looking for and the product kame rather QUICk...VERY impressed! Will def use this service again in the future!</li>
            <li> All was well and gave as a gift at Christmas.  Did shop around and found this to be the best buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend and love it so much every he uses this. love the smell.</li>
            <li> The product arrive in it&#x27;s original package at a great price. I love wearing this cologne and get so many compliments.</li>

            <li> I love this on my husband, not over powering or too manly. Every where we go people ask what he is wearing. Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> The notorious 1 million. I had some hesitations about blind buying this because I wanted to avoid the possibility of being sent a knockoff. My female friend at sephora absolutely loves this Cologne and also knows it is a lady killer. Enough said, I found the most reputable seller and reviews I could on this site and bought a 1.7 bottle. The scent is strong and projects well. A lot of people swear by this fragrance and others can&#x27;t wait to wash it off. I would recommend .checking it out a store first. It works on my skin and the ladies hover whenever I go out partying. It smells like &amp;#34;sophisticated bubblegum&amp;#34; but manly and captivating. Two sprays is all you need and you&#x27;re set for a night out</li>
            <li> One million never fails to satisfy me. Purely amazing. Every where i go, can&#x27;t get enough of the compliments about Paco Rabanne. I love it!</li>
            <li> If you are worried about women smelling all over you, this is not the fragrance for you. BUT if you&#x27;re the ladies man this is the one for you most definitely. That sexy sweet smell is sure to get a woman&#x27;s attention. PURE SEXY MAN in a bottle no joke</li>
            <li> Came across it in a magazine and loved it strong in a subtle way regret not buying bigger bottle def must have</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, bueno y de calidad, llego a tiempo, muy satisfecha y agradecida con la rapidez del envio.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. The lotion is original and lasts all day. The only flaw is that the lotion is a bit watered down the sides to activate the spray, but not if it is coming very busy.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it! Every time he puts it on, I am like &amp;#34;Ahhhhh, smells soooo good&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Good price.  I could not find it at any store except Macy&#x27;s and we don&#x27;t have one where I live.</li>
            <li> I love this smell , this product came on time and i plan to purchase another one when it is empty...</li>
