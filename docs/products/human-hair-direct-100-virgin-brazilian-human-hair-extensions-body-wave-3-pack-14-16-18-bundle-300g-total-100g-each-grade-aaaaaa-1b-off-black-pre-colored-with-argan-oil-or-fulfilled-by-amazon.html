            <li>Looks good so far.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Super friendly customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Lighting</li>
            <li>Their just excited because it shipped quick.</li>
            <li>This is worth the price I bleach and colored a bundle of this hair and it took quick and wonderfully, it frizzed up a little just like real hair does with bleach ,but</li>
            <li>It wuz Luv at First sight!</li>
            <li>so I had to review it for the ladies that are scared to buy because its so cheap, ITS REAL BRAZILIAN HAIR</li>
            <li>it came on time and defiantly worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would buy the hair again well worth the money....</li>
            <li>I have gotten many comments on how natural the hair blends with my hair...</li>
            <li>The hair was not as good as the quality I expected.</li>
            <li>I ordered two orders of this product before I&#x27;d read the reviews, therefore I must be TOTALLY honest when admitting that I was &#x27;Mixed up N-duh mind&#x27; about having made this purchase and doubling it at that!</li>
            <li>Loved the hair,  little to no shedding at all.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars elsewhere and get good hair that will last.</li>
            <li>The hair is really pretty.</li>
            <li>and it still remains soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>However, I still have more hair left!!</li>
            <li>so I knew that the hair was pretty much GARBAGE at that point.</li>
            <li>Immediately the beautiful body wave pattern that it came with went completely flat and dead.</li>
            <li>I washed and conditioned 1 bundle with a very high end shampoo, Organix Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It mattes up terribly, very nappy at the nape.</li>
            <li>This hair was alright the length is not the length it&#x27;s suppose to be the 14&amp;#34; is like a 8&amp;#34; very shot</li>
            <li>therefore I&#x27;m very knowledgeable on Proportion, the bundles were very sufficient.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive all of my items and I&#x27;m very upset about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY upset</li>
            <li>The texture, length, quantity and quality are all meeting My high Expectations!</li>
            <li>I always do straight.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll stick w straight.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really trashy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the thin side but the quality is great.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t need much combing so it hasn&#x27;t shed a lot yet for me.</li>
            <li>And their main website...</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I have to say is the fact that it ships out very fast.</li>
            <li>I explained to them the problem with just the one bundle and they pretty much shunned me away as though my experience couldn&#x27;t have possibly occurred with their hair.</li>
            <li>SUPER SOFT BODY WAVE BRAZILIAN 100% HUMAN HAIR</li>
            <li>Hair was not black hair was red when held up to light tried to bleach it and it turned red and orange also hair will not hold a curl</li>
            <li>Shipping was speedy and that&#x27;s the only positive thing I will say about the product.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 because shipping was quick ; but the hair was really really soft ; after a while it gets rough maybe a wash will do</li>
            <li>3 weeks later I&#x27;m ready to throw this hair in the trash.</li>
            <li>I bought it in early April.</li>
            <li>However I was on pins &amp; needles until I received the hair (early I might add), and</li>
            <li>But overall im glad I didnt waste my money.</li>
            <li>but,  I have purchased many different kinds of hair in the past so</li>
            <li>a whole bunch of noticible grey hairs !!!</li>
            <li>Thank you human hair direct.</li>
            <li>It does tangle a little but keep it brushed and when its first curled again if you decide to straighten it.</li>

            <li> Thank you human hair direct.</li>
            <li> It does tangle a little but keep it brushed and when its first curled again if you decide to straighten it.</li>
            <li> this review is based on a second batch of hair, I returned the first batch due to it having excessively thin ends (many shorter stands of hair mixed in with few long stands reaching the length</li>
            <li> it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it still took long to arrive</li>
            <li> this hair was very tangled , i had to take it out in less then a month, and it gets stiff too</li>
            <li> I just want other potential buyers to know what they&#x27;re getting themselves into before closing the deal.</li>
            <li> Washed hair let let air dry and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real and tangles up</li>
            <li> noting that the frizz ease didn&#x27;t tame ,It moves when u moves, its not shiny, and there a lot of hair in a bundle, and I have a big head...</li>
            <li> Two weeks later after bleaching it and adding color and having it installed, it is extremely tangled, stiff, and matted.</li>
            <li> Other than that they couldn&#x27;t do nothing else.</li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical about getting this hair because of the bad reviews I read but it turned out great.</li>
            <li> I have to get more hair very inconvenient</li>
            <li> It was dry and when adding a small amount of moisturizing product, the texture was not right...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they get tons of bad reviews because I wrote a bad review for them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it now for a few days and ABSOLUTELY NO SHEDDING!</li>
            <li> By the way, the company cares less about refunding your money once they&#x27;ve gotten it.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> If you have money to waste then go a head</li>
            <li> please dont waste your hard earned money on this trash</li>
            <li> I felt hopeless and ugly my whole trip.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> this hair is terrible fake fake fake vigin hair shedds alot gets matted up alot no body just very cheap hair that i will never shop with human hair direct again</li>
            <li> So the only reviews they have are from stupid girls that just bought the hair...</li>
            <li> Hair stinks and the bundles are so small.</li>
            <li> I was mad when I saw how small the bundles are</li>
            <li> Oh and after wearing it one week I washed it and it is now dull and lifeless!!</li>
            <li> This hair is not Brazilian, it is extremely thin and the ends were stringy!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will not be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> very thin at the bottom making hair look unattractble and fake.</li>
            <li> The hair is very thin at the ends</li>
            <li> sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> The obly thing I can say bad about it roght now is that the 20 inches does not look 20 Inches.</li>
            <li> I guess I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> It was that bad.</li>
            <li> I also wrote a bad review on their fb pg</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the purchase to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> This hair is terrible.</li>
            <li> My experience was terrible.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS BUSINESS!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible!!</li>
            <li> I HATE EM!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> So did I just F*** up buying this hair someone anyone please tell me !!!😞</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased so far with this hair. There was a lot on the bundle and it was packaged well with no odor. I would order this hair again and it looks amazing with the ombre effect!</li>
            <li> Listen am from Atlanta so am going to keep it real, I don&#x27;t have money to waste. This is worth the price I bleach and colored a bundle of this hair and it took quick and wonderfully, it frizzed up a little just like real hair does with bleach ,but noting that the frizz ease didn&#x27;t tame ,It moves when u moves, its not shiny, and there a lot of hair in a bundle, and I have a big head... this is a good buy and am very funny about how my hair looks, it has to look real even if people know its not ,I didn&#x27;t see any reviews for this hair so I had to review it for the ladies that are scared to buy because its so cheap, ITS REAL BRAZILIAN HAIR I TEST IT WELL....</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super friendly customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Lighting fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Weft not neatly sewn.&lt;br /&gt;Foreign fibers in hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I feel you get what you pay for. Like the Beauty Supply store hair I feel I&#x27;ll get one install out of the hair. I&#x27;m worried washing this hair may cause tangling and matting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI.. this review is based on a second batch of hair, I returned the first batch due to it having excessively thin ends (many shorter stands of hair mixed in with few long stands reaching the length advertised)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - My husband is complaining about the shedding, hair is everywhere. It mattes up terribly, very nappy at the nape. It dose not hold a curl and will not revert back to wavy once you apply heat.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Two weeks later after bleaching it and adding color and having it installed, it is extremely tangled, stiff, and matted. The hair is very thin at the ends and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the purchase to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> Love this hair, it last forever great quality. it came on time and defiantly worth the price.</li>
            <li> The hair just arrived.  It looks nice and I wasnt expecting it to blook thr way it did! Super excited!  The obly thing I can say bad about it roght now is that the 20 inches does not look 20 Inches.</li>
            <li> I would not buy after reading these reviews. Also, you can tell that some of the 5 stars are rated by the vender, with the wording of the statement.</li>
            <li> This hair was alright the length is not the length it&#x27;s suppose to be the 14&amp;#34; is like a 8&amp;#34; very shot I measure it now I haven&#x27;t install it as yet I have to get more hair very inconvenient so I don&#x27;t think I would order from them again</li>
            <li> The does not tangle or shed which is great gave it 4 stars because wave pattern don&#x27;t hold. I would buy the hair again well worth the money.... look good, feel good and everyone wants to know where I got it from...</li>
            <li> The hair is excellent I shampoo and condition it each week as well as Brazilian Keratin products on the hair.I have gotten many comments on how natural the hair blends with my hair...I am a former stylist therefore I&#x27;m very knowledgeable on Proportion, the bundles were very sufficient. ...I just placed another order and referred others!</li>
            <li> The hair is good. No tangle and it perfectly took the color I wanted when I dyed it. Just wish it came with more hair.</li>
            <li> This hair is terrible. The only positive thing I have to say is the fact that it ships out very fast. I ordered 7/5 and received 7/8. So that&#x27;s the only reason they got 1 star. I received the hair and out of the package it was beautiful but,  I have purchased many different kinds of hair in the past so, I know the #1 test in determining whether the hair is good or not is by washing it. I washed and conditioned 1 bundle with a very high end shampoo, Organix Argan Oil. Immediately the beautiful body wave pattern that it came with went completely flat and dead. I&#x27;ve had experience with this before so I knew that the hair was pretty much GARBAGE at that point. If you purchase body wave it should remain body wave even after washing. 3 weeks later I&#x27;m ready to throw this hair in the trash. I&#x27;m not upset about it because you get what you pay for! I just want other potential buyers to know what they&#x27;re getting themselves into before closing the deal. IT&#x27;S CHEAP FOR A REASON LADIES!! And with that being said. Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Spend a few more dollars elsewhere and get good hair that will last. By the way, the company cares less about refunding your money once they&#x27;ve gotten it. I explained to them the problem with just the one bundle and they pretty much shunned me away as though my experience couldn&#x27;t have possibly occurred with their hair. I knew I would never order again at that point.</li>
            <li> The hair was not as good as the quality I expected. It was dry and when adding a small amount of moisturizing product, the texture was not right...</li>
            <li> The hair is really pretty. I loved loved it. I&#x27;m in the process of installing now. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Hair was not black hair was red when held up to light tried to bleach it and it turned red and orange also hair will not hold a curl I guess I got a bad batch. Washed hair let let air dry and know I don&#x27;t have waves.</li>
            <li> The package says Indian. The color and texture changed after 1 wash. It couldn&#x27;t take color. This is NOT virgin hair.</li>
            <li> this hair was very tangled , i had to take it out in less then a month, and it gets stiff too</li>
            <li> this hair is terrible fake fake fake vigin hair shedds alot gets matted up alot no body just very cheap hair that i will never shop with human hair direct again</li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical about getting this hair because of the bad reviews I read but it turned out great. I&#x27;ve been had this hair in for about two months now. I bought it in early April. It does tangle a little but keep it brushed and when its first curled again if you decide to straighten it. The curls will fall I would use my flexie rods and my curling wand. But overall im glad I didnt waste my money.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because shipping was quick ; but the hair was really really soft ; after a while it gets rough maybe a wash will do</li>
            <li> not virgin hair. tangles. sheds like crazy. very thin at the bottom making hair look unattractble and fake. a whole bunch of noticible grey hairs !!! do not buy. please dont waste your hard earned money on this trash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts been 3wks since I had this hair installed and it still remains soft and tangle free. Will definately be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I co-washed it before install and it was beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;2 days after install it matted and tangled like a synthetic wig that had gotten wet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an inexpensive buy but good luck with trying to detangle it. It was install for a week when I had to take it out.&lt;br /&gt;So it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> My experience was terrible. I didn&#x27;t receive all of my items and I&#x27;m very upset about it. I only got 2 of the three bundles when I should have received 3. I&#x27;m VERY upset and I would like my money back.</li>
            <li> I ordered two orders of this product before I&#x27;d read the reviews, therefore I must be TOTALLY honest when admitting that I was &#x27;Mixed up N-duh mind&#x27; about having made this purchase and doubling it at that! I Only did so bcus the hair stores here in Kansas City, Missouri are charging over $200 for one bag, therefore I figured I would get 2 , 4-duh price of one. However I was on pins &amp; needles until I received the hair (early I might add), and It wuz Luv at First sight! The texture, length, quantity and quality are all meeting My high Expectations! I&#x27;ve worn it now for a few days and ABSOLUTELY NO SHEDDING! I Love this hair and I&#x27;m Extremely Satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> The hair is beautiful , soft and I can style it anyway I want. I haven&#x27;t dyed it yet .  I will keep yall posted.</li>
            <li> Perfect my gf loves it</li>
            <li> I just had to write a review in this. Shipping was speedy and that&#x27;s the only positive thing I will say about the product. This hair is not Brazilian, it is extremely thin and the ends were stringy! This hair does not hold a curl no matter what you do to it! I emailed the company and all they told me was to send it back if it wasn&#x27;t used yet. Other than that they couldn&#x27;t do nothing else. Needless to say I will not be buying from this company again. Oh and after wearing it one week I washed it and it is now dull and lifeless!!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS BUSINESS!!! I bought 26 and 28in brazilian bodywave. Tangled up and matted like a cheap wig. Terrible!! I only had it in a week and threw it away!! It was that bad. And their main website...I&#x27;m pretty sure they get tons of bad reviews because I wrote a bad review for them and they DELETED IT!! I also wrote a bad review on their fb pg and they ALSO DELETED IT! So the only reviews they have are from stupid girls that just bought the hair...haven&#x27;t put it in their head yet lol. Their just excited because it shipped quick. Waste of money! I HATE EM!! Good luck deleting this review!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled by how fast I got my hair! Looks good so far. Hope it fits well. Thank you human hair direct.</li>
            <li> I always do straight. It was okay. For the price. Think I&#x27;ll stick w straight. However, I still have more hair left!! Lol</li>
            <li> I would  not advise anyone to buy this hair it&#x27;s a total waste of money. It&#x27;s not real and tangles up and it&#x27;s really trashy.</li>
            <li> Hair stinks and the bundles are so small. I was mad when I saw how small the bundles are, I actually had to get another one. Appears to be good quality otherwise tho. Also I was told the hair was in the USA and it was actually in Hong Kong. I paid for priority shipping and it still took long to arrive</li>
            <li> I am not big on writing reviews but I do not want anyone to go through what I am going through. I bought body wave had it put in. Went to Italy. On my vacation the hair tangled.. I felt hopeless and ugly my whole trip. Please please don&#x27;t buy. If you have money to waste then go a head</li>
            <li> the hair is garbage and they will not work with you please save yourself . I read someone else review and said: well that was her experience . Well it was one in the same</li>
            <li> Ok hair. It did shed a lot but maybe because I didn&#x27;t deal it prior to installation. It tangled after about a week of wearing.</li>
            <li> Loved the hair,  little to no shedding at all. It&#x27;s a bit on the thin side but the quality is great.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair...it doesn&#x27;t need much combing so it hasn&#x27;t shed a lot yet for me. Been getting compliments for 2 days now :)</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!!! WOULD BUY IT AGAIN. NO WILL BUY IT AGAIN!!!!! LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS!! SUPER SOFT BODY WAVE BRAZILIAN 100% HUMAN HAIR</li>
