            <li>Better than any battery operated device &amp; cuts closer.</li>
            <li>I believe these to be the best facial hair scissors on the market.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>More rust.  </li>
            <li>After many wear and tear from nose trimmers, I decided to purchase these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman products and I bought these to replace my cheap pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Perfect little pair of scissors for touching up the beard and mustache as well as snipping those stray nose hairs.</li>
            <li>It cuts safely and cleanly.</li>
            <li>These are pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Work just fine.</li>
            <li>Quite curved at the end for safety purposes, but works fine.</li>
            <li>These little scissors are perfect for what I needed them for.  </li>
            <li>Fit and fishish are about what one expect at that price point.  </li>
            <li>Great scissors for gromming mustache and facial hair.</li>
            <li>Looks good, nice materials, durable, safety tip for less of a chance to stab my eye out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are especially nice for nasal work, with the small, yet blunt, tips.</li>
            <li>They are really good with trimmnig facial hair.</li>
            <li>They are made of good quality steel and very sharp, yet safe.  </li>
            <li>This thing rusts pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sharp and work great.</li>
            <li>Good, but need to be careful still.</li>
            <li>He likes them, and more importantly, uses them regularly.  </li>
            <li>First foray into using scissors for nose hair maintenance.</li>
            <li>Rusting issue aside, it cuts pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Upon initial inspection, it seemed like a great item and would work very well for getting hairs in the pesky facial (or bikini!)</li>
            <li>Build quality seems high, so they should last for many years.</li>
            <li>In short, I am suspicious these are genuine.</li>
            <li>but when you get them they&#x27;re actually very well made.</li>
            <li>Does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Sharp but safe.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp but safe.</li>
            <li>but these are also slightly curved, which I love.</li>
            <li>Seems to be high quality.  </li>
            <li>Just take care of them: Keep them clean and dry, and never use to cut paper or anything else besides hair.</li>
            <li>good for the price, but not great.  </li>
            <li>I reached out to them and they provided a refund immediately, but it was still pretty gross that they even considered repackaging a used item like this.</li>
            <li>These are clearly used scissors packaged in a new box.</li>
            <li>I have a beloved small pair of Tweezerman scissors and they are really sharp, shiny, precision scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look a little cheap in the photos</li>
            <li>Hard to explain why I love a pair of grooming scissors I suppose.</li>
            <li>I bought these directly from Amazon and was sent a used pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Great for maintaining facial hair and especially like the round tip versus sharp.</li>
            <li>It works fine on other stray facial hair although because it&#x27;s curved I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for major beard</li>
            <li>While these do the job, they pull the hair a little more than I expected.</li>
            <li>so I purchased this pair made out of stainless steel but still recomend keeping in a dry place to avoid rust.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well made, solid but not heavy.</li>
            <li>To top it off these are curved so that it makes cutting anything a real struggle.</li>
            <li>Not sharp (rectangular edged)but never has pulled out hair only cuts them.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I rinsed it off, patted it dry with a towel, and left it out in open air to air dry it as well.  </li>

            <li> I can see these lasting for a long time.</li>
            <li> The small size and safety tips making getting hard to reach hairs easy to get with precision.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The blades are solid and sharp, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with hair pulling.</li>
            <li> These are like some $1 scissors for little kids so they won&#x27;t hurt themselves, and these barely cut.</li>
            <li> Only downside is size of handle - not really made for average man size fingers.</li>
            <li> I actually gave him a little Mohawk and painted it pink.</li>
            <li> but I wiped the blade and upon careful examination it turned out to be oil.</li>
            <li> They did exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Other reviews stated these scissors have a rusting issue.  </li>
            <li> not as sharp as i thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> The curved blade makes it easier to adjust the angle for facial grooming (hard to explain, it just does when you&#x27;re trying to maneuver scissors in front of your face).</li>
            <li> This is a quality tool and makes all the various buzzers and electronic solutions I&#x27;ve used seem like shoddy overkill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The slightly curved blade and blunt tips makes for safer grooming.</li>
            <li> These are very hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> but since they are small it makes a difference that is noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are dull.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t met to cut hard or thicker than hair</li>
            <li> The blades are not sharpened at all and are thick and clumsy.</li>
            <li> These are a dull ugly grey.</li>
            <li> My fingers had to struggle to close them and open them, it was a chore to get the curved blades to line up with the hairs, and the unsharpened cutting edges were barely cutting.</li>
            <li> Like the &#x27;snub&#x27; points, avoids unnecessary accidents.</li>
            <li> Painful to use, finger holes are too small.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with their tweezers or scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get stabbed when you cut whatever hair you&#x27;re cutting.</li>

            <li> Works Good cheap price.  Not sharp (rectangular edged)but never has pulled out hair only cuts them. Oxidation may be the only concern after years or abuse</li>
            <li> I have a beloved small pair of Tweezerman scissors and they are really sharp, shiny, precision scissors.&lt;br /&gt;These are dull. The blades are not sharpened at all and are thick and clumsy. These are very hard to open and close. These are a dull ugly grey. To top it off these are curved so that it makes cutting anything a real struggle. I dislike these. These are like some $1 scissors for little kids so they won&#x27;t hurt themselves, and these barely cut. I had a heck of a time trying to cut my nose hair with these.

            <li> good but get rusty and should be cleaned after use..</li>
            <li> I actually use these to cut my childrens nails.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice. They look a little cheap in the photos but when you get them they&#x27;re actually very well made. I couldn&#x27;t  tell from the photos but these are also slightly curved, which I love. They&#x27;re very sharp and work great.</li>

            <li> No surprises.  Work just fine.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than the pair I purchased about 20 years ago, just a hair but since they are small it makes a difference that is noticeable.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  My husband is thrilled with their quality.  Only downside is size of handle - not really made for average man size fingers.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Great scissors! Love Tweezerman. Better than any battery operated device &amp; cuts closer.</li>
            <li> I believe these to be the best facial hair scissors on the market. However do not use them for anything else. I used mine to snip a plastic tag and the scissors were ruined. They aren&#x27;t met to cut hard or thicker than hair items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slightly curved blade and blunt tips makes for safer grooming.</li>
            <li> Good quality! Sharp but safe.</li>
            <li> Hard to explain why I love a pair of grooming scissors I suppose. They&#x27;re well made, solid but not heavy. The curved blade makes it easier to adjust the angle for facial grooming (hard to explain, it just does when you&#x27;re trying to maneuver scissors in front of your face). The blades are solid and sharp, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with hair pulling. Perfect little pair of scissors for touching up the beard and mustache as well as snipping those stray nose hairs.</li>
            <li> they were delivered quickly &amp; they are of excellent quality!&lt;br /&gt;I love them</li>
            <li> gets them nose hairs real good</li>
            <li> This works great for nose hair, much better than a rotary contraption. It feels well made and looks like it will last. It works fine on other stray facial hair although because it&#x27;s curved I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for major beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I was hesitant after some of the reviews which said they got used scissors but I bought it anyway. When I got it there was something that looked like hair on the blade but I wiped the blade and upon careful examination it turned out to be oil.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Good, but need to be careful still.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman sells (makes?) great product. Can&#x27;t go wrong with their tweezers or scissors.&lt;br /&gt;These are especially nice for nasal work, with the small, yet blunt, tips.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do.  Fit and fishish are about what one expect at that price point.  Time will tell how it holds up.</li>
            <li> Like the &#x27;snub&#x27; points, avoids unnecessary accidents.</li>
            <li> Quite curved at the end for safety purposes, but works fine.</li>
            <li> very nice, work well, well-made</li>
            <li> First foray into using scissors for nose hair maintenance. Never going back. This is a quality tool and makes all the various buzzers and electronic solutions I&#x27;ve used seem like shoddy overkill.</li>
            <li> Safe and effective. You won&#x27;t get stabbed when you cut whatever hair you&#x27;re cutting. Tweezerman makes excellent products, I&#x27;ve had many for years. Just take care of them: Keep them clean and dry, and never use to cut paper or anything else besides hair.</li>
            <li> Bought a lesser brand, and had to return. These are the best.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought theywould be but they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Other reviews stated these scissors have a rusting issue.  I disregarded and went ahead and bought them, hoping perhaps mine wouldn&#x27;t have the issue.  After the first use, I rinsed it off, patted it dry with a towel, and left it out in open air to air dry it as well.  The next time I went to use it, I discovered a spot of rust.  I used it again and repeated what I had done before.  More rust.  This thing rusts pretty easily.  I definitely would not recommend these to anyone.  Rusting issue aside, it cuts pretty well.  Hence, the 2-star rating... and that&#x27;s being nice.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products and I bought these to replace my cheap pair of scissors. While these do the job, they pull the hair a little more than I expected.</li>
            <li> High-quality facial hair scissors that does the job. It cuts safely and cleanly. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> good for the price, but not great.  not as sharp as i thought it would be.  angled tip is good for something, but not for others.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product several weeks ago. Upon initial inspection, it seemed like a great item and would work very well for getting hairs in the pesky facial (or bikini!) area. However, looking more closely, I realized the blades had hairs on them! I bought these directly from Amazon and was sent a used pair of scissors. I reached out to them and they provided a refund immediately, but it was still pretty gross that they even considered repackaging a used item like this.</li>
            <li> They seemed good until I looked at them closer.  There was several hair trimmings and residue on the blade.  These are clearly used scissors packaged in a new box.</li>
            <li> After many wear and tear from nose trimmers, I decided to purchase these.  They are really good with trimmnig facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend to maintain his beard.  He likes them, and more importantly, uses them regularly.  His grooming routine has greatly improved with the use of these scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and it&#x27;s legit</li>
            <li> Great scissors. They did exactly as expected. They&#x27;re sharp but safe.</li>
            <li> I have owned a pair of these for over 15 years and they are still working great. I bought these as a gift for my father.</li>
            <li> They get the job done. Build quality seems high, so they should last for many years.</li>
            <li> These are a nice quality pair of scissors. I have average/small hands, size 8, and the wholes still have some room in them. I can see these lasting for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great scissors for gromming mustache and facial hair. The small size and safety tips making getting hard to reach hairs easy to get with precision. I had the chrome plated version which rusted so I purchased this pair made out of stainless steel but still recomend keeping in a dry place to avoid rust.</li>
