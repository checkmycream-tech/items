            <li>You have to make sure they are all in their own heating spot upright or it won&#x27;t heat up good...</li>
            <li>I took this set of electric curlers with me to Europe and had great success with them.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers are great because there are so many</li>

            <li>They hold much better than the wire clips enclosed.</li>

            <li>Pins also fit nicely &amp; keep the rollers in place - even on top of the head.</li>
            <li>My daughters love them because they won&#x27;t get burnt when I use them in their hair unlike a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Great job and very packable.</li>
            <li>Make sure each roller is secure in its own heater &amp;#34;socket&amp;#34; unit otherwise it won&#x27;t heat.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>did not use them more than twice.</li>
            <li>They were okay and convenient for packing but they frizzed my hair</li>
            <li>I have med to long hair and found I needed more curlers but the product does a wonderful job and both sets fit into my luggage like a charm</li>
            <li>This set is great because it comes with a soft case so there is nothing to break.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands, but hands down, Conair is the best.   </li>
            <li>These rollers are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fun travel size, best for short to medium hair</li>
            <li>it is so easy</li>
            <li>4)The rollers are all plastic, and can slide easily out of fine hair  5)</li>
            <li>I have the clips from my previous Conair Ion Shine hairsetter and these work perfectly well.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>curlers are easy to use and give a great curl in a very short time.</li>
            <li>These are the best little set of rollers I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>yet I can fit them in my suitcase when traveling.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need any more curlers, so this set was the right size for me.</li>
            <li>- just make sure if you do travel; or move the unit around to make sure as previously noted that each roller is secure in its own place before plugging in.</li>
            <li>They all fit in my hair with a little practice and the curls came out beautiful</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, USE IT EVERY DAY, VERY COMPACT</li>
            <li>Bought for my grandchildren, they were happy with the color pink!  </li>
            <li>The rollers are not very large, but are perfect for my fine , blonde, shoulder lenght hair.</li>
            <li>so I could quickly tell the difference in size.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>and they heat up quickly...</li>
            <li>The rollers aren&#x27;t very hot after 20 or 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The hot rollers themselves are not round but oval almost which gives you a nice curl.</li>
            <li>rollers are hot!</li>
            <li>Quick heating and the right size</li>
            <li>Very compact -- can fit into carry-on luggage  2)</li>
            <li>Overall this product is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, heats fast, and has 12 rollers.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the largest rollers to be much larger, but that&#x27;s my fault, not theirs.  </li>
            <li>I checked each roller to make sure they were secure and left them plugged in for 20+ minutes - they never got hot;  just lukewarm.  </li>
            <li>Not the right size rollers for me</li>
            <li>I also love the light pink case, it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li>My hair was to the middle of my back and got great flowing curls.  </li>
            <li>2)Inconsistent heat amongst the rollers, and does not maintain heat consistently  </li>
            <li>I would have  preferred larger sized rollers, but that is more a preference than a critique.       </li>
            <li>I decided to try hot rollers to save the time of doing one section of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for .  </li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly and are extremely lightweight and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a person with very short hair who travels because this set will hardly take up any space in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it would be nice to have an on/off switch and an indicator light to tell when rollers are ready, but the rollers work so well that those features are a very small inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for new ones right now.</li>
            <li>Even though the curlers are smaller than what i use at home it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I found them hot enough to use after about twenty minutes (which in my opinion was quickly for hot rollers).</li>
            <li>is not my first time getting Conair rollers, I chose these as I believe in contributing to Breast Cancer.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed for buying them, a quick set with excellent results...</li>
            <li>All around handy little electric roller set.</li>
            <li>The little pack they come in is indeed handy for travel</li>
            <li>Short heat up time and comfortable for day time wear.  </li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m not stepping straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>but I let them heat for 10-15 minutes depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and easily do my whole head with this set.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and cause no tangling problems.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>when they do they don&#x27;t get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;they tangle in my hair</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These are nice to put in your hair to hold curl for a few hours, it does its job.  </li>
            <li>I love the PINK!</li>
            <li>To be sure that the rollers heat up uniformly, check to see that each one is pushed all the way down into the heating unit before you plug in the set.</li>
            <li>These rollers are convenient to travel with but do not heat well and when heated do not maintain a steady temperature until used.</li>
            <li>They heat up really quickly, and there are just enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use to lug my larger roller set with me but the airline baggage crew manhandled my bag one too many times and cracked the lid off my much larger and older set.</li>
            <li>strips\\&quot; - actually hold much more hair than regular electric rollers.</li>
            <li>However , they did heat up pretty fast and the case is very pretty and the whole set is very compact and small.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not thick either ....</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a new heat roller set I can take with me during my travels.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get HOT enough to set curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>Just double check first</li>
            <li>I expected a full set.</li>
            <li>This heat roller set has just enough rollers for long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The 8 medium and  4 small rollers give body, curl, and wave to fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Work great, but the pins are hard to distinguish between the large and small size.  </li>
            <li>Very uneven heating - one roller gets hot but the one next to it is only warm.</li>
            <li>The rollers don&#x27;t fit tight in the case and some of the clips won&#x27;t go through the roller.</li>
            <li>Not heavy  2)</li>
            <li>I left the hot rollers in my hair for ten minutes-</li>
            <li>I just love them , so small for travelling but does the job of the bigger sets.</li>
            <li>These curlers did not get hot enough, and the shape of the actual curlers was oval...not round.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a lifelong hot roller user.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and recently started using a curling iron to put it back in shape</li>
            <li>but if you take your time, just like any other hot rollers they won&#x27;t tangle when you take them out</li>
            <li>Most travel setters have only 8-10 rollers, which isn&#x27;t enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Mine is straight and fine and a little past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>The small size is also nice for home use - the entire unit takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>The rollers are on the small side but were just the right size and number for my hair.  </li>

            <li> Mine is straight and fine and a little past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> The small size is also nice for home use - the entire unit takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> The rollers are on the small side but were just the right size and number for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The pins are hard to use, leave lots of &#x27;dents&#x27; in my hair, and all look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> These hot curlers are extremely small!</li>

            <li> If you are unfortunate to have this same problem, I would recommend buying the clips that grip the full length of the rollers.</li>
            <li> The larger curlers leave loose bouncy curls, the smaller ones leave tighter curls.the variety of curls across my head complimented each other.</li>
            <li> I have very long that go to my hips</li>
            <li> The other version of these rollers (the black case) has different colors for the small and large rollers and pins, which make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> These Conair power pink instant heat ionic hair rollers/curlers do not get hot enough thus rendering them useless to me.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t loose beach waves</li>
            <li> The soft vinyl case is easier to use and store than the hard plastic cases.  </li>
            <li> This product was well priced and does the job as I expected.</li>
            <li> I like the pink color too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for travel figuring there wouldn&#x27;t be enough rollers for my thick hair to use regularly, but the rollers - designed with \\&quot;starter grip</li>
            <li> After a few hours, your hair will go flat.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have read someones review explaining how small these curlers actually are.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy that it doesn&#x27;t work for me, I love the look of it and package it comes in.     </li>
            <li> My only complaint about this is the pins.</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is no on/off switch.</li>
            <li> It did take me a few tries to get used to the holding pins</li>
            <li> Less room than my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I have lusciously thick long hair and these pins</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I bought one a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> My money was wasted.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not fine</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t very tight curls.</li>
            <li> Medium clips don&#x27;t stay on small rollers without connecting them to another roller.</li>
            <li> If a curler is tilted a bit and off center, it&#x27;s a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these curlers are for someone with very thin and very short hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the white clips to help set it, but neither the pins that came with it and the white clips were not successful for me and the curls looked terrible and I prefer to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The set is very small.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers since they were invented and these are the worst.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit disappointed when these travel rollers did not live up to my expectations.     </li>
            <li> I was shocked when I got the package and how little it was, I got scared</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me :(    </li>
            <li> Hoping it&#x27;ll make a difference but still disappointed!</li>

            <li> Just what I expected!!! Short heat up time and comfortable for day time wear.  Just becareful cause rollers are hot! Makes wonderful quick curls for any length of hair. My hair was to the middle of my back and got great flowing curls.  Now my hair is shoulder length and still great curls. (Donated my hair to locks of love).  Recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These rollers are convenient to travel with but do not heat well and when heated do not maintain a steady temperature until used.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong hot roller user. I have tried many brands, but hands down, Conair is the best.   So I was a bit disappointed when these travel rollers did not live up to my expectations.     PROS:    1) Very compact -- can fit into carry-on luggage  2) Not heavy  2) Inexpensive   3) Twelve rollers in two sizes  4) Operates on dual voltage    CONS:  1)Takes about 7 minutes to heat up   2)Inconsistent heat amongst the rollers, and does not maintain heat consistently  3) Reheating takes about three minutes  4)The rollers are all plastic, and can slide easily out of fine hair  5) I would have  preferred larger sized rollers, but that is more a preference than a critique.       All in all, not my favorite, but darn good for the price and for travel.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and recently started using a curling iron to put it back in shape if I&#x27;m not stepping straight out of the shower.  I decided to try hot rollers to save the time of doing one section of hair at a time.  The result is a fairly glamourous \\&quot;straightened\\&quot; look that&#x27;s gotten lots of compliments.  This product was well priced and does the job as I expected.</li>
            <li> These rollers are terrible! I have been using hot rollers since they were invented and these are the worst. Very uneven heating - one roller gets hot but the one next to it is only warm. My hair gets tangled with these rollers and I have to pull them out, so there goes the curl. The pins are hard to use, leave lots of &#x27;dents&#x27; in my hair, and all look exactly the same. I had to mark them so I could quickly tell the difference in size. I&#x27;m looking for new ones right now.</li>
            <li> This heat roller set has just enough rollers for long fine hair.  The 8 medium and  4 small rollers give body, curl, and wave to fine straight hair.  The soft vinyl case is easier to use and store than the hard plastic cases.  Only thing that could have been better would be receiving 4 small clips and 8 medium clips instead of 3 small clips and 9 medium clips.  Medium clips don&#x27;t stay on small rollers without connecting them to another roller.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers! They heat up really quickly, and there are just enough for my hair. I had bought another set the week earlier, but the clips did not hold. So...they went in the trashcan, and I bought this set. I didn&#x27;t need any more curlers, so this set was the right size for me. I love the PINK!</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for travel.  I would have liked the largest rollers to be much larger, but that&#x27;s my fault, not theirs.  I recommend it, esp for travel.   Works great, heats up fast.  Curls hold.</li>
            <li> For the price these are good. They are perfect to travel with at the size of 5\\&quot;X6\\&quot;. Less room than my hairdryer. They do take a while to heat up (about 20 min.). I would plug it in when your drying your hair. The rollers are not very large, but are perfect for my fine , blonde, shoulder lenght hair. I would also invest in the conair clips from this web. They hold much better than the wire clips enclosed. Overall I am satisfied with them. I like the pink color too.</li>
            <li> I took this set of electric curlers with me to Europe and had great success with them.  They heat up very quickly and are extremely lightweight and easy to pack.  The rollers are on the small side but were just the right size and number for my hair.  To be sure that the rollers heat up uniformly, check to see that each one is pushed all the way down into the heating unit before you plug in the set.</li>
            <li> This product worked perfect for me. I have very long that go to my hips and it&#x27;s not fine but it&#x27;s not thick either .... They all fit in my hair with a little practice and the curls came out beautiful they weren&#x27;t loose beach waves but they weren&#x27;t very tight curls. I was shocked when I got the package and how little it was, I got scared but once I tried it I was instantly in love. You have to make sure they are all in their own heating spot upright or it won&#x27;t heat up good... But the heat up time is amazing. It says 90 second heat up or something like that but I let them heat for 10-15 minutes depending on how much time I have. The hot rollers themselves are not round but oval almost which gives you a nice curl. People are saying they tangle your hair but if you take your time, just like any other hot rollers they won&#x27;t tangle when you take them out and they do leave my hair shinning. Overall this product is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home use and for travel</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a new heat roller set I can take with me during my travels. I use to lug my larger roller set with me but the airline baggage crew manhandled my bag one too many times and cracked the lid off my much larger and older set. This set is great because it comes with a soft case so there is nothing to break. It is also compact enough that I can pack a smaller suitcase and still have room for all my shoes. With the smaller suitcase, I can now avoid checking in my luggage and leaving my personal belongings to the will of the manhandling airline baggage crew. My only complaint about this is the pins. I have lusciously thick long hair and these pins don&#x27;t quite hold my hair in place. If you are unfortunate to have this same problem, I would recommend buying the clips that grip the full length of the rollers. I have the clips from my previous Conair Ion Shine hairsetter and these work perfectly well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for travel figuring there wouldn&#x27;t be enough rollers for my thick hair to use regularly, but the rollers - designed with \\&quot;starter grip strips\\&quot; - actually hold much more hair than regular electric rollers. Pins also fit nicely &amp; keep the rollers in place - even on top of the head. Like others have said, it would be nice to have an on/off switch and an indicator light to tell when rollers are ready, but the rollers work so well that those features are a very small inconvenience. The small size is also nice for home use - the entire unit takes up very little space. All around handy little electric roller set.</li>
            <li> This is my second set. I bought one a few weeks ago. I have med to long hair and found I needed more curlers but the product does a wonderful job and both sets fit into my luggage like a charm</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to set my hair and set curls. Very unhappy that it doesn&#x27;t work for me, I love the look of it and package it comes in.     I bought the white clips to help set it, but neither the pins that came with it and the white clips were not successful for me and the curls looked terrible and I prefer to use a flat iron. They kept sliding out of my hair and were pulling on my hair.    Waste of money for me :(    Didn&#x27;t get HOT enough to set curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers aren&#x27;t very hot after 20 or 30 minutes. The rollers don&#x27;t fit tight in the case and some of the clips won&#x27;t go through the roller.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size for travel.  I wish there was a choice of the size of the rollers.  Overall I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> These Conair power pink instant heat ionic hair rollers/curlers do not get hot enough thus rendering them useless to me.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UWAJI6 Conair HS28RPK Instant Heat Rollers, Breast Cancer Awareness, Power of Pink]]  This is a great, compact set of rollers. I have shoulder length hair and easily do my whole head with this set. They heat up fast and cause no tangling problems. My ONLY complaint is no on/off switch. I don&#x27;t like plug/unplug. Why do we have switches on dryers and irons but not the rollers?</li>
            <li> Not the right size rollers for me, I&#x27;m returning it. An excellent looking product for someone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. My hair is about chin length so if yours is longer I suggest you. Go with the bigger&lt;br /&gt;set.  Note: you heat these with the cover zipped close (as per instructions).</li>
            <li> I expected a full set.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, USE IT EVERY DAY, VERY COMPACT</li>
            <li> These rollers are easy to use. My daughters love them because they won&#x27;t get burnt when I use them in their hair unlike a curling iron. I just ordered another set because 12 just isn&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> Item was not as described. In the process of returning it I found out that there was to be no refund. My money was wasted.</li>
            <li> I did not like Hair got stuck to rollers !!!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for .  Great job and very packable.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly. I found them hot enough to use after about twenty minutes (which in my opinion was quickly for hot rollers). Tip: Make sure each roller is secure in its own heater &amp;#34;socket&amp;#34; unit otherwise it won&#x27;t heat. If a curler is tilted a bit and off center, it&#x27;s a bit frustrating. Just double check first and you&#x27;ll be fine. THAT said, everyone&#x27;s hair is different. Mine is straight and fine and a little past my shoulders. I left the hot rollers in my hair for ten minutes- the curls lasted all day at work (with just a touch of hair spray to hold.)  With twelve curlers you may end up using all of them with one setting. The larger curlers leave loose bouncy curls, the smaller ones leave tighter curls.the variety of curls across my head complimented each other. The little pack they come in is indeed handy for travel - just make sure if you do travel; or move the unit around to make sure as previously noted that each roller is secure in its own place before plugging in.</li>
            <li> This roller set is the perfect size for travel. It did take me a few tries to get used to the holding pins but it works great.</li>
            <li> Review of electric curlers bought at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curlers are easy to use and give a great curl in a very short time.</li>
            <li> Fun travel size, best for short to medium hair</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are great because there are so many yet I can fit them in my suitcase when traveling. I have lots of hair so these are perfect! I also love the light pink case, it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li> Bought for my grandchildren, they were happy with the color pink!  They are learning to use the rollers and clips</li>
            <li> Love this wonderful Conair rollers...it is so easy and they heat up quickly...&lt;br /&gt;This is not my first time getting Conair rollers, I chose these as I believe in contributing to Breast Cancer.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed for buying them, a quick set with excellent results...</li>
            <li> Work great, but the pins are hard to distinguish between the large and small size.  The other version of these rollers (the black case) has different colors for the small and large rollers and pins, which make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> These are nice to put in your hair to hold curl for a few hours, it does its job.  After a few hours, your hair will go flat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat well and it doesn&#x27;t create curls !</li>
            <li> this is my second set. I just love them , so small for travelling but does the job of the bigger sets. thanks</li>
            <li> sometimes don&#x27;t heat up at all. when they do they don&#x27;t get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;they tangle in my hair</li>
            <li> Have been looking for another set like this one for over 2 years!!! Thanks. Quick heating and the right size cirlers for medium length hair</li>
            <li> I love the color. It&#x27;s light weight, heats fast, and has 12 rollers. Most travel setters have only 8-10 rollers, which isn&#x27;t enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> The clips to hold the curler on doesn&#x27;t hold so now I must buy different clips! Hoping it&#x27;ll make a difference but still disappointed!</li>
            <li> love these so great for travel and I take them everywhere</li>
            <li> These curlers did not get hot enough, and the shape of the actual curlers was oval...not round.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use them more than twice. I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are the best little set of rollers I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Awful. I checked each roller to make sure they were secure and left them plugged in for 20+ minutes - they never got hot;  just lukewarm.  I will be returning; something I never do</li>
            <li> These hot curlers are extremely small! I was very disappointed when I opened up the box. In my opinion, these curlers are for someone with very thin and very short hair. I have shoulder length and these don&#x27;t work at all for me. I wasted my money. However , they did heat up pretty fast and the case is very pretty and the whole set is very compact and small. Perfect for a person with very short hair who travels because this set will hardly take up any space in your suitcase. The set is very small. Wish I would have read someones review explaining how small these curlers actually are.</li>
            <li> They were okay and convenient for packing but they frizzed my hair</li>
            <li> Is great excellent item</li>
            <li> Even though the curlers are smaller than what i use at home it worked fine. The size is great for traveling!</li>
