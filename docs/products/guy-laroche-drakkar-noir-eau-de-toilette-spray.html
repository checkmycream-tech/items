            <li>Nice buy and great cologne scent for a man.</li>
            <li>, it was a good gift.  </li>
            <li>Have always loved my husband wearing this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Drakkar for years and good to have source with reduced pricing.</li>
            <li>more better real good.</li>
            <li>nice smelling get it cause it smells good</li>
            <li>Love Drakkar!</li>
            <li>when tried it,really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite scent, but the man likes it, so it was a good gift.  </li>
            <li>I remember loving it in the 80&#x27;s, and now my 11 yo son loves it-</li>
            <li>Great value and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I like it, but it seems more &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; to me...</li>
            <li>Love this for travel.</li>
            <li>Was a gift, and he is very finicky about what smells nice.</li>
            <li>same great manly scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky but Drakkar Noir has been my favorite men&#x27;s perfume for more than twenty years.</li>
            <li>I was trying to stay away from the popular smell of D&amp;G Light Blue because I know many guys that use it</li>
            <li>I rarely use cologne, but I really enjoy a bit of Drakkar every now and then.</li>
            <li>I guess true love does last forever :)</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat stinging first scent, but quickly fades into a rich mix of lavender and masculinity.</li>
            <li>and love it even more when it is almost half the cost of retail!</li>
            <li>but it seems I have to go back to it because it really does have a great scent, especially when it starts to faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will have to go into a reputable store and check one of theirs to see if they are made the same.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no secret here.</li>
            <li>compared to Light Blue are like total opposites.</li>
            <li>As with all cologne, you should definitely find it in a store (Macy&#x27;s or Dilliard&#x27;s) and try it before you buy it, but you really need to try this.</li>
            <li>Will buy again, may go for a bigger size next time since she really likes this so much.</li>
            <li>just go to walmart and buy a gallon of old spice for 5 bux, b/c that is essentially what this stuff smells like..</li>

            <li> /&gt;It has that type of aftershave smell in it.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it has the \\&quot;old\\&quot; smell to it; Sorry I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not particularly good or anything, not sure why it has such high reviews, shipping was a little slow as well.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t broken down yet.</li>
            <li> I imagine the guy that wears this gets a lot of tail.. if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Yeah this stuff stinks don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> The cologne isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My son-in-law loved the fragrance.  Transaction was perfect.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift for a family member. heard about it that its a vintage perfume and one of the must have. when tried it,really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li> just go to walmart and buy a gallon of old spice for 5 bux, b/c that is essentially what this stuff smells like..it&#x27;s not particularly good or anything, not sure why it has such high reviews, shipping was a little slow as well.</li>
            <li> He loves it! Was a gift, and he is very finicky about what smells nice. Only now it will be costly keeping him in this...great cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky but Drakkar Noir has been my favorite men&#x27;s perfume for more than twenty years. I guess true love does last forever :)</li>
            <li> Smells like the 80&#x27;s. In a good way, I think. Haven&#x27;t had the courage to wear it in public yet.</li>
            <li> This cologne is the Sex Panther of Anchorman. It is absolutely incredible. It has a somewhat stinging first scent, but quickly fades into a rich mix of lavender and masculinity. As with all cologne, you should definitely find it in a store (Macy&#x27;s or Dilliard&#x27;s) and try it before you buy it, but you really need to try this.</li>
            <li> I rarely use cologne, but I really enjoy a bit of Drakkar every now and then. I imagine the guy that wears this gets a lot of tail.. if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The cologne isn&#x27;t bad at all. It smells good but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for anyone 25 and younger.&lt;br /&gt;It has that type of aftershave smell in it.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it has the \\&quot;old\\&quot; smell to it; Sorry I can&#x27;t really explain it but I guess it&#x27;s just my preference. I was trying to stay away from the popular smell of D&amp;G Light Blue because I know many guys that use it but it seems I have to go back to it because it really does have a great scent, especially when it starts to faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This compared to Light Blue are like total opposites.</li>
            <li> ilove drakkar nor for years its the best</li>
            <li> Love Drakkar! and love it even more when it is almost half the cost of retail! same great manly scent and i cannot get enough of it!  WOOF</li>
            <li> Basic staple for anybody with middle eastern or Mediterranean genetics.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized for a overnight travel bag.</li>
            <li> Yeah this stuff stinks don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell, and neither can everyone around me!</li>
            <li> chicks dig it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell real good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell more better real good. nice smelling get it cause it smells good</li>
            <li> Great travel size. Works perfectly and does not leak.</li>
            <li> Nice buy and great cologne scent for a man.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered, it hasn&#x27;t changed, my wife still loves me to wear it.</li>
            <li> It was way after Christmas before I got it!  Other than that, it was a good gift.  Wish I had gotten the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Great value and fast delivery</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no secret here. Drakkar is great stuff at any price.</li>
            <li> Seems to be genuine, although it is very difficult to tell where the nozzle is. That is the only thing that makes me question it.  I will have to go into a reputable store and check one of theirs to see if they are made the same. Had it for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t broken down yet.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it seems more &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; to me...I was looking for something sweeter and fresher....but it will get used every now and then.</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite scent, but the man likes it, so it was a good gift.  A very good buy.</li>
            <li> My Fianc&amp;eacute;e loves the scent. Item arrived quickly from Amazon. Will buy again, may go for a bigger size next time since she really likes this so much.</li>
            <li> Have always loved my husband wearing this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Drakkar for years and good to have source with reduced pricing.</li>
            <li> Love this for travel. Would prefer no spray.</li>
            <li> Drakkar will never get &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;. I remember loving it in the 80&#x27;s, and now my 11 yo son loves it- and is on his second bottle!</li>
