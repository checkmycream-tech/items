            <li>I think it nicely offsets any concerns with size about the brush anyone may have!</li>
            <li>He loves it, very rich emollient shave and wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>the, while pleasant to me, is a hazard to those with breathing problems.</li>
            <li>The cream itself (which I have since ordered for myself) is nicely scented, not quite as pleasant as the AOS set, but still very nice.</li>
            <li>so cleaned it up as good as I could.</li>
            <li>He loves the way it lathers and how good it feels on his skin.</li>
            <li>Smells good, works well ...</li>

            <li>Love it, great lather and brush.</li>
            <li>The box looks nice, good for a gift.</li>
            <li>I love the brush and shave cream !</li>
            <li>In fact, it works nicely for things like applying the shaving cream under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;The Shaving cream is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and not too bristly.  </li>
            <li>Nice box/gift packaging.</li>
            <li>After a fair bit of frustration with my $14.95 brush/cup/soap combo I started to read and learn more.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to run a Pepsi Challenge of my own...</li>
            <li>The packaging is shockingly nice.</li>
            <li>Nice scent of the Sandalwood shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my own brush before, so</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>I love it get a nice close shave with the badger brush,</li>
            <li>the shave cream is amazing, just a tiny amount gives great volume and the brush on the face is great, also.</li>
            <li>The shave cream has a very nice scent and even leaves the bathroom smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>But, the density of fibers in the knot is greater than the Best and nearly as dense as the Silvertip.</li>
            <li>The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to work long to get a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>love the smell absolutely what I was lookin for in every way..not too strong no fruity smell what so ever...works to an amazing lather for a truely great shaving experience..</li>
            <li>Very happy and will definitely buy more from the range.</li>
            <li>My wife gave this to me as a birthday gift, and let me tell you, it is a perfect compliment to my Double Edge Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>All I ever got from them was an OK shave.</li>
            <li>For this price... I will probably order this again when it is time for more cream as the price for a tub alone is around $15</li>
            <li>so it makes more sense to grab the brush as,</li>
            <li>:-)ellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>And, if it is a Rooney... Fuggeddaboudit!  :-)</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic, and the brush is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great set of your looking to give this as a gift or just want a box set for yourself!</li>
            <li>however I have found the coconut scented version more to my liking.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You wont find a better quality product for cheaper, although I&#x27;m sure you could pay more for inferior products if you so wished.</li>
            <li>Badger hair brushes make the hairs stand up so a close and comfortable shave can be achieved!</li>
            <li>I love the sandelwood aroma.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Really good lather and just the right amount of scent.  </li>
            <li>Ladies dig it too, every party I go to their hands are all over my face, even though I am a pretty good looking guy, this shaving cream has magic powers.</li>
            <li>The sandlewood scent is awesome, I love how lingers long after he shaves.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and I love it!</li>
            <li>Just getting in to safety razor shaving and wanted the full experience of a brush and some nice cream...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice, quality brush and a great starter kit when you&#x27;re not sure quite what to buy and also the separate components could cost you much more.</li>
            <li>The Taylor shaving cream goes on smooth, lathers up very nicely, and really does make for a great shave, besides the fact that the sandalwood scent is a masculine scent that lasts all day, and yet is not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all of their creams are fantastic, but these are the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>The badger brush is great and soft.</li>
            <li>At first the scent was very strong to me, and I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it.  </li>
            <li>for this quality of brush, you&#x27;d easily pay $25</li>
            <li>for this quality of brush, you&#x27;d easily pay $25</li>
            <li>lathers extremely easily.</li>
            <li>The shave cream does  have a strong scent when using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice set for the price.  </li>
            <li>, I love shaving with this tried and true method.</li>
            <li>The beard is fully hydrated and the hairs come off easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and leaves the skin feeling comfortable throughout the shave and after.</li>
            <li>It has since grown on me, and I quite enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment definitively on it, but it seems great to me, I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and have only noticed one hair in my lather</li>
            <li>For almost 40 years I have used the standard disposable blades and Foamy, Barbasol type shaving cream and been happy.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood scent is a good introduction to Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams.</li>
            <li>Finally we go to the brush which is very nice</li>
            <li>most of that was in the first week.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to lather and super smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a good shaving experience, and are willing to drop the bucks to do so, this is certainly a product worthy of your consideration.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good quality brush and shave cream set at an incredible price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know which one to buy , but made the right choice !</li>
            <li>I love their products so much that I bought a bar of soap and aftershave too.</li>
            <li>The brush is smaller but good quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful gift for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;His old shaving brush was worn out, so I chose this set.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream has a very strong fragrance, so he uses a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, but I found that my shave with a soap and brush is much closer that I experienced with the same razor and a can of foam.  </li>
            <li>It quickly dissipated after 3 or 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li>The bruxh is very good after the first couple of uses when it lost quite a few pieces of hair.  </li>
            <li>The results are the same each way: a winning shave!</li>
            <li>The brush produces great lather and easily holds enough to do multiple passes on a face.</li>
            <li>Seems ok so far.</li>
            <li>The quality is luxurious for lack of a more masculine name.</li>
            <li>For the money this is a great set plus Taylor of Old Bond Street offers many different creams and accessories to keep you groomed!</li>
            <li>This is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice scent but not the heavy, smokey, incense sandalwood.</li>
            <li>and man were they right...</li>
            <li>Secondly, the brush is smaller being slightly less tall and a fair bit more narrow of a &#x27;fan&#x27; than the Parker Silvertip and the Jagger Best</li>
            <li>/&gt;Christmas day came, and I had my first shave with a brush and soap.  </li>
            <li>While I really would only deduct 1/2 a star for this, it&#x27;s really not bad just not as soft as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve bought tons of razorock shave soaps after i first got this set.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First the brush:  </li>
            <li>the shaving cream is ready for use!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a smooth, comfortable shave every time as long as you don&#x27;t add too much water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is good quality, not very big, but enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>But even if you think it smells old, young women love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, I find I need to use very little to get a good \\&quot;real\\&quot; lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the $2 bars of shaving soap, and have used about every other kind of shaving cream, soap or oil available at your local department store.</li>
            <li>Defiantly this is far better than Gillette and other cheap branded shaving creams</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but definitely not subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he uses it every day and says he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this set for a couple months now and the brush has held up very well.  </li>
            <li>The hairs seems secure, but he has only used it for a week.</li>
            <li>It lathes up very well.</li>
            <li>I fully intend to buy more Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving products in the future.</li>
            <li>It is like going back in time when man were elegant and modest.  </li>
            <li>However, I also found a wide range of opinion out there and started to get a real &#x27;Ford v Chevy&#x27; feel from many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>This is my personal favorite shaving cream so far.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street offers a unique experience.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a Pure Badger Hair Shaving Brush, and with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I see it selling for much more from other sellers.  </li>
            <li>First, the bristles are soft; softer than the Silvertip Badger by Parker I compared to.</li>
            <li>I had my first old fashioned shaving experience in college, about 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Instead of gambling and investing $50-$100 on a brush I wasn&#x27;t sure about, I dropped $150 on 4 different hair quality (Synthetic/Pure/Best/Silvertip) brushes from 4 different makers with the added bonus of the shaving cream coming with this brush.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Taylor Sandalwood shaving cream for quite a while and bought this gift set mainly for the brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands such as Proraso which were good, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with this brand for the long term.</li>
            <li>Overall a quality product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Is the brush worth the extra $40?  </li>
            <li>very young like 7...</li>
            <li>It was a substantial upgrade, and he reports that the brush is very soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li>First the actual cream which by itself would be 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I have a goatee but also shave my head and one brush load was enough for a full shave with plenty left</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I think the soap is a bit strong smelling, but its not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Over that time, I have tried different razors and foams but ended up with pretty much the same results - a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old and a young professional.</li>
            <li>Old Bond Shave Cream for years and loves the close shave, scent and how his skin feels after its use.</li>
            <li>and every one I try is excellant as far as texture and smell.</li>
            <li>I replaced my husband&#x27;s old boar&#x27;s hair shaving brush with this set for Christmas and he loves it.</li>
            <li>this was a brush made by Rooney for Taylor Of Old Bond Street!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the quality of the lather and shave, TOBS can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can lather up your cream in a bowl or directly on your face.</li>
            <li>At $30, why not, its over 30 british pounds ($50+) if you purchase straight from TOBS in England.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street since Christmas 2011 when I received a set as a gift.</li>
            <li>Then I got this Old Bond Shaving Badger Brush with the Sandalwood Shave Cream, and.....</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>it produces a thick, creamy lather sure to leave your face hydrated post-shave.  </li>
            <li>I originally started using shave brush and soap a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li>But wow, it is very high quality and produces such a rich, thick lather  that I don&#x27;t mind its size.  </li>
            <li>The brush I got had an odor for the first couple shaves, which is to be expected from a badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Produces a rich thick lather.</li>
            <li>The shave cream itself produces a rich lather using just a small amount!</li>
            <li>I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street for a long time now.</li>
            <li>The only way to describe the feel is like fresh heavy whipped cream, dense but no big bubbles.</li>
            <li>Just a small portion of cream (like the size of your fingernail) combined with some hot water and the brush produces a rich, thick lather.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to work long to get a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> love the smell absolutely what I was lookin for in every way..not too strong no fruity smell what so ever...works to an amazing lather for a truely great shaving experience..</li>
            <li> Very happy and will definitely buy more from the range.</li>
            <li> My wife gave this to me as a birthday gift, and let me tell you, it is a perfect compliment to my Double Edge Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> All I ever got from them was an OK shave.</li>
            <li> For this price... I will probably order this again when it is time for more cream as the price for a tub alone is around $15</li>
            <li> so it makes more sense to grab the brush as,</li>
            <li> :-)ellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For this price... I will probably order this again when it is time for more cream as the price for a tub alone is around $15</li>
            <li> so it makes more sense to grab the brush as,</li>
            <li> And, if it is a Rooney... Fuggeddaboudit!  :-)</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic, and the brush is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great set of your looking to give this as a gift or just want a box set for yourself!</li>
            <li> however I have found the coconut scented version more to my liking.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You wont find a better quality product for cheaper, although I&#x27;m sure you could pay more for inferior products if you so wished.</li>
            <li> Badger hair brushes make the hairs stand up so a close and comfortable shave can be achieved!</li>
            <li> I love the sandelwood aroma.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Really good lather and just the right amount of scent.  </li>
            <li> Ladies dig it too, every party I go to their hands are all over my face, even though I am a pretty good looking guy, this shaving cream has magic powers.</li>
            <li> The sandlewood scent is awesome, I love how lingers long after he shaves.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and I love it!</li>
            <li> Just getting in to safety razor shaving and wanted the full experience of a brush and some nice cream...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice, quality brush and a great starter kit when you&#x27;re not sure quite what to buy and also the separate components could cost you much more.</li>
            <li> The Taylor shaving cream goes on smooth, lathers up very nicely, and really does make for a great shave, besides the fact that the sandalwood scent is a masculine scent that lasts all day, and yet is not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all of their creams are fantastic, but these are the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> The badger brush is great and soft.</li>
            <li> At first the scent was very strong to me, and I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it.  </li>
            <li> for this quality of brush, you&#x27;d easily pay $25</li>
            <li> for this quality of brush, you&#x27;d easily pay $25</li>
            <li> lathers extremely easily.</li>
            <li> The shave cream does  have a strong scent when using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice set for the price.  </li>
            <li> , I love shaving with this tried and true method.</li>
            <li> The beard is fully hydrated and the hairs come off easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and leaves the skin feeling comfortable throughout the shave and after.</li>
            <li> It has since grown on me, and I quite enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment definitively on it, but it seems great to me, I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and have only noticed one hair in my lather</li>
            <li> For almost 40 years I have used the standard disposable blades and Foamy, Barbasol type shaving cream and been happy.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood scent is a good introduction to Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Finally we go to the brush which is very nice</li>
            <li> most of that was in the first week.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to lather and super smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a good shaving experience, and are willing to drop the bucks to do so, this is certainly a product worthy of your consideration.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good quality brush and shave cream set at an incredible price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know which one to buy , but made the right choice !</li>
            <li> I love their products so much that I bought a bar of soap and aftershave too.</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller but good quality.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful gift for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;His old shaving brush was worn out, so I chose this set.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream has a very strong fragrance, so he uses a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but I found that my shave with a soap and brush is much closer that I experienced with the same razor and a can of foam.  </li>
            <li> It quickly dissipated after 3 or 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li> The bruxh is very good after the first couple of uses when it lost quite a few pieces of hair.  </li>
            <li> The results are the same each way: a winning shave!</li>
            <li> The brush produces great lather and easily holds enough to do multiple passes on a face.</li>
            <li> Seems ok so far.</li>
            <li> The quality is luxurious for lack of a more masculine name.</li>
            <li> For the money this is a great set plus Taylor of Old Bond Street offers many different creams and accessories to keep you groomed!</li>
            <li> This is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice scent but not the heavy, smokey, incense sandalwood.</li>
            <li> and man were they right...</li>
            <li> Secondly, the brush is smaller being slightly less tall and a fair bit more narrow of a &#x27;fan&#x27; than the Parker Silvertip and the Jagger Best</li>
            <li> /&gt;Christmas day came, and I had my first shave with a brush and soap.  </li>
            <li> While I really would only deduct 1/2 a star for this, it&#x27;s really not bad just not as soft as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve bought tons of razorock shave soaps after i first got this set.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First the brush:  </li>
            <li> the shaving cream is ready for use!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a smooth, comfortable shave every time as long as you don&#x27;t add too much water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is good quality, not very big, but enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> But even if you think it smells old, young women love this stuff.</li>
            <li> , I find I need to use very little to get a good \\&quot;real\\&quot; lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the $2 bars of shaving soap, and have used about every other kind of shaving cream, soap or oil available at your local department store.</li>
            <li> Defiantly this is far better than Gillette and other cheap branded shaving creams</li>
            <li> Not too strong, but definitely not subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he uses it every day and says he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for a couple months now and the brush has held up very well.  </li>
            <li> The hairs seems secure, but he has only used it for a week.</li>
            <li> It lathes up very well.</li>
            <li> I fully intend to buy more Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving products in the future.</li>
            <li> It is like going back in time when man were elegant and modest.  </li>
            <li> However, I also found a wide range of opinion out there and started to get a real &#x27;Ford v Chevy&#x27; feel from many of the reviews.</li>
            <li> This is my personal favorite shaving cream so far.  </li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street offers a unique experience.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a Pure Badger Hair Shaving Brush, and with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I see it selling for much more from other sellers.  </li>
            <li> First, the bristles are soft; softer than the Silvertip Badger by Parker I compared to.</li>
            <li> I had my first old fashioned shaving experience in college, about 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Instead of gambling and investing $50-$100 on a brush I wasn&#x27;t sure about, I dropped $150 on 4 different hair quality (Synthetic/Pure/Best/Silvertip) brushes from 4 different makers with the added bonus of the shaving cream coming with this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Taylor Sandalwood shaving cream for quite a while and bought this gift set mainly for the brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands such as Proraso which were good, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with this brand for the long term.</li>
            <li> Overall a quality product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Is the brush worth the extra $40?  </li>
            <li> very young like 7...</li>
            <li> It was a substantial upgrade, and he reports that the brush is very soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li> First the actual cream which by itself would be 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have a goatee but also shave my head and one brush load was enough for a full shave with plenty left</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I think the soap is a bit strong smelling, but its not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Over that time, I have tried different razors and foams but ended up with pretty much the same results - a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and a young professional.</li>
            <li> Old Bond Shave Cream for years and loves the close shave, scent and how his skin feels after its use.</li>
            <li> and every one I try is excellant as far as texture and smell.</li>
            <li> I replaced my husband&#x27;s old boar&#x27;s hair shaving brush with this set for Christmas and he loves it.</li>
            <li> this was a brush made by Rooney for Taylor Of Old Bond Street!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the quality of the lather and shave, TOBS can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can lather up your cream in a bowl or directly on your face.</li>
            <li> At $30, why not, its over 30 british pounds ($50+) if you purchase straight from TOBS in England.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street since Christmas 2011 when I received a set as a gift.</li>
            <li> Then I got this Old Bond Shaving Badger Brush with the Sandalwood Shave Cream, and.....</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> it produces a thick, creamy lather sure to leave your face hydrated post-shave.  </li>
            <li> I originally started using shave brush and soap a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> But wow, it is very high quality and produces such a rich, thick lather  that I don&#x27;t mind its size.  </li>
            <li> The brush I got had an odor for the first couple shaves, which is to be expected from a badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Produces a rich thick lather.</li>
            <li> The shave cream itself produces a rich lather using just a small amount!</li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street for a long time now.</li>
            <li> The only way to describe the feel is like fresh heavy whipped cream, dense but no big bubbles.</li>
            <li> Just a small portion of cream (like the size of your fingernail) combined with some hot water and the brush produces a rich, thick lather.</li>
            <li> The badger hair brush is a little smaller than other badger hair brushes, but unless you have very large hands</li>
            <li> The handle is small for my large hands.  </li>
            <li> I can see that when this jar of cream is gone, he will be wanting more of the same and not the less expensive solid shave soaps he had been using before.  </li>
            <li> but perhaps a bit old as it was fairly dried out when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I like the brush in that it is not as large as some of the other badger brushes that I have used in the past</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount of product, so the shave cream lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> this should be a staple to all wet shavers</li>
            <li> I shaved before showering and could still smell a hint of the cream on me a few hours later</li>
            <li> Within 30 sec.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than some of the other brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> Only a few hairs have came out of brush !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered some other samples of TOBS creams and this is one of my favorites now.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve used a couple other brands, and TOBS is nothing but quality, and all reviews rave about their creams.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it, but my silver tip brush is too much for this beginner&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> had an old brush I&#x27;d worn out an ol tired soap bout at any drug store...</li>
            <li> I would not shave any other way!</li>
            <li> With an almond sized amount (maybe a little less)</li>
            <li> Give yourself plenty of time, in case it comes all messy like mine.</li>
            <li> The smell is NOT a dank, heavy, incense type sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the sandalwood shaving set from The Art of Shaving, so I was hoping the quality of this set would at least match theirs.</li>
            <li> Small brush.</li>
            <li> Can cream is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> The brush in this set is a bit small, but it does the job you need it to do.</li>
            <li> The least they could have done was dust it off bdfore shipping.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really go wrong with this set...</li>
            <li> Feeling a bit nostalgic, I added this set to my Christmas wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I watched all the YouTube videos about the smell and the feel and how all canned creams are crap</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This was a gift, so I will need to wait for comments from the user before I can truly speak to the quality.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this set. The brush is soft and excellent quality. He&#x27;s been using Taylor of Old Bond Shave Cream for years and loves the close shave, scent and how his skin feels after its use. You only have to use a small amount of product, so the shave cream lasts a long time. Great products!</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful gift for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;His old shaving brush was worn out, so I chose this set.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream has a very strong fragrance, so he uses a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very good compared to what I found it for elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street for a long time now. I love it get a nice close shave with the badger brush, great price smell good . I love their products so much that I bought a bar of soap and aftershave too. Ladies dig it too, every party I go to their hands are all over my face, even though I am a pretty good looking guy, this shaving cream has magic powers.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who wanted to try this instead of aerosol foam. He loves it, very rich emollient shave and wonderful smell. He shaves in the shower and has no problem handling it at all. It&#x27;s a very nice, quality brush and a great starter kit when you&#x27;re not sure quite what to buy and also the separate components could cost you much more. Very happy and will definitely buy more from the range.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a Pure Badger Hair Shaving Brush, and with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream. My wife gave this to me as a birthday gift, and let me tell you, it is a perfect compliment to my Double Edge Safety Razor. The badger hair brush is a little smaller than other badger hair brushes, but unless you have very large hands it won&#x27;t bother you at all. In fact, it works nicely for things like applying the shaving cream under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;The Shaving cream is simply amazing. I have tried all kinds of shaving products to improve my shave. I&#x27;ve had the $2 bars of shaving soap, and have used about every other kind of shaving cream, soap or oil available at your local department store. All I ever got from them was an OK shave. The Taylor shaving cream goes on smooth, lathers up very nicely, and really does make for a great shave, besides the fact that the sandalwood scent is a masculine scent that lasts all day, and yet is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good shaving experience, and are willing to drop the bucks to do so, this is certainly a product worthy of your consideration. I fully intend to buy more Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving products in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice set for the price.  The bruxh is very good after the first couple of uses when it lost quite a few pieces of hair.  The shave cream is very good also- but perhaps a bit old as it was fairly dried out when it arrived.  The fault may reside with the seller- as the box was covered with dust.  The least they could have done was dust it off bdfore shipping.  Overall- I would recommend the set at the 30.00 dollars it cost me- as it is well woth that price.  I see it selling for much more from other sellers.  TOBS makes about the nicest shave cream on the market- and every one I try is excellant as far as texture and smell.</li>
            <li> Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband.  he uses it every day and says he really likes it.  The brush is nice and not too bristly.  My only complaint is that I think the soap is a bit strong smelling, but its not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Great product. Small brush. Not the box in picture</li>
            <li> I remember my grandpa teaching me to save with a brush an soap very young like 7...had an old brush I&#x27;d worn out an ol tired soap bout at any drug store...this brush an soap is niether of those. .truely an awesome set for the price...hairs on brush could be a touch finer an thicker but I still rate it a 5..cant say enough about the cream...love the smell absolutely what I was lookin for in every way..not too strong no fruity smell what so ever...works to an amazing lather for a truely great shaving experience..you can&#x27;t really go wrong with this set...</li>
            <li> this should be a staple to all wet shavers</li>
            <li> This brush and shave cream set is great for anybody looking to get a brush and shave cream.  The shave cream does  have a strong scent when using it.  However, once you shave and rinse your face it does not leave an overpowering scent.  I&#x27;ve been using this set for a couple months now and the brush has held up very well.  I&#x27;ve only noticed about 6 hairs that have come out of the brush and most of that was in the first week.  If you are looking for a good quality brush and shave cream set at an incredible price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I replaced my husband&#x27;s old boar&#x27;s hair shaving brush with this set for Christmas and he loves it. It was a substantial upgrade, and he reports that the brush is very soft and lathers well. The hairs seems secure, but he has only used it for a week. The soap smells great, too!</li>
            <li> Seems ok so far. Nice box/gift packaging. It&#x27;s for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day so we will see how he likes it. The issue I had was that the shave cream was gooped all over the inside of the box and outer container. I don&#x27;t have time to send it back so cleaned it up as good as I could. Just FYI if you are ordering as a gift. Give yourself plenty of time, in case it comes all messy like mine.</li>
            <li> I like this shaving cream.  It is like going back in time when man were elegant and modest.  I would gave it a five start if it was for the brush.  Nothing wrong with it, but my silver tip brush is too much for this beginner&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> Great product smells wonderful my wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> We both love it!!! The sandlewood scent is awesome, I love how lingers long after he shaves. He loves the way it lathers and how good it feels on his skin.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son, and he loves it.  The brush is smaller but good quality.  The shave cream has a very nice scent and even leaves the bathroom smelling fresh.  I can see that when this jar of cream is gone, he will be wanting more of the same and not the less expensive solid shave soaps he had been using before.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I originally started using shave brush and soap a little over a year ago. After a fair bit of frustration with my $14.95 brush/cup/soap combo I started to read and learn more. However, I also found a wide range of opinion out there and started to get a real &#x27;Ford v Chevy&#x27; feel from many of the reviews. So, I decided to run a Pepsi Challenge of my own... Instead of gambling and investing $50-$100 on a brush I wasn&#x27;t sure about, I dropped $150 on 4 different hair quality (Synthetic/Pure/Best/Silvertip) brushes from 4 different makers with the added bonus of the shaving cream coming with this brush. After reading a lot of different reviews and information on shave brushes I also believed there was an outside chance this was a brush made by Rooney for Taylor Of Old Bond Street!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the results I&#x27;ve gotten using this are... First, the bristles are soft; softer than the Silvertip Badger by Parker I compared to. Secondly, the brush is smaller being slightly less tall and a fair bit more narrow of a &#x27;fan&#x27; than the Parker Silvertip and the Jagger Best I compared to. But, the density of fibers in the knot is greater than the Best and nearly as dense as the Silvertip. The brush produces great lather and easily holds enough to do multiple passes on a face. I have a goatee but also shave my head and one brush load was enough for a full shave with plenty left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the shaaving cream is incredible! The quality is luxurious for lack of a more masculine name. The smell is NOT a dank, heavy, incense type sandalwood smell. Rather, it has a smell of Barbershop with a hint of sandalwood. It is a very nice scent but not the heavy, smokey, incense sandalwood. So, be forewarned if that is what you are after. That being said, the cream is awesome,  dramatically reduces friction, hydrates and softens your skin and has staying power beyond a shower. I shaved before showering and could still smell a hint of the cream on me a few hours later and my skin feels excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, great product and between the cream&#x27;s awesome lathering ability and the brush&#x27;s quality I think it nicely offsets any concerns with size about the brush anyone may have! For this price... I will probably order this again when it is time for more cream as the price for a tub alone is around $15 so it makes more sense to grab the brush as, for this quality of brush, you&#x27;d easily pay $25+... And, if it is a Rooney... Fuggeddaboudit!  :-)ellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, great product and between the cream&#x27;s awesome lathering ability and the brush&#x27;s quality I think it nicely offsets any concerns with size about the brush anyone may have!

            <li> This cream is fantastic, and the brush is quite nice. The packaging is shockingly nice. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 30 years.  Over that time, I have tried different razors and foams but ended up with pretty much the same results - a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; shave.  Feeling a bit nostalgic, I added this set to my Christmas wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas day came, and I had my first shave with a brush and soap.  What a difference!  It took some getting used to, but I found that my shave with a soap and brush is much closer that I experienced with the same razor and a can of foam.  I would load up the brush with a ton of soap but as time goes on, I find I need to use very little to get a good \\&quot;real\\&quot; lather.  I also like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next step is to get a brush stand so it dries properly but overall, I love shaving with this tried and true method.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a christmas gift for my Dad. I had previously used the sandalwood shaving set from The Art of Shaving, so I was hoping the quality of this set would at least match theirs. It didn&#x27;t disappoint. The box looks nice, good for a gift. The brush is good quality, not very big, but enough to get the job done. The cream itself (which I have since ordered for myself) is nicely scented, not quite as pleasant as the AOS set, but still very nice. It lathers well and leaves the skin feeling comfortable throughout the shave and after.</li>
            <li> A girl told me I smelled like a man and soap. I told her, &amp;#34;you&#x27;re welcome!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just try it. It speaks for itself. Can cream is a thing of the past.You won&#x27;t regret trying this product.</li>
            <li> Just getting in to safety razor shaving and wanted the full experience of a brush and some nice cream... First the actual cream which by itself would be 5 stars! I watched all the YouTube videos about the smell and the feel and how all canned creams are crap and I figure I would give it a shot and man were they right... It is super easy to lather and super smooth to apply. The only way to describe the feel is like fresh heavy whipped cream, dense but no big bubbles. I will never go back to regular canned shaving cream again. Finally we go to the brush which is very nice but because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;pure badger&amp;#34; hair the ends of the brush are cut and give a scratchy feel... While I really would only deduct 1/2 a star for this, it&#x27;s really not bad just not as soft as I would have liked. However I will be continuing to use this for the foreseeable future. Overall it&#x27;s a great set of your looking to give this as a gift or just want a box set for yourself!</li>
            <li> Nice scent of the Sandalwood shaving cream. Produces a rich thick lather. No complaints at all however I have found the coconut scented version more to my liking.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve bought tons of razorock shave soaps after i first got this set.  my girlfriend still says this one smells the best.  lathers extremely easily. not as protective as mitchells or even some of the razorocks.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and I love it! Smells good, works well ... just what I was hoping for. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the brush and shave cream ! And my wife loves the smell ! Only a few hairs have came out of brush ! Didn&#x27;t know which one to buy , but made the right choice !</li>
            <li> the cream is leaking and it appears so it is not in perfect condition</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade your shave routine, then this brush and cream set will help you do just that! The sandalwood scent is a good introduction to Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams. Younger customers may not like the overpowering, grandpa-like smell, but to me it&#x27;s comforting. I&#x27;m 25 years old and a young professional. I was raised by my grandparents, so this smell takes me back to mornings when I would wander into the bathroom while pap was shaving. But even if you think it smells old, young women love this stuff. I always get compliments on how I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality of the lather and shave, TOBS can&#x27;t be beat. The brush in this set is a bit small, but it does the job you need it to do. Just a small portion of cream (like the size of your fingernail) combined with some hot water and the brush produces a rich, thick lather. You&#x27;ll get a smooth, comfortable shave every time as long as you don&#x27;t add too much water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can lather up your cream in a bowl or directly on your face. The results are the same each way: a winning shave! And trust me, you will feel like a winner once you learn how to use this stuff. It leaves your face looking, feeling, and smelling good. What more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other TOBS shaving creams to try: Eton College, Jermyn Street, Almond, and Grapefruit. I&#x27;m sure all of their creams are fantastic, but these are the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> I had my first old fashioned shaving experience in college, about 7 years ago.  My room mate had a tub of TOBS Almond he brought back from Scotland, and I would use it from time to time.  I decided on a whim I wanted to use a brush and TOBS again so I sprung for this.  At first the scent was very strong to me, and I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it.  It has since grown on me, and I quite enjoy it.  I&#x27;ve ordered some other samples of TOBS creams and this is one of my favorites now.  I prefer it to the Almond scent now.  I&#x27;ve never had my own brush before, so I can&#x27;t comment definitively on it, but it seems great to me, I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and have only noticed one hair in my lather bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this style cream and lather, I would emphatically recommend it!  Also, I&#x27;ve used a couple other brands, and TOBS is nothing but quality, and all reviews rave about their creams.  I forgot how luxurious their creams make your face feel.  At $30, why not, its over 30 british pounds ($50+) if you purchase straight from TOBS in England.  You wont find a better quality product for cheaper, although I&#x27;m sure you could pay more for inferior products if you so wished.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like a good lather shave! Taylor of Old Bond Street offers a unique experience. Badger hair brushes make the hairs stand up so a close and comfortable shave can be achieved! The shave cream itself produces a rich lather using just a small amount! For the money this is a great set plus Taylor of Old Bond Street offers many different creams and accessories to keep you groomed! I personally am sold on this brand name! I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street since Christmas 2011 when I received a set as a gift. I would not shave any other way!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Taylor Sandalwood shaving cream for quite a while and bought this gift set mainly for the brush.  I like the brush in that it is not as large as some of the other badger brushes that I have used in the past and it seems a bit easier to control.  Overall a quality product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really good lather and just the right amount of scent.  This is my personal favorite shaving cream so far.  The brush is excellent and I am very pleased with both of them.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands such as Proraso which were good, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with this brand for the long term.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap. It lathes up very well. I like to do the 4 pass technique, and it last till the end. The badger brush is great and soft. This was the perfect gift...to myself, lol.</li>
            <li> The shipment did arrived before date as promised . Overall good product. I love the sandelwood aroma. Defiantly this is far better than Gillette and other cheap branded shaving creams</li>
            <li> First the brush:  It is a little smaller than some of the other brushes out there.  The handle is small for my large hands.  But wow, it is very high quality and produces such a rich, thick lather  that I don&#x27;t mind its size.  The brush I got had an odor for the first couple shaves, which is to be expected from a badger hair brush.  It quickly dissipated after 3 or 4 shaves.  I have not yet noticed the brush \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; after 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the shaving cream.  The shaving cream is absolutely wonderful!  With an almond sized amount (maybe a little less) it produces a thick, creamy lather sure to leave your face hydrated post-shave.  The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to work long to get a nice lather.  Within 30 sec. the shaving cream is ready for use!  The scent is very nice as well.  Not too strong, but definitely not subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you can get the shaving cream for $15.  Is the brush worth the extra $40?  Yes!</li>
            <li> Love it, great lather and brush. Love the scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> For almost 40 years I have used the standard disposable blades and Foamy, Barbasol type shaving cream and been happy. Then I got this Old Bond Shaving Badger Brush with the Sandalwood Shave Cream, and.....WOW...it has given me the best shave I have ever had in my life. I got Harry&#x27;s razor and blades from the Internet, also. The shaving experience is something I actually look forward to- the shave cream is amazing, just a tiny amount gives great volume and the brush on the face is great, also. The beard is fully hydrated and the hairs come off easily and smoothly. This is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Brush is great but the soap does work real good but has an odor to it the, while pleasant to me, is a hazard to those with breathing problems. Cannot use it because it starts my wife wheezing.</li>
