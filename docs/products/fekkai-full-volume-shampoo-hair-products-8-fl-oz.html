            <li>One of my most favorite shampoos ever!  </li>
            <li>I t also has a very nice mild scent to it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is excellent - has lots of sudsy foam when you wash and smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, does what it says it will do...give you full volume</li>
            <li>Fekkai is a top quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair feel weightless, but unless you love to smell like your man&#x27;s aftershave or deodorant...</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li>This gives me lift and body to style my hair and it does hold up longer .. Would most defiantly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>but you will surely change your mind when you look at yourself in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>overly pleased with it</li>
            <li>the for color treated hair product more</li>
            <li>B0030GFXM6 Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner, 8-fluid ounces Bottle]] and was pleased with the product line.  </li>
            <li>I get the most compliments when I use this fabulous shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to tell the difference by just switching shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>This product protects against frizz as well as giving my hair a lot more volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Fekkai volume products for many years.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is watery, and the shampoo is greasy (like a cheap motel 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner!).</li>
            <li>It seems OK, but</li>
            <li>It has a nice citrus smell, very fresh and not too girly.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend!!!!!</li>
            <li>This has a most pleasant clean scent, not like those fruity, sickly sweet products everyone else pushes.</li>
            <li>The full volume shampoo and conditioner manages to remove the effects of the medication and compensate for the thinning hair while also leaving my hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this shampoo leaves it looking full and healthy.</li>
            <li>Superior product for fine hair and smells absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, smooth and more fuller.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money it cost - I expected it to be flawless.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, my hair does feel very healthy and it looks shiny.  </li>
            <li>MOST CERTAINLY DID!!</li>
            <li>(And yes, I rinsed well; I have fine hair and make it a point to rinse well every day.)</li>
            <li>It adds volume to my fine hair, without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>The hair spray was just that, hair spray like any cheap brand you could buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>So, I put that away in the bottom of one of my drawers and tried to forget about it, it was free with the set after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes it works great, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the cost, when my major national brand $5 shampoo works just fine.</li>
            <li>While I love the Technician Color Care Shampoo, it still has a tendency to leave my hair flat and does not do a good job of stripping out the medication.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and had been curious about this shampoo for years after reading good reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>I like that the product description&#x27;s first sentence is \\&quot;who&#x27;s it for?\\&quot; because I wasn&#x27;t sure after using it.  </li>
            <li>to their claims of greatness) then do what I did and buy the travel size first, if you love it-</li>
            <li>Very strange, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever experienced any type of hair products that smelled like you could just as easily clean the tub with them.</li>
            <li>It is great to get it through Amazon as the stores carry a very limited supply.</li>
            <li>So, when I received the Full Volume Shampoo and Conditioner through Bzz Agent, I was super excited.  </li>
            <li>I received Fekkai Full Volume shampoo and conditioner from BzzAgent to try.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I purchased the Full volume travel pack which contains the shampoo,conditioner, and hair spray.</li>
            <li>As a Bzz Agent I received two full size bottled of full volume shampoo and full volume conditioner.   </li>
            <li>Overall, I think the shampoo works great - it certainly adds volume to my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have used many other products designed to add volume, but nothing worked as well as this product.  </li>
            <li>For me, both the shampoo and conditioner are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Even though its a bit pricey, I think its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This stuff is way overpriced, it would have been worth it if it lived up to its hype</li>
            <li>Got it quick and so happy to get this product since Fekkai has apparently stopped making this actual volumizing shampoo</li>
            <li>I used it right away and was blown away by the result, with my fine limp hair I need to use a mousse, but not with these products, they smell great and have even better results than expected.</li>
            <li>Used this before and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Everyone who I have ever convinced to try it, loves it~ when I first started using it, people would say what did you do to your hair?  </li>
            <li>It totally transforms the texture to manageable and makes me look like I have way more hair than I do.  </li>
            <li>I rarely spend this much money on hair products</li>
            <li>The first night I tried it, I used all of the products including the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I first learned of Fekkai hair products when someone gave me a sample pack.  </li>
            <li>she is interested in selling the product in her salon.</li>
            <li>today I felt like my hair was full of static and not really all that manageable.  </li>
            <li>Obviously it isn&#x27;t magic, but with a blowout your hair will no longer be laying flat.</li>
            <li>It seemed to make my hair more flat than volumized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The products are natural with no harsh ingredients and did not even have to fish for compliments from my husband who could not stop touching and smelling my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, long, smooth hair, and when I used this product with the Fekkai Full Volume Conditioner, it left my hair feeling clumpy, sticky, and almost brittle.</li>
            <li>it had a texture and after finishing of with some glossing spray I looked ready to party.</li>
            <li>If you really feel like you want to try it anyway(due</li>
            <li>This shampoo adds lots of volume to your hair - really like it.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it is baby fine and flat.  </li>
            <li>I received the Fekkai Full Volume Shampoo, Fine or Thin Hair, 8 fl oz for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why it has such a strong, musky smell (like Old Spice).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but honestly after two days of use, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really any better than the Tresemme shampoo I had been using.  </li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t, well, you only shelled out $25 instead of the $60+ for buying the full size shampoo&amp;conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Seemed to give a little more volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, my hair has some curl, and I live at the beach</li>
            <li>LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT GREAT PRODUCT FOR FINE HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I used it on a trip and was very surprised at how well my hair did using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of volume enhancing hair products but they seemed to work only for the first couple applications.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that I am using for the last year or more, and the only one that does what it says: gives you volume.  </li>
            <li>These results were clearly visible on my hair after three uses.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling really soft .</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it did not leave my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I could have bought the whole kit &amp;#34;Full Size&amp;#34; at Costco&#x27;s....for almost the same price.</li>
            <li>I will probably experiment with it another few days, but overall, I think I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li>My first hint that something was up with the shampoo was the day-glo yellow colour, and the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it several times with different styling products and tools, but it still leaves my hair super flat.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s expensive and at first I thought this was a huge mistake</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and live in Colorado where the dry climate tends to leave my hair looking like a baby chick&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>Just a small amount of the volume shampoo suds up like crazy, has a wonderful fresh scent and not only puts some oomph in limp hair, but leaves it looking shiny and feeling silky.</li>
            <li>I loved the product, but will never buy it because it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li>However, I felt it left my hair more flat than any other volumizing product I&#x27;ve used in the past...</li>

            <li> I could have bought the whole kit &amp;#34;Full Size&amp;#34; at Costco&#x27;s....for almost the same price.</li>
            <li> I will probably experiment with it another few days, but overall, I think I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li> My first hint that something was up with the shampoo was the day-glo yellow colour, and the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it several times with different styling products and tools, but it still leaves my hair super flat.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive and at first I thought this was a huge mistake</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and live in Colorado where the dry climate tends to leave my hair looking like a baby chick&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount of the volume shampoo suds up like crazy, has a wonderful fresh scent and not only puts some oomph in limp hair, but leaves it looking shiny and feeling silky.</li>
            <li> I loved the product, but will never buy it because it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> However, I felt it left my hair more flat than any other volumizing product I&#x27;ve used in the past...</li>
            <li> i have thick but fine texture hair and this is the only shampoo that doesnt weigh it down and make my hair feel oily by the end of the day</li>
            <li> Seriously though, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It made my hair oily and flat, so oily it looked like I hadn&#x27;t bathed in days.</li>
            <li> Now I have been back to other products -at</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have thin, flat hair and this shampoo gives me thinker, fuller hair. My hair looks very healthy and shiny since using this. I would highly recommend it. Fekkai is a top quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> I take medication that has both thinned my hair and leaves a residue in it.  While I love the Technician Color Care Shampoo, it still has a tendency to leave my hair flat and does not do a good job of stripping out the medication.  The full volume shampoo and conditioner manages to remove the effects of the medication and compensate for the thinning hair while also leaving my hair nice and shiny. For me, both the shampoo and conditioner are worth every penny. I only wish that Amazon itself stocked the larger 16oz sizes so I could get them in two days with my prime account.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of years now.  Everyone who I have ever convinced to try it, loves it~ when I first started using it, people would say what did you do to your hair?  I have never had anyone be disappointed~ LOVE IT~</li>
            <li> I received Fekkai Full Volume shampoo and conditioner from BzzAgent to try. I have thin and oily hair that get flat every other day. I have tried a lot of volume enhancing hair products but they seemed to work only for the first couple applications. I have tried Fekkai for almost 2 weeks now and I have to admit it has worked wonders for my hair. It makes my hair shiny, smooth and more fuller. I don&#x27;t have to worry about blow drying every time as my hair has a bounce even without it. Even though its a bit pricey, I think its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I like that the product description&#x27;s first sentence is \\&quot;who&#x27;s it for?\\&quot; because I wasn&#x27;t sure after using it.  I have no idea why it has such a strong, musky smell (like Old Spice).  For the amount of money it cost - I expected it to be flawless.  It does make your hair feel weightless, but unless you love to smell like your man&#x27;s aftershave or deodorant...I suggest you save your money and avoid this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great! It makes ton of lather with just a small amount!! I t also has a very nice mild scent to it. Leaves my hair feeling really soft . Love it! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> As a Bzz Agent I received two full size bottled of full volume shampoo and full volume conditioner.   I used it right away and was blown away by the result, with my fine limp hair I need to use a mousse, but not with these products, they smell great and have even better results than expected. The products are natural with no harsh ingredients and did not even have to fish for compliments from my husband who could not stop touching and smelling my hair. My hair was clean and beautiful it had a texture and after finishing of with some glossing spray I looked ready to party.</li>
            <li> Okay. Don&#x27;t love the scent. Makes my hair somewhat fuller. Don&#x27;t like it enough to buy again.</li>
            <li> I like Feddai products and although they are a bit pricey they don&#x27;t disappointed. Just a small amount of the volume shampoo suds up like crazy, has a wonderful fresh scent and not only puts some oomph in limp hair, but leaves it looking shiny and feeling silky. And, by oomph I mean a bit of boost. Obviously it isn&#x27;t magic, but with a blowout your hair will no longer be laying flat. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> i have thick but fine texture hair and this is the only shampoo that doesnt weigh it down and make my hair feel oily by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I have tried nto purchase the product twice and I never got it. It has been a chalenge to get a refund and I&#x27;m very disappointed. Definitely not recommend it!</li>
            <li> Kerastase had been my go-to shampoo for a couple years now. Always wanted to try Fekkai products to see if they measure up to the Kerastase I&#x27;d been using. MOST CERTAINLY DID!! To the reviewer who said this smells like men&#x27;s aftershave, I disagree. This has a most pleasant clean scent, not like those fruity, sickly sweet products everyone else pushes. I&#x27;m now hooked on the (less expensive) Fekkai products. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!  I have very fine, thin hair and live in Colorado where the dry climate tends to leave my hair looking like a baby chick&#x27;s!  This shampoo plumps every strand....I can literally feel it working while I lather.  It totally transforms the texture to manageable and makes me look like I have way more hair than I do.  I am hooked...worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, I have always had thin blonde hair with no body. This gives me lift and body to style my hair and it does hold up longer .. Would most defiantly recommend it. I use the shampoo and condt both and also the cream style but just a tiny little bit..</li>
            <li> I received the Fekkai Full Volume Shampoo, Fine or Thin Hair, 8 fl oz for free from BzzAgent. Overall, I think the shampoo works great - it certainly adds volume to my fine, straight hair. It has a nice citrus smell, very fresh and not too girly. I loved the product, but will never buy it because it&#x27;s very expensive. Yes it works great, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the cost, when my major national brand $5 shampoo works just fine.</li>
            <li> Love how this shampoo cleans and volumizes my hair!  I have very fine hair and this shampoo leaves it looking full and healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent - has lots of sudsy foam when you wash and smells clean and fresh.  Leaves my hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive and at first I thought this was a huge mistake but you will surely change your mind when you look at yourself in the mirror.  It lasts a long time because you use less of it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, long, smooth hair, and when I used this product with the Fekkai Full Volume Conditioner, it left my hair feeling clumpy, sticky, and almost brittle. I used it once, and the entire day I felt like my hair was tangled, and when I&#x27;d run my hands through it, my hair felt sticky. (And yes, I rinsed well; I have fine hair and make it a point to rinse well every day.) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone with a similar hair type.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way overpriced, it would have been worth it if it lived up to its hype but it doesn&#x27;t even come close.  Thankfully I purchased the Full volume travel pack which contains the shampoo,conditioner, and hair spray. I paid around $25 for that but of course, way cheaper than if I had purchased the regular sizes. The shampoo did not reinforce any strands of my hair(like it claims) and the smell was just horrid. The fragrance of both the shampoo &amp; conditioner reminded me of cleaning materials (kinda like Pine-sol). Very strange, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever experienced any type of hair products that smelled like you could just as easily clean the tub with them. After using the shampoo &amp; conditioner, my hair was just as limp as ever and quite dull looking as well. Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination due to the industrial fragrance but I felt it was very harsh on my hair. The hair spray was just that, hair spray like any cheap brand you could buy at the drugstore.  Save your money on this brand. If you really feel like you want to try it anyway(due to their claims of greatness) then do what I did and buy the travel size first, if you love it- great but if you don&#x27;t, well, you only shelled out $25 instead of the $60+ for buying the full size shampoo&amp;conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo adds lots of volume to your hair - really like it. It is great to get it through Amazon as the stores carry a very limited supply.</li>
            <li> Bought the shampoo, conditioner set that included the small bottle of leave-in conditioner. I rarely spend this much money on hair products but I decided to try it since I have been so frustrated with my fine, thin, flat hair lately. What a mistake. The first night I tried it, I used all of the products including the leave in conditioner. That was the biggest problem. It made my hair oily and flat, so oily it looked like I hadn&#x27;t bathed in days. I ended up having to rewash my hair. So, I put that away in the bottom of one of my drawers and tried to forget about it, it was free with the set after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued using the shampoo and conditioner, not overly pleased with it but I bought it so why not use it. After about a week of use, I started to get really bad dandruff and itchiness which I have NEVER had a problem with in the past. Then I started noticing that I was having to wash my hair almost every day to keep it from looking so greasy, when I had previously only had to wash it with shampoo maybe twice a week. This product claims to make your hair shiny, which I think what the greasiness was coming from. It seemed to make my hair more flat than volumized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I switched to Bumble and Bumble and have been extremely happy with their thickening shampoo and conditioner, apart from the price...</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell of the product&lt;br /&gt;it did not leave my hair soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;liked the for color treated hair product more</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is baby fine and flat.  When I was coloring my hair, I used [[ASIN:B000R8WOT0 Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo 16 oz (475 ml)]] and [[ASIN:B0030GFXM6 Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner, 8-fluid ounces Bottle]] and was pleased with the product line.  So, when I received the Full Volume Shampoo and Conditioner through Bzz Agent, I was super excited.  However, I felt it left my hair more flat than any other volumizing product I&#x27;ve used in the past...and I&#x27;ve tried them all! On the positive side, my hair does feel very healthy and it looks shiny.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times with different styling products and tools, but it still leaves my hair super flat.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite shampoos ever!  The smell is amazing, and lingers throughout the day.  It adds volume to my fine hair, without drying it out.  I get the most compliments when I use this fabulous shampoo!  A must try!</li>
            <li> I got to try Fekkai volume shampoo and conditioner through Bzz Agent and I am so happy because I am in love with this product. I can&#x27;t stop feeling my hair. lol Seriously though, it is worth every penny. I highly reccommend!!!!! A++++++++</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I am using for the last year or more, and the only one that does what it says: gives you volume.  My hair is very thin and flat.  I have tried almost every brand, until I got to this one.  Now I have been back to other products -at the gym, while traveling, when trying to save a buck- and I can tell the difference with just one wash. I never thought I would be able to tell the difference by just switching shampoos.  Several people have asked me what I&#x27;ve been using. My hair looks thicker and healthier too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps give my hair weightless volume and cleans beautifully.  It is non drying and smells wonderful.  I&#x27;m sure it will be one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product and excellent supplier as well!  Superior product for fine hair and smells absolutely heavenly! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great price!  At the time, price was $7 less than grocery store.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money. This left my hair flat, dull and dry. These results were clearly visible on my hair after three uses.</li>
            <li> Good product wife is happy</li>
            <li> Used this before and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I first learned of Fekkai hair products when someone gave me a sample pack.  I used it on a trip and was very surprised at how well my hair did using this product.  I have very fine hair and have used many other products designed to add volume, but nothing worked as well as this product.  Also, my hair has some curl, and I live at the beach so my hair has a tendency to frizz because of the humidity.  This product protects against frizz as well as giving my hair a lot more volume.  Even my hair dresser noticed the difference.  She was so impressed with what it has done for my hair she is interested in selling the product in her salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fekkai volume products for many years. Since I bought in bulk, I only recently replenished my supply, and was dismayed at the change in the products since my last purchase. The conditioner is watery, and the shampoo is greasy (like a cheap motel 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner!). My first hint that something was up with the shampoo was the day-glo yellow colour, and the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse properly. It made my hair greasy-looking and flat; I will not buy these products again--what a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Seemed to give a little more volume to my hair.  Will continueto use and judge the results.  Lot for the money.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, does what it says it will do...give you full volume</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> Got it quick and so happy to get this product since Fekkai has apparently stopped making this actual volumizing shampoo</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT SHAMPOO...LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT GREAT PRODUCT FOR FINE HAIR.  I HAVE USED FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT NOW ORDER SO I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO GO OUT IN THE HEAT AND LOOK FOR PLACES TO PARK...........THIS IS GREAT PRODUCT..........</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and had been curious about this shampoo for years after reading good reviews on it.  After recently having a baby and experiencing postpartum hair loss, I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but honestly after two days of use, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really any better than the Tresemme shampoo I had been using.  It seems OK, but today I felt like my hair was full of static and not really all that manageable.  I will probably experiment with it another few days, but overall, I think I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li> I could have bought the whole kit &amp;#34;Full Size&amp;#34; at Costco&#x27;s....for almost the same price. I was disappointed to find out it was sold there.</li>
