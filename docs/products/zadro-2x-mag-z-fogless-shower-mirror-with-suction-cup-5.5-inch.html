    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome saving in the shower.</li>
            <li>Still is a great product!</li>
            <li>Good Mirror, but does fog in the shower!</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The good points:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>The good: Looks neat, good size on it, suction cups work as intended, no shower fog</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s good after that.</li>
            <li>arrived in good time and is ok, still fogs up</li>
            <li>This is a nice size mirror for men to shavie in the shower.</li>
            <li>The size is nice.</li>
            <li>Best to replace with real glass that is shatterproof.</li>
            <li>Could have been a lot more sturdy , thank you anyway</li>
            <li>it also has spots that you cannot clean.  </li>
            <li>the four suction cups on each corner are also effective, but as with any mirror it will eventually lose its adhesion and slip off, but just re-stick to the shower wall and your good for another few weeks.</li>
            <li>Fairly durable, at least in my experience, which is a good thing, because...</li>
            <li>Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a second one for travel.</li>
            <li>however this one is not bad, but i keep a mini-squeegee in there anyway.  </li>
            <li>It tends to get a soapy film on it as the magnification layer peels off rather quickly</li>
            <li>My husband loves this mirror, no hassles with mounting or fogging, and it is just the right size.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to get this to stick to anything, despite the four legs on the back.</li>
            <li>The frame, however, was pretty durable plastic, as it never did break or crack through repeated crashes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It fell from the shower wall and broke the first day.</li>
            <li>falling and hope to get something a little more secure</li>
            <li>It is simple and functional, but the face is made of plastic and scratches easily if you run a loufa over it and</li>
            <li>had mine for at least eight years, so in some ways, you could say I did get pretty good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Size is large enough&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li>well if you are VERY close to the mirror, otherwise its like a fun-house distortion thing going on &#x3D; not</li>
            <li>so very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone really.</li>
            <li>Absolutely will not stay attached to the wall.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it if they had just left it a regular mirror I think.</li>
            <li>I stuck this to nearly new subway tiles and it fell within the first week and broke.  </li>
            <li>Better than other shower mirrors I have purchased&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, this mirror works fine - but eventually water/steam gets between the glass and its reflective backing - and inevitably you will have a black \\&quot;ring\\&quot; around the perimeter of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is clear and inconspicuous in the shower.</li>
            <li>You have to wipe it off or pour water on it to clear it up.</li>
            <li>Clear view&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I would of given it 5 stars but if you are someone that like steam showers you would have to pour water on it to clear of the steam</li>
            <li>The only chance if it sticking on your shower wall is if you have some convex surface to stick it on.</li>
            <li>The information was clear on not sticking to natural stone tile.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an old mirror.</li>
            <li>Not small like so many other so-called fog less mirrors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then you can barely see in the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The mirror is just fine, but the suction cups on the reverse side are so small and sunken in that they can&#x27;t grab a flat wall.</li>
            <li>and I definitely have had enough of being ripped awake at 3 a.m, by a loud crash that sounds like someone is breaking through the front door.</li>
            <li>If you take a typical hot shower, which you&#x27;d want to to produce sufficient steam to shave properly, it tends to, you got it, fog up.</li>
            <li>first mirror has started turning black where the backing is peeling away!  </li>

            <li> As everyone know, the suction cups do not hold for long.</li>

            <li> this product is terrible, I had purchased 2 just a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a mirror, how bad can it be?</li>
            <li> The plastic reflective piece is dumb and comes off the base because the glue is horrible.</li>

            <li> arrived in good time and is ok, still fogs up</li>
            <li> Good Mirror, but does fog in the shower!</li>
            <li> The mirror is just fine, but the suction cups on the reverse side are so small and sunken in that they can&#x27;t grab a flat wall. The only chance if it sticking on your shower wall is if you have some convex surface to stick it on.</li>
            <li> people, there IS NO such thing as a fogless shower mirror.  however this one is not bad, but i keep a mini-squeegee in there anyway.  the four suction cups on each corner are also effective, but as with any mirror it will eventually lose its adhesion and slip off, but just re-stick to the shower wall and your good for another few weeks.</li>
            <li> Suction cups on back are to small.</li>
            <li> Often falls of the wall as suckers are not suckie enough. It&#x27;s awesome saving in the shower. I&#x27;ll never go back. After about a month, the screen started to fog. Even after I cleaned it.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is a little smaller, along with the suction cups on back.  The information was clear on not sticking to natural stone tile.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an old mirror. The mirror is clear and inconspicuous in the shower. I am quite happy with the product. The suction cups could be a bit larger helping to keep it on the wall.</li>
            <li> Mirror is for shower, but allowed water to seep in behind mirror surface thereby diminishing reflective quality.  This occured within just a few days.  Don&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> This is indeed shatter proof! As everyone know, the suction cups do not hold for long. Still is a great product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice size mirror for men to shavie in the shower. Helps save time in the am. Sticks well to wall and stays there. Only downside is there is not spot for the razor!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I paid for it. Smaller than expected and magnification not 2x as stated. Not as expected.</li>
            <li> this product is terrible, I had purchased 2 just a few months ago.  first mirror has started turning black where the backing is peeling away!  it also has spots that you cannot clean.  even using the cleaning cloth that is provided with the mirror.  I have left the 2nd mirror in its package leaving it in storage.  I would not suggest this product to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> The frame depth on the rear of the mirror does not allow the suction cups to attach to the sower wall.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to get this to stick to anything, despite the four legs on the back. It simply falls off every time.</li>
            <li> Falls apart within 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I owned this mirror for several years. The good points:&lt;br /&gt;1. The size is nice. Not small like so many other so-called fog less mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;2. Fairly durable, at least in my experience, which is a good thing, because...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;1. The suction cups were constantly failing and the mirror would crash into the tub. This seemed to happen every couple of months. In fact, I&#x27;m replacing it because I&#x27;ve had enough of it falling and hope to get something a little more secure and I definitely have had enough of being ripped awake at 3 a.m, by a loud crash that sounds like someone is breaking through the front door. The frame, however, was pretty durable plastic, as it never did break or crack through repeated crashes.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s only marginally fogless. If you take a typical hot shower, which you&#x27;d want to to produce sufficient steam to shave properly, it tends to, you got it, fog up. You have to wipe it off or pour water on it to clear it up. Not so bad if you have a hose-type shower head, but pretty difficult with a fixed head.  It tends to get a soapy film on it as the magnification layer peels off rather quickly and then you can barely see in the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mine for at least eight years, so in some ways, you could say I did get pretty good value for the money. Nevertheless, I would probably not buy another one.</li>
            <li> My shower has ceramic tile. Suction cups will not hold. Mirror stays fogged up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This mirror is not fogless and the dimensions claimed are not correct. The actual mirror measurements are H6.375 x W5.25 x D0.5.</li>
            <li> At first, this mirror works fine - but eventually water/steam gets between the glass and its reflective backing - and inevitably you will have a black \\&quot;ring\\&quot; around the perimeter of the mirror.  It&#x27;s unsightly.  Also, the adhesion of the suction cups on my fiberglass shower stall began to fail within just a couple of months of use.  It would be helpful if the makers of shower mirrors would include a few extra suction cups.</li>
            <li> Really like this mirror.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Clear view&lt;br /&gt;2) Does not fog up&lt;br /&gt;3) Size is large enough&lt;br /&gt;4) Fell from the wall one time.  Small dent, but did not break&lt;br /&gt;5) Better than other shower mirrors I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;6) Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a second one for travel.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this mirror, no hassles with mounting or fogging, and it is just the right size.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The good: Looks neat, good size on it, suction cups work as intended, no shower fog&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The X2 magnification effect only works well if you are VERY close to the mirror, otherwise its like a fun-house distortion thing going on &#x3D; not so very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone really. I would have liked it if they had just left it a regular mirror I think.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Zadro magnifing shower mirror and in a couple months of use by a household with only two people the reflective surface has disintegrated around all edges. The mirror was 4 feet from the shower head.</li>
            <li> Just received, haven&#x27;t used yet. But it&#x27;s a mirror, how bad can it be? Only as bad as the person using it.  Get that little reflection innuendo in there?</li>
            <li> I stuck this to nearly new subway tiles and it fell within the first week and broke.  Garbage product, into the garbage it goes.</li>
            <li> Was hoping that I could use the 2X magnification so I didn&#x27;t need my reading glasses when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification does not work as well as my reading glasses 1.5 power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cups have already come loose once and I am concerned that the mirror is likely to eventually fall off and break.</li>
            <li> I would of given it 5 stars but if you are someone that like steam showers you would have to pour water on it to clear of the steam then it&#x27;s good after that. It also has a little of a magnifying look and fell to it</li>
            <li> Could have been a lot more sturdy , thank you anyway</li>
            <li> nothing about this product works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a mirror. It&#x27;s a reflective film that still fogs up. The plastic reflective piece is dumb and comes off the base because the glue is horrible. The suction cups don&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> The suction cups that hold the morror to the wall are reseced behind the mirrors frame.  Absolutely will not stay attached to the wall.</li>
            <li> used one month. cups gave up and it fell and broke.</li>
            <li> It is simple and functional, but the face is made of plastic and scratches easily if you run a loufa over it and the fog-less coating is gone.  Best to replace with real glass that is shatterproof.</li>
            <li> It seems that the suction cups were not strong enough to hold the mirror.  It fell from the shower wall and broke the first day.</li>
