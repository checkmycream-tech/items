            <li>I have an Oster Classic 76 clippers and this brush is the perfect size for cleaning the clippers and blades.</li>
            <li>A great brush to clean the parts on electrical things in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li>they are a good, light weight.</li>
            <li>Worked great and was just the right size .</li>
            <li>There are better brushes for cleaning electric razors.</li>
            <li>Softer brushes do better for me.</li>
            <li>I think a toothbrush or a brush you can buy at a hardware store works better.</li>
            <li>so they are sure to get out even the smallest debris from my clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to get another</li>
            <li>Better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This review is requiring me to make more words</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for cleaning all types and sizes of clippers, and is useful as a first step for cleaning of electric razors too.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Better than expected it has a wood handle as opposed to plastic happy</li>
            <li>Sturdy bristles and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>an excellent little brush to clean your clipper and clipper blades.</li>
            <li>The brush is super useful and even more sturdy than I thought it was.</li>
            <li>Put new blades on, bought some nice oil, and got this brush to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>and I usually clean them out with a hair coloring brush.</li>
            <li>While the brush was fine, I didn&#x27;t feel 1 brush was worth the cost</li>
            <li>It cleans super well and the bristles are nice and soft</li>
            <li>quick delivery....</li>
            <li>Great for brushing down wiry hair when clipping.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, like the size, easy to hold on to and really gets into my buzzer.</li>
            <li>This does the job of cleaning electric clippers nicely, and seems like it&#x27;ll last a good long while.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>Works much better than an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is it worth $7?</li>
            <li>Really well constructed brush that keeps your hair clippers clean.</li>
            <li>WAY better than the little puny brush that came with my clippers, and way better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s black and is good for brushing things.</li>
            <li>This is awesome, no more searching for the tiny ones that come with clippers!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as it was listed.</li>
            <li>I definite buy more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna buy another one which I&#x27;ll use on my body, while using my first one for the clippers.</li>
            <li>Good replacement to the small flimsy ones that comes with the hair clipper packages.</li>
            <li>Very handy, better than the long thin handle clipper brushes.</li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job very well.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>What a difference compared to the cheap, tiny brush that came with my clippers!</li>
            <li>The brush is fantastic, even if I only use it once a month.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really screw up a nylon brush for cleaning my hair clippers.</li>
            <li>It is too big to completely clean my electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It is big enough to make quick work of trimmer blades and has nice stiff bristles that do a great job of getting in the small cracks to get out dust and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much bigger, more durable, and higher quality than any other clipper brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the little brush that comes with the clippers.</li>
            <li>After 1.5 years bristles coming out in clumps with normal use.</li>
            <li>This thing really speeds up the cleanup and gets all the little whisker hairs off of my clippers so they stay clean and neat.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package to see this brush, I thought it to be much larger than I had pictured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large and much better than several of the other TINY brushes I purchased or looked at here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This little brush quickly cleans the clipper blades very well.</li>
            <li>No, more like $3-$5... to clean hair off your clippers.</li>
            <li>The larger size and stiff bristles make it way easier to clean my clippers.</li>
            <li>should anything happen to it, however, seeing as how it&#x27;s held up so far I&#x27;m unsure of when that&#x27;ll be necessary.</li>
            <li>Recently overhauled my 10 year old clippers.</li>
            <li>but, hard to say how long it will last but, for the price I would order more.</li>

            <li> Tough to clean off the sink.  </li>
            <li> This was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> This brush was larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to get my buzzer this clear of hair with such little effort.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It seems that eveery pair of clippers I buy comes with this tiny little brush that sorta works.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have been using the same clippers for the past 5-6 years</li>
            <li> Pretty useless, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my Oster clippers they came with a brush that was about an eighth of an inch wide - not useful at all.  </li>
            <li> Lasted about 4 days in the shop before the handle broke in half.</li>
            <li> I use it virtually everyday and don&#x27;t regret anything about it.</li>
            <li> My clippers have been running a little dead lately, decided to give this bad boy a shot, my clippers are running like they are brand new!</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s not much more to say...</li>
            <li> Expected a chintzy, thin brush, this is about a 1/4 inch thick bunch of bristles.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are a bit hard to get into the blades.</li>
            <li> Well, I got tired of it</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t wrong purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> also use this brush to brush hair off my head, neck, and shoulders when cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> This seems worthless to me.</li>

            <li> Does it&#x27;s job very well.  Only issue I have with it is that when you try and &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; off some of the hairs on a white sink.... The handle gets &amp;#34;black smudges&amp;#34; on it.  Tough to clean off the sink.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Really well constructed brush that keeps your hair clippers clean.</li>
            <li> Works great. A little bigger than I was expecting. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Cleaning my clippers is a breeze now. Great little brush.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, no more searching for the tiny ones that come with clippers! This is about the size of a childs toothbrush and works well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for brushing my clippers free of hair! It&#x27;s exactly as it was listed. Would buy again when it eventually wears out.</li>
            <li> Great, quality product.</li>
            <li> This is the best quality clipper brush I have purchased in years, It is made of excellent quality and is very sturdy. My clippers thank you</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was made of wood, good for brushing off hair during fading.</li>

It&#x27;s great for cleaning all types and sizes of clippers, and is useful as a first step for cleaning of electric razors too.

            <li> This was bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s perfect for its intended purpose. Totally happy with this product. Great value for anyone who uses clippers or electric shavers.</li>
            <li> This brush is made well it just has a really big head and the bristles are a bit hard to get into the blades. I think a toothbrush or a brush you can buy at a hardware store works better.</li>
            <li> I have an Oster Classic 76 clippers and this brush is the perfect size for cleaning the clippers and blades.</li>
            <li> The headline speaks for itself. This is the best product available to clean your hair clippers. It is much bigger, more durable, and higher quality than any other clipper brush I&#x27;ve used. The bristles on the brush are very strong and work excellent.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning my trimmers and the bristles don&#x27;t come out like others.  Very well made.</li>
            <li> Arrived as scheduled!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, like the size, easy to hold on to and really gets into my buzzer. I was never able to get my buzzer this clear of hair with such little effort. Beats blowing in it constantly and shooting all kinds of hair everywhere!</li>
            <li> great I like it. they are a good, light weight. and they get into the clippers very good. I definite buy more</li>
            <li> This little brush quickly cleans the clipper blades very well. It&#x27;s much better than the little brush that comes with the clippers. In just a few seconds it cleans all the fur from the clipper blades which helps the process of grooming the cat go just that much easier.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package to see this brush, I thought it to be much larger than I had pictured. That doesn&#x27;t take anything away from its effectiveness. The brush is super useful and even more sturdy than I thought it was. It cleans super well and the bristles are nice and soft so they are sure to get out even the smallest debris from my clippers. I use it virtually everyday and don&#x27;t regret anything about it.

            <li> Cleans my clippers well. Sturdy bristles and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> Perfect ... cleans my electric razor beautifully!</li>
            <li> This brush was larger than I expected.  It is too big to completely clean my electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality though.</li>
            <li> The item was described as a pack of 12. However, the package I received actually only contained 1 brush. While the brush was fine, I didn&#x27;t feel 1 brush was worth the cost so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Get 2. One for people and one for tools.</li>
            <li> Great brush for cleaning my tools to get all the hair off.</li>
            <li> Very handy, better than the long thin handle clipper brushes.</li>
            <li> Worked great and was just the right size .</li>
            <li> What a difference compared to the cheap, tiny brush that came with my clippers! The larger size and stiff bristles make it way easier to clean my clippers. The tiny brush from before couldn&#x27;t do anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this brush to brush hair off my head, neck, and shoulders when cutting my hair. Brushing off those clippings makes it easier to see the progress of my haircut. I&#x27;m gonna buy another one which I&#x27;ll use on my body, while using my first one for the clippers.</li>
            <li> it brushes cut out of clipper job well done. without losing the bristles.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected...great brush.</li>
            <li> Recently overhauled my 10 year old clippers. Put new blades on, bought some nice oil, and got this brush to keep it clean. The brush is fantastic, even if I only use it once a month. Hoping to get another 10 years from my clippers.</li>
            <li> This brush fell apart about a month after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Good quality and it does the job............</li>
            <li> great seller but take a pass on this brush....the bristles fall out in clumps and i don&#x27;t see it lasting a week</li>
            <li> Expected a chintzy, thin brush, this is about a 1/4 inch thick bunch of bristles. Gets the hairs out of the clippers.</li>
            <li> Is it worth $7? No, more like $3-$5... to clean hair off your clippers. Make of wood &amp; comes wrapped in a plastic... Better than a toothbrush. This review is requiring me to make more words but there&#x27;s not much more to say...</li>
            <li> Good brush, lots of bristles.  It&#x27;s black and is good for brushing things.</li>
            <li> awesome - sure beats the pinky-sized brush the clippers came with</li>
            <li> Good replacement to the small flimsy ones that comes with the hair clipper packages.</li>
            <li> Better than expected it has a wood handle as opposed to plastic happy</li>
            <li> quick delivery....great product</li>
            <li> Good cleaning brush. Great for brushing down wiry hair when clipping.</li>
            <li> Great size and works great on my Braun 7 series.  It&#x27;s large and much better than several of the other TINY brushes I purchased or looked at here on Amazon.  It has great bristles and they seem to stay in fairly well even when using on the blade.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 4 days in the shop before the handle broke in half. Also had a couple bristles fall out in that time.</li>
            <li> A great brush to clean the parts on electrical things in the kitchen.  I just wish it were more flexible!</li>
            <li> Good brush. Seems to hold onto the hair particles though.</li>
            <li> fast shipping works awesome.</li>
            <li> After 1.5 years bristles coming out in clumps with normal use. Had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Use this with my Andis T-outliner. It is big enough to make quick work of trimmer blades and has nice stiff bristles that do a great job of getting in the small cracks to get out dust and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a good job of getting hair off your scalp after shaving.</li>
            <li> WAY better than the little puny brush that came with my clippers, and way better than a toothbrush. This does the job of cleaning electric clippers nicely, and seems like it&#x27;ll last a good long while.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really screw up a nylon brush for cleaning my hair clippers. It&#x27;s a great replacement from the one that came with my clipper. So far it&#x27;s great but, hard to say how long it will last but, for the price I would order more.</li>
