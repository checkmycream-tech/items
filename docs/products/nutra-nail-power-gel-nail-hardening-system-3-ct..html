            <li>and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and I followed directions perfectly!</li>
            <li>To the people saying it came out lumpy and bumpy, maybe you need to practice your polishing techniques and your generosity with the product on each nail because if you can CORRECTLY polish your nails, you can use this product and have it be very effective.</li>
            <li>so I thought it must be good.</li>
            <li>they look as good as the others.</li>
            <li>Great product my nails never looked better.</li>
            <li>Would have liked to try the product but will now have to return it.</li>

            <li>and I was pretty happy with it</li>
            <li>I should have done more research.</li>
            <li>So before you buy it do some more research then just what</li>
            <li>So you better make sure you have a sheet of paper at hand when you start applying</li>
            <li>I love my nails now.  </li>

            <li>Love this product, you will too.</li>
            <li>Have used this product  for  years ,so glad to find it</li>
            <li>It works just as strong as acrylic when applied correctly and using more than one coat.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me the best way to remedy the problem, is to take some regular nail polish on a paper towel or cloth and wipe it lightly over the product already applied to your nails and the stickiness goes away immediately</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure to clean the brush between each activator application.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and makes nails strong.</li>

            <li>/&gt;-it smells very much like one of those superglues that can glue your fingers together if you are not careful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was an impulse buy from Rite Aid so I didn&#x27;t have the benefit of reading any reviews before purchasing.  This is just like a DIY gel nails kit minus the fake tips.  It was nigh on impossible to get this stuff to go on smooth without bumps or ridges, and I found that even with three coats on they cracked after just one and a half days.  I&#x27;m not that active a person and certainly wasn&#x27;t doing anything rough enough to warrant them cracking so soon after applying.  All in all a waste of ten bucks.  I won&#x27;t bother with it again.</li>
            <li> Not worth the fuss and muss</li>
            <li> not happy-stuff was totally dried out and unusable  It was a waste of money and I will not be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> I have always had pretty weak nails. I used for last few months Nailtiques Formula 2 and it really made my nails stronger and longer and I was pretty happy with it but then my bottle got empty and I (foolishly) decided to try something else. Nutra Nail hard as wraps had (when I placed my order ) single 5 star review so I thought it must be good. I should have done more research. After I already placed my order I did review search on a drugstore webpage and there star numbers were very different. Two and a half stars from 16 people total. So before you buy it do some more research then just what this webpage offers.&lt;br /&gt;Here are my pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;- it works! It doesn&#x27;t let your nail break that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;- My Nailtiques Formula 2 was in the same price range and had 0.5 fl oz. NutraNail hard as wraps only has 0.17 fl oz. and with just 4 layers 1/3 of the bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t really do anything for the nail itself like other strengthers do. You put a layer on your nail, then add activator layer and between the two of them it hardens and becomes like a milder version of artifical nail.&lt;br /&gt;- You cant remove it with regular polish remover. You have to have artificial nail remover. Which I had to buy thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;- it is very difficult to apply. You have to clean the brush with brush cleanser liquid they give you and that alone is not enough. I kept dipping my brush in it and it didnt cleanse it well enogh, it became very hard and unusable. I had to use another brush and dipped it into cleanser and then rubbed it on the back of my hand to make sure everything comes off. How stupid was that? two minutes later the back of my hand was covered with hard layer I couldnt get off any other way but using metal footscrubber. So you better make sure you have a sheet of paper at hand when you start applying it.&lt;br /&gt;-it smells very much like one of those superglues that can glue your fingers together if you are not careful. In fact I wouldnt be surprised if thats the base of it. This and the fact you have to use fake nail remover to get it off makes me worried what will happen with your nails if you use it long term.&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t apply on evenly. I feel the bumps and ridges on almost every nail.&lt;br /&gt;-some of my nails dried very fast while others were sticky for hours. Tho I did tried to apply the activator as fast as possible. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;- it started chipping pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think Im gonna go back to Formula 2. I want my OWN nail to be healthy and long not just to be under protective shell. And when some people say that indeed Hard as wraps can make your nail grow longer with just few weeks then - of course, if you have a glue or fake nails over your own nails, of course they will grow long but what shape are they in? Ive heard enough cases when people who use fake nails end up with their own nails looking yellow and soft as porridge. No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is with other strenghtners (those that work) your nails will be strong even if you remove strengtner for a week or so. But when you remove hard as wraps in the best case scenario, it stays the same as it was before you put it on (meaning-weak) and in worst case scenario  it will be worse then it was before (artifical nail effect).f you are not careful.

            <li> doesn&#x27;t really strengthen your nails just reinforces them like cement would. My problem with it though is that it doesn&#x27;t stay shiny like someof the other stuff like this. It just dries all dull looking.</li>
            <li> I have very hard nails but they are extremely bumpy and have ridges.  With polish on it was very noticeable.  I had gels for years and stopped a couple of years ago for financial reasons.  Gels totally hid any nail imperfection.  I thought I would try this as an at home gel kit.  It really does work!  I love my nails now.  You do have to make sure to clean the brush between each activator application.    I accidentally put the brush from the activator in the gel bottle and it ruined the whole bottle so I was back at the store buying a new kit.  I also had problems with it not being smooth after the nails dried.  I took an emory board and smoothed the nails with that and it worked perfectly.  Now my nails look totally natural and smooth!  That was my goal.  I only gave it 4 stars because of how bumpy your nail gets after each application.  But I do love this product and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This product truly works as described in the ads!  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to remove and doesn&#x27;t harm natural nails the way that acrylic nails do!  I&#x27;m never without it when I travel - it&#x27;s a quick easy fix for a torn nail to keep your nails looking great anytime!  I highly recommend this product to anyone with Natural Nails![[ASIN:B000EGOFD8 Nutra Nail Power Gel, Nail Hardening System 1 Kit]]</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work well, it is either tacky or it chips. No matter how many times you read the directions, it still isn&#x27;t going to come out right.</li>

            <li> It works just as it&#x27;s supposed to. As long as you can read and follow directions then it will be a  nice and smooth, shiny, hard gel covering your nails. The only downside is the smell so just be in front of an open window.</li>
            <li> I had NO problems with this, I am a nail tech and i wanted to do something new with my nails so i figured why not give this a try. It works just as strong as acrylic when applied correctly and using more than one coat. i was skeptical because the reviews arent good but all the complaints I saw are completely wrong. I was worried because one person claimed the item was so small that after two coats the product was gone, I will have to STRONGLY disagree with that statement, my nails are very long, i did three coats and i still have way more than enough to do this whole process quite a few times again. I dont know how you would manage to run out this product after only two coats. To the people saying it came out lumpy and bumpy, maybe you need to practice your polishing techniques and your generosity with the product on each nail because if you can CORRECTLY polish your nails, you can use this product and have it be very effective. My nails are very shiny, very strong, and look AMAZING, i would definitely recommend this product. Dont let the bad reviews fool you, this product works like a charm, as long as the INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOLLOWED.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and makes nails strong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all like it says peels and cracks don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The product that I received, is a little difficult to use. It is applied in two steps. And the second coats wants to stay sticky . A friend of mine told me the best way to remedy the problem, is to take some regular nail polish on a paper towel or cloth and wipe it lightly over the product already applied to your nails and the stickiness goes away immediately</li>
            <li> Great product my nails never looked better. I had cracks and couldn&#x27;t get my thumb nails to grow out now they look as good as the others. Would recommend the product. Please keep away from children the fumes might be dangerous around them. Love this nail product.</li>
            <li> How easy this product is to use. At first look at the instructions I was a little worried that it was going to be too complicated. It was so easy and looked like a professional manicure. Even my daughter couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. This really helps me with my constant splitting nail that has been splitting since I was a little kid. Love this product, you will too.</li>
            <li> Have used this product  for  years ,so glad to find it</li>
            <li> Product defective.  Seller returned my money.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I knew something was off with the gel, as it was rock solid. Inside the bottle the gel was hardened all the way through. Would have liked to try the product but will now have to return it. Maybe I will buy elsewhere.</li>
