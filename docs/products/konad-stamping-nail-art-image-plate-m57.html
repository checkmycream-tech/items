            <li>very nice condition-- works (and looks)great</li>
            <li>The fishnet design is very nice as well</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT concept and it has worked for a couple of my nail polishes wonderfully, however, many of my nail polishes don&#x27;t seem to work with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this stamp and it will make a great addition to your nail stamping collection!</li>
            <li>MANY GREAT DESIGNS have come from this image plate !</li>

            <li>all of them have filled the plate well and it creates an awesome transfer image onto the nail.</li>
            <li>But I am writing this review, just in case someone has questions on whether the plate is good or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nails are medium sized and the images still fit perfectly on my nails.</li>
            <li>beautiful and cute designs.</li>
            <li>Great item I just wish more came in a pack that just one for 5 dollars</li>
            <li>There are so many great combinations with this plate.</li>
            <li>The ones that have worked have been very cute though.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these designs!</li>

            <li>I love this plate!</li>
            <li>The cheetah and zebra designs are my favorite!</li>
            <li>This is a very quick, &amp; easy way out of $30.00 at a salon, or ripping your hair out because you can&#x27;t get the design perfectly done with the stripers.</li>
            <li>Great designs, easy process</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, amazing service.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and work amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought the KONAD nail stamper kit B with these as a n addition, the designs are great for funky french designs, practice makes perfect though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 and to be honest, esp.</li>
            <li>This was my first plate ever, and one by one, i&#x27;ve been throwing my money away to get more plates :D</li>
            <li>The item is brand new and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I Love this plate, The designs apply really nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li>i love love love this!</li>
            <li>Product arrived shortly after the purchase, well packaged, in great conditions and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipment, great item, and I would buy again from this Store.</li>
            <li>the konad stamper and plate are a great and easy way to create cool nail art.</li>
            <li>the designs are crisp and come out great every time.</li>
            <li>love the plate.</li>
            <li>it looks really cute and</li>
            <li>This template works just as promised I will use this on many projects,I love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why, everytime I try to use it more paint stays on the plate then transfers to the stamp.</li>
            <li>The designs are all etched perfectly, however I did have some difficulty with the two french tip designs transferring onto my stamp.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner though, so it may be that I just need more</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails and being creative.</li>
            <li>I find myself using this plate more than most of the others I have.</li>
            <li>but once she did they came out truly stunning.</li>
            <li>There are so many ways that you can use just this one plate, so many color options.  </li>
            <li>My girls LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>, I love this item.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have. :)</li>
            <li>M57 is the Konad plate I use most often.</li>
            <li>I love my plate</li>
            <li>I love the zebra</li>
            <li>and she says \\&quot;The Image Plate is great and very stylish\\</li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  </li>
            <li>i love this plate.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Even though brands like bundle monster offer a giant pack of plates for like $20, I have heard that they aren&#x27;t as good of quality as Konad and some of the designs aren&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments with this set of designs, I just ordered 6 more plates</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I seem to get the most compliments with this design...  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the zebra print and the zig-zaggy</li>
            <li>, what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>Such a money saver and a great look!</li>
            <li>and I love the patterns on this plate.</li>
            <li>This is another one of Konad top favorite plates.</li>
            <li>and I just love my nails with this design</li>
            <li>This plate has some really cute designs on them.</li>
            <li>After a couple times of practicing with it, I started to fall in love.</li>
            <li>The designs are really cute.</li>
            <li>Glad I got this.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of these.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This worked like magic.</li>
            <li>Cute for teens though.</li>
            <li>Love the designs</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Maybe Im getting more of these.</li>
            <li>This plate is so cute</li>
            <li>you like to do your own nails, and you can tolerate the clean up...  </li>
            <li>I love these designs they are so cute and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I think its neat because I can change my nail colors more often than what I could in the salon, and the whole reason I liked going to the salon was because I liked nail art, now I can do it myself as often as I like</li>
            <li>This works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Fun too use too!!</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve seen many videos and reviews out there saying how easy it is</li>
            <li>for the product itself i love these designs and the are soo easy to apply it</li>
            <li>I love this, it makes doing my own nails so much fun and so easy.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>This product i love i would buy more if you want more designs its easy to use and fun to do</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; easy to clean!</li>
            <li>they look so cool!</li>
            <li>I was able to get great designs on the first try without much effort.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; a must have for your konad system.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the special polish-</li>
            <li>I love this plate, specially the zebra and leopard designs.  </li>
            <li>While this is the most popular Konad plate because of the great designs, I found that the images were just too small for thumbs or longer nails.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and authentic konad too!</li>
            <li>With a little skill, the images come out perfectly.</li>
            <li>Large designs that are always cute, you&#x27;re sure to get compliments every time.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the leopard image.  </li>
            <li>I bought the cheap as seen on tv set as well</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to save money on manicures by doing their own.</li>
            <li>but i really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>The detail is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I think it works great if you practice enough.</li>
            <li>The pictures for this product made it look super easy to use.</li>
            <li>LoL. Anyways...I am looking forward to buying more discs, &amp; I will include a picture of my blue and white cheetah nails that I did with this (AMAZING) disc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was soooo excited to receive this plate in the mail.</li>
            <li>Okay, this is my first Nail Stamping item that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Love this device, it takes some practice to get the hang of it, just keep trying and watch a you tube video on how to use it if its your first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun to tell them I did it myself!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and fun way to get a unique nail design.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my 5 year old&#x27;s nails when she wants cheetah print.</li>
            <li>this plate was my favorite to use and was used often and more frequently than others I used to have.</li>
            <li>When I first received the plate and initially used it, I thought it wasn&#x27;t too great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset with this product and probably would have been better off throwing the $6 in the garbage.</li>
            <li>SO cool if you haven&#x27;t done nail stamping before.</li>
            <li>I love this plate so much</li>
            <li>I used O.P.I nail polish and it worked really well together :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t be able to transfer the flowers  and one of the first band to the right that is why the 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I have other plates that work great, but because of the engravment these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I received it really quickly, way before the date it said I would.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy trying this out as it was my first time.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the product, &amp; the seller.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend buying the black and white Konad special polishes, as these are the best and make the image pop on your nail.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to get a really clean clear stamp off of it</li>
            <li>with this nail stamper it makes it super easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>The zebra print pretty much fits on my largest finger (which is my thumb) and is super cute.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect it to work the first time!</li>
            <li>the black nail polish, the stamper, and the scrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an amazon junkie, but when I saw a good deal + free shipping on ebay, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>if you have large nail sizes, then you might want to get the cheeky plates instead because these designs won&#x27;t fit (happened to my friend, just letting you know)</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because my teenage daughter loves to do her own nails and wanted to try this.  </li>
            <li>I recommend going to wowsocool.com and check out the \\&quot;image plates\\&quot; section to get a better look at all the plates that Konad offers.</li>
            <li>This image plate is so fun.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to be creative with my natural nails.</li>
            <li>This is a fun llittle tool!&lt;br</li>
            <li>this by far is my favorite plate i use alot.</li>
            <li>My daughter and her friends (me too) had fun using this plate to make our nails zebra striped.  </li>
            <li>They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  </li>
            <li>I own other Konad stamping plates and they work great with my other polishes(not</li>
            <li>swipping on the plate, swipe away from you, preferably to the right.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite get the right amount of nail polish on the metal plate to scrap up on the stamper.</li>
            <li>This is a cute plate, which can yield several fun designs.</li>
            <li>The Leopard and Zebra print designs are so versatile and depending on your color choices can really make your nails POP or give them a super chic textured look.</li>
            <li>They will fit my nails better than the smaller images on the older plates.</li>
            <li>but I have just bought it and not had very much practice.</li>
            <li>This is the most clever idea that I&#x27;ve seen in a while as far as do it yourself</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t really think this was going to be worth getting</li>
            <li>Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  </li>
            <li>This is my first Konad plate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather get a better quality product and pick and choose designs that I&#x27;ll actually use.   </li>
            <li>it is this exact product.</li>
            <li>The plate is in mint condition too when it arrives ;)</li>
            <li>There are so many combos and different ways to do your nails with just one plate.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>With this plate you can create so many different designs.</li>
            <li>the patterns come out CRISP each time....</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>I love all the different ways you can use it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes a few trials for the good nail polishes to take the pattern on the stamp.</li>
            <li>ive tried to stamp with other nail polish with mixed results, but nothing is as good as the special polish.</li>
            <li>Nice design though, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun design on your nail.     </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty inconsistent with me, so I only use it when I have a LOT of free time.</li>
            <li>i love every single image on this plate.</li>
            <li>My only tip for you would be to use the special Konad nail polish, because it picks up 1000000x better than regular polish, although people use China Glaze.  </li>
            <li>shipping was fast and painless price is very decent</li>
            <li>I did like the effect though, I have used those that cover the whole nail and the flower,</li>
            <li>but now she absolutely loves it and uses it every time she polishes her nails.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used any of the others yet.  </li>
            <li>I see some people saying that they don&#x27;t work, which I absolutely DON&#x27;T understand..........</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then paying for a pedicure.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m gonna buy one for my sister too because she always wants to use mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also time-consuming so you really need to settle in when getting ready to do your nails.</li>
            <li>the other 2 require a lot more precision that I have.</li>
            <li>After reading numerous reviews on nail art stamping, I decided to go with the original Konad brand.</li>
            <li>The stencils are deep enough to make a suitable design on the nail.</li>
            <li>so much so that im glad it doesnt ware down.</li>
            <li>I think Konad should have a pedicure line full of discs with bigger designs on them made for toes.</li>
            <li>(thumb in particular</li>
            <li>and with this particular plate it just wouln&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to order more of these in the future!</li>
            <li>i tried this as soon as my stamper and scraper came in the mail, which i didnt know i needed one!, and it just goes on so easily, no special nail polish needed, although some work better than others.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as easy to wear as the other two.</li>
            <li>For less than $20, the Monster Bundle came with a buttload of plates and is SUCH a better deal!</li>
            <li>its the best i reccomed this 2 any body who ever said it was bad they lost there bannanas</li>
            <li>The plates aren&#x27;t engraved very well that it doesn&#x27;t allow the stamp to pick up the design after you clear off excess polish.</li>
            <li>Fun basic plate that transfers well to the stamping tool and nail.  </li>
            <li>In reality I am finding it takes more than a few practices.</li>
            <li>Also if your new at this</li>
            <li>As soon as this item came in the mail my daughter tested it out with her new Konad Stamping kit</li>
            <li>I own this plate and find that the only design I have trouble with is the zebra print.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a Wet and Wild polish which makes all the differenence between the Konad polishes and cheap polishes.</li>
            <li>I bought this to compare it to the one in my MASH set and they are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Their nails look like they were professionally created!</li>
            <li>After much research on the internet and my own testing, the verdict is: Yes, BUT only heavy, metallic polishes work well with it, such as China Glaze metallics.  </li>
            <li>I had the original Konad kit, and it had just a few of the older plates in the kit.</li>
            <li>with a three year old daughter and working full time, a simple solid color works for me now.</li>
            <li>the stamping plate came securely packaged and was received earlier than was expected.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment much, since I&#x27;m a disaster with makeup (and haven&#x27;t tried these), but I know she uses them constantly on herself, and professionally.</li>
            <li>but the print does come out on the rubber stamp really clearly.</li>
            <li>Now my 12 year old is using it and has no problem with it at all.  </li>
            <li>guess it&#x27;s not a waste if it makes me happy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This image plate is what I was looking for and the seller got it to me early as well.</li>
            <li>She used Kiss white and black nail polish for her design and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomend these especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to do, Once done properly (which is 2nd nature when u play around with it enough)</li>
            <li>, I think they could be a little wider and its hard to do on a color wheel (the plastic wheel of nails that people use as swatches in salons) unless you have the double sided stamp and use the small stamper (which works great on like an accent design like a flower or a star but not so well on a full nail design.)</li>
            <li>I have a hard time fitting the pattern on larger nails like thumbs and big toes.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, the prints would have looked great, but no matter what....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of time consuming and tedious because you have to wipe everything off between each nail.</li>
            <li>I was mad at first, cos images won&#x27;t transfer well and so many errors which turned out to be my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do the same exact thing for far less of a price!</li>
            <li>I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of animal designs and pretty lace options too.</li>
            <li>I only give this plate four stars though because I don&#x27;t really use the other designs</li>
            <li>But I have found other brands that are much cheaper and make similar image plates.</li>
            <li>The plate, specifically M57, helped turn a simple manicure into a complex, artistic look with no talents necessary.</li>
            <li>I used to go to the salon every 2 weeks where I got acrylic nails and an airbrush design, I gave that up a little over a year ago, I really missed the nail art</li>
            <li>/&gt;Takes a few tries, placement is the key &amp; can be tricky at first!</li>

            <li> very nice condition-- works (and looks)great</li>
            <li> The fishnet design is very nice as well</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT concept and it has worked for a couple of my nail polishes wonderfully, however, many of my nail polishes don&#x27;t seem to work with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this stamp and it will make a great addition to your nail stamping collection!</li>
            <li> MANY GREAT DESIGNS have come from this image plate !</li>

            <li> Buff the stamper lightly and any polish will work perfectly!</li>
            <li> all of them have filled the plate well and it creates an awesome transfer image onto the nail.</li>
            <li> But I am writing this review, just in case someone has questions on whether the plate is good or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nails are medium sized and the images still fit perfectly on my nails.</li>
            <li> beautiful and cute designs.</li>
            <li> Great item I just wish more came in a pack that just one for 5 dollars</li>
            <li> There are so many great combinations with this plate.</li>
            <li> The ones that have worked have been very cute though.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these designs!</li>

            <li> I love this plate!</li>
            <li> The cheetah and zebra designs are my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is a very quick, &amp; easy way out of $30.00 at a salon, or ripping your hair out because you can&#x27;t get the design perfectly done with the stripers.</li>
            <li> Great designs, easy process</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, amazing service.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and work amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the KONAD nail stamper kit B with these as a n addition, the designs are great for funky french designs, practice makes perfect though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and to be honest, esp.</li>
            <li> This was my first plate ever, and one by one, i&#x27;ve been throwing my money away to get more plates :D</li>
            <li> The item is brand new and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I Love this plate, The designs apply really nice</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> i love love love this!</li>
            <li> Product arrived shortly after the purchase, well packaged, in great conditions and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipment, great item, and I would buy again from this Store.</li>
            <li> the konad stamper and plate are a great and easy way to create cool nail art.</li>
            <li> the designs are crisp and come out great every time.</li>
            <li> love the plate.</li>
            <li> it looks really cute and</li>
            <li> This template works just as promised I will use this on many projects,I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why, everytime I try to use it more paint stays on the plate then transfers to the stamp.</li>
            <li> The designs are all etched perfectly, however I did have some difficulty with the two french tip designs transferring onto my stamp.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner though, so it may be that I just need more</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails and being creative.</li>
            <li> I find myself using this plate more than most of the others I have.</li>
            <li> but once she did they came out truly stunning.</li>
            <li> There are so many ways that you can use just this one plate, so many color options.  </li>
            <li> My girls LOVE them.  </li>
            <li> , I love this item.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have. :)</li>
            <li> M57 is the Konad plate I use most often.</li>
            <li> I love my plate</li>
            <li> I love the zebra</li>
            <li> and she says \\&quot;The Image Plate is great and very stylish\\</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  </li>
            <li> i love this plate.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Even though brands like bundle monster offer a giant pack of plates for like $20, I have heard that they aren&#x27;t as good of quality as Konad and some of the designs aren&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments with this set of designs, I just ordered 6 more plates</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I seem to get the most compliments with this design...  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the zebra print and the zig-zaggy</li>
            <li> , what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> Such a money saver and a great look!</li>
            <li> and I love the patterns on this plate.</li>
            <li> This is another one of Konad top favorite plates.</li>
            <li> and I just love my nails with this design</li>
            <li> This plate has some really cute designs on them.</li>
            <li> After a couple times of practicing with it, I started to fall in love.</li>
            <li> The designs are really cute.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This worked like magic.</li>
            <li> Cute for teens though.</li>
            <li> Love the designs</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Maybe Im getting more of these.</li>
            <li> This plate is so cute</li>
            <li> you like to do your own nails, and you can tolerate the clean up...  </li>
            <li> I love these designs they are so cute and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I think its neat because I can change my nail colors more often than what I could in the salon, and the whole reason I liked going to the salon was because I liked nail art, now I can do it myself as often as I like</li>
            <li> This works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Fun too use too!!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve seen many videos and reviews out there saying how easy it is</li>
            <li> for the product itself i love these designs and the are soo easy to apply it</li>
            <li> I love this, it makes doing my own nails so much fun and so easy.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> This product i love i would buy more if you want more designs its easy to use and fun to do</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; easy to clean!</li>
            <li> they look so cool!</li>
            <li> I was able to get great designs on the first try without much effort.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; a must have for your konad system.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get the special polish-</li>
            <li> I love this plate, specially the zebra and leopard designs.  </li>
            <li> While this is the most popular Konad plate because of the great designs, I found that the images were just too small for thumbs or longer nails.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and authentic konad too!</li>
            <li> With a little skill, the images come out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Large designs that are always cute, you&#x27;re sure to get compliments every time.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the leopard image.  </li>
            <li> I bought the cheap as seen on tv set as well</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to save money on manicures by doing their own.</li>
            <li> but i really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> The detail is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I think it works great if you practice enough.</li>
            <li> The pictures for this product made it look super easy to use.</li>
            <li> LoL. Anyways...I am looking forward to buying more discs, &amp; I will include a picture of my blue and white cheetah nails that I did with this (AMAZING) disc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to receive this plate in the mail.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is my first Nail Stamping item that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Love this device, it takes some practice to get the hang of it, just keep trying and watch a you tube video on how to use it if its your first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun to tell them I did it myself!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and fun way to get a unique nail design.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my 5 year old&#x27;s nails when she wants cheetah print.</li>
            <li> this plate was my favorite to use and was used often and more frequently than others I used to have.</li>
            <li> When I first received the plate and initially used it, I thought it wasn&#x27;t too great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset with this product and probably would have been better off throwing the $6 in the garbage.</li>
            <li> SO cool if you haven&#x27;t done nail stamping before.</li>
            <li> I love this plate so much</li>
            <li> I used O.P.I nail polish and it worked really well together :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t be able to transfer the flowers  and one of the first band to the right that is why the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have other plates that work great, but because of the engravment these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I received it really quickly, way before the date it said I would.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy trying this out as it was my first time.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the product, &amp; the seller.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend buying the black and white Konad special polishes, as these are the best and make the image pop on your nail.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to get a really clean clear stamp off of it</li>
            <li> with this nail stamper it makes it super easy and fast.  </li>
            <li> The zebra print pretty much fits on my largest finger (which is my thumb) and is super cute.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to work the first time!</li>
            <li> the black nail polish, the stamper, and the scrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an amazon junkie, but when I saw a good deal + free shipping on ebay, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> if you have large nail sizes, then you might want to get the cheeky plates instead because these designs won&#x27;t fit (happened to my friend, just letting you know)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because my teenage daughter loves to do her own nails and wanted to try this.  </li>
            <li> I recommend going to wowsocool.com and check out the \\&quot;image plates\\&quot; section to get a better look at all the plates that Konad offers.</li>
            <li> This image plate is so fun.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to be creative with my natural nails.</li>
            <li> This is a fun llittle tool!&lt;br</li>
            <li> this by far is my favorite plate i use alot.</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends (me too) had fun using this plate to make our nails zebra striped.  </li>
            <li> They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  </li>
            <li> I own other Konad stamping plates and they work great with my other polishes(not</li>
            <li> swipping on the plate, swipe away from you, preferably to the right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite get the right amount of nail polish on the metal plate to scrap up on the stamper.</li>
            <li> This is a cute plate, which can yield several fun designs.</li>
            <li> The Leopard and Zebra print designs are so versatile and depending on your color choices can really make your nails POP or give them a super chic textured look.</li>
            <li> They will fit my nails better than the smaller images on the older plates.</li>
            <li> but I have just bought it and not had very much practice.</li>
            <li> This is the most clever idea that I&#x27;ve seen in a while as far as do it yourself</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really think this was going to be worth getting</li>
            <li> Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  </li>
            <li> This is my first Konad plate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather get a better quality product and pick and choose designs that I&#x27;ll actually use.   </li>
            <li> it is this exact product.</li>
            <li> The plate is in mint condition too when it arrives ;)</li>
            <li> There are so many combos and different ways to do your nails with just one plate.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> With this plate you can create so many different designs.</li>
            <li> the patterns come out CRISP each time....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> I love all the different ways you can use it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a few trials for the good nail polishes to take the pattern on the stamp.</li>
            <li> ive tried to stamp with other nail polish with mixed results, but nothing is as good as the special polish.</li>
            <li> Nice design though, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun design on your nail.     </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty inconsistent with me, so I only use it when I have a LOT of free time.</li>
            <li> i love every single image on this plate.</li>
            <li> My only tip for you would be to use the special Konad nail polish, because it picks up 1000000x better than regular polish, although people use China Glaze.  </li>
            <li> shipping was fast and painless price is very decent</li>
            <li> I did like the effect though, I have used those that cover the whole nail and the flower,</li>
            <li> but now she absolutely loves it and uses it every time she polishes her nails.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used any of the others yet.  </li>
            <li> I see some people saying that they don&#x27;t work, which I absolutely DON&#x27;T understand..........</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then paying for a pedicure.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m gonna buy one for my sister too because she always wants to use mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also time-consuming so you really need to settle in when getting ready to do your nails.</li>
            <li> the other 2 require a lot more precision that I have.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews on nail art stamping, I decided to go with the original Konad brand.</li>
            <li> The stencils are deep enough to make a suitable design on the nail.</li>
            <li> so much so that im glad it doesnt ware down.</li>
            <li> I think Konad should have a pedicure line full of discs with bigger designs on them made for toes.</li>
            <li> (thumb in particular</li>
            <li> and with this particular plate it just wouln&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to order more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> i tried this as soon as my stamper and scraper came in the mail, which i didnt know i needed one!, and it just goes on so easily, no special nail polish needed, although some work better than others.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as easy to wear as the other two.</li>
            <li> For less than $20, the Monster Bundle came with a buttload of plates and is SUCH a better deal!</li>
            <li> its the best i reccomed this 2 any body who ever said it was bad they lost there bannanas</li>
            <li> The plates aren&#x27;t engraved very well that it doesn&#x27;t allow the stamp to pick up the design after you clear off excess polish.</li>
            <li> Fun basic plate that transfers well to the stamping tool and nail.  </li>
            <li> In reality I am finding it takes more than a few practices.</li>
            <li> Also if your new at this</li>
            <li> As soon as this item came in the mail my daughter tested it out with her new Konad Stamping kit</li>
            <li> I own this plate and find that the only design I have trouble with is the zebra print.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a Wet and Wild polish which makes all the differenence between the Konad polishes and cheap polishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to compare it to the one in my MASH set and they are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Their nails look like they were professionally created!</li>
            <li> After much research on the internet and my own testing, the verdict is: Yes, BUT only heavy, metallic polishes work well with it, such as China Glaze metallics.  </li>
            <li> I had the original Konad kit, and it had just a few of the older plates in the kit.</li>
            <li> with a three year old daughter and working full time, a simple solid color works for me now.</li>
            <li> the stamping plate came securely packaged and was received earlier than was expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment much, since I&#x27;m a disaster with makeup (and haven&#x27;t tried these), but I know she uses them constantly on herself, and professionally.</li>
            <li> but the print does come out on the rubber stamp really clearly.</li>
            <li> Now my 12 year old is using it and has no problem with it at all.  </li>
            <li> guess it&#x27;s not a waste if it makes me happy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This image plate is what I was looking for and the seller got it to me early as well.</li>
            <li> She used Kiss white and black nail polish for her design and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Highly recomend these especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to do, Once done properly (which is 2nd nature when u play around with it enough)</li>
            <li> , I think they could be a little wider and its hard to do on a color wheel (the plastic wheel of nails that people use as swatches in salons) unless you have the double sided stamp and use the small stamper (which works great on like an accent design like a flower or a star but not so well on a full nail design.)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time fitting the pattern on larger nails like thumbs and big toes.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, the prints would have looked great, but no matter what....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of time consuming and tedious because you have to wipe everything off between each nail.</li>
            <li> I was mad at first, cos images won&#x27;t transfer well and so many errors which turned out to be my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do the same exact thing for far less of a price!</li>
            <li> I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of animal designs and pretty lace options too.</li>
            <li> I only give this plate four stars though because I don&#x27;t really use the other designs</li>
            <li> But I have found other brands that are much cheaper and make similar image plates.</li>
            <li> The plate, specifically M57, helped turn a simple manicure into a complex, artistic look with no talents necessary.</li>
            <li> I used to go to the salon every 2 weeks where I got acrylic nails and an airbrush design, I gave that up a little over a year ago, I really missed the nail art</li>
            <li> /&gt;Takes a few tries, placement is the key &amp; can be tricky at first!</li>
            <li> A little later she tried the cheetah design with a no-name brand nail polish and it still worked great, so need need to buy the expensive Konad brand nail polish!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried Konad nail polish, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really stickier then the regular ones.</li>
            <li> While the whole finger stamps are too small for an adults fingernail, the stamps themselves work just as well as Konad.</li>
            <li> I have really slender and small nails, but these images still couldn&#x27;t cover my thumbs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the zebra print with a regular silver nail polish over a grey bottom coat</li>
            <li> but you need to know what you are doing and be careful not to use too little or too much polish.  </li>
            <li> the stamper doesn&#x27;t get the whole impression and this is very messy to use.</li>
            <li> It is kinda hard to use because the patterns are really close together</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product that I had to purchase at least one plate to try it out.</li>
            <li> i have long nails.)</li>
            <li> I just wish that it didn&#x27;t cost so much (especially since other inexpensive/generic plates seem to stamp well).</li>
            <li> but I realized it was due to human error.</li>
            <li> I only have a few complaints, the full nail designs are a little hard to do across your thumb</li>
            <li> The picture is the red and black one.</li>
            <li> Using the zebra pattern, I use a bright pink or silver base and Konad black stamping polish.  </li>
            <li> If I could change one thing, it would be that the plate template should be a little larger.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to apply and my nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> Cute designs, bad plate.</li>
            <li> This will make the design faint but still fun.     </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless.  </li>
            <li> Red base with wet and wild fast dry, and the black is konad black.</li>
            <li> We used a different base kit but they worked together fine.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s a little harder to make it work.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it took over a month for it to come in.  </li>
            <li> Of course it took a few tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> if you paint your nails in rainbow stripes and put the zebra or cheetah stamp in black</li>
            <li> To make the design more suble, use a metallic polish over a base or plain nail.</li>
            <li> All though, I was a little dissapointed when I couldn&#x27;t use it on my toes.</li>
            <li> Konad plates are pricey, though, but I wanted to buy a few to compare to the Monster bundle.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble drawing a circle [like me], you&#x27;ll dig this plate.</li>
            <li> Dont even waste your money because this peice of junk doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy though so have plenty of paper towels at your disposal when in use!  </li>
            <li> When stamping with a polish that isnt thick at all, paint on the plate and wait just about 7-10 seconds which will thicken it because it dried just a little.</li>
            <li> I have a little tip though!</li>
            <li> Another plus, we got the shipment in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> It can be messy but again it takes practice!</li>
            <li> and i have no problem with it although the image may be a bit small for my nails</li>
            <li> I also like a classic zebra look, using a white base and Konad black, or a black base and Konad white!  </li>
            <li> is very hard to mess these ones up</li>
            <li> I had to write a complaint and another got sent.</li>
            <li> Then it would look uneven and I would get annoyed with it.</li>
            <li> but i guess u need a konad polishes, wish i knew this early! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I mean I can use the flowers, but the square designs don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> And this ONE PLATE was half the cost of it!!!</li>
            <li> I just got this image plate today and tried it (wearing a shellac, shimmery green as a base) and I used Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dri Whirlwind White as d stamping polish w/ d leopard print image</li>
            <li> I hate it and will never waste my money on anything like this again</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave the seller 5 stars on their review but my stupid computer decided something different.</li>
            <li> so if I get bored with a color I don&#x27;t have to wait 2 weeks to remove it, I can redo my nails myself.</li>
            <li> well i bought some fake konad, plates here from another brand, and it cost me the lesson, the fake plates do nnot work, konad works 100% all the time.</li>
            <li> a color different from your base and stamping color!  </li>
            <li> they must be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> but I never actually stamped my nails, the polish I bought was terrible and havent bothered to buy anymore</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> one - please see my included photo in which I used a combo of Gelish nail polish colors (for the nail base) and Konad colors (for the image).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a mistake.  The description was misleading.  I had an impression that with the picture shown this order should include this plate phus the stamping &amp; the scraper. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> While the whole finger stamps are too small for an adults fingernail, the stamps themselves work just as well as Konad. Highly recomend these especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I used to go to the salon every 2 weeks where I got acrylic nails and an airbrush design, I gave that up a little over a year ago, I really missed the nail art but now I can do it myself with the Konad plates! I think its neat because I can change my nail colors more often than what I could in the salon, and the whole reason I liked going to the salon was because I liked nail art, now I can do it myself as often as I like so if I get bored with a color I don&#x27;t have to wait 2 weeks to remove it, I can redo my nails myself. I only have a few complaints, the full nail designs are a little hard to do across your thumb, I think they could be a little wider and its hard to do on a color wheel (the plastic wheel of nails that people use as swatches in salons) unless you have the double sided stamp and use the small stamper (which works great on like an accent design like a flower or a star but not so well on a full nail design.) It&#x27;s kind of time consuming and tedious because you have to wipe everything off between each nail. Also if your new at this I recommend starting with a design that doesn&#x27;t cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> I tried using regular nail polish and at times I couldn&#x27;t make it stick to the stamper at all. Although I&#x27;ve seen many videos and reviews out there saying how easy it is, it&#x27;s pretty inconsistent with me, so I only use it when I have a LOT of free time. I did like the effect though, I have used those that cover the whole nail and the flower, the other 2 require a lot more precision that I have. I haven&#x27;t tried Konad nail polish, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really stickier then the regular ones.</li>
            <li> love the plate. if you paint your nails in rainbow stripes and put the zebra or cheetah stamp in black it looks really cute and \\&quot;Lisa Frank\\&quot; inspired. the konad stamper and plate are a great and easy way to create cool nail art. i have gotten tons of compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> This template works just as promised I will use this on many projects,I love it.It will be a great design aide.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because everyone seemed to rave about it. I don&#x27;t see why, everytime I try to use it more paint stays on the plate then transfers to the stamp. I bought the cheap as seen on tv set as well, it works better than this!! And this ONE PLATE was half the cost of it!!! I&#x27;m really upset with this product and probably would have been better off throwing the $6 in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to receive this plate in the mail. The designs are all etched perfectly, however I did have some difficulty with the two french tip designs transferring onto my stamp. I am a beginner though, so it may be that I just need more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this stamp and it will make a great addition to your nail stamping collection!</li>
            <li> This is a cute plate, which can yield several fun designs. I just wish that it didn&#x27;t cost so much (especially since other inexpensive/generic plates seem to stamp well).</li>
            <li> I used this on my manicure as soon as I got it. I tried the zebra print with a regular silver nail polish over a grey bottom coat and I got numerous compliments. I recommend this to anyone who wants to save money on manicures by doing their own. nails.</li>
            <li> the stamping plate came securely packaged and was received earlier than was expected. very nice condition-- works (and looks)great</li>
            <li> The plates aren&#x27;t engraved very well that it doesn&#x27;t allow the stamp to pick up the design after you clear off excess polish. I have other plates that work great, but because of the engravment these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this to compare it to the one in my MASH set and they are exactly the same. I see no use in buying Konad plates when you can get the MASH plates for cheaper but the same quality. Nice design though, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really think this was going to be worth getting but i really enjoy using it. I love painting my nails and being creative. This definitely met my expectations. I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I own this plate and find that the only design I have trouble with is the zebra print. I&#x27;m using a Wet and Wild polish which makes all the differenence between the Konad polishes and cheap polishes. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun design on your nail.     To make the design more suble, use a metallic polish over a base or plain nail. This will make the design faint but still fun.     Absolutely love these designs! I find myself using this plate more than most of the others I have.</li>
            <li> well i bought some fake konad, plates here from another brand, and it cost me the lesson, the fake plates do nnot work, konad works 100% all the time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into buying the Konad polish with this. Any will do. The trick? Buff the stamper lightly and any polish will work perfectly! Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Konad M57 Image Plate! I have not had any problems with it at all. I use it almost on a daily basis weather its for a friend or myself . MANY GREAT DESIGNS have come from this image plate ! Also you DONT have to use the official Konad Nail Polish for it. I found that Art Deco by L.A. colors works just as well.!</li>
            <li> As soon as this item came in the mail my daughter tested it out with her new Konad Stamping kit and she loved it!  Of course it took a few tries to get the hang of it but once she did they came out truly stunning. She used Kiss white and black nail polish for her design and it worked fine.  A little later she tried the cheetah design with a no-name brand nail polish and it still worked great, so need need to buy the expensive Konad brand nail polish!  There are so many ways that you can use just this one plate, so many color options.  Another plus, we got the shipment in just a few days!  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Okay, this is my first Nail Stamping item that I have purchased.  Found these nice plates to work perfectly.  My girls LOVE them.  The detail is fabulous.  If I could change one thing, it would be that the plate template should be a little larger.  I have a hard time fitting the pattern on larger nails like thumbs and big toes.  Other than that, I love this item.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought thinking i can use any nail polish but i guess u need a konad polishes, wish i knew this early! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, amazing service. Product is amazeballs. Stop reading reviews and just buy it already! It&#x27;s a must have. :)</li>
            <li> M57 is the Konad plate I use most often. The Leopard and Zebra print designs are so versatile and depending on your color choices can really make your nails POP or give them a super chic textured look. The fishnet design is very nice as well but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as easy to wear as the other two. I only give this plate four stars though because I don&#x27;t really use the other designs</li>
            <li> Love this device, it takes some practice to get the hang of it, just keep trying and watch a you tube video on how to use it if its your first time. It can be messy but again it takes practice!</li>
            <li> SO cool if you haven&#x27;t done nail stamping before. Konad plates are pricey, though, but I wanted to buy a few to compare to the Monster bundle. For less than $20, the Monster Bundle came with a buttload of plates and is SUCH a better deal! They do the same exact thing for far less of a price!</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; a must have for your konad system. Be sure to get the special polish- ive tried to stamp with other nail polish with mixed results, but nothing is as good as the special polish.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It works great I could never do a print like this by hand but with this nail stamper it makes it super easy and fast.  I would recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> i love every single image on this plate. works well and i have no problem with it although the image may be a bit small for my nails (thumb in particular but that&#x27;s probably cus i have long nails.) other than that no complaints. love it :D</li>
            <li> I ordered the plates and it got here within 2 days:D I love my plate it&#x27;s awesome I love the zebra I use it all the time also the cheetah</li>
            <li> Product arrived shortly after the purchase, well packaged, in great conditions and at a great price. It was a gift for my Fiance and she says \\&quot;The Image Plate is great and very stylish\\&quot; lol</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  Nice price too! :D</li>
            <li> While this is the most popular Konad plate because of the great designs, I found that the images were just too small for thumbs or longer nails. I have really slender and small nails, but these images still couldn&#x27;t cover my thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the detail is good, and the quality of Konad plates are always the best of all stamping sets.</li>
            <li> beautiful and cute designs. very easy to use and look awsome on your nails! fast shipping and work amazing!!!! Definitley recommend this to konad lovers!!!!!</li>
            <li> i love this plate. the designs are crisp and come out great every time. it&#x27;s very pretty and easy to use. although sometimes it doesnt reach the end of my nail</li>
            <li> This stamp plate is essential for anyone who uses Konad or nail stamping. Large designs that are always cute, you&#x27;re sure to get compliments every time. I&#x27;d get this for the zebra and leopard print alone. Love.</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive but it was in the frame given at check out. Great item I just wish more came in a pack that just one for 5 dollars but I wanted the designs but no shipping or tax was great.</li>
            <li> its the best i reccomed this 2 any body who ever said it was bad they lost there bannanas or they are so NOT dope</li>
            <li> This plate is great!  I have used it with multiple colors and brands of polish, all of them have filled the plate well and it creates an awesome transfer image onto the nail.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because my teenage daughter loves to do her own nails and wanted to try this.  It took her a couple times before she finally got the hang of it but now she absolutely loves it and uses it every time she polishes her nails.  Now my 12 year old is using it and has no problem with it at all.  Their nails look like they were professionally created!</li>
            <li> I love this image plate! I am a huge fan of the leopard image.  I haven&#x27;t really used any of the others yet.  I have tried the zebra, but don&#x27;t have the hang of it yet.  For me it&#x27;s a little harder to make it work.  like everything it takes practice!</li>
            <li> This is my first Konad plate and I love it! The designs are cute and the quality is excellent. After reading numerous reviews on nail art stamping, I decided to go with the original Konad brand. Even though brands like bundle monster offer a giant pack of plates for like $20, I have heard that they aren&#x27;t as good of quality as Konad and some of the designs aren&#x27;t all that great. I&#x27;d rather get a better quality product and pick and choose designs that I&#x27;ll actually use.   I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments with this set of designs, I just ordered 6 more plates and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out! I recommend going to wowsocool.com and check out the \\&quot;image plates\\&quot; section to get a better look at all the plates that Konad offers. See which ones you like and then it is easier that way to search for the image plate number on amazon.   If you want to try out nail art stamping, go with KONAD! You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> This image plate is so fun.  The zebra pattern and leopard spots pattern create some awesome manicures that I get complements on and people asking who did my nails!  It&#x27;s so fun to tell them I did it myself!  :)  The possibilities are endless.  I seem to get the most compliments with this design...  Using the zebra pattern, I use a bright pink or silver base and Konad black stamping polish.  I also like a classic zebra look, using a white base and Konad black, or a black base and Konad white!  For the leopard print, try mixing it up and fill in the middle of the spots a color different from your base and stamping color!  Happy stamping!!  :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome and popular plate.  I love the zebra print and the zig-zaggy one - please see my included photo in which I used a combo of Gelish nail polish colors (for the nail base) and Konad colors (for the image).  There is debate on whether you can use \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polish with these plates.  After much research on the internet and my own testing, the verdict is: Yes, BUT only heavy, metallic polishes work well with it, such as China Glaze metallics.  I would strongly recommend buying the black and white Konad special polishes, as these are the best and make the image pop on your nail.</li>
            <li> i love love love this! i tried this as soon as my stamper and scraper came in the mail, which i didnt know i needed one!, and it just goes on so easily, no special nail polish needed, although some work better than others. I have a little tip though! When stamping with a polish that isnt thick at all, paint on the plate and wait just about 7-10 seconds which will thicken it because it dried just a little. This method makes it easier for the stamper to pick up the design and easier to apply to the nails. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> I love this plate so much and it works so well!  It can be some extra cleanup to get the excess design off your skin, and it isn&#x27;t quite big enough for longer nails, but people are always asking me where I got my nails done when I use this!</li>
            <li> There are so many great combinations with this plate. If you are just looking to purchase one to start off with, pick this one NOW!! Great designs, easy process, what more can you ask for. Such a money saver and a great look!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, as I got a great deal on Ebay. This plate came with the black nail polish, the stamper, and the scrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an amazon junkie, but when I saw a good deal + free shipping on ebay, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. But I am writing this review, just in case someone has questions on whether the plate is good or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you now, this is a great plate. I was mad at first, cos images won&#x27;t transfer well and so many errors which turned out to be my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When swipping on the plate, swipe away from you, preferably to the right. Every design came out great. I uploaded a picture with a different design on each nail. The picture is the red and black one. Red base with wet and wild fast dry, and the black is konad black.</li>
            <li> I got these plates for christmas and I know they were from this seller, so it is this exact product. (Just saying) Anyways, this product is great! I see some people saying that they don&#x27;t work, which I absolutely DON&#x27;T understand.......... they must be doing something wrong. My only tip for you would be to use the special Konad nail polish, because it picks up 1000000x better than regular polish, although people use China Glaze.  GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I Love this plate, The designs apply really nice and I love the patterns on this plate. This is another one of Konad top favorite plates. I used O.P.I nail polish and it worked really well together :)</li>
            <li> Forget about going to the nail salon when you can do it yourself. it&#x27;s so easy! I will highly recommend</li>
            <li> I took this with me when I had my nails done and I just love my nails with this design</li>
            <li> I love this plate, specially the zebra and leopard designs.  I haven&#x27;t be able to transfer the flowers  and one of the first band to the right that is why the 3 stars. When I purchase something I expect it to work fully and this plate didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I used this image plate with my regular nail polish and a double ended stamper. It&#x27;s great for my 5 year old&#x27;s nails when she wants cheetah print. Much cheaper then paying for a pedicure.</li>
            <li> My daughters love how the designs look on the nails!  The only complaint is that it took over a month for it to come in.  I had to write a complaint and another got sent.</li>
            <li> This plate has some really cute designs on them. It allows me to be creative with my natural nails. I would recommend this product to all ages.</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of nail art plates.  This one is great but you need to know what you are doing and be careful not to use too little or too much polish.  With a little skill, the images come out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I own other Konad stamping plates and they work great with my other polishes(not Konad polishes) and with this particular plate it just wouln&#x27;t work for me. Also, the design itself would not cover my entire nail. So i would have to go back and reapply to a section that it didn&#x27;t get to. Then it would look uneven and I would get annoyed with it. Cute designs, bad plate.</li>
            <li> This is the most clever idea that I&#x27;ve seen in a while as far as do it yourself nail art goes. Love it!</li>
            <li> well i order it thaught i can use it alone ..LoL ,, but u have 2 have stamper n all dat stuff 2 do it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t engraved enough. Waste of money. :-( Too bad, the prints would have looked great, but no matter what....nothing worked.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is a nail art diva, so I got these for her, and she loves them.  I can&#x27;t comment much, since I&#x27;m a disaster with makeup (and haven&#x27;t tried these), but I know she uses them constantly on herself, and professionally.</li>
            <li> I used just regular China Glaze nail polish on this plate.  The design came off the stamp beautifully ...once I got the hang of lining it up on my nail properly.  It can be a little messy though so have plenty of paper towels at your disposal when in use!  *Note this is just the plate I bought the stamp and scraper separately.  The plate is in mint condition too when it arrives ;)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy trying this out as it was my first time. It wasn&#x27;t hard to apply and my nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product that I had to purchase at least one plate to try it out. When I first received the plate and initially used it, I thought it wasn&#x27;t too great but I realized it was due to human error. After a couple times of practicing with it, I started to fall in love. The plate, specifically M57, helped turn a simple manicure into a complex, artistic look with no talents necessary. If you have trouble drawing a circle [like me], you&#x27;ll dig this plate.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipment, great item, and I would buy again from this Store. The item is brand new and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I just got this image plate today and tried it (wearing a shellac, shimmery green as a base) and I used Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dri Whirlwind White as d stamping polish w/ d leopard print image n it&#x27;s GORGEOUS!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a fun llittle tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes a few tries, placement is the key &amp; can be tricky at first!</li>
            <li> The designs are really cute. But I have found other brands that are much cheaper and make similar image plates.</li>
            <li> I bought the KONAD nail stamper kit B with these as a n addition, the designs are great for funky french designs, practice makes perfect though.</li>
            <li> I love this plate! There are so many combos and different ways to do your nails with just one plate. Glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Dont even waste your money because this peice of junk doesn&#x27;t work. I hate it and will never waste my money on anything like this again</li>
            <li> These images work well. It is kinda hard to use because the patterns are really close together but the print does come out on the rubber stamp really clearly. I haven&#x27;t been able to get a really clean clear stamp off of it but I have just bought it and not had very much practice. I received it really quickly, way before the date it said I would. I will purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT concept and it has worked for a couple of my nail polishes wonderfully, however, many of my nail polishes don&#x27;t seem to work with it. Sometimes it takes a few trials for the good nail polishes to take the pattern on the stamp. Maybe the nail polishes they sell specifically for Konad is needed in some cases. The ones that have worked have been very cute though. Item arrived in a timely fashion. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love these designs they are so cute and easy to apply. The cheetah and zebra designs are my favorite! :) Fun too use too!!</li>
            <li> This product i love i would buy more if you want more designs its easy to use and fun to do</li>
            <li> This works pretty good.  The zebra print pretty much fits on my largest finger (which is my thumb) and is super cute.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and painless price is very decent&lt;br /&gt;as for the product itself i love these designs and the are soo easy to apply it is very hard to mess these ones up they look so cool!</li>
            <li> This is a very quick, &amp; easy way out of $30.00 at a salon, or ripping your hair out because you can&#x27;t get the design perfectly done with the stripers. This worked like magic. All though, I was a little dissapointed when I couldn&#x27;t use it on my toes. I mean I can use the flowers, but the square designs don&#x27;t work well. I think Konad should have a pedicure line full of discs with bigger designs on them made for toes. Overall, I am very pleased with the product, &amp; the seller. It came 1 day after I ordered it. It actually came before the stamper/scraper did. LoL. Anyways...I am looking forward to buying more discs, &amp; I will include a picture of my blue and white cheetah nails that I did with this (AMAZING) disc.</li>
            <li> Used a credit card to get the access off. The stencils are deep enough to make a suitable design on the nail. I&#x27;m 27 and to be honest, esp. with a three year old daughter and working full time, a simple solid color works for me now. Cute for teens though. this plate was my favorite to use and was used often and more frequently than others I used to have.</li>
            <li> Fun basic plate that transfers well to the stamping tool and nail.  A little bit of animal designs and pretty lace options too. Fast shipping and authentic konad too!</li>
            <li> this by far is my favorite plate i use alot. so much so that im glad it doesnt ware down.</li>
            <li> With this plate you can create so many different designs. i&#x27;m gonna buy one for my sister too because she always wants to use mine.</li>
            <li> I love this, it makes doing my own nails so much fun and so easy.  I have been asked by several people to do their nails and have done my moms.</li>
            <li> Beautiful designs!&lt;br /&gt;My nails are medium sized and the images still fit perfectly on my nails. if you have large nail sizes, then you might want to get the cheeky plates instead because these designs won&#x27;t fit (happened to my friend, just letting you know)</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends (me too) had fun using this plate to make our nails zebra striped.  We used a different base kit but they worked together fine.</li>
            <li> The pictures for this product made it look super easy to use. In reality I am finding it takes more than a few practices. I can&#x27;t quite get the right amount of nail polish on the metal plate to scrap up on the stamper. It&#x27;s also time-consuming so you really need to settle in when getting ready to do your nails. I think it works great if you practice enough. Just don&#x27;t expect it to work the first time! Purchase lots of nail polish remover if you&#x27;re picky.</li>
            <li> Love the designs but I never actually stamped my nails, the polish I bought was terrible and havent bothered to buy anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to do, Once done properly (which is 2nd nature when u play around with it enough) the patterns come out CRISP each time.... This was my first plate ever, and one by one, i&#x27;ve been throwing my money away to get more plates :D&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s not a waste if it makes me happy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to do your own nails, and you can tolerate the clean up...  KONAD is awesome</li>
            <li> Since  I started using I;ve been receiving compliments on my nails. Im glad I bought it. Maybe Im getting more of these.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fun way to get a unique nail design.  I was able to get great designs on the first try without much effort.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; easy to clean! Purchased with Konad stamper &amp; Konad nail polish. Definitely going to order more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted... I wanted to leave the seller 5 stars on their review but my stupid computer decided something different. This image plate is what I was looking for and the seller got it to me early as well. Over all experience I&#x27;m really happy with the seller and my purchase. This plate is so cute I love all the different ways you can use it.</li>
            <li> I had the original Konad kit, and it had just a few of the older plates in the kit. I like the bigger designs on this plate. They will fit my nails better than the smaller images on the older plates.</li>
            <li> the patterns are too big the stamper doesn&#x27;t get the whole impression and this is very messy to use. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless u are an expert on nail designs</li>
