            <li>This is a pleasant curl refresher.</li>
            <li>A salon recommended it and we like to keep a good supply in our household.</li>
            <li>But if you wanna pay for convenience, this is a good product from Deva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the scent, too!  </li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>, I am pretty sure your hair will look great and will be very healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use all the time and would recommend it to all the curly girls out there.  </li>
            <li>Love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product and you will too.</li>
            <li>This product makes my life better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance and ordered this product, not knowing what effect it would have on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect for &#x27;second&#x27; days.  </li>
            <li>I love this line of products for my curly hair that needs a little help to be at its best!</li>
            <li>To me, at immediate application, it smells strongly of ginger.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Set It Free -- and ordered this instead by mistake.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy what it does...</li>
            <li>amazing turns bedhead into runway ready head</li>
            <li>I use a lot of this spray and sometimes my curls look even better than they did when they were freshly styled.  </li>
            <li>right is the product I use most because it helps me to revive my curls during the day and in the morning.</li>
            <li>use this after I&#x27;ve slept on my curls to revive them a bit and to add a fresh, clean herbal (mostly lavender) scent.</li>
            <li>I fined this product with wide tooth comb or hair pikes works great.</li>
            <li>having a product that damage, or weigh down my curls - this is great to use on days</li>
            <li>It is a great little mist-er to refresh curls.</li>
            <li>It rejuvenates my curls and leaves my hair smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Also, I use this with the Arc An-Gel, and though the gel doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when I put it in, the Mist-er Right does make my hair sticky when I spray it on to \\&quot;revitalize.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think I just haven&#x27;t hit on the right method for using it.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very curly and at 4yr she can go from pretty curls to what happened quickly.</li>
            <li>And you have time left over to do the more important things in live, like sleeping in in the morning.</li>
            <li>Love love this, totally brings curls back to life!</li>
            <li>Right doesn&#x27;t really help the frizziness.</li>
            <li>I use this mist as part of the whole Deva Curl regime; on my 2nd and 3rd day hair, it works wonderfully to reduce frizz and bring springiness back to my curls.  </li>
            <li>Will not get this again but am a huge fan of Set It Free and other DevaCurl products</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is (really, you could get a bottle, add deionized water and some lavender oil and a bit of conditioner and pretty much be set).</li>
            <li>now I have a large supply (bought the two pack).  </li>
            <li>The lavendar is nice, but it is a little overpowering for me</li>
            <li>It is true as the product states that your curls are actually rejuvenated and look like your first wash day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a conditioner, as it&#x27;s mostly water with botanicals, but it is slightly hydrating.</li>
            <li>and I actually was ENJOYING my hair for once and not constantly worrying and fighting with it.  </li>
            <li>have used Low-Poo, No-Poo, One Conditioner, Arc An-Gel, and Mist-er Right, and the mist is my least favorite Deva product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is natural and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Right is a must for anyone religiously following the &amp;#34;Curly-Girl Method&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Some of the other comments seem to be made by very clever, knowledgeable folks and they are probably right.  </li>
            <li>With long, dark, coarse, fine, dry, colored, curly hair I mostly wanted to shave my head until I started with this line.  </li>
            <li>I comb my fingers lightly through my hair, then spray a ton of the mister right on, give it some time to dry and then de-crunch it a little.  </li>
            <li>It does revitalize your curls for a quick fix, IF YOU USE OTHER DEVA CURL PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a big fan of anything with a fragrance, really).  </li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve searched for a product that would maximize my natural curl....</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find a good dry shampoo for curly hair.</li>
            <li>It brings the day old or two day old curls back every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do be careful not to use TOO much, or your curls will get sticky-ish.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Generally my hair is a mess in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It is meant for use on dry hair, so after a shower, where my hair gets incidentally damp this stuff doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair either - which can be a difficult balance to find.  </li>
            <li> Use minimally</li>
            <li> I use all the other products in this line as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to other curly girls out there looking to revitalize their curls between shampoos.</li>
            <li> If you use other gel or leave-in conditioner,</li>
            <li> I was my hair at night and use the other deva products.  </li>
            <li> Just the other day, my hair was down, in control</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that it gets gummy or weighs down my hair after using it even repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or weighed down.</li>
            <li> When I try to style dry curly hair on day 2 (or 3) after a no-poo, my hair is usually way too frizzy.</li>
            <li> I do use quite a bit as my hair is long and thick but it never feels sticky or crunchy.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of this product I thought it was just another product to freshen my hair, I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> I am not sure jet what to think about this one</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to find so we are grateful we can get it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> However, I NEVER want to be without these products and even though they are expensive, compared to all the other products I bought and threw out/gave away for not working, it&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
            <li> I know that sounds shallow but seriously as a curly haired girl</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, useless.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> It does the job but leaves your hair feeling a bit dirty.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews where some folks swear by it and others are decidedly unhappy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Product!  Use minimally and it does wonders on unwashed curls.    Does not moisturize, which is probably the only thing I could complain about.   Love the scent, too!  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, useless. I meant to order another DevaCurl product -- Set It Free -- and ordered this instead by mistake. Bummer! Will not get this again but am a huge fan of Set It Free and other DevaCurl products</li>
            <li> I am not sure jet what to think about this one but I like the smell... use it on my daughter too!</li>
            <li> I love this product it smells great even after swimming and works wonderfully. My daughter is very curly and at 4yr she can go from pretty curls to what happened quickly. I fined this product with wide tooth comb or hair pikes works great.</li>
            <li> With long, dark, coarse, fine, dry, colored, curly hair I mostly wanted to shave my head until I started with this line.  I am a total convert.  Just the other day, my hair was down, in control and I actually was ENJOYING my hair for once and not constantly worrying and fighting with it.  I love this product.  I do use it, it does work and I use all the other products in this line as well.  Some of the other comments seem to be made by very clever, knowledgeable folks and they are probably right.  However, I NEVER want to be without these products and even though they are expensive, compared to all the other products I bought and threw out/gave away for not working, it&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
            <li> I use this mist as part of the whole Deva Curl regime; on my 2nd and 3rd day hair, it works wonderfully to reduce frizz and bring springiness back to my curls.  I haven&#x27;t found that it gets gummy or weighs down my hair after using it even repeatedly.  The only thing I would change is that I would reduce the fragrance a bit.  The lavendar is nice, but it is a little overpowering for me (I&#x27;m not a big fan of anything with a fragrance, really).  I&#x27;d recommend this to other curly girls out there looking to revitalize their curls between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product to make my hair springy again after one day. I really enjoy what it does...it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy. But does anyone else think it has a lavender AFTER-scent? To me, at immediate application, it smells strongly of ginger.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a good dry shampoo for curly hair. I have tried many and this is one of the best I have found. I do use quite a bit as my hair is long and thick but it never feels sticky or crunchy. It spritzes on nicely and has a very light lavender smell.

            <li> It does the job but leaves your hair feeling a bit dirty. It does curl your hair but I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to find so we are grateful we can get it through Amazon.  It is a great little mist-er to refresh curls. Just spray and prop up your hair with your fingers.  A salon recommended it and we like to keep a good supply in our household.</li>
            <li> Love love this, totally brings curls back to life!</li>
            <li> When I first heard of this product I thought it was just another product to freshen my hair, I was wrong!  It is true as the product states that your curls are actually rejuvenated and look like your first wash day.  I love this product and use all the time and would recommend it to all the curly girls out there.  I have also used it on my straight hair girl when she just needed a little freshening up!</li>
            <li> Love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love having a product that damage, or weigh down my curls - this is great to use on days you don&#x27;t wash your hair. It revives the curl, and smells divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with it - is that it sometimes makes my hair a bit too sticky.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant curl refresher. It&#x27;s not a conditioner, as it&#x27;s mostly water with botanicals, but it is slightly hydrating. Here are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqueous Extracts of: Achilea Millefolium, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus, Humulus Lupulus (Hops), Melissa Offcinalis (Balm Mint), Rosmarinus Offcinalis (Rosemary), Propylene Glycol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Lavendar Oil, DMDM Hydantoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I&#x27;ve slept on my curls to revive them a bit and to add a fresh, clean herbal (mostly lavender) scent. I get compliments on the scent. I do think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is (really, you could get a bottle, add deionized water and some lavender oil and a bit of conditioner and pretty much be set). But if you wanna pay for convenience, this is a good product from Deva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful not to use TOO much, or your curls will get sticky-ish.</li>
            <li> Love this product and you will too. It brings the day old or two day old curls back every time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is natural and works very well.  I had been buying it at Ulta, but the prices just keep going up and now their coupon&#x27;s don&#x27;t apply to this product so looked online and bought it cheaper here.</li>
            <li> It does revitalize your curls for a quick fix, IF YOU USE OTHER DEVA CURL PRODUCTS. If you use other gel or leave-in conditioner, etc., this product does nothing. Also, I use this with the Arc An-Gel, and though the gel doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when I put it in, the Mist-er Right does make my hair sticky when I spray it on to \\&quot;revitalize.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Low-Poo, No-Poo, One Conditioner, Arc An-Gel, and Mist-er Right, and the mist is my least favorite Deva product.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve searched for a product that would maximize my natural curl....I finally found it in the Deva Curl products.  It&#x27;s the perfect picker-upper for my hair in the morning and allows me to go longer between washings, which saves money and time!</li>
            <li> amazing turns bedhead into runway ready head</li>
            <li> love it!  now I have a large supply (bought the two pack).  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  My son calls it my hair water.</li>
            <li> This product makes my life better.  I know that sounds shallow but seriously as a curly haired girl this is a life changing product.  I was my hair at night and use the other deva products.  Generally my hair is a mess in the morning.  I use a lot of this spray and sometimes my curls look even better than they did when they were freshly styled.  When I get out of bed I comb my fingers lightly through my hair, then spray a ton of the mister right on, give it some time to dry and then de-crunch it a little.  It&#x27;s fabulous in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance and ordered this product, not knowing what effect it would have on my hair.  I found that it does restore the curl and eliminates the need for daily shampooing.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products for my curly hair that needs a little help to be at its best!</li>
            <li> Mist-er Right is a must for anyone religiously following the &amp;#34;Curly-Girl Method&amp;#34;.  It revitalized curls and reactivates the product already applied to the hair.  Smells delicious too,</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it smells incredible. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or weighed down. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews where some folks swear by it and others are decidedly unhappy. I think I just haven&#x27;t hit on the right method for using it. It is meant for use on dry hair, so after a shower, where my hair gets incidentally damp this stuff doesn&#x27;t work well. When I try to style dry curly hair on day 2 (or 3) after a no-poo, my hair is usually way too frizzy. Mist-er Right doesn&#x27;t really help the frizziness. Maybe it would work if my hair didn&#x27;t get too mussed up overnight. What I need to try is sleeping with some sort of doo-rag or investing in a silk or satin pillow.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair.  This product is perfect for &#x27;second&#x27; days.  Mist my hair, and the curls refresh, but no friz that I&#x27;d get if I only used water as mist. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair either - which can be a difficult balance to find.  Lavender scent is great too!</li>
            <li> After years of blow drying my waves out I found the Deva curl products. They give me the freedom to have my waves/ curls do what they want and look awesome. My hair is healthier then ever and looks great. Mist-er right is the product I use most because it helps me to revive my curls during the day and in the morning. It never has felt sticky or anything like that, but maybe that is because I use the Deva curl gel also. If you follow the Deva curl steps and take care of your wavy or curly hair that way, I am pretty sure your hair will look great and will be very healthy. And you have time left over to do the more important things in live, like sleeping in in the morning.</li>
