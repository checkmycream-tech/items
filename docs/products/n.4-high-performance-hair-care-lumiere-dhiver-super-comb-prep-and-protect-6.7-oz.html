            <li>I love Super Comb Prep &amp; Protect.  </li>
            <li>N.4 Super Comb Prep &amp; Protect is about 1000x better than the argan oil</li>

            <li>It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>importantly it somehow softens it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have noticed an actual difference in my hair after I started using it about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel soft and smooth and smells good.</li>

            <li>it is quick, easy and if not doing anything drastic with my hair</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>I was NEVER one to use any kind of leave in conditioner but after trying this stuff, I now can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>My hair still feels clean and bouncy after use.</li>
            <li>No matter how huge, frizzy or tangled my hair is, a couple spritzes of #4 and a quick comb through</li>
            <li>It make you hair feel so soft and gives it an amazing shine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and light.</li>
            <li>Product is good and definitely does the job!</li>
            <li>and this stuff is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft, easy to comb through, and had a beautiful shine that last all day!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Great Product and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down!</li>
            <li>Nice light leave in conditioner just enough scent</li>
            <li>Really love this for detangling after showers and leave in conditioner to keep hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It wears off quickly, in any case.</li>
            <li>I really cannot rate it yet, as I have not used it enough to know whether I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>My hairs is super think</li>
            <li>After my first use, I noticed a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>After I spray it on my hair (I use a fair amount, but my hair is quite long), I brush it through with a detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>All the other 5 star reviews are spot on -- this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>this is the only product from the N.4 line that acually is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Might try the conditioner as I read in a review that a person with similar hair and experience with this product really liked the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It leaves my normally ratty hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>so I scooped it up right away.  </li>
            <li>no dryness, comb goes right through.  </li>
            <li>I spray this on right after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and absolutely will be reordering!!!</li>
            <li>it smells a bit like cocoa butter, a warm choco-vanilla scent that disappears once hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and makes it super manageable too!</li>
            <li>My blowdry comes out so much better when I use this prior.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that drew me in was the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reminiscent of FCUK Polished, which I love.</li>
            <li>and when I went to order more it was back ordered.</li>
            <li>This product is part of my daily hair routine and love it.</li>
            <li>I first tried it out when I didn&#x27;t have conditioner and hoped that this would hold up.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and feel like it protects my color from heat pretty well</li>
            <li>I live in San Antonio, Texas and it withstood the humidity and heat of the next couple of days beautifully until I took a shower the next evening.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
            <li>Serious protection, volume, and great smell.</li>
            <li>and course but pretty straight.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down and gives it a nice shine without looking oily.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for any hair type because it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, it doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky, and it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Detangles and makes your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>Protect you color, untangle, and get super soft shiny strands.</li>
            <li>I tried it more than once, a couple of times on damp hair and a couple of times on dry hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product is French, but it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The only product I have ever used that truly eliminates frizz and gives me smooth, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I unclipped my hair, and my hair was STRAIGHT and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>Opted to buy from Amazon instead though for the shipping was much faster.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for highlighted/ dyed hair!</li>
            <li>No snags, no broken ends,</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Received this in one of my subscription boxes and really like this.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like my hair has a layer of protection when I style it</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>It is sooooo soft, silky and rejuvenated!!!</li>
            <li>I have never felt so strongly about a hair care product before, and will continue to be a fan as long as I can get my hands on this product!</li>
            <li>It gets dry and tangled easily.</li>
            <li>Or, if I don&#x27;t blow dry, it leaves my natural waves hydrated and they have a bit more</li>
            <li>Bought the full size and use daily.</li>
            <li>Looked on Amazon to compare full size prices and they were about the same.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this, now that I&#x27;ve used it!</li>
            <li>super shiny and stick straight after using the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>A few sprays from the nape of my neck down make my hair easy to comb through and when I blow it out, gives it a nice, glossy sheen without being oily.</li>
            <li>and I can run a brush easily through my wet hair.</li>
            <li>I was going to cut my hair super short than a person in work recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>I have color treated straight hair and I use this on wet hair and when I wake in the morning my hair is smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It helps with taming the frizz a little but more</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use products for my hair</li>
            <li>This hydrates just as well as normal conditioner and smells</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my frizz calm even if I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>so I use clear total care which is super affordable and spray this stuff</li>
            <li>I have super long hair so after towel drying my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to brush, and as others have mentioned it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not great, for my very healthy, extra thick hair.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in my Birchbox and decided to try it after I ran out of my usual stuff, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I got s same of this the first time from one of those sample subscription services</li>
            <li>Your hair, after styling, looks professionally done!  </li>
            <li>Most leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li>I have hair that needs to be tamed on a daily basis, I first discovered this product in a Birchbox buy.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product and I am completely sold!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a pretty good product -- just not perfect.</li>
            <li>This works great as a daily leave-in, as it tames frizz without being too heavy or weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, long, dry, easily tangled hair, so finding a product that both detangles and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down has been a long process.  </li>
            <li>Great for de-tangling and managing my daughter&#x27;s hair without dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this product from a subscription box and it has completely transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>Also conserves product, too, as you really only need 3-4 sprays when used as a finishing spray, as opposed to wetting your whole head when used as a styling spray.</li>
            <li>but it moisturizes and seperates each strand and makes your hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>The product was really sticky and only stayed on the cuticle.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to rewash and condition my hair, then use my old products to make my hair manageable.</li>
            <li>This keeps my ends feeling so soft and prevents my ends breaking off from the bleach.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This is probably the most expensive hair product I have ever bought, but after receiving it in a birch box, it is by far worth it...</li>
            <li>I get compliments daily on how much nicer my hair looks since I have started using it.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair, and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>Works really well with a flat iron!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I live in Hawaii and battle constant humidity.</li>
            <li>Too short to put up and ALMOST too short to curl or straight iron...</li>
            <li>I use it every day, it makes my hair very soft especially after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little odd (and thankfully, it fades pretty quickly), almost musky/musty.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried there shampoo and conditioner also and they are good but expensive and since i have long hair conditioner</li>
            <li>I have very long hair that is straight in the front and then gets progressively wavier until it&#x27;s curly in the back underneath.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately when I used this spray, I didn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine and my hair seemed to get even more tangled, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li>I no longer need to use any other products in my hair, it really works that well.</li>
            <li>This product smells a little &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; when first applied, but after your hair drys it isn&#x27;t noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I then let dry naturally or style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I spray my hair after a shower and am able to comb through it very easily (color-treated/fine hair)</li>
            <li> (my hair is fine), so this is a nice balance for conditioning the crown of my hair.  </li>

            <li> I love Super Comb Prep &amp; Protect.  </li>

            <li> I really cannot rate it yet, as I have not used it enough to know whether I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My hairs is super think</li>
            <li> After my first use, I noticed a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> After I spray it on my hair (I use a fair amount, but my hair is quite long), I brush it through with a detangling brush.  </li>
            <li> All the other 5 star reviews are spot on -- this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> this is the only product from the N.4 line that acually is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Might try the conditioner as I read in a review that a person with similar hair and experience with this product really liked the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It leaves my normally ratty hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> so I scooped it up right away.  </li>
            <li> no dryness, comb goes right through.  </li>
            <li> I spray this on right after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and absolutely will be reordering!!!</li>
            <li> it smells a bit like cocoa butter, a warm choco-vanilla scent that disappears once hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and makes it super manageable too!</li>
            <li> My blowdry comes out so much better when I use this prior.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that drew me in was the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reminiscent of FCUK Polished, which I love.</li>
            <li> and when I went to order more it was back ordered.</li>
            <li> This product is part of my daily hair routine and love it.</li>
            <li> I first tried it out when I didn&#x27;t have conditioner and hoped that this would hold up.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and feel like it protects my color from heat pretty well</li>
            <li> I live in San Antonio, Texas and it withstood the humidity and heat of the next couple of days beautifully until I took a shower the next evening.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
            <li> Serious protection, volume, and great smell.</li>
            <li> and course but pretty straight.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down and gives it a nice shine without looking oily.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for any hair type because it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, it doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky, and it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Detangles and makes your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> Protect you color, untangle, and get super soft shiny strands.</li>
            <li> I tried it more than once, a couple of times on damp hair and a couple of times on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product is French, but it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> The only product I have ever used that truly eliminates frizz and gives me smooth, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I unclipped my hair, and my hair was STRAIGHT and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> Opted to buy from Amazon instead though for the shipping was much faster.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for highlighted/ dyed hair!</li>
            <li> No snags, no broken ends,</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Received this in one of my subscription boxes and really like this.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like my hair has a layer of protection when I style it</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> It is sooooo soft, silky and rejuvenated!!!</li>
            <li> I have never felt so strongly about a hair care product before, and will continue to be a fan as long as I can get my hands on this product!</li>
            <li> It gets dry and tangled easily.</li>
            <li> Or, if I don&#x27;t blow dry, it leaves my natural waves hydrated and they have a bit more</li>
            <li> Bought the full size and use daily.</li>
            <li> Looked on Amazon to compare full size prices and they were about the same.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this, now that I&#x27;ve used it!</li>
            <li> super shiny and stick straight after using the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> A few sprays from the nape of my neck down make my hair easy to comb through and when I blow it out, gives it a nice, glossy sheen without being oily.</li>
            <li> and I can run a brush easily through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I was going to cut my hair super short than a person in work recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> I have color treated straight hair and I use this on wet hair and when I wake in the morning my hair is smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It helps with taming the frizz a little but more</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use products for my hair</li>
            <li> This hydrates just as well as normal conditioner and smells</li>
            <li> It really helps keep my frizz calm even if I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> so I use clear total care which is super affordable and spray this stuff</li>
            <li> I have super long hair so after towel drying my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to brush, and as others have mentioned it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not great, for my very healthy, extra thick hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my Birchbox and decided to try it after I ran out of my usual stuff, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I got s same of this the first time from one of those sample subscription services</li>
            <li> Your hair, after styling, looks professionally done!  </li>
            <li> Most leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> I have hair that needs to be tamed on a daily basis, I first discovered this product in a Birchbox buy.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and I am completely sold!</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a pretty good product -- just not perfect.</li>
            <li> This works great as a daily leave-in, as it tames frizz without being too heavy or weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long, dry, easily tangled hair, so finding a product that both detangles and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down has been a long process.  </li>
            <li> Great for de-tangling and managing my daughter&#x27;s hair without dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from a subscription box and it has completely transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> Also conserves product, too, as you really only need 3-4 sprays when used as a finishing spray, as opposed to wetting your whole head when used as a styling spray.</li>
            <li> but it moisturizes and seperates each strand and makes your hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> The product was really sticky and only stayed on the cuticle.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to rewash and condition my hair, then use my old products to make my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> This keeps my ends feeling so soft and prevents my ends breaking off from the bleach.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most expensive hair product I have ever bought, but after receiving it in a birch box, it is by far worth it...</li>
            <li> I get compliments daily on how much nicer my hair looks since I have started using it.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair, and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> Works really well with a flat iron!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I live in Hawaii and battle constant humidity.</li>
            <li> Too short to put up and ALMOST too short to curl or straight iron...</li>
            <li> I use it every day, it makes my hair very soft especially after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little odd (and thankfully, it fades pretty quickly), almost musky/musty.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried there shampoo and conditioner also and they are good but expensive and since i have long hair conditioner</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is straight in the front and then gets progressively wavier until it&#x27;s curly in the back underneath.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I used this spray, I didn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine and my hair seemed to get even more tangled, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to use any other products in my hair, it really works that well.</li>
            <li> This product smells a little &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; when first applied, but after your hair drys it isn&#x27;t noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I then let dry naturally or style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as for their other products please stay clear away from them.</li>
            <li> so it tends to be dry and can be limp with too much product.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that is usually so tangled after I shower a bird could easily live in it.</li>
            <li> This leave in makes it soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I use a similar process on fully dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long loose curls that tend to frizz if not properly treated.  </li>
            <li> I can blow dry AND flat iron it</li>
            <li> (blow dry, curling iron, or flat iron).</li>
            <li> but it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> After a shower, after going in my hottub, or even after a long nights sleep when I wake up and have a rats nest to deal with...</li>
            <li> If I had an endless supply of money I would ever be without out this (essentially) detangling, protecting spray.</li>
            <li> This product definitely unlike other products</li>
            <li> After washing I simply spray this in my wet tangled hair and comb!  </li>
            <li> Overall it allows my hair to dry a little faster and hold a lot nicer, especially in Hawaii humidity.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like the hundreds of other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> then when dry, I spray this on and scrunch to sort of set and define the waves.</li>
            <li> I spray about 6 sprays of the No.4 spray and then use Kenra blow dry spray before using the blow dryer/flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This product did nothing except dry out my hair to the point that I couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair.</li>
            <li> Even if I air dry it</li>
            <li> have tried it two ways -- on towel-dried damp hair and on fully dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Now... I have extremely long hair (down to the middle of my butt)</li>
            <li> I use this every single morning after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> A few squirts and my hair is that of a much younger me!</li>
            <li> Without it if I go to bed with wet hair</li>
            <li> After some experimenting, I use the product a little differently that the directions on the label: I style and dry my long wavy hair the way I usually do, and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that it was a light spray as I found it annoying to try and spray my whole head with it in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> (I know it says to do on towel dried hair, but I was curious after it didn&#x27;t work on damp hair to see about dry)</li>
            <li> This helps in that it both adds moisture and makes it easier for me to work in my other styling products.  </li>
            <li> The scent reminded me of the beach for some reason, it works well with the scents of my other hair products.</li>
            <li> It also stand so well against humidity ( if you live or ever been to Houston, TX you know what I mean)!</li>
            <li> My hair turned completely white when I was about 25 years old, so it is frequently color-treated a very dark brunette; everyone knows that it is very difficult to get a shine on color-treated dark brown hair, but with this product, my hair looks glossy, silky, and bouncy every day.</li>
            <li> I usually need a little extra frizz control.</li>
            <li> And I usually follow through with a little hair oil for extra shine and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but because I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, it will last me for at least 2 months, so</li>
            <li> I got this product and clipped my hair back out of frustration and because I was running late...</li>
            <li> This cream is average in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and I am forced to try and make do with whatever I can so with it until it grows out enough to do something with it.</li>
            <li> It detangles without weighing the hair down</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and gets the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I still have them of course, but not as bad and not as quickly after a trim as before.</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> and it adds ton of shine and maybe even a little volume.  </li>
            <li> Two, if I use this on damp hair, it can get a little re-tangled overnight.  </li>
            <li> recently cut my hair and have had very hard to manage hair...</li>
            <li> This is one of my few go to&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had alot of trouble finding a detangler that can do the job well.....</li>
            <li> that is extremely curly and extremely thick</li>
            <li> My son has long hair and a really tough tine brushing through it.</li>
            <li> Thick dry unmanageable and heavily processed hair, it works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, long hair that is very hard to comb out after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;ll do when it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li> No more frizz or fly-aways after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair and put whatever hair products I am to use that day while I am still in the shower as a time saving technique and wrap my hair in one of those hair towels that stay in place.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product here after I received a small sample in my birchbox.</li>
            <li> I have thin extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> so I try to moisturizer my ends at least a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> Delicate scent, detangles and conditions.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> when i would spend up to an hour and a half trying to comb and brush her hair without pulling hair out and hurting her, i use this spray and it takes no longer than 10 mins and no pain and fussing!!!  </li>
            <li> Works so well for my hair, which is hard to manage!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is color treated.</li>
            <li> and I was a bit shocked how expensive the big bottle is</li>
            <li> I know it sounds dramatic</li>
            <li> Not too badly, but a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I mean THICK!!!)</li>
            <li> This is my go to, everyday, must have!!!!</li>
            <li> This will be my go to product for as long as they make it, go give it a try because you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> or maybe I got a bad sample?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Smells great. I would  definitely  recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product, makes my hair smell amazing and feel like silk!</li>
            <li> Great for de-tangling and managing my daughter&#x27;s hair without dangerous chemicals. Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy or sticky even when you use repeatedly. Love it but It&#x27;s a little pricey. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice light leave in conditioner just enough scent so it&#x27;s not over powering. Good product.</li>
            <li> Really love this for detangling after showers and leave in conditioner to keep hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Smells nice &amp; light and does not leave hair oily</li>
            <li> I love Super Comb Prep &amp; Protect.  I bought it on a whim and it&#x27;s now a mainstay in my medicine cabinet.  It detangles without weighing the hair down and it adds ton of shine and maybe even a little volume.  My blowdry comes out so much better when I use this prior.  I also don&#x27;t like conditioning the top of my hair (my hair is fine), so this is a nice balance for conditioning the crown of my hair.  I use all No. 4 products now for my hair and they are great.</li>
            <li> All the other 5 star reviews are spot on -- this stuff is amazing!  Detangles and makes your hair super soft.  I&#x27;m hooked and will be rebuying!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from a subscription box and it has completely transformed my hair. The mirror shine is unreal! Plus there is no loss of body and bounce like with some leave-in conditioners. I love the smell - to me it smells a bit like cocoa butter, a warm choco-vanilla scent that disappears once hair is dry. My hair turned completely white when I was about 25 years old, so it is frequently color-treated a very dark brunette; everyone knows that it is very difficult to get a shine on color-treated dark brown hair, but with this product, my hair looks glossy, silky, and bouncy every day. N.4 Super Comb Prep &amp; Protect is about 1000x better than the argan oil I was using previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to note that the packaging on this purchase was gorgeous and included two generous freebies. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Works so well for my hair, which is hard to manage!</li>
            <li> This stuff is hair magic. Protect you color, untangle, and get super soft shiny strands.</li>
            <li> I use this every single morning after washing my hair. It helps detangle as well as with frizziness.  And I LOVE the scent - it&#x27;s fresh and light.</li>
            <li> This is the best diet angler/conditioner I have ever used. It is a very light spray and easily does its work.</li>
            <li> Product is good and definitely does the job! Makes my hair feel so soft and makes it super manageable too!</li>
            <li> Smell great. Great detangler.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders! I have long thick hair and it makes it SUPER easy to comb out after I shower!!</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this product as a sample with an order that I placed with a cosmetic company and I e been sold ever since!  It leaves my normally ratty hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I actually like the scent of this stuff -- it has an earthy scent similar to balsam or cedar with vanilla overtones. It wears off quickly, in any case. After some experimenting, I use the product a little differently that the directions on the label: I style and dry my long wavy hair the way I usually do, and then when dry, I spray this on and scrunch to sort of set and define the waves. Works BEAUTIFULLY. Also conserves product, too, as you really only need 3-4 sprays when used as a finishing spray, as opposed to wetting your whole head when used as a styling spray.</li>
            <li> I received this promptly and it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I use it every day, it makes my hair very soft especially after blow drying.  I had a sample of this and I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months but I ran low and needed to purchase a larger bottle.  It&#x27;s a great price for a hair product.</li>
            <li> This product smells a little &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; when first applied, but after your hair drys it isn&#x27;t noticeable.  Works great at detangling hair and leaves your hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love my hair after using this.  Lightweight, not sticky or tacky...just great, healthy-looking, shiny, tangle-free hair with a squirt or two!</li>
            <li> Overall it allows my hair to dry a little faster and hold a lot nicer, especially in Hawaii humidity. I would recommend to buy to any one.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It is the only thing I can use to get tangles and knots out of my hair. I use it every day when I get out of the shower and it leaves my hair healthy and smelling great. Awesome beauty product!!</li>
            <li> If I had an endless supply of money I would ever be without out this (essentially) detangling, protecting spray. It smells great and makes my hair stunning!! Not sure what I&#x27;ll do when it&#x27;s gone...maybe get another job....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product is French, but it is fabulous.  A few squirts and my hair is that of a much younger me! The only product I have ever used that truly eliminates frizz and gives me smooth, shiny hair.  Works really well with a flat iron!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I live in Hawaii and battle constant humidity. I fell in love with the shampoo and conditioner from this line when birchbox sent me a sample. This leave in is a silicone and castor oil based product that gives your hair volume and fights frizz. I have fine thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like the hundreds of other products I&#x27;ve tried. My hair still feels clean and bouncy after use.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product.  It&#x27;s a great conditioner that&#x27;s so light it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on your hair but it moisturizes and seperates each strand and makes your hair feel so soft.  Even if your conditioner in the shower isn&#x27;t all that great this product still makes you hair fell wonderful after you blowdry.  I was worried about the price but because I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, it will last me for at least 2 months, so I don&#x27;t mind paying $16 a month for a great leave in.</li>
            <li> I used to use It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner but I received a sample of this and switched.  Smell is great.  Leaves my hair (color treated, fine and prone to frizz) super shiny and stick straight after using the flat iron.  I spray about 6 sprays of the No.4 spray and then use Kenra blow dry spray before using the blow dryer/flat iron.  Seems to help against humidity also.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing except dry out my hair to the point that I couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair. The product was really sticky and only stayed on the cuticle. I ended up having to rewash and condition my hair, then use my old products to make my hair manageable. I thought at this price, this product would be great, especially reading all the great reviews it had! Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> I made this purchase after receiving a sample through a subscription service. The first thing that drew me in was the scent. It&#x27;s reminiscent of FCUK Polished, which I love. This works great as a daily leave-in, as it tames frizz without being too heavy or weighing down my hair. I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> Love it. Gives you a nice sleek look</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I normally don&#x27;t use products for my hair but I received a sample of this product and fell in love.  No more frizz or fly-aways after blow drying.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! It really helps keep my frizz calm even if I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair. It&#x27;s crazy. Without it if I go to bed with wet hair I wake up with a white girl fro. With it I wake up with beach waves. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I bleach my hair so I try to moisturizer my ends at least a couple times a day. This keeps my ends feeling so soft and prevents my ends breaking off from the bleach. I only bleach my roots now that I have my hair the platinum color I was aiming for, but my roots feel like virgin hair</li>
            <li> Learned about this product through Birchbox, and loved it! Bought the full size and use daily. Excellent hair detangler and protectant, and GREAT on thin/fine hair. Serious protection, volume, and great smell. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I received a sample of this through Birch box and when I went to order more it was back ordered. Amazon had it in stock so I scooped it up right away.  It has a soft delicious smell and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years.  It does not weigh my hair down and gives it a nice shine without looking oily.  Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all for my fine hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and gets the tangles out.  The Price is much better than Birchbox!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair care products that I have ever purchased. It make you hair feel so soft and gives it an amazing shine. Once you try it, you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> I was definitely sold on this product! After my first use, I noticed a huge difference in my hair.  My hair was so soft, easy to comb through, and had a beautiful shine that last all day!  This product definitely unlike other products Ive used that promise to add shine but leave a greasy residue.  This product is part of my daily hair routine and love it.</li>
            <li> I use this after every shower for me and my daughter. It detangles her hair, makes it smell great, and knowing it protects it as well makes it even better! This is one product I always want to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Smooth tangle free hair that is protected from heat damage! YAY!</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in my monthly Birchbox and immediately purchased the full-sized product here on Amazon. I have thick, wavy, long hair that is very hard to comb out after I wash it. This product is fabulous!  It detangles and conditions my hair and I can run a brush easily through my wet hair. What a great find!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in a subscription box that I get. I have very long hair that is straight in the front and then gets progressively wavier until it&#x27;s curly in the back underneath. It gets dry and tangled easily. Unfortunately when I used this spray, I didn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine and my hair seemed to get even more tangled, especially at the ends. I tried it more than once, a couple of times on damp hair and a couple of times on dry hair. I got the same result every time. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong (I know it says to do on towel dried hair, but I was curious after it didn&#x27;t work on damp hair to see about dry) or maybe I got a bad sample? I really don&#x27;t know. Most people here seem to have had good results with it?</li>
            <li> Let me just say you need this product in your life! I know it sounds dramatic but that&#x27;s how well this product works! I received a sample in my Birchbox and decided to try it after I ran out of my usual stuff, and I&#x27;m glad I did. My hair has never been so soft and manageable. I have short fine hair, and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. It also stand so well against humidity ( if you live or ever been to Houston, TX you know what I mean)! This will be my go to product for as long as they make it, go give it a try because you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, works great as a detangler and leave in conditioner. I got s same of this the first time from one of those sample subscription services and I was a bit shocked how expensive the big bottle is but it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell that it has and how well it functions de tangling my hair. La De da da.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Great at detangling my very long fine hair and even better at keeping my flaming ginger hair, ginger.  And it smells amazing!  A must buy for anyone with color treated hair!</li>
            <li> This is one of my few go to&#x27;s it is quick, easy and if not doing anything drastic with my hair it&#x27;s the only thing I need. I have thin extremely curly hair so when I straighten and or use a lot of heat I usually need a little extra frizz control.</li>
            <li> My son has long hair and a really tough tine brushing through it. A small amount of this stuff works wonders! According to the label it is also free of a lot of chemicals and is vegan. Nice touch!</li>
            <li> I was going to cut my hair super short than a person in work recommended this product.  It is amazing.  Spray on damp hair after you shower and comb through.  I have fine hair and this product gave my hair a lot of volume.  This product is amazing.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This has been the best thing to happen to my hair since running water. 5 months since my last hair cut and NO SPLIT ENDS!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Is great for smoothing out frizzes with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most expensive hair product I have ever bought, but after receiving it in a birch box, it is by far worth it...&lt;br /&gt;I recently cut my hair and have had very hard to manage hair... After the hack job I had, I have NO control whatsoever and I am forced to try and make do with whatever I can so with it until it grows out enough to do something with it. Too short to put up and ALMOST too short to curl or straight iron... I usually wash my hair and put whatever hair products I am to use that day while I am still in the shower as a time saving technique and wrap my hair in one of those hair towels that stay in place. I got this product and clipped my hair back out of frustration and because I was running late...&lt;br /&gt;I unclipped my hair, and my hair was STRAIGHT and frizz-free. I didn&#x27;t have to use ant styling tools at all. I live in San Antonio, Texas and it withstood the humidity and heat of the next couple of days beautifully until I took a shower the next evening.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING PRODUCT. I bought it and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I get compliments daily on how much nicer my hair looks since I have started using it. Only drawback is that my husband says that it smells like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> possibly the best hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Great to use as a de-frizzer and de-tangler. I have fine hair but a lot of it and it made my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I highlight my hair, it&#x27;s also very fine so it tends to be dry and can be limp with too much product. This leave in makes it soft without weighing it down. I can blow dry AND flat iron it and it&#x27;s neither frizzy or crunchy when I use this spray. Even if I air dry it my curls aren&#x27;t frizzy. It&#x27;s amazing stuff wish I found it sooner. Fragrance is meh, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and the spray is very fine mist.</li>
            <li> Received as a sample in one of my monthly subscription boxes and FELL IN LOVEEEE!!! Looked on Amazon to compare full size prices and they were about the same. Opted to buy from Amazon instead though for the shipping was much faster. This stuff is absolutely amazing!!! The smell is beautiful. Now... I have extremely long hair (down to the middle of my butt) that is extremely curly and extremely thick (I mean THICK!!!) and this stuff is a dream come true. After a shower, after going in my hottub, or even after a long nights sleep when I wake up and have a rats nest to deal with... This stuff is my savior!!! No matter how huge, frizzy or tangled my hair is, a couple spritzes of #4 and a quick comb through and my hair looks like I just got out of the salon. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. It is sooooo soft, silky and rejuvenated!!! I used to dread it and get headaches from brushing my hair out... Now, I literally look forward to it. This is my go to, everyday, must have!!!! I can&#x27;t rave about it enough!!! I was NEVER one to use any kind of leave in conditioner but after trying this stuff, I now can&#x27;t live without it. Highly recommended and absolutely will be reordering!!! Great price for the quality and arrived on time which was within a week. I am SOOOO happy!!!</li>
            <li> this is the only product from the N.4 line that acually is an amazing product. i received a sample of this from birchbox and loved it so much i purchased it. this is the one and only thing that works on my daughters tangled hair. when i would spend up to an hour and a half trying to comb and brush her hair without pulling hair out and hurting her, i use this spray and it takes no longer than 10 mins and no pain and fussing!!!  this product should also be advertised has a detangaler too because i will never use anything eles, and it smells good too. as for their other products please stay clear away from them.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair care product I have ever come across..Your hair, after styling, looks professionally done!  Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Great Product and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down!</li>
            <li> I really cannot rate it yet, as I have not used it enough to know whether I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this at 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the cost and I don&#x27;t like how it smells. That said I will still pay the money for a product that works this well. I no longer need to use any other products in my hair, it really works that well.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is color treated. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used! My hair is shiny and feels so healthy!</li>
            <li> Thick dry unmanageable and heavily processed hair, it works wonders!! Love it!  Highly recommended for highlighted/ dyed hair! Definitely try it! Worth the money</li>
            <li> Great hair product. Lovely scent too!</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but seemed to dissipate as the day went on.  Did not work on my course, curly wavy hair.  Actually seemed to make it frizzier.  Might try the conditioner as I read in a review that a person with similar hair and experience with this product really liked the conditioner.  Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend for whom it works great.</li>
            <li> This cream is average in my opinion. I didn&#x27;t like that it was a light spray as I found it annoying to try and spray my whole head with it in my small bathroom. LOL. I still prefer Carol&#x27;s Daughter Chocolat to this.</li>
            <li> My favorite treat to myself...this product is so pricey on the No. 4 website.  Such a great price for this product.</li>
            <li> love the  way my hair feels so much more volume too!</li>
            <li> Using the No. 4 shampoo and conditioner I was looking for a leave-in… didn&#x27;t know No. 4 had Super Comb!!!!!! I am a fan!  It works wonders on my hair!  After washing I simply spray this in my wet tangled hair and comb!  No snags, no broken ends, no dryness, comb goes right through.  I then let dry naturally or style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: African-American/Caucasian, normal/dry, partly curly, brown</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long, dry, easily tangled hair, so finding a product that both detangles and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down has been a long process.  This product is AMAZING! It detangles, accelerates blow-drying time, smells great, leaves my hair shiny but not greasy and very soft.  I have never felt so strongly about a hair care product before, and will continue to be a fan as long as I can get my hands on this product!</li>
            <li> Pricey but I do love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best invention for hair since the no breakage elastic hair tie.  This spray adds the perfect amount of moisture making my hair manageable and shiny without being flattened out.  I have long loose curls that tend to frizz if not properly treated.  This helps in that it both adds moisture and makes it easier for me to work in my other styling products.  The scent reminded me of the beach for some reason, it works well with the scents of my other hair products.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed!&lt;br /&gt;I received the sample 1oz size in my monthly Birchbox subscription. Most items I save until I run out of conditioner, shave cream, etc. I haven&#x27;t stopped using this since I got it. I first tried it out when I didn&#x27;t have conditioner and hoped that this would hold up. Most leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past don&#x27;t make the cut. This hydrates just as well as normal conditioner and smells AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have super long hair so after towel drying my hair it is invariably tangled. Spraying this product allows me to comb right thorugh the tangles and adds a great scent to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have come across. I highly recommend this product. This is basically the one product I use on a daily basis. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. My isn&#x27;t as frizzy as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair which means it likes to get tangled.  I spray this on right after I wash my hair.  It helps with taming the frizz a little but more importantly it somehow softens it.  I used to buy this on another website for much more but luckily found it here.  Would recommend for any hair type because it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, it doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky, and it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I generally love N. 4 haircare products.  This is a pretty good detangler, but probably not the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it two ways -- on towel-dried damp hair and on fully dry hair.  It helps in both cases, but is most effective on damp hair.  After I spray it on my hair (I use a fair amount, but my hair is quite long), I brush it through with a detangling brush.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  I use a similar process on fully dry hair.  And I usually follow through with a little hair oil for extra shine and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars.  One, I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.  It&#x27;s a little odd (and thankfully, it fades pretty quickly), almost musky/musty.  Two, if I use this on damp hair, it can get a little re-tangled overnight.  Not too badly, but a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the non-aerosol pump.  Overall, this is a pretty good product -- just not perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have hair that needs to be tamed on a daily basis, I first discovered this product in a Birchbox buy. I fell in love with it immediately. Smells amazing and performs as promised. Buy it here if you can, as Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this as was hooked. I have color treated straight hair and I use this on wet hair and when I wake in the morning my hair is smooth and manageable. It makes it shiny and protects the color. My husband likes to use it in the am to style his hair. It makes your hair feel soft and smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have EVER come across for my hair. I have thin, fine hair that is usually so tangled after I shower a bird could easily live in it. Since I was a kid it has been a battle to rip a brush through my hair, and I have tried everything from leave-in-conditioners to argon oil, this is the only product that has made a difference. My hair is easy to brush, and as others have mentioned it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or weighed down. I love it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and I am completely sold! My hair tangles easily and I&#x27;ve had alot of trouble finding a detangler that can do the job well.....well, this one does the job on both my daughter&#x27;s hair and my curly hair. I will definitely buy this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Received this in one of my subscription boxes and really like this.  Makes my hair easy to comb and I swear hair dries faster and is so shiny and has good volume.  Ive tried there shampoo and conditioner also and they are good but expensive and since i have long hair conditioner barely last 2 weeks so I use clear total care which is super affordable and spray this stuff and my hair looks just as good.  all you need is this spray it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> I purchased this product here after I received a small sample in my birchbox. This is a great product, I have noticed an actual difference in my hair after I started using it about 3 months ago. It just has a healthier feel and shine too it. I think it has actually protected the tips of my hair from further breakage and split ends. I still have them of course, but not as bad and not as quickly after a trim as before. I really feel like my hair has a layer of protection when I style it (blow dry, curling iron, or flat iron). The item was delivered very quickly and will purchase again from this seller when I run out! Also, it has a nice smell too, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I also received a sample of this from Birchbox and really loved it. My hairs is super think and course but pretty straight. This makes it smoother and shinier!  Much better price than Birchbox as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great at detangling my hair and leaving it soft even after blow drying.  I have color treated hair and feel like it protects my color from heat pretty well</li>
            <li> The only product I regularly use in my hair. Delicate scent, detangles and conditions. PS read the bottle, great label :) Love this stuff, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like this but it smells like cough syrup. 3 stars because of the smell. If it smelled better, 4 stars. It&#x27;s good, but not great, for my very healthy, extra thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It smells good and really does work well as a detangle solution. I spray my hair after a shower and am able to comb through it very easily (color-treated/fine hair)</li>
            <li> The best. Really. Amazon has the best price too. You should try it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this, now that I&#x27;ve used it! I received a generous sample in a subscription box, and raced to purchase more. A few sprays from the nape of my neck down make my hair easy to comb through and when I blow it out, gives it a nice, glossy sheen without being oily. Or, if I don&#x27;t blow dry, it leaves my natural waves hydrated and they have a bit more oomph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend No. 4 Hair Care - my favorites are this, the Volumizing Shampoo, and the Hydrating Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner!!!  It smells so good. It leaves my hair really shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference when I started using this product.  It makes my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking. I have coarse asian hair and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
