            <li>These practice skins work great, and hold the color.  </li>
            <li>But its just to practice on and its good to use to get the feel of tattooing.</li>

            <li>I like the idea of tattoo skins, and these are very economical....</li>
            <li>The needle kept getting stuck and scraping against the skin as I tried to tattoo, real skin is better.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get a bag of oranges much more realistic practice skin.</li>

            <li>wasnor as good as i had thought as it was, , doesnt feel as thick as it should be to simulate real skin</li>
            <li>fast shipping and solid product</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you how realistic these skins actually are compared to human skin but according to the tattoo artist i&#x27;m working under</li>
            <li>not what I expected, takes ink well, but still isn&#x27;t real skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put in approximately five more practice hours on them today, so</li>
            <li>hard to clean away the wipe away smudges from the ink that isn&#x27;t settled in.</li>

            <li> Completely satisfied with shipping and item.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you how realistic these skins actually are compared to human skin but according to the tattoo artist i&#x27;m working under they&#x27;re a great tool for me to get the general idea of working authentic skin.  So far i&#x27;ve only put in approximately two to three hours worth of practice on it and i&#x27;ve seen improvements over my technique off the bat.  I&#x27;ll put in approximately five more practice hours on them today, so i&#x27;ll post again when i&#x27;ve gone through all five!  I highly recommend first timers like myself grabbing these before phuxing up some test dummie. I&#x27;ll surely be reordering these at months end.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of tattoo skins, and these are very economical....but way too thin IMO. Suggest you get foam board and place the skin on that when working as your needles will go thru the skin.</li>
            <li> Planned on using these for a prop for a costume I am making.  They are great.</li>
            <li> as described good skins fast shipping very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get a bag of oranges much more realistic practice skin.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re alright. hard to clean away the wipe away smudges from the ink that isn&#x27;t settled in. you should probably just practice on grapefruits or oranges.</li>
            <li> very good product exactly what&#x27;s in the description in the picture feels like real skin</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 so awesome! perfect product. Sometimes the needle may cling onto the skin pulling at it.</li>
            <li> They were awsome just not sure how to really use hem yet guess ill figure it all out in time</li>
            <li> The ink is sticking just fine,&lt;br /&gt; It smears some, But its a great product for beginning! works great! Thank you!</li>

            <li> The ink dosent even stick in it.. so bad feels like a computer mouse mate ..i tired both sides and nothing ..</li>
            <li> like them but if yur just getting started its not like doing it on skin its so much easier and the practice skins are way different then I thought</li>
