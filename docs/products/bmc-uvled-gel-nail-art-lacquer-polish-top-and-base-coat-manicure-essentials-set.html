    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>Works Great!</li>
            <li>Great product and value!</li>
            <li>This polish is the best, I will buy again and again and again.</li>
            <li>Great price too!</li>
            <li>I have had nothing but great compliments, and the polish works well.</li>
            <li>Great for at home gel nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a Led lamp because they can cost 25-100 dollars!  </li>
            <li>Good deal..have you priced the junk at the &amp;#34;beauty supply&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>The top coat works great with my uv lamp.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had zero issues with scuffing, chipping or peeling of any kind</li>
            <li>first time doing my own gel nails … easy to use , great results</li>
            <li>Large bottles and a great product.</li>
            <li>Top coat works well to my knowledge.</li>
            <li>If the bottom coat didn&#x27;t peel off so soon, I could probably say the top coat lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Its price makes it seem appealing, but don&#x27;t get roped in.</li>
            <li>And I use the BMC nail polish with the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that you needed a LED lamp to be able to make this product work until after I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions for the maximum results.</li>
            <li>No problems with the top coat.</li>
            <li>I did notice that you do NOT need to use rubbing alcohol after curing the top coat like most get top coats.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried, the polish doesn&#x27;t stand up for more than a couple of days or so before it starts peeling or chipping.</li>
            <li>You have to apply the top coat and place your hand under the lamp again in order for this process to work.</li>
            <li>So until the top coat goes on, it will feel a bit tacky, so be</li>
            <li>applied a layer of the top coat, and used the lamp and timer again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been in love</li>
            <li>Super sensitive to UV light!!!!</li>
            <li>Its not as noticeable with darker colors but with spring around the corner, I LIVE for bright spring colors.  </li>
            <li>These work fine.</li>
            <li>I was able to peel it right off my nails in one piece like a plastic coating.</li>
            <li>Great base and top coat, practice does make perfect!</li>
            <li>I was all excited to use my new UV light nail dryer and bought this kit to start with.</li>
            <li>But for some reason the top coat completely changes the color of my polish when I finish curing everything.</li>
            <li>I tried the 2nd hand, I had more success since I&#x27;d figured out how it worked.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>But the outcome is pretty.</li>
            <li>I did some research and watched some Youtube videos before I tried it because I wasn&#x27;t sure about using it over regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>So be aware of that.</li>
            <li>These work really well!</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s why I purchased this one, though I&#x27;m sure the colored options work equally as well as this</li>
            <li>I let my hand cool off since this was a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>It just last much longer than this top coat.  </li>
            <li>The base and top coat work perfect with the color changing polish.</li>
            <li>This base and top coat is the best I have found yet!  </li>
            <li>It is very glossy and looks pretty.</li>
            <li>but these are great starter base and top coats!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very long-lasting and high shine!  </li>
            <li>i absolutely love the other polishes from this company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I especially like that you don&#x27;t really have to wipe the top coat when you&#x27;re done like other gel products.</li>
            <li>A bright pink is instantly changed to a duller lighter pink.</li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions, be super careful, then it will work.</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoys this product and it seems to last longer than normal products you would by at say, &amp;#34;walmart&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>However, I have found that no matter what kind of clear polish, base coat, or top coat combos</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I just needed to give it a minute to cool down and harden, so</li>
            <li>When I first pulled my hand out, my nails felt dry but still as though it might be tacky underneath the surface.</li>
            <li>The other brands (with varying degrees of success) lasted weeks.  </li>
            <li>my daughter loves it but be advised that it takes much longer than stated to dry.</li>
            <li>lead a hectic life and don&#x27;t have a ton of time to do my nails, and typically don&#x27;t like to go to a salon except for rare occasions.</li>
            <li>Not sure that&#x27;s necessary, but it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t care to wear nail color on my fingernails, and prefer just a glossy clear polish.</li>
            <li>I think that this product was a huge waste of money because they cannot dry without a lamp</li>
            <li>There is some type of reaction that occurs between the components of the base coat, top coat and the UV light.</li>
            <li>After reading some negative reviews, I was worried but it worked perfectly on my first try!</li>
            <li>This really helps extend the length of time between doing my nails, except for a little cleanup of cuticles here and there.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is that it is very thick and somewhat tricky to get a smooth coat.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty hard on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It pulled away from the edges of my nail to dry thicker in the middle.</li>
            <li> The finished product is way thicker / harder than if you&#x27;d just applied several coats of polish.</li>
            <li> I still use the base coat with no problems, I have just switched back to my Red Carpet for the top coat.  </li>
            <li> This works well but could use a professional brush goes on a,bit thick.</li>
            <li> I used this over regular nail polish and layered the base and top coats and cured each coat with my UV lamp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been wearing mine for that long, but my sister commented she&#x27;d been wearing hers for a little over 2 weeks and still had no chips or peeling.</li>
            <li> you HAVE TO USE A UV LAMP TO DRY THIS POLISH!!!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s convenient, but not worth it compared to lifetime of other brands.</li>
            <li> I expected the polish to feel a little tacky after curing since i had read about that happening</li>
            <li> One of the cheapest gel top and base coats out in Amazon.</li>
            <li> For me, I ran my hand under the lamp twice with the base coat, then once with the top coat.</li>
            <li> After it cooled, it was perfectly hard and dry</li>
            <li> Came well packaged in a little box.</li>
            <li> After that timer went off, my nails were still feeling a little tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this was a waste.</li>
            <li> Top coat turns nasty yellow-green within minutes of finishing manicure.</li>
            <li> was a gift they haven&#x27;t complained so have to thin</li>
            <li> After the timer finished, I was confused because the polish still felt a bit tacky.</li>
            <li> No more expensive salon visits for me anymore!</li>
            <li> Base coat refuses to harden or dry even after 2 hours of trying!</li>
            <li> I tried the base coat by itself and the polish clumped up as it dried.</li>
            <li> After giving myself the usual manicure, I applied the base coat and used the timer function on my UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Very weird.</li>
            <li> Has it gone bad?</li>
            <li> If you get the base coat on your skin then the polish peels off easier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the base coat won&#x27;t cure.</li>
            <li> Awful product!!  </li>

            <li> Good deal..have you priced the junk at the &amp;#34;beauty supply&amp;#34;? This works well but could use a professional brush goes on a,bit thick.</li>
            <li> I have purchased, from their product line of nail polish. I have had nothing but great compliments, and the polish works well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Works well.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described. Came well packaged in a little box. Product works well. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Great base and top coat, practice does make perfect! If you get the base coat on your skin then the polish peels off easier. It took me a few times to really get the hang of it but these are great starter base and top coats!</li>
            <li> These work fine. Bottom coat you can expect to peel off in about a week, but have yet to have it damage my nails when it does peel off. Top coat works well to my knowledge. If the bottom coat didn&#x27;t peel off so soon, I could probably say the top coat lasts longer. For the price, it&#x27;s convenient, but not worth it compared to lifetime of other brands.</li>
            <li> Awful product!!  I have been using Gelish, OPI, Red Carpet, etc. brands for years.  This product peeled off within days.  The other brands (with varying degrees of success) lasted weeks.  I used it once and threw it away immediately after the nails peeled a couple of days later.  Its price makes it seem appealing, but don&#x27;t get roped in.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love the other polishes from this company. But for some reason the top coat completely changes the color of my polish when I finish curing everything. And I use the BMC nail polish with the top coat.  A bright pink is instantly changed to a duller lighter pink. Its not as noticeable with darker colors but with spring around the corner, I LIVE for bright spring colors.  I still use the base coat with no problems, I have just switched back to my Red Carpet for the top coat.  It just last much longer than this top coat.  And obviously doesn&#x27;t change the color.</li>
            <li> For some reason this topcoat changes color on my polish.  It changes everything to have a gold cast to it.  Definitely am not using it anymore.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it but be advised that it takes much longer than stated to dry. But the outcome is pretty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that you needed a LED lamp to be able to make this product work until after I bought it.  I don&#x27;t own a Led lamp because they can cost 25-100 dollars!  I think that this product was a huge waste of money because they cannot dry without a lamp and they just stay all goopy.</li>
            <li> Works Great! After reading some negative reviews, I was worried but it worked perfectly on my first try! I used this over regular nail polish and layered the base and top coats and cured each coat with my UV lamp. I did some research and watched some Youtube videos before I tried it because I wasn&#x27;t sure about using it over regular nail polish. The results looked just like the gel manicures I get at the salon. No more expensive salon visits for me anymore! Great product and value! The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is that it is very thick and somewhat tricky to get a smooth coat. If you don&#x27;t cap off the edge of the nail, it will peel off, too. So be aware of that.</li>
            <li> The top coat works great with my uv lamp. I don&#x27;t understand why the base coat won&#x27;t cure. I did a thin layer and put it under my light and nothing happens. It just stays goopy. What is the deal? Has it gone bad?</li>
            <li> One of the cheapest gel top and base coats out in Amazon. Great for at home gel nails. Just follow the instructions, be super careful, then it will work. However, I do have to say that the shine is not the strongest, and it is removable with acetone. Make sure you follow the instructions for the maximum results.</li>
            <li> was a gift they haven&#x27;t complained so have to thin they are wonderfull</li>
            <li> Large bottles and a great product. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This polish is the best, I will buy again and again and again. It dries without that tacky feel...which means no need for the use of alcohol after it cures.</li>
            <li> Top coat turns nasty yellow-green within minutes of finishing manicure. Super sensitive to UV light!!!!</li>
            <li> Base coat refuses to harden or dry even after 2 hours of trying! No problems with the top coat.</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys this product and it seems to last longer than normal products you would by at say, &amp;#34;walmart&amp;#34;.  Definitely a re-buy item</li>
            <li> The base and top coat work perfect with the color changing polish. I did notice that you do NOT need to use rubbing alcohol after curing the top coat like most get top coats.</li>
            <li> Bought to use with BMC color changing gel polish. Works well.</li>
            <li> first time doing my own gel nails … easy to use , great results</li>
            <li> This base and top coat is the best I have found yet!  Very long-lasting and high shine!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> This product was a bust. I was all excited to use my new UV light nail dryer and bought this kit to start with. I tried the base coat by itself and the polish clumped up as it dried. It pulled away from the edges of my nail to dry thicker in the middle. Very weird. I&#x27;ve never seen that before. I expected the polish to feel a little tacky after curing since i had read about that happening but this was a waste. I was able to peel it right off my nails in one piece like a plastic coating. It wasn&#x27;t even an option to leave it on since it didn&#x27;t stay evenly spread out on my nails.</li>
            <li> These work really well! I especially like that you don&#x27;t really have to wipe the top coat when you&#x27;re done like other gel products.</li>
            <li> Needs to be used with gel colors to allow maximum wear time.</li>
            <li> stays on until i decide to peel it off</li>
            <li> Until purchasing this product, I had never tried gel nail polish before. However, I have found that no matter what kind of clear polish, base coat, or top coat combos I&#x27;ve tried, the polish doesn&#x27;t stand up for more than a couple of days or so before it starts peeling or chipping. I wash my hands A LOT and think this must have something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this problem even after going to get a manicure, so I decided to find a different solution. Personally, I don&#x27;t care to wear nail color on my fingernails, and prefer just a glossy clear polish. So that&#x27;s why I purchased this one, though I&#x27;m sure the colored options work equally as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Note you HAVE TO USE A UV LAMP TO DRY THIS POLISH!!!*** Do not buy this if you don&#x27;t have a lamp, because IT WILL NOT WORK!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an inexpensive lamp from Ivation along with this polish. After giving myself the usual manicure, I applied the base coat and used the timer function on my UV lamp. After the timer finished, I was confused because the polish still felt a bit tacky. I ran my hand under the lamp for another session. After that timer went off, my nails were still feeling a little tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I remembered something I&#x27;d read on the reviews when I bought it. You have to apply the top coat and place your hand under the lamp again in order for this process to work. There is some type of reaction that occurs between the components of the base coat, top coat and the UV light. So until the top coat goes on, it will feel a bit tacky, so be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a layer of the top coat, and used the lamp and timer again. When I first pulled my hand out, my nails felt dry but still as though it might be tacky underneath the surface. I thought maybe I just needed to give it a minute to cool down and harden, so I let my hand cool off since this was a new experience for me. That did the trick. After it cooled, it was perfectly hard and dry and I&#x27;ve been in love ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried the 2nd hand, I had more success since I&#x27;d figured out how it worked. For me, I ran my hand under the lamp twice with the base coat, then once with the top coat. Not sure that&#x27;s necessary, but it worked fine. This stuff is amazing. The finished product is way thicker / harder than if you&#x27;d just applied several coats of polish. It is very glossy and looks pretty. My Mom told me it looked like a salon manicure.  I&#x27;ve had zero issues with scuffing, chipping or peeling of any kind and I&#x27;m pretty hard on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lead a hectic life and don&#x27;t have a ton of time to do my nails, and typically don&#x27;t like to go to a salon except for rare occasions. This really helps extend the length of time between doing my nails, except for a little cleanup of cuticles here and there. I haven&#x27;t been wearing mine for that long, but my sister commented she&#x27;d been wearing hers for a little over 2 weeks and still had no chips or peeling. I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
