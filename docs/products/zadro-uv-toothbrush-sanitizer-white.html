    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally impressed.</li>
            <li>Bought it before i went on vacation and it works great as a storage unit as well as sanitizing.</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>Everyone thought they were great stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel over the holiday.</li>
            <li>Great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>My dental technician says the UV does work to disinfect my brushes, so that&#x27;s nice!</li>
            <li>Wiping off the toothbrush before putting it away probably is a good idea.</li>
            <li>Nice protective case.  </li>
            <li>A relief knowing that my toothbrush is +-  sterile each time I use it and not growing it&#x27;s own food</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, it works all on its own!</li>
            <li>I do love the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I will order more for others who want them also.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush case opens fine, it operates fine, my toothbrush fits into it just fine, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the Zadro sanitizer when I first received it.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>And easy to use...</li>
            <li>easy to use-works well</li>
            <li>I was very pleased at how fast it shipped.</li>
            <li>I have a $5 battery operated toothbrush that fits fine in the case.</li>
            <li>Went through airport security fine.</li>
            <li>Order and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I had another brand and the switch that turned on the light</li>
            <li>Great at home or travel especially for the price.</li>
            <li>So far, so good with this device.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Gives me the peace of mind that I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth with a clean brush every time.</li>
            <li>I think this works, but how do we really know for sure if it is killing all the germs?I use once or twice per day</li>
            <li>This is good if you use it as a travel holder since it won&#x27;t open inadvertently.  </li>
            <li>and I found out the UV does work, not bad for a tenner.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really for my electric toothbrush, so I had to bring a regular one, but I was happy to have it with all the germs going around.</li>
            <li>So, this my second purchase and I&#x27;m not disappointed, love that we can travel with a sanitized toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought four of these in different colors (one for each member of my family), we love them!.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, so that&#x27;s certainly a factor in its favor.</li>
            <li>Very handy little gadget!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t open case more than once</li>
            <li>I have had my Zadro UV Toothbrush Sanitizer for a couple of years now and use it with confidence, knowing my toothbrush it not only clean but remains clean between use by being stored in the enclosed Zadro.</li>
            <li>Works great time after time but a little tricky to open.</li>
            <li>Although the green power indicator light came on, the UV light did not.</li>
            <li>I think the UV light needs to be a tad bit larger to cover all he bristles.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>And the inside seemed to collect dirt really fast.</li>
            <li>Still, it isn&#x27;t really a problem getting them in place.  </li>
            <li>After about 2weeks the light started blinking,and 2weeks later it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, so that&#x27;s why it only gets three stars.</li>
            <li>I take a screw driver and open the whole thing to clean.</li>
            <li>After putting in batteries they worked first and every time so far.  </li>
            <li>As some reviewers have also commented, however, the cover gets harder to open the longer you own it.</li>
            <li>For the few dollars spent, this seems to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>It was highly rated..</li>
            <li>One time I did notice the UV light took about 30 seconds to turn on after having closed the case</li>
            <li>The light works as expected, so it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, at the moment.</li>
            <li>If this one continues to work as it has for the last two months, it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a brand new toothbrush *head</li>
            <li>Purchased a few of these from Amazon over the years , though the idea is great they stop working after a few months.</li>
            <li>Has been working for about a month worth of twice daily use so far, and is still going.</li>
            <li>The only significant problem I have is getting it open.  </li>
            <li>Two months later it still works and is running on the same two batteries I loaded it with originally.</li>
            <li>The 1st is still working after over a year, the 2nd was dead on arrival, the 3rd has stopped working (UV light won&#x27;t light) after 3 months.</li>
            <li>Actually, it appears to be a clever bit of technology!</li>
            <li>Clearly this is an inferior product</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase, but I find it difficult to open.</li>
            <li>and so far it works.  </li>
            <li>Previously I had a different brand of toothbrush sanitizer which was very easy to open and lasted for several years until the UV bulb burned out.</li>
            <li>We use it often and the batteries last pretty long with it.</li>
            <li>(the blue ultraviolet light wouldn&#x27;t go on) after 4 months - past the time limit for returning it.</li>
            <li>One more pain in the keester if you&#x27;re not a happy waker-upper.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My sister had one so when I read reviews I decided this would do.  I use it for my tweezers as well as toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 weeks</li>
            <li> Falls open if dropped this is not a protective case and will shoot your toothbrush across the room the sanitizer shouldn&#x27;t be kept bear a sink because water will corrode the batteries in the bottom</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, it works all on its own! Gives me the peace of mind that I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth with a clean brush every time.</li>
            <li> Works well. I hate trying to open it. Could have made larger tabs for prying it open.  Every time I open it, I have to wrestle the thing.</li>
            <li> This works well. I have had it for a year. The batteries need changed every 3-4 months but I use Dollar Store batteries. The downside is toothpaste sludge. It pools underneath the compartment. I take a screw driver and open the whole thing to clean. Wiping off the toothbrush before putting it away probably is a good idea. I have a $5 battery operated toothbrush that fits fine in the case.</li>
            <li> Nice protective case.  I think the UV light needs to be a tad bit larger to cover all he bristles.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 of these. The 1st is still working after over a year, the 2nd was dead on arrival, the 3rd has stopped working (UV light won&#x27;t light) after 3 months. Appears to be very poor quality control.</li>
            <li> Sanitizer works as described. I have had similar units in the past but the UV bulb failed in those units. So far, so good with this device.</li>
            <li> I think this works, but how do we really know for sure if it is killing all the germs?I use once or twice per day and so far it works.  Seems sturdy and this will work well for travel.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush case opens fine, it operates fine, my toothbrush fits into it just fine, it&#x27;s all good. Order and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Bought it before i went on vacation and it works great as a storage unit as well as sanitizing. Went through airport security fine.</li>
            <li> Holds battery life well. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it &amp;#34;really works&amp;#34;... how can you know? It&#x27;s not like the bristles change color. And the inside seemed to collect dirt really fast. I felt like it was dirty on the inside, didn&#x27;t know if it was helping, and ended up just tossing it out.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and easy to travel with.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost 9 months without any problems.</li>
            <li> And easy to use...It&#x27;s like having a brand new toothbrush *head* every time U use it. A relief knowing that my toothbrush is +-  sterile each time I use it and not growing it&#x27;s own food lol...</li>
            <li> We use it often and the batteries last pretty long with it.</li>
            <li> Has been working for about a month worth of twice daily use so far, and is still going. One time I did notice the UV light took about 30 seconds to turn on after having closed the case but otherwise it instantly turns on and stays lit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I do love the sanitizer.  It appears to meet my needs, but I will know if it quits working after a short time.  I had another brand and the switch that turned on the light quit working after about 6 months.  If this one continues to work as it has for the last two months, it is well worth the money.  The switch seems sturdier that the model I had previously.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t open case more than once so it went into the garbage toothbrush and all</li>
            <li> ordered 4 to give as we traveled for Christmas.  After putting in batteries they worked first and every time so far.  Everyone thought they were great stocking stuffer.  I will order more for others who want them also.  Great at home or travel especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This works well.  Some toothbrushes are shaped so that the fit in the small plastic positioning clip is difficult, particularly if the handle curves away from the axis of the brush.  Still, it isn&#x27;t really a problem getting them in place.  Snap it close and it starts working immediately.  The only significant problem I have is getting it open.  This is good if you use it as a travel holder since it won&#x27;t open inadvertently.  But with my big fingers I have a problem getting it open.</li>
            <li> it IS a pain to open so I use an envelope opener that I keep in the library to pry it open. One more pain in the keester if you&#x27;re not a happy waker-upper.Otherwise survived a trip and if the UV actually does anything it works well for a tenner. UPDATE: My dental technician says the UV does work to disinfect my brushes, so that&#x27;s nice! And of course just being in a case protects it from the spray that Dr Oz talks about from the toilet water. Opens  easier now after a while and I found the way it opens is deceiving due to color of tab, raised to 4 from 3 stars since I can open  and I found out the UV does work, not bad for a tenner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product - mine stopped working (the blue ultraviolet light wouldn&#x27;t go on) after 4 months - past the time limit for returning it. I&#x27;ll try the disposable ones next time.</li>
            <li> I bought four of these in different colors (one for each member of my family), we love them!. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> easy to use-works well</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before,but felt I should in this case.I was very pleased with the Zadro sanitizer when I first received it.After about 2weeks the light started blinking,and 2weeks later it stopped working. Changing batteries didn&#x27;t help. It was highly rated..that&#x27;s why I bought it.Very disappointed.I have never had a problem with an Amazon purchase before.</li>
            <li> Great for travel over the holiday. It didn&#x27;t really for my electric toothbrush, so I had to bring a regular one, but I was happy to have it with all the germs going around.</li>
            <li> I think the product does what is expected.  How would you know??  I find the case quite difficult to open.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I was very pleased at how fast it shipped. Great stocking stuffer. My daughter had been wanting one. I hope it gets us through flu season.</li>
            <li> Although the green power indicator light came on, the UV light did not. Clearly this is an inferior product and I seriously doubt quality inspections are performed prior to packaging.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend the product to others.  It works as represented and there were no disappointments. Actually, it appears to be a clever bit of technology!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no way to tell if this works but it makes my boyfriend feel clearer so I guess it serves a purpose.</li>
            <li> Purchased a few of these from Amazon over the years , though the idea is great they stop working after a few months.</li>
            <li> as expected and works.</li>
            <li> Broke after a week  ....junk.  Getting refund from Amazon</li>
            <li> Works great time after time but a little tricky to open. Overall, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very handy little gadget! Works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, so that&#x27;s certainly a factor in its favor. It&#x27;s cheap, so that&#x27;s why it only gets three stars. The lid closure and hinge relies on the flex of the plastic, so it&#x27;s bound to break sooner, rather than later. The light works as expected, so it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, at the moment. Later on, I&#x27;ll edit my review to tell you how long it took before it failed and how quickly it eats up batteries.    February 1st Update: Two months later it still works and is running on the same two batteries I loaded it with originally. That&#x27;s a record for any UV sanitizer I&#x27;ve ever purchased before. As some reviewers have also commented, however, the cover gets harder to open the longer you own it. Anyone with arthritis or weak hands would be happy that the product works well, but sad that they can never get their toothbrush out.</li>
            <li> For the few dollars spent, this seems to be a great product.  I&#x27;m totally impressed.</li>
            <li> I have had my Zadro UV Toothbrush Sanitizer for a couple of years now and use it with confidence, knowing my toothbrush it not only clean but remains clean between use by being stored in the enclosed Zadro.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband after he saw the one I bought myself. He loves it! So, this my second purchase and I&#x27;m not disappointed, love that we can travel with a sanitized toothbrush! Will recommend to anyone that asks.</li>
            <li> It did not work on arrival. It was returned.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase, but I find it difficult to open. I am hoping that with time it will loosen up a bit and be easier to open. Previously I had a different brand of toothbrush sanitizer which was very easy to open and lasted for several years until the UV bulb burned out. I hope that this sanitizer lasts as long as my former one did!</li>
