            <li>Great stuff great holding power</li>
            <li>Great product, great hold.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>still want to try Monster Hold just to compare, but I am totally happy with the Matt Clay.  </li>
            <li>Probably great for some people, but not me.</li>
            <li>Great bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>It works and feels great on my beard as well.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I have found that letting the hair dryer soften the top layer up before going in for a scoop is best.</li>
            <li>Easily the best hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Works good</li>
            <li>this is really a great product if you are looking for a really nice matt finish.</li>
            <li>Smells good but wouldn&#x27;t work with my hair.  </li>
            <li>A fantastic product that holds and provides excellent textured looks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, very good product, strong hold and good smell.</li>
            <li>The best way to quickly get this gunk off your hands is GoJo Mechanics Soap &amp;#62; http://tinyurl.com/p5a2ulk</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Ok so this has great hold and no shine, BUT it takes about three days to wash out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>I warm up the product with a hair dryer or warm water before applying.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how this stuff can be marketed as a hair product.</li>
            <li>My hair cut is kind of 30s gatsby-ish (not rocking</li>
            <li>, I remembered their fragrances were a bit better, but this has too much hold for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that great product!</li>
            <li>Looks like it&#x27;ll be fairly pliable and easy to work, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice smelling, shine-free, extraordinarily sturdy wax.</li>
            <li>This product is great and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The clay is by far the best I&#x27;ve used it holds all day</li>
            <li>it has great hold and makes my hair do exactly what I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t itch, but wears out quickly in my experience.</li>
            <li>I was able to work my hair into a style I wanted; however, at the end of the day it all went downhill.</li>
            <li>We are a layrite household for the most part</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will do well for men that like the greasy matte look</li>
            <li>The dryer your hair is, the better it will work.</li>
            <li>thing I love about this product is being able to restyle my hair throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>Recently tried mixing the matt clay and the monster hold to create THE PERFECT mix.  </li>
            <li>I like my hair better</li>
            <li>With a refreshing minty fragrance, you&#x27;ll want to use Uppercut Matt Clay every day.</li>
            <li>This product has strong workable hold with no shine making it very easy to achieve a textured, no shine look.</li>
            <li>I cant seem to get it to smooth out very easily.  </li>
            <li>It works best with dry hair.</li>
            <li>I regret buying this stuff, but the tin looks cool!</li>
            <li>This stuff styles fine, so</li>
            <li>Works best when your hair is slightly damp.</li>
            <li>It would be great if all you wanted was the standard greaser look.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stress how important that its.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with all types of hair products from cheap gels to pomade.  </li>
            <li>It is a light and pleasing smell that fades as it dries in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I imagine anyone using this on a daily basis probably adds a good 30 minutes or more to their styling and showering time just removing the product off of them.</li>
            <li>Was excited after I opened the package and applied it.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair in a psychobilly style flat top quiff about 3 inches straight up and this stuff is the best I have tried so far for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The clay is very think and has a very  light peppermint scent.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the same consistency of a Hans De Fuko Claymation but good nonetheless.</li>
            <li>This is for someone who doesn&#x27;t do much physical activity and wants to look great.</li>
            <li>This is not water based and does not wash out quick.</li>
            <li>I use a light amount and not daily and honestly</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got curly hair, and I tend to like matte clays because they calm the fro with no waxiness or shine.</li>
            <li>I say like three or four showers or even more will completely remove the clay off your hair.</li>
            <li>My goals are simple.&lt;br /&gt;1 - be able to craft classic 20s-50s hair styles with a modern spin&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to live with.</li>
            <li>The light decent smell is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I have asian hair, the kind that always likes to stick up, and well this product is exactly what i need.  </li>
            <li>The results are a nice dry look.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love it but the only con that cause a star is that it is really, LIKE REALLY!!</li>
            <li>hot days it does not melt in the heat like some pomades.</li>
            <li>More like a John Wayne after barfight mixed with a hungover David Beckham look.</li>
            <li>Be aware though, this is a petroleum based product so it will not come out of your hair with one wash.</li>
            <li>But overall in my opinion, I love this product</li>
            <li>The aesthetic of the tin, their website and many of the hair cuts they showcase represent my goals listed above.</li>
            <li>and although Minoxidil has been slowing down that process, it is important that I use a matte product that allows me more volume.</li>
            <li>First time I figured I&#x27;d used too much and chalked it up to user error.  </li>
            <li>Took multiple shampooings in one sitting for my hair to feel normal again, but it&#x27;s still not all out, I&#x27;ll have to work on that some more when I get home.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this product is that I position my hair the way I would like dry</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t that easy to work with for a low maintenance look.</li>
            <li>I love this for a loose worn in look.</li>
            <li>Great hold on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to style their hair to perfection.</li>
            <li>After 3-4 washes with soap and really scrubbing, I then had to rinse my hair out</li>
            <li>I sometimes have to add a bit during the day when I am not working, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>have to admit I am really into the Uppercut line.</li>
            <li>5 stars for X-TREEM hold, good smell, but 2 stars for being too thick, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good clay, but I was looking for something with a little less hold, and easily manipulated after it was in.</li>
            <li>(depends how much you use) a little bit if good enough.</li>
            <li>- Classic classic pliable hold.</li>
            <li>this gives a very natural no shine finish and a modern chunky lift and texture.</li>
            <li>big thing about it is that it&#x27;s not water based, which is my own fault for not looking at, but I read other reviews and got the impression that it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fun to try, and I&#x27;ll use it every now and then, but not my daily driver.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Matrix Dirty Trix messy matte clay, but a good replacement.</li>
            <li>I switched to a better barber shop a few months ago and started using this product right around the same time and have gotten tons of compliments from strangers on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not hard to wash out considering the hold.</li>
            <li>a 50&#x27;s clipper fade right now) and this clay helps me just toss my hair back with my finger and let it chunk and fall.</li>
            <li>The matt clay keeps your hair down while the monster hold gives it that strong pomade to style it.</li>
            <li>and it was a new product to try on his unruly mane.  </li>
            <li>I think the only hair style this product would be good for is a flat greased back look and someone with 60-grit sand paper next to their sink to get it off your hands.</li>
            <li>If you use it heavy it will take days and many washes to get out completely.</li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s not matte, it&#x27;s low gloss.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, allows you to manipulate your hair easily.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is gross and really upsetting.</li>
            <li>It gives the natural look and holds it in place.</li>
            <li>Throw away the old way and use this stuff if that is your deal.</li>
            <li>Very thick, great for short hair feels a little tacky at first.</li>
            <li>This stuff looks the exact same when you put it in as it does hours later.</li>
            <li>-  find product(s) that wash out easy-ish&lt;br /&gt;4 - find products that if left in overnight do not feel overly tacky, greasy, brittle or stain the pillow&lt;br /&gt;5 - find products that resemble the feel and hold of real old school products (no &amp;#34;pomades&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair down and looking fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this product (hold, scent) EXCEPT for the fact that its hard to initially work into my hair.  </li>
            <li>Can last whole day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to keep a side part all day long with this stuff, which is a challenge with my extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li>This certainly holds well, and there&#x27;s no shine, but it&#x27;s extremely waxy.</li>
            <li>Some may not like that it is hard to wash out, however, I enjoy it because I can use what is left in it the next day to style my hair without any product and the look that there is no product at all.</li>
            <li>When I was using Reformer I had to add a lot several times a day, it was more expensive, and it didn&#x27;t look nearly as cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so powerful that a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>I recommend pointing a hot hair dryer at it for a few minutes to soften up the wax prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li> First off, it&#x27;s not matte, it&#x27;s low gloss.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, allows you to manipulate your hair easily.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is gross and really upsetting.</li>
            <li> It gives the natural look and holds it in place.</li>
            <li> Throw away the old way and use this stuff if that is your deal.</li>
            <li> Very thick, great for short hair feels a little tacky at first.</li>
            <li> This stuff looks the exact same when you put it in as it does hours later.</li>
            <li> -  find product(s) that wash out easy-ish&lt;br /&gt;4 - find products that if left in overnight do not feel overly tacky, greasy, brittle or stain the pillow&lt;br /&gt;5 - find products that resemble the feel and hold of real old school products (no &amp;#34;pomades&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair down and looking fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this product (hold, scent) EXCEPT for the fact that its hard to initially work into my hair.  </li>
            <li> Can last whole day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to keep a side part all day long with this stuff, which is a challenge with my extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> This certainly holds well, and there&#x27;s no shine, but it&#x27;s extremely waxy.</li>
            <li> Some may not like that it is hard to wash out, however, I enjoy it because I can use what is left in it the next day to style my hair without any product and the look that there is no product at all.</li>
            <li> When I was using Reformer I had to add a lot several times a day, it was more expensive, and it didn&#x27;t look nearly as cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so powerful that a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I recommend pointing a hot hair dryer at it for a few minutes to soften up the wax prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The Matt clay gives a unique hold and no shine, the only issue is, it takes a long time washing out the product out of my hand and i am serious when I say it stays in your hand for a long time.</li>
            <li> All I could achieve is a flat look, not separated, not quaffed, nothing.</li>
            <li> When used with other products this clay is a great base to give lift and mold to any style.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a little bit, just the finger tip is enough you need to rub it in your hand before applying it.</li>
            <li> It says on the can to apply with dry hair and dry hands</li>
            <li> Occasionally wearing bucket hats and bandanas with a pastel button down, locoste belt, and weed print tube</li>
            <li> But most importantly it&#x27;s impossible to get out of your hair.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you have to wash your hands after using it and it smells slightly like shoe polish,</li>
            <li> Truth is, it&#x27;s not really a clay at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would be careful since when trying to apply this product, tons of hair will get pulled out along the way.</li>
            <li> and I am using it as a once every other day or so light base layer to keep my naturally frizzy hair under control.</li>
            <li> It felt like any other clay/wax would in my hands, so I expected the tackiness.</li>
            <li> I was using Mitch Reformer and tried LS&amp;B Raw Earth, but Uppercut Matt Clay is a head and shoulders above, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This being said, a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Anyway, his hair is pretty thick and he has at least 3 extremely stubborn cowlicks.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a thick/tough paste, it&#x27;s hard to work into dry hair (actually can pull hairs out!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely greasy and resists all attempts to wash it out.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used every product from American Crew and used Layrite and Layrite Superhold.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> But like other oil based products, that is not the intent, so know what you&#x27;re getting into.</li>
            <li> This is so hard that it is incapable of being softened to actually use.</li>
            <li> As in like &#x27;4 lather-and-repeats later it&#x27;s still there&#x27; thick.</li>
            <li> and I can still style my hair at the end of the day even with two 20 min car rides with the windows down.  </li>
            <li> A little bit shiny for a clay...</li>
            <li> Taking a little amount and working it between my hands eventually turned it into a dried glue feeling and made me wonder how I was going to get it into my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is useless to me and had to be thrown out after multiple tries to come up with a useable tactic for styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much trouble taking it out of one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It balls up in sections on your hands and you have to scrape it off, like dried tacky glue-balls.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and it&#x27;s lasted me 3 months</li>
            <li> that harden stiff like hair</li>
            <li> : It does not easily wash out.</li>
            <li> Little hard to wash out but just use your shampoo 2x</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my hair look, but it gave me HORRIBLE forehead and temple acne....</li>
            <li> I said screw this and went to wash the clay off my hands which was also near impossible.</li>
            <li> This also proved to be near impossible.</li>
            <li> u have to work little too hard with your hands and also it&#x27;s very hard to wash out from your hair</li>
            <li> Really really hard and pasty.</li>
            <li> understand it&#x27;s supposed to be a hard hold, but it&#x27;s so hard that you cannot even apply it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to wash out</li>
            <li> Hard to wash of hands.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair up every day, so I like the fact that it&#x27;s hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li> just one negative thing is that it is hard to wash it off from your hair.</li>
            <li> It is however really hard to remove as it is really thick.</li>
            <li> Trying to do it otherwise seems at least quasi-futile.</li>
            <li> Dad will sue&amp;#34; haircut of late.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick.</li>
            <li> The product description warned me not to be fooled by its thick consistency, so I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Ordered Matt Clay, so it&#x27;s thick wax and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, difficult to remove, builds up horribly, and most closely resembles shoe polish.  </li>
            <li> It was impossible to work through my hair, and just ended up cementing my hair flat against my head.</li>
            <li> No matter how small of an amount I applied, it was difficult to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hard and difficult to remove it from your hair and hands.</li>
            <li> The hold stays and with my thin hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worse to wash out than Murray&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to bad mouth</li>
            <li> Difficult to get off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will have to experiment with quantities to see if Im doing something wrong...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of other Uppercut products, but this Matt Clay is the worst.</li>
            <li> My apologies for the dirty mirror, it was an in the moment pic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is breaking my forehead out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have a dirty job doing metalwork</li>
            <li> Just plain awful.</li>
            <li> Applied to my hair and attempted to style, practically impossible.</li>
            <li> Impossible to remove from hands.</li>
            <li> Bad product to remove off hands and hair.</li>
            <li> I was literally frustrated with the product.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I cannot say I hate it, but I dislike it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 - find product(s) that do not smell awful</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  </li>

            <li> This stuff styles fine, so I cannot say I hate it, but I dislike it. It felt like any other clay/wax would in my hands, so I expected the tackiness. I was able to work my hair into a style I wanted; however, at the end of the day it all went downhill. I hopped into the showers, and mind you that I&#x27;m a 10-minute shower guy. I didn&#x27;t get out until 30 minutes after. I stood in the showers shampooing my hair for the longest time. I would lather, rinse, and repeat, but to no avail. I was literally frustrated with the product. I was cursing under my breath. I finally gave up after the 5th try. I felt defeated. Now I will have to sleep with product in my hair. I regret buying this stuff, but the tin looks cool! Anyways, do not buy this stuff. It&#x27;s too much trouble taking it out of one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Not too heavy, allows you to manipulate your hair easily.  The only downside is that you have to wash your hands after using it and it smells slightly like shoe polish, that&#x27;s easy to live with.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan. It&#x27;s really hard for me to bad mouth a product but this just wasn&#x27;t for me. First off, it&#x27;s not matte, it&#x27;s low gloss. But most importantly it&#x27;s impossible to get out of your hair. It&#x27;s extremely greasy and resists all attempts to wash it out. It took me about 5 washes over 2 days to get out the tiniest amount. I will not be reordering. This product is useless to me and had to be thrown out after multiple tries to come up with a useable tactic for styling. It would be great if all you wanted was the standard greaser look.</li>
            <li> Pros: This product works great! it has great hold and makes my hair do exactly what I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It does not easily wash out.</li>
            <li> This is so hard that it is incapable of being softened to actually use. It actually pulled some of my husbands hair out. It says matt clay but thats actually what your getting; clay. This shouldn&#x27;t even be a hair product. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li> Great stuff great holding power</li>
            <li> This product is great and well worth the price. The clay is very think and has a very  light peppermint scent. You only need to apply a little bit, just the finger tip is enough you need to rub it in your hand before applying it. It works best with dry hair. The clay is by far the best I&#x27;ve used it holds all day even it hot days it does not melt in the heat like some pomades. It is however really hard to remove as it is really thick. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to style their hair to perfection.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Uppercut Matt Clay and I have to say ... it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big thing about it is that it&#x27;s not water based, which is my own fault for not looking at, but I read other reviews and got the impression that it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good clay, but I was looking for something with a little less hold, and easily manipulated after it was in. I use Layrite Clay for this, but the smell isn&#x27;t what you would consider &amp;#34;pleasant&amp;#34;, so being a buyer of Uppercut before, I remembered their fragrances were a bit better, but this has too much hold for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that great product!</li>
            <li> Like putting wax in your hair. took 3 shampooing to take it out</li>
            <li> Really really hard and pasty. Difficult to get off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand it&#x27;s supposed to be a hard hold, but it&#x27;s so hard that you cannot even apply it.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time and is the best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> Works good but it&#x27;s hard to wash out</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my hair look, but it gave me HORRIBLE forehead and temple acne....I will be looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Great product, great hold. For folks with medium or longer hair, you may want to reconsider (or I need lessons in applying). I have found that letting the hair dryer soften the top layer up before going in for a scoop is best. Trying to do it otherwise seems at least quasi-futile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of other Uppercut products, but this Matt Clay is the worst. Looks like it&#x27;ll be fairly pliable and easy to work, and watching videos online of how to use and apply even make it seem effortless. Not the case at all! Taking a little amount and working it between my hands eventually turned it into a dried glue feeling and made me wonder how I was going to get it into my hair. Applied to my hair and attempted to style, practically impossible. All I could achieve is a flat look, not separated, not quaffed, nothing. It just laid there and every pass through with my hands/fingers led to my hair getting ripped out, even using a Denman brush yielded the same results. I said screw this and went to wash the clay off my hands which was also near impossible. It balls up in sections on your hands and you have to scrape it off, like dried tacky glue-balls. After 3-4 washes with soap and really scrubbing, I then had to rinse my hair out so I could throw a hat on for the day. This also proved to be near impossible. Took multiple shampooings in one sitting for my hair to feel normal again, but it&#x27;s still not all out, I&#x27;ll have to work on that some more when I get home. I think the only hair style this product would be good for is a flat greased back look and someone with 60-grit sand paper next to their sink to get it off your hands. I imagine anyone using this on a daily basis probably adds a good 30 minutes or more to their styling and showering time just removing the product off of them. This stuff is gross and really upsetting. I will be returning.</li>
            <li> Easily the best hair product I&#x27;ve used. Works best when your hair is slightly damp. Since it&#x27;s a thick/tough paste, it&#x27;s hard to work into dry hair (actually can pull hairs out!). It&#x27;s so powerful that a little goes a LONG way. I use this product everyday and it&#x27;s lasted me 3 months and I&#x27;m only halfway through the can.</li>
            <li> Great hold on both wet and dry hair. Can last whole day long. Not hard to wash out considering the hold. The light decent smell is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Use it once and you&#x27;ll still have it in your hair 3 days later.  Going in the trash after two uses.  First time I figured I&#x27;d used too much and chalked it up to user error.  Second time I conceded that the product is simply unusable.</li>
            <li> A little bit shiny for a clay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, very good product, strong hold and good smell.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! It gives the natural look and holds it in place. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product! My apologies for the dirty mirror, it was an in the moment pic. Was excited after I opened the package and applied it.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used every product from American Crew and used Layrite and Layrite Superhold. My hair has been thinning the last year or so and although Minoxidil has been slowing down that process, it is important that I use a matte product that allows me more volume. My favorite part about this product is that I position my hair the way I would like dry and I just move the clay into it. This stuff looks the exact same when you put it in as it does hours later. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product. The hold stays and with my thin hair the matte look is perfect. Some may not like that it is hard to wash out, however, I enjoy it because I can use what is left in it the next day to style my hair without any product and the look that there is no product at all. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my brother. He&#x27;s rockin&#x27; the &amp;#34;My Dad will sue&amp;#34; haircut of late. Occasionally wearing bucket hats and bandanas with a pastel button down, locoste belt, and weed print tube socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, his hair is pretty thick and he has at least 3 extremely stubborn cowlicks. This isn&#x27;t that easy to work with for a low maintenance look. I cut and style his hair and it was a new product to try on his unruly mane.  Kinda disappointed. We are a layrite household for the most part but this brand intrigued me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will do well for men that like the greasy matte look but that&#x27;s not what he was going for. More like a John Wayne after barfight mixed with a hungover David Beckham look.</li>
            <li> Great product. Little hard to wash out but just use your shampoo 2x and it should work.</li>
            <li> Impossible to remove from hands.</li>
            <li> Very thick, great for short hair feels a little tacky at first. Not as good as Matrix Dirty Trix messy matte clay, but a good replacement. Has  peppermint smell. Hard to wash of hands. I warm up the product with a hair dryer or warm water before applying. The results are a nice dry look.</li>
            <li> This stuff is breaking my forehead out like crazy. I had the same problem with Brylecream. Other than that, it works like a charm. I&#x27;m able to keep a side part all day long with this stuff, which is a challenge with my extremely thick hair. It says on the can to apply with dry hair and dry hands and I can&#x27;t stress how important that its. The dryer your hair is, the better it will work.</li>
            <li> Bad product to remove off hands and hair.</li>
            <li> Could hold stronger, it doesn&#x27;t hold up well to a day of work in the restaurant. This is for someone who doesn&#x27;t do much physical activity and wants to look great. Smells good, doesn&#x27;t itch, but wears out quickly in my experience. Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough, IDK.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product (hold, scent) EXCEPT for the fact that its hard to initially work into my hair.  feels like Im ripping my hair out trying to work it in, then it inevitably feels frizzy.  I cant seem to get it to smooth out very easily.  Will have to experiment with quantities to see if Im doing something wrong...</li>
            <li> This product has strong workable hold with no shine making it very easy to achieve a textured, no shine look. Be aware though, this is a petroleum based product so it will not come out of your hair with one wash. But like other oil based products, that is not the intent, so know what you&#x27;re getting into. My only qualm with this product is that it is a tad pricey in my opinion for only about 2.5oz. This being said, a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in a psychobilly style flat top quiff about 3 inches straight up and this stuff is the best I have tried so far for my fine hair.  I have experimented with all types of hair products from cheap gels to pomade.  I was using Mitch Reformer and tried LS&amp;B Raw Earth, but Uppercut Matt Clay is a head and shoulders above, in my opinion.  I switched to a better barber shop a few months ago and started using this product right around the same time and have gotten tons of compliments from strangers on my hair.  I&#x27;m in a rockabilly band, so it&#x27;s of the utmost importance, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love about this product is being able to restyle my hair throughout the day.  I have a dirty job doing metalwork and I can still style my hair at the end of the day even with two 20 min car rides with the windows down.  I sometimes have to add a bit during the day when I am not working, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  When I was using Reformer I had to add a lot several times a day, it was more expensive, and it didn&#x27;t look nearly as cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still want to try Monster Hold just to compare, but I am totally happy with the Matt Clay.  I wear my hair up every day, so I like the fact that it&#x27;s hard to wash out.  Don&#x27;t like the smell though, but it&#x27;s no big deal since you only smell it when you open the can.</li>
            <li> Just plain awful. Rather than being clay-like, it was rubber-like. It was impossible to work through my hair, and just ended up cementing my hair flat against my head. When I finally gave up on the product, I went to wash it out BUT IT WOULDN&#x27;T COME OUT! It took 5 shampooings before I finally got this junk out of my hair. I honestly don&#x27;t know how this stuff can be marketed as a hair product.</li>
            <li> The Matt clay gives a unique hold and no shine, the only issue is, it takes a long time washing out the product out of my hand and i am serious when I say it stays in your hand for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- I recommend pointing a hot hair dryer at it for a few minutes to soften up the wax prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;- If you get some clumpy residue in your hair, just blast it with the hair dryer to work it out.&lt;br /&gt;- The best way to quickly get this gunk off your hands is GoJo Mechanics Soap &amp;#62; http://tinyurl.com/p5a2ulk</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick. As in like &#x27;4 lather-and-repeats later it&#x27;s still there&#x27; thick. The product description warned me not to be fooled by its thick consistency, so I wasn&#x27;t. But perhaps I should have been. I&#x27;ve got curly hair, and I tend to like matte clays because they calm the fro with no waxiness or shine. This certainly holds well, and there&#x27;s no shine, but it&#x27;s extremely waxy. Like, the waxiest. (I emulsified for weeks and it never softened.) Truth is, it&#x27;s not really a clay at all. It&#x27;s a very nice smelling, shine-free, extraordinarily sturdy wax. So if you&#x27;re looking for a matte clay that will leave your hair touchable and doesn&#x27;t require paint thinner to remove, you may need to look elsewhere. That said, if you&#x27;re looking for a no-shine wax to hold your hair through hurricane season, this would appear to be that.</li>
            <li> this is really a great product if you are looking for a really nice matt finish. Personally, I love it but the only con that cause a star is that it is really, LIKE REALLY!! hard and difficult to remove it from your hair and hands. I say like three or four showers or even more will completely remove the clay off your hair. (depends how much you use) a little bit if good enough. But overall in my opinion, I love this product just one negative thing is that it is hard to wash it off from your hair. hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I have asian hair, the kind that always likes to stick up, and well this product is exactly what i need.  Keeps my hair down and looking fresh all day.  Recently tried mixing the matt clay and the monster hold to create THE PERFECT mix.  The matt clay keeps your hair down while the monster hold gives it that strong pomade to style it.</li>
            <li> 3 stars over all. 5 stars for X-TREEM hold, good smell, but 2 stars for being too thick, and it&#x27;s worse to wash out than Murray&#x27;s. Probably great for some people, but not me. Fun to try, and I&#x27;ll use it every now and then, but not my daily driver.</li>
            <li> I have been on a pomade/paste/wax/clay mission. My goals are simple.&lt;br /&gt;1 - be able to craft classic 20s-50s hair styles with a modern spin&lt;br /&gt;2 - find product(s) that do not smell awful&lt;br /&gt;3 -  find product(s) that wash out easy-ish&lt;br /&gt;4 - find products that if left in overnight do not feel overly tacky, greasy, brittle or stain the pillow&lt;br /&gt;5 - find products that resemble the feel and hold of real old school products (no &amp;#34;pomades&amp;#34; that harden stiff like hair gel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I am really into the Uppercut line. The aesthetic of the tin, their website and many of the hair cuts they showcase represent my goals listed above. The Matt Clay is no exception and I am using it as a once every other day or so light base layer to keep my naturally frizzy hair under control. Here are my point by point notes based on the goals above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Used by itself this gives a very natural no shine finish and a modern chunky lift and texture. I love this for a loose worn in look. My hair cut is kind of 30s gatsby-ish (not rocking a 50&#x27;s clipper fade right now) and this clay helps me just toss my hair back with my finger and let it chunk and fall. When used with other products this clay is a great base to give lift and mold to any style.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Smells like mint. It is a light and pleasing smell that fades as it dries in.&lt;br /&gt;3 - This is the reason for 4 not 5 stars. This is not water based and does not wash out quick. If you use it heavy it will take days and many washes to get out completely. I use a light amount and not daily and honestly I like my hair better (it is frizzy) with a bit of the clay in at all times.&lt;br /&gt;4 - No grease, no tack, never brittle and no pillow stain. This feels natural.&lt;br /&gt;5 - Classic classic pliable hold. Throw away the old way and use this stuff if that is your deal.</li>
            <li> Ordered Matt Clay, so it&#x27;s thick wax and u have to work little too hard with your hands and also it&#x27;s very hard to wash out from your hair</li>
            <li> Ok so this has great hold and no shine, BUT it takes about three days to wash out.  Im torn</li>
            <li> Great bang for your buck.  Don&#x27;t expect the same consistency of a Hans De Fuko Claymation but good nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Smells good but wouldn&#x27;t work with my hair.  No matter how small of an amount I applied, it was difficult to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be careful since when trying to apply this product, tons of hair will get pulled out along the way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  It it simply a wax.  It&#x27;s waterproof, difficult to remove, builds up horribly, and most closely resembles shoe polish.  Never again.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product that holds and provides excellent textured looks. It works and feels great on my beard as well.  With a refreshing minty fragrance, you&#x27;ll want to use Uppercut Matt Clay every day.</li>
            <li> Great product. Moderate hold.</li>
