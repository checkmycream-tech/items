            <li>Best place to purchase this large bottle.</li>
            <li>But for others it may be amazing.</li>
            <li>It cleans her her hair nicely, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t wash out her hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>I had been using this product for about five years and liked it but got sucked in by one of those infomercials with</li>
            <li>I tried it for about a year and decided that I liked Redkin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it online without having to leave the house, and at a better price.</li>
            <li>so when I saw this large bottle I thought the price was great</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>and I love the products.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments with my hair, even after 3 weeks after I had my hair done.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo every time I wash my hair and love the way it cleans and makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>i love it when i can get it sent to me asap.great product..</li>
            <li>The more I lathered my hair up, though, the more tangled my hair felt.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels much better.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE SHAMPOO</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>I use this Redken Shampoo with the Mystic Oil Gold Conditioner to leave my hair healthy and not frizzy/</li>
            <li>I have been using Redken Color Extend for sometime and love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Do your research and you will find this comes up twords the top of the pile if not at the top.</li>
            <li>Great item and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better save the color of my hair</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the way it leaves my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels wonderful and let&#x27;s my color last longer!</li>
            <li>And I am very happy that I went back</li>
            <li>Love this product ..</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for my salon colored hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>But I think there is probably better for her out there.</li>
            <li>You may love it.</li>
            <li>everything seemed good; shampoo looked and felt normal, nice consistency, etc.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist strongly recommended this product for my color-treated hair, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  </li>
            <li>BEST shampoo for long fine colored hair.</li>
            <li>A pleasant smell and more importantly, not a watered-down product so a bottle lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the price is right!</li>
            <li>It feels to me this bottle is such a good buy for a Redken product because it&#x27;s cheap shampoo put in a redken bottle, though I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>I guess they meant &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to assure you it isn&#x27;t cheap &amp;#34;re- manufactured&amp;#34; shampoo in a Redken bottle.......</li>
            <li>Fortunately I saved&lt;br /&gt;thier phone number and cancelled the order.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product in the larger size.  </li>
            <li>My salon has changed to a new brand of color that I like better, but when I tried a sample of their shampoo (on the premise that using a product formulated for their chemistry would work better at maintaining color)</li>
            <li>I used it and noticed it doesn&#x27;t smell like the redken I am familiar with</li>
            <li>Great for damaged or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It truly washes my hair clean without stripping out the color.</li>
            <li>The whole family has been using this product, and they all love how it works on their hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and silky- honestly don&#x27;t even need the conditioner (it&#x27;s just an added bonus).</li>
            <li>whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>ago!!many many thanks to you all</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair color vibrant and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone dealing with hair texture that is becoming coarser due to graying ,  This product also does extend the time between dye jobs.</li>
            <li>I had my hair colored a very pretty auburn color</li>
            <li>it does seem to make a difference in my color lasting longer than normal, Im happy with the  purchase.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for getting my shampoo to me so quick!  </li>
            <li>Top rated product and seems to keep colour in longer -- yes I am old and gray without a touch up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can see my original color now, and look more tinted than full-on red.  </li>
            <li>Save dollars ordering from Amazon plus free shipping, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>In this case, I think the compensation would be absolutely required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: The good news is, now that it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>Much more economical than buying the smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li>I must say, this is certainly better than the Pantene or other cheap junk they sell at Box Mart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that it would be better in combination with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I share this ;-)).</li>
            <li>Both shampoo bottles arrived as described and work great on my thick brown color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as other shampoos either.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, lather, a nickle size goes a long way on my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this when I got my hair colored for the first time ever, &amp; it is gentle on my hair and works well.</li>
            <li>and I was anxious for a good wash.  </li>
            <li>Makes my color treated hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>Her mother had achieved much softer hair utilizing this product</li>
            <li>Going to my local store to purchase genuine Redken Colir Extend.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, will order again.</li>
            <li>You kept promising it would arrive</li>
            <li>It really extends the life of my color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and really like it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Item arrived as promised and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>My hair has a tendency to be quite oily (I have long fine straight hair)</li>
            <li>It is not so good.i think extreme shampoo and conditioner from redken is better</li>
            <li>So I have stuck with the Redken, and while it is certainly pricier than drug store shampoos, I feel like it is worth it, especially considering how much I pay to get my hair done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redken Color Extend for years - for those of us with red color, which fades more quickly over time than other colors, this product helps to lengthen the time between colors</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and leaves it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it is only after I use Redkin that I experience the undesired results.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Price was too high.  </li>
            <li>Ended up having tremendous difficulty rinsing it out, as it became extremely matted with the product in, and felt more dry and brittle, rather than clean, even while still wet from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My color did fade to reveal some gray at my temples and normally washing with this shampoo preserves my color.</li>
            <li>The new color used by the salon lasts even longer than their Redken did, so I haven&#x27;t had any problem from \\&quot;cross-contaminating\\</li>
            <li>new fangled shampoo and all of its bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>and I bought this to use in hopes of extending the color, as I know all shades of red fade fast, but within two weeks it was very noticeable that the color had faded.</li>
            <li>It maintains the color and leaves hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Shampoo that makes the cycle of dying my own hair last two weeks longer than usual.</li>
            <li>Really liking this shampoo, feels very moisturizing for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I like to dye my hair various colors, but I have very fine and delicate hair that doesn&#x27;t hold color very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and the color stays around.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 11 year old daughter who had her hair highlighted.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of using this product once a week and find a better daily shampoo so that I will not have to wash my hair everyday as it is making my hair color fade from over washing.</li>
            <li>So far I really enjoy this shampoo, my color has stayed vibrant and at the same time my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too dried out or damaged!</li>
            <li>I found that it left my oily hair limp and lifeless very quickly after washing.</li>
            <li>Granted, it was only the $10 Loreal kind, but a week of washing with hot water (because I won&#x27;t stick my head in cold even for color)</li>
            <li>Since I was only washing it with water, my hair felt pretty dry</li>
            <li>why would anyone label a product they purchased directly from the manufacturer as such</li>
            <li>(and Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive with salons, although you can occasionally get BOGO offers through the salons.)</li>
            <li>I am not certain if it is really helping retain the hair color since I have to wash it so often.</li>
            <li>About six months ago I first dyed my hair black.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out either.  </li>
            <li>color unchanged, hair soft and not bogged down,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s first time dying my hair from asian black to pulm red, so I&#x27;m not sure how color really fades that much with other shampoos.</li>
            <li>The 33.8 oz bottle is a little large to handle</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Both shampoo bottles arrived as described and work great on my thick brown color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as other shampoos either.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, lather, a nickle size goes a long way on my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this when I got my hair colored for the first time ever, &amp; it is gentle on my hair and works well.</li>
            <li> and I was anxious for a good wash.  </li>
            <li> Makes my color treated hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> Her mother had achieved much softer hair utilizing this product</li>
            <li> Going to my local store to purchase genuine Redken Colir Extend.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, will order again.</li>
            <li> You kept promising it would arrive</li>
            <li> It really extends the life of my color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and really like it.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Item arrived as promised and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to be quite oily (I have long fine straight hair)</li>
            <li> It is not so good.i think extreme shampoo and conditioner from redken is better</li>
            <li> So I have stuck with the Redken, and while it is certainly pricier than drug store shampoos, I feel like it is worth it, especially considering how much I pay to get my hair done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken Color Extend for years - for those of us with red color, which fades more quickly over time than other colors, this product helps to lengthen the time between colors</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and leaves it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it is only after I use Redkin that I experience the undesired results.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Price was too high.  </li>
            <li> Ended up having tremendous difficulty rinsing it out, as it became extremely matted with the product in, and felt more dry and brittle, rather than clean, even while still wet from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My color did fade to reveal some gray at my temples and normally washing with this shampoo preserves my color.</li>
            <li> The new color used by the salon lasts even longer than their Redken did, so I haven&#x27;t had any problem from \\&quot;cross-contaminating\\</li>
            <li> new fangled shampoo and all of its bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> and I bought this to use in hopes of extending the color, as I know all shades of red fade fast, but within two weeks it was very noticeable that the color had faded.</li>
            <li> It maintains the color and leaves hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Shampoo that makes the cycle of dying my own hair last two weeks longer than usual.</li>
            <li> Really liking this shampoo, feels very moisturizing for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I like to dye my hair various colors, but I have very fine and delicate hair that doesn&#x27;t hold color very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and the color stays around.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 11 year old daughter who had her hair highlighted.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of using this product once a week and find a better daily shampoo so that I will not have to wash my hair everyday as it is making my hair color fade from over washing.</li>
            <li> So far I really enjoy this shampoo, my color has stayed vibrant and at the same time my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too dried out or damaged!</li>
            <li> I found that it left my oily hair limp and lifeless very quickly after washing.</li>
            <li> Granted, it was only the $10 Loreal kind, but a week of washing with hot water (because I won&#x27;t stick my head in cold even for color)</li>
            <li> Since I was only washing it with water, my hair felt pretty dry</li>
            <li> why would anyone label a product they purchased directly from the manufacturer as such</li>
            <li> (and Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive with salons, although you can occasionally get BOGO offers through the salons.)</li>
            <li> I am not certain if it is really helping retain the hair color since I have to wash it so often.</li>
            <li> About six months ago I first dyed my hair black.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out either.  </li>
            <li> color unchanged, hair soft and not bogged down,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s first time dying my hair from asian black to pulm red, so I&#x27;m not sure how color really fades that much with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> The 33.8 oz bottle is a little large to handle</li>
            <li> If you buy it in the big bottles it last a long time.</li>
            <li> It actually feels smoother and softer than it did while it was wet</li>
            <li> If it is not very thoroughly rinsed it gives her a back of the head frizz.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I visited my beautician and expressed my concern over my hair turning coarse due to it beginning to gray.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it maintain the color, but it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other products.</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t show any difference in color and a single rinse with this shows about a 50% decrease.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I want to stretch my color as long as possible without the chlorine in the water or harsh chemicals in my shampoo stripping it or leaving it brassy before its time, and this product seems to help.</li>
            <li> and my scalp is very dry.</li>
            <li> The bad news is that most of my color went out with the wash.  </li>
            <li> For instance, I&#x27;ll need to dye it again soon because my roots are about 1/2 to an inch long, but my hair is still as black as the day I dyed</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that the shampoo leaked in the box.</li>
            <li> Like what other reviewers say, this product keeps the life of color in your hair.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the product coming from my small bottle that I know Is redken color extend.</li>
            <li> then any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> If I wash my hair the night before it is always extremely greasy in the a.m.</li>
            <li> I recently found out that stores like Ulta sell small bottles for travel.</li>
            <li> Very confused by the overwhelmingly positive reviews to this, on which I based my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use conditioners because they cause the opposite problem and leave my hair too slippery and limp.  </li>
            <li> I USE THIS SHAMPOO TO PULL COLOR OUT OF MY HAIR WHEN MY HAIR HAS BEEN DYED TOO DARK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since buying it I&#x27;ve dyed my hair black three times.</li>
            <li> I started using this product years ago when the salon I went to used Redken products, hoping to hold onto that expensive color as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I have experimented to see if it was this product by using a few others in between uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I gave it four stars is, as someone else mentioned, it has dried out my hair a bit</li>
            <li> A small bottle runs around $16-18 (10.1oz)</li>
            <li> but it is even worse with this product compared to other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> So, this product doesn&#x27;t do much for over-the-counter color. :(</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve always had an issue with dry-scalp when it&#x27;s cold outside</li>
            <li> Service was a bit slow</li>
            <li> They were not happy.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels soft at the ends but the roots are horrible.  </li>
            <li> And yes, I have used their conditioner which is useless.  </li>
            <li> (weird).  </li>
            <li> #34;I hope thus isn&#x27;t fake product packed in a redken bottle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very difficult to describe, but I had a terrible time managing my hair afterward.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my color treated hair very manageable. Will purchase again. The whole family has been using this product, and they all love how it works on their hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever made..also the conditioner. Helps keep color longer! Try it..also the Redken Clarifying shampoo is a must to get all product residue out of hair... Have used this for 26 yrs!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Redken Color Extend Shampoo for years and without a doubt Amazon has the best price. I buy all my Redken products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 3 months. I swore that when my big bottle is used up that I would stop using it because it leaves my hair matted after washing it.  And yes, I have used their conditioner which is useless.  I have coarse hair but this stuff is leaving it like straw, and it dries it out.  I have experimented to see if it was this product by using a few others in between uses.  Sure enough, it is only after I use Redkin that I experience the undesired results.  I cannot recommend this brand or product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the conditioner and I love the products. It keeps my hair color vibrant and healthy looking. With all the coloring and highlighting, you need to have a great shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair color to not fade. I highly recommend this product. I get so many compliments with my hair, even after 3 weeks after I had my hair done.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo every time I wash my hair and love the way it cleans and makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s first time dying my hair from asian black to pulm red, so I&#x27;m not sure how color really fades that much with other shampoos. So far I really enjoy this shampoo, my color has stayed vibrant and at the same time my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too dried out or damaged! Great price for the size of the bottle. The package came in timely. I read in other reviews that the shampoo leaked in the box. Mine came taped around the lid so it didn&#x27;t spill. Efficient.</li>
            <li> I visited my beautician and expressed my concern over my hair turning coarse due to it beginning to gray.  Without hesitation, knowing that I dyed my hair, she recommended Redken Color Extend Shampoo (and conditioner).  She said her mother had hair similar to mine and also dyed her hair which was graying.  Her mother had achieved much softer hair utilizing this product and so I decided to give it a try.  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone dealing with hair texture that is becoming coarser due to graying ,  This product also does extend the time between dye jobs.</li>
            <li> i love it when i can get it sent to me asap.great product..arrived in good time as i was out of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Price was too high.  My fault for not double checking and then when wanted it returned, there was a $6 charge.  Again, my fault for not checking but won&#x27;t buy items like this from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Lathers great and smells wonderful.  This is NOT a sulfate-free product.</li>
            <li> Very confused by the overwhelmingly positive reviews to this, on which I based my purchase.  I colored my hair a week ago and avoided washing it with any products until I had received this one, so that I could retain the color longer.  Since I was only washing it with water, my hair felt pretty dry and I was anxious for a good wash.  Finally lathered up with this - everything seemed good; shampoo looked and felt normal, nice consistency, etc.  The more I lathered my hair up, though, the more tangled my hair felt.  Ended up having tremendous difficulty rinsing it out, as it became extremely matted with the product in, and felt more dry and brittle, rather than clean, even while still wet from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very difficult to describe, but I had a terrible time managing my hair afterward.  I definitely can&#x27;t use this product, myself.  It&#x27;s possible that it would be better in combination with the conditioner.  I don&#x27;t usually use conditioners because they cause the opposite problem and leave my hair too slippery and limp.  In this case, I think the compensation would be absolutely required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: The good news is, now that it&#x27;s dry my hair feels much better.  It actually feels smoother and softer than it did while it was wet (weird).  The bad news is that most of my color went out with the wash.  Granted, it was only the $10 Loreal kind, but a week of washing with hot water (because I won&#x27;t stick my head in cold even for color) didn&#x27;t show any difference in color and a single rinse with this shows about a 50% decrease.  I can see my original color now, and look more tinted than full-on red.  So, this product doesn&#x27;t do much for over-the-counter color. :(</li>
            <li> I USE THIS SHAMPOO TO PULL COLOR OUT OF MY HAIR WHEN MY HAIR HAS BEEN DYED TOO DARK. IT WORKS GREAT FOR THAT!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE SHAMPOO AND THE PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD PURCHASE AT ANY HAIR STYLIST IN THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER.</li>
            <li> as a shampoo it&#x27;s alright, I do not see it extending hair color</li>
            <li> this is my go tp shampoo. I would not use anything else</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years/years.  I have very fine hair and this product seems to work  best for me.  The 33.8 oz bottle is a little large to handle so I pour it into a smaller container for my personal use.  Save dollars ordering from Amazon plus free shipping, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Like what other reviewers say, this product keeps the life of color in your hair. A pleasant smell and more importantly, not a watered-down product so a bottle lasts a good while. I have been using this product for the last 8 years and do not plan on switching or even find a need to try another brand.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo! Leaves hair soft and silky- honestly don&#x27;t even need the conditioner (it&#x27;s just an added bonus). Great for damaged or dry hair. Love the smell and the consistency of the shampoo- works into a great lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken is a responsible company that reduces use of harmful chemicals and harsh dyes. Definitely love this product/brand and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> It prevents color from washing away with each shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and leaves it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, lather, a nickle size goes a long way on my shoulder length hair.  I use this Redken Shampoo with the Mystic Oil Gold Conditioner to leave my hair healthy and not frizzy/dry even though I hot roller my hair everyday!  Great products at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the price is right!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this shampoo for years.  It cleans her her hair nicely, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t wash out her hair coloring.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it online without having to leave the house, and at a better price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Color Extend for sometime and love it. I have never bought it on Amazon, prior to this purchase. A small bottle runs around $16-18 (10.1oz) so when I saw this large bottle I thought the price was great so I ordered it. When it arrived I was finishing up the 10oz bottle so still had that in my shower, but I decided to open the larger size. It came with scotch tape over the lid, which looked wierd, but I thought probably just double protection to prevent leakage during shipping. After opening the cap I found there was no plastic vaccum-tight seal to peel off and it made me think, &amp;#34;I hope thus isn&#x27;t fake product packed in a redken bottle&amp;#34;. I used it and noticed it doesn&#x27;t smell like the redken I am familiar with and it doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the product coming from my small bottle that I know Is redken color extend. It feels to me this bottle is such a good buy for a Redken product because it&#x27;s cheap shampoo put in a redken bottle, though I can&#x27;t be sure. My color did fade to reveal some gray at my temples and normally washing with this shampoo preserves my color. I am wishing there were some laboratory way to test the substance to see if it is indeed a different product poured into a redken bottle. Going to my local store to purchase genuine Redken Colir Extend. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this vendor based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the store retail barcode tag reads &amp;#34;New Bottle&amp;#34;.....why would anyone label a product they purchased directly from the manufacturer as such...wouldn&#x27;t that be a given? I guess they meant &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to assure you it isn&#x27;t cheap &amp;#34;re- manufactured&amp;#34; shampoo in a Redken bottle.......</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for color treated hair. Fast delivery, will order again.</li>
            <li> I never received this!  I think that I would like it if it ever came!!!!  You kept promising it would arrive but it never did.  I assumed that I had not been charged but this seems to indicate that you think that I got it and that I have been charged for it.  Perhaps we can solve this?</li>
            <li> Best place to purchase this large bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  It really extends the life of my color.  I can sometimes notice a bit of build up when using this product, so I&#x27;ll use the Redken clarifying shampoo for a wash then go back to this.</li>
            <li> Top rated product and seems to keep colour in longer -- yes I am old and gray without a touch up. Do your research and you will find this comes up twords the top of the pile if not at the top.</li>
            <li> Redken has the best hair products on the market which is why so many hair stylists use it. I have tested many and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Thanks for getting my shampoo to me so quick!  I love my Redken Shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great item and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Shampoo that makes the cycle of dying my own hair last two weeks longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I started using this product years ago when the salon I went to used Redken products, hoping to hold onto that expensive color as long as possible. My salon has changed to a new brand of color that I like better, but when I tried a sample of their shampoo (on the premise that using a product formulated for their chemistry would work better at maintaining color) I found that it left my oily hair limp and lifeless very quickly after washing. So I have stuck with the Redken, and while it is certainly pricier than drug store shampoos, I feel like it is worth it, especially considering how much I pay to get my hair done. The new color used by the salon lasts even longer than their Redken did, so I haven&#x27;t had any problem from \\&quot;cross-contaminating\\&quot; the brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I want to stretch my color as long as possible without the chlorine in the water or harsh chemicals in my shampoo stripping it or leaving it brassy before its time, and this product seems to help. (and Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive with salons, although you can occasionally get BOGO offers through the salons.)</li>
            <li> have bought and used  before..happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better save the color of my hair then any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Service was a bit slow but Redken is an excellent product and I have always had excellent service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and the color stays around. If you buy it in the big bottles it last a long time. I&#x27;ve used it for years and really like it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using it for years now.</li>
            <li> Alway like this shampoo thank you.</li>
            <li> Once again, Redken has me sold.  Love the scent and the way it leaves my hair.  Does not dry out either.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> 4.5 as I don&#x27;t see a visible improvement in my hair texture or quality. But the fragrance is heavenly!!! And it does keep colors longer. Works on both men and women (actually my husby and I share this ;-)).</li>
            <li> My hair feels wonderful and let&#x27;s my color last longer!</li>
            <li> This is really great for color treated hair. It maintains the color and leaves hair very soft and shiny. I would recommend the conditioner also.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for about five years and liked it but got sucked in by one of those infomercials with&lt;br /&gt;a new fangled shampoo and all of its bells and whistles.  I tried it for about a year and decided that I liked Redkin&lt;br /&gt;a whole lot better.  I was on one of those revolving delivery schedules and it always showed up. Fortunately I saved&lt;br /&gt;thier phone number and cancelled the order. They were not happy. hehe  And I am very happy that I went back&lt;br /&gt;to Redkin. Try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> BEST shampoo for long fine colored hair. Been using it for decades.</li>
            <li> Love this product .. My hair color Looks awsome using color extend shampoo</li>
            <li> Really liking this shampoo, feels very moisturizing for dry hair.</li>
            <li> the best!!! color unchanged, hair soft and not bogged down, should have begun using this years ago!!many many thanks to you all</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product in the larger size.  I have colored my hair since college and this is the best shampoo for color-treated hair I have ever used.  It truly washes my hair clean without stripping out the color.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my salon colored hair. And the value is unbeatable !!</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not do a great job cleaning my hair. If I wash my hair the night before it is always extremely greasy in the a.m. My hair has a tendency to be quite oily (I have long fine straight hair) but it is even worse with this product compared to other shampoos.  It looks and feels soft at the ends but the roots are horrible.  I am thinking of using this product once a week and find a better daily shampoo so that I will not have to wash my hair everyday as it is making my hair color fade from over washing. I do like the scent and texture of the product but it just does not seem to work well with my hair type. I am not certain if it is really helping retain the hair color since I have to wash it so often. I will use the remainder of the bottle and then will not repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist strongly recommended this product for my color-treated hair, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  Not only did it maintain the color, but it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other products.</li>
            <li> I had my hair colored a very pretty auburn color and I bought this to use in hopes of extending the color, as I know all shades of red fade fast, but within two weeks it was very noticeable that the color had faded. I don&#x27;t believe this helped to extend the color at all.</li>
            <li> it does seem to make a difference in my color lasting longer than normal, Im happy with the  purchase.  thanks</li>
            <li> Got this for my 11 year old daughter who had her hair highlighted. It&#x27;s ok. If it is not very thoroughly rinsed it gives her a back of the head frizz. Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as other shampoos either. I must say, this is certainly better than the Pantene or other cheap junk they sell at Box Mart. But I think there is probably better for her out there. I think with this product we missed. But for others it may be amazing. I recently found out that stores like Ulta sell small bottles for travel. Perfect to sample before you buy as well. So maybe try it before you buy a big bottle. You may love it. We, however, do not.</li>
            <li> I like to dye my hair various colors, but I have very fine and delicate hair that doesn&#x27;t hold color very well. About six months ago I first dyed my hair black. It faded in about two weeks, so I decided to invest in some color extending shampoo. I searched a bit online and this one had very good reviews so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying it I&#x27;ve dyed my hair black three times. The only time I need to dye my hair is when my roots get longer. For instance, I&#x27;ll need to dye it again soon because my roots are about 1/2 to an inch long, but my hair is still as black as the day I dyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it four stars is, as someone else mentioned, it has dried out my hair a bit and my scalp is very dry. However, I&#x27;ve always had an issue with dry-scalp when it&#x27;s cold outside so I wouldn&#x27;t attribute that only to the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. I&#x27;ve had this shampoo for four months now and have used maybe 2/3 of the bottle. It definitely saves the money you would spend on re-dying faded hair.</li>
            <li> It is not so good.i think extreme shampoo and conditioner from redken is better, i know it&#x27;s not for color hair, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and an even better price!</li>
            <li> Great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Redken Color Extend Shampoo, 33.8 ounces Bottles&lt;br /&gt;Redken&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: TheBeautySource&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping, best price, great communication.  Both shampoo bottles arrived as described and work great on my thick brown color treated hair. Also follow shampoo with same brand conditioner.</li>
            <li> Ordered shampoo, conditioner was delivered. Which I didn&#x27;t need. Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo</li>
            <li> I bought this when I got my hair colored for the first time ever, &amp; it is gentle on my hair and works well.</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived on time. I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Item arrived as promised and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken Color Extend for years - for those of us with red color, which fades more quickly over time than other colors, this product helps to lengthen the time between colors</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo!!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time.  Much more economical than buying the smaller bottle.  I simply refill my used smaller bottles.</li>
