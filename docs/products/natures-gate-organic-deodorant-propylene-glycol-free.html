            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s safe to use though.</li>
            <li>though since it&#x27;s aluminum and paraben free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Got this deodorant to try it as I love lavender.</li>
            <li>If you get BO easily, I&#x27;d consider otherwise.</li>
            <li>Just fine.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t irritate and is free of the ingredients I wish to avoid.</li>
            <li>Just fine..</li>
            <li>I am searching for an aluminum free deodorant and decided to try this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that flowering/perfume smell like those filled with harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok looking for a more sustainable one has a musty scent almost looking for something with better scent because Iam active a lot</li>
            <li>Works well, nice scent, but should be applied more than once during summer, less so during the winter.</li>
            <li>It was very sticky and smelt sort of strong and manly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>deodorant smells good and the scent is not very overpowering.</li>
            <li>I need to reapply WAY to often to be worth the money.</li>
            <li>Keeps you fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch from synthetic to natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and stays strong for a long time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain clothes and it goes on clear and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that has actually kept me reasonably odor free all day.  </li>
            <li>I really like not having that feeling of goose grease in your armpits when you use this.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>but I actually really like it.</li>
            <li>The only major issue I experienced was during the first few weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re into reapplying your deodorant throughout the day, this might be worth it for the low price point.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and clear so there&#x27;s not any white marks left on clothes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s clear so it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing and it&#x27;s not greasy or anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very medicinal smelling and body odor returns after only a couple of hours of inactivity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t provoked my psoriasis, so far, and I hope we continue to get along.</li>
            <li>The deodorant wears off a little too quickly for my taste.</li>
            <li>Pure &amp; Natural is a spray that also works well if you have several minutes to finish your morning preparation before getting dressed to allow dry time</li>
            <li>Any complaints regarding irritated skin (my skin is on the sensitive side, especially to fragrance); and (4) will it stain my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s back to using my old stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It took a while, but arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> This is a gel that stays wet and sticky. It went into the trash with just one day of use from me.  If you are at all sensitive to having your underarms feeling wet and sticky (it made me feel chilled on a cold day), then look elsewhere for a natural deodorant.  I like Pit Putty, but was hoping for a cheaper option.  Pure &amp; Natural is a spray that also works well if you have several minutes to finish your morning preparation before getting dressed to allow dry time (I put on my robe while still a little wet with no issues).  Both of them work for one day; you may be stinky by the morning.</li>
            <li> My favorite not toxic deodorant.  I love the scent.  Have used it for years.  If you like a flowery scent, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> this deoderant have a more femine scent. thats why i got it. dont have to worry about any harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have used it for well over 2 years now and it works well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear so it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing and it&#x27;s not greasy or anything. Just fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smells really nice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great.  I have now switched brands.</li>
            <li> I am searching for an aluminum free deodorant and decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;It is very medicinal smelling and body odor returns after only a couple of hours of inactivity.&lt;br /&gt;I am having to apply it multiple times a day. I will use continue to use it until it is depleted (at this re-apply rate won&#x27;t be very long) but will not purchase again and cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Everything was as promised</li>
            <li> Very pleasant odor. Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t irritate and is free of the ingredients I wish to avoid. It hasn&#x27;t provoked my psoriasis, so far, and I hope we continue to get along.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the job so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells alright and it works okay. The deodorant wears off a little too quickly for my taste. I love the fact that it&#x27;s safe to use though. I&#x27;ll just use this for outdoor activities, like after swimming to freshen up.</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that has actually kept me reasonably odor free all day.  Even though it is &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34;, the scent is not feminine.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is not very strong. If you get BO easily, I&#x27;d consider otherwise. i appreciate it bc it is vegan, but it&#x27;s not the best product</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and clear so there&#x27;s not any white marks left on clothes. It does need to be reapplied throughout the day if you notice it wearing off. I put it on in the mornings and then again around 2pm. Totally worth it though since it&#x27;s aluminum and paraben free!</li>
            <li> Great product, recommend</li>
            <li> I love this product, the smell is wonderful &amp; it wears wonderfully, too! I plan to order again! Love it!</li>
            <li> Since the previous brand of natural deodorant I have been using has become harder to find, I have been on a search for a replacement. I&#x27;m relatively new to natural deodorants, but what I look for in reviews are: (1) Does it last at least 12-hours (a typical workday); (2) Does it control some perspiration; (3) Any complaints regarding irritated skin (my skin is on the sensitive side, especially to fragrance); and (4) will it stain my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant smells good and the scent is not very overpowering. However, after using it for several weeks I noticed that by midday I could catch a subtle hint of body odor. I&#x27;m not particularly smelly, and this was only after sitting in my office for a few hours, nothing too active. It also has zero antiperspirant qualities. I know it&#x27;s not labeled as such, but some brands I have used while not antiperspirants per se still have some sweat control. Unless you&#x27;re into reapplying your deodorant throughout the day, this might be worth it for the low price point. It doesn&#x27;t stain clothes and it goes on clear and absorbs quickly. I didn&#x27;t notice any skin irritation whatsoever. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Works well, nice scent, but should be applied more than once during summer, less so during the winter. It&#x27;s my favorite. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me...I had high hopes.  I need to reapply WAY to often to be worth the money. Maybe it will work for you. I tried.  Next please...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok looking for a more sustainable one has a musty scent almost looking for something with better scent because Iam active a lot</li>
            <li> I really do not like this product.  I wanted to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have all of those bad for your skin ingredients but this deodorant was no good.  As I applied it, it felt like a glue stick.  It was very sticky and smelt sort of strong and manly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like not having that feeling of goose grease in your armpits when you use this. Keeps you fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Great organic deodorant. Did not leave any stains on my clothes which was my favorite part and also has a great light scent to it for allergic skin like mine it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Just fine..I bought 2 and the caps are both a little loose, which is weird but its a good product.</li>
            <li> It feels gummy, gooey, and sticky.  It also runs. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch from synthetic to natural deodorant. The only major issue I experienced was during the first few weeks of using the product. My body needed time to adjust to using an organic deodorant. During that time an unfriendly underarm funk fest took place for 2 weeks while my body purged toxins and renewed itself.</li>
            <li> Works well. Stay dry all day</li>
            <li> It works really well.  I had trouble with over the counter deodorants, tried about 20 of them, kept breaking out in a rash.  a few days of using this, rash is completely gone.  If you like the smell of bees wax, you&#x27;ll like this.  It doesn&#x27;t have that flowering/perfume smell like those filled with harmful chemicals.  That&#x27;s the only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 start.</li>
            <li> The smell grew on me because I found it to be a little manly but I actually really like it. It works unless you&#x27;re really active or are going yo sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> definitely a good product.A++++.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant! I love the smell and stays strong for a long time. Love that there is no aluminum!</li>
            <li> Not normally someone who has any issues with body odor, but when I used this product it appeared to actually MAKE me smell by the end of the day. Complete waste of money. Guess it&#x27;s back to using my old stuff.</li>
            <li> Got this deodorant to try it as I love lavender. Turned out to be very good. Like it a lot!</li>
