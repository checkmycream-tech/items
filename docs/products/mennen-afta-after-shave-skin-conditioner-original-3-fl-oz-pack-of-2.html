            <li>This is an excellent product that does what it is supposed to--improve the shave.  </li>
            <li>This is the best preshave I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided that cassava flour-based pre-shave lotions are the best choice for me.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT for two!</li>
            <li>Excellent after shave product!</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Great product, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>It is unreal how great my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and does not burn or sting when applied after shaving.</li>
            <li>Finding it at Azamon.com, and, in quanity was great.</li>
            <li>I have also tried many others thru the years but this works best for me.</li>
            <li>I like this pre shave because it smoothes things out, doesn&#x27;t clog my razor, and has a pleasant after scent.</li>
            <li>I always loved afta pre-electric shaving lotion.</li>
            <li>I am puzzled because in my opinion it is superior to anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Could not find a good pre electric lotion that worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Despite the superior application and lower &#x60;oily&#x27; feel of Afta, I had to go with Williams Lectric Shave.</li>
            <li>He smells good also.</li>
            <li>aftershave smells good</li>
            <li>really good deal.</li>
            <li>Trial and error will help you determine what your best adequate amount is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product.. still very effective for so many years.</li>
            <li>Began having problems finding it in stores, so I turned to Amazon, and found that is available at a very good price.</li>
            <li>, my favorite brushless shave cream that works great with everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a week and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Does not smell as good, kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>I did not, I hated it lol.</li>
            <li>but I love to use it as an after shave!</li>
            <li>you have finished shaving, if the residual fragrance of the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is agreeable then you can choose to use an after shave lotion of your selection or not; if the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is not agreeable with you, you may want to use a warm washcloth to remove the residual lotion from your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice smell non-oily.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an excellent pre-electric cream to use before you shave, we highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is OK , but not as good.</li>
            <li>It worked great as PreElectric and when I went to clean the head</li>
            <li>Good smelling, works great, and smells fresh &amp; clean!</li>
            <li>This is a like a lotion, which you&#x27;d think would clog your razor, but it doesn&#x27;t at all, which just makes your skin smooth, makes your whiskers stand-up, and smells good.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to using Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion check your electric shaver to ensure is has a good battery charge and the shaver head is clean and functioning correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powder sticks were OK but preferred this since it went on better and had a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>Transaction was very smooth and prompt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of the fanciar brands over the years, as well as the popular and easy to find Lectric Shave.  </li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to take an extra minute or two that will make your shaving experience the best</li>
            <li>most people here seem to use this with their electric razor and put it on before they shave</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Mennen ought to market it better</li>
            <li>so they can get it into a lot more stores and states.</li>
            <li>The Norelco&#x27;s cut better.     </li>
            <li>It is easy to wash off (if you wish) and has a mild and pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>Most of the products cause &#x60;gumming&#x27; of the beard trimmings in the shaver blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These will all stay with you for many hours, so you better like what you pick (ranked in order of preference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>better, closer shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad they still make this</li>
            <li>As a side note I also use the Neutrogena SPF20 after shave cream which I like better than any of the liquid</li>
            <li>Was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>I need to write 13 more words for some asinine reason, so here they are</li>
            <li>I have using this product for many years, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>much better than the Nivea</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>the reviews say its pretty good.</li>
            <li>WLS is pretty good, but still my neck would get \\&quot;somewhat\\&quot; irritated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many pre-electric shave lotions, powders, oils, and combinations to choose from and in my opinion Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion ranks in the top 15% to 20% of the products available; only you will be able to judge which one(s) work best for you and your unique skin and whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is perfectly easy to apply, unlike most pre-shaves which are in liquid form,because it is in the form of  a lotion.</li>
            <li>I felt this was the best pre-electric lotion and missed it when it seems to only be available on line.</li>
            <li>They can make a lot more money with this fine product.</li>
            <li>On occasion I like to use my electric Panasonic Arc IV, its a great shaver, just not as fun as wet shaving lol.</li>
            <li>Glad its available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love good old fashioned Afta!  </li>
            <li>I have used Mennen Afta skin conditioner original for many years.</li>
            <li>Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>- Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.  </li>
            <li>So easy to obtain it from this seller, with timely delivery to my door.  </li>
            <li>Afta has a strong musty &#x60;woodsy&#x27; odor.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>- Afta has a strong musty &#x60;woodsy&#x27; odor.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using after once because the smell is sooo strong and pungent.&lt;br /&gt;seemed</li>
            <li>It is soothing to my face, smells good without being over powering, and it causes no negative reactions on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have fine whiskers and this product helps my whiskers stand up.</li>
            <li>For my beard, the alcohol in this stuff tightens up my skin, but once it dries, the cassava flour leaves my skin very smooth and the razor just glides right over my face.</li>
            <li>The possitives about it are it smells kinda nice, and it was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>it feels great after I shave with a regular razor blade and shaving cream and just put afta on as an after shave.</li>
            <li>it feels really nice and really smoothes out my skin after I shave.</li>
            <li>Happily it is available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I remember 25 years ago shaving with a Panasonic foil and Old Spice shaving powder and use to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the old Mennen pre Shave.</li>
            <li>to work ok on first shave interms of increasing the hair grasp and cut</li>
            <li>I ordered Afta original AFTER SHAVE, not pre-electric shave...</li>
            <li>This Afta blend is a light lotion unlike the Lectric shave, and is a good cross between a liquid that tends to roll out of your hand when applying, and the shave sticks that can tend to gum up some of the finer shavers.  </li>
            <li>This is an old product that has been around for many years, and I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising: you&#x27;d think they would all be scrambling to offer the superior gel consistency or, at least, put the liquids it into a spray pump.</li>
            <li>Pretty good pre save cream, have tried different brands and this is one of the better ones I believe.</li>
            <li>I did pick it up at Wally-World and OMG, the reviews on Amazon were right!</li>
            <li>final consideration regarding shaving - be gentle and thorough - allowing an extra minute or two when shaving will produce the most comfortable great shave you can get!</li>
            <li>Williams Lectric Shave is much easier to apply and smells better.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing on the skin, makes your beard stand up and allows the razor to glide easily  resulting in a comfortable close shave.  </li>
            <li>Electric Glide Formula has a mild citrus odor</li>
            <li>I like this stuff a lot and enjoy its very manly scent.  </li>
            <li>, it would alomost be gone by the time my hand had reached my face either some ran off my hand or my hand absorbed it</li>
            <li>Once it was on my face, just like it did on myhand, it did a vanishing act, my skin absorbed it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaving this as a 3 star review because I can&#x27;t comment on how effective the product actually is.</li>
            <li>None, zero, zilch neck irritaiton and my newer Norelco has never cut better (and my blades are old).  </li>
            <li>This will require more frequent cleaning of the shaver than shaving without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will require more frequent cleaning of the shaver than shaving without them.    </li>
            <li>It works just as well, and smells far better in my (and my wife&#x27;s) opinion.</li>
            <li>Washes right off.  </li>
            <li>The products tried were (in order of preference): Williams Lectric Shave, Electric Glide Formula (California North), Afta Pre-electric by Mennen (original), Skin Bracer, Eltron Prep and Kinexium Shave Oil by King-Of-Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used an electric shaver for more than 30 years and, for the first time in over 20 years, am trying these pre-electric lotions again after having shaved without these the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>Allow your lathered up shave area to soak for about half a minute or more then rinse completely with warm water - this should help soften your beard and clean your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply an adequate (not too much)</li>
            <li>; then, let it thoroughly and completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave as recommended by your shaver&#x27;s operating instructions and make sure you do not apply too much pressure against your skin to avoid cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes his shaving experience that much more enjoyable due to this high quality product.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s so greasy that I cringed with disgust after using it the first time.  </li>
            <li>Washed face first then put this on.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>and I alternate between the two, but use Williams Lectric Shave much more often.</li>
            <li>gel consistency of Afta is much better for application than the liquids (which run through your fingers, like water), but only Afta is a gel.</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that gives me the close shave I am looking for without an overwhelming fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I had bought a store brand of this item from CVS, but I wanted to try this because it was a better price for the two-pack, and I assumed it would have the same fragrance as the store brand.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>When I run out I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Evidently I misread something because I was searching for pre-shave (Mennen).  </li>
            <li>It actually gives me a better shave with out any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>good product...sometimes not available in the store...</li>
            <li>An old favorite for an old friend.  </li>
            <li>A new ad campaign, new packaging, etc., anything to have it more accessible to the public.</li>
            <li>There is no &#x27;gumming&#x27; (clumping of the beard trimmings in the blades).&lt;br /&gt;- Williams Lectric Shave has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is somewhat easy to wash off.</li>

            <li>My husband has super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Finally got a 97% good dry shave.</li>
            <li>I originally bought my first Afta PreElectric thinking that I was buying the basic Afta</li>
            <li>Really does do what it promises.</li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave with my Braun 8985 when I use Afta.</li>
            <li>who wants a bumpy ride.</li>
            <li>With this pre-shave it allows for a very close shave and the shaver just glides along my face.</li>
            <li>very close second&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.    </li>
            <li>This is only available through the marketplace and I recommend TeeBop over Deal Buzz Health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A better shave with minimal irritation.   </li>
            <li>It really soothed my skin before using my electric razor.</li>
            <li>He loves this product because it really helps when using an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like the other reviewers, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I needing something that would help my sensitve facial skin whne I decided to go with a clean face.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad if you are buying packs of two, quite reasonable actually.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears to me to work well when I only apply an adequate amount (not too much).  </li>
            <li>My husband would love to comment on the pre-electric, but we received after shave instead and it is not worth the hassle to return it and try again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell is soo strong (similar to classic old spice but 1000 times stronger)</li>
            <li>I found I suddenly absolutely had to use a pre shave with this new shaver.</li>
            <li>If you put the Williams Lectric Shave and Electric Glide Formula into sample-sized spray pumps, spray them on your face then spread with your hand, you will have a much better and less wasteful</li>
            <li>Likely most of the following you already know; however, since many men want to shave in a hurry some of these basic and essential comfort/closeness steps get missed.  </li>
            <li>- Electric Glide Formula has a mild citrus odor  - Skin Bracer has a moderate lime odor  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My conclusion is that my face doesn&#x27;t like the high alcohol content of either the pre or after shaves.</li>
            <li>Flour\\&quot; - Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae native to South America and is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy, tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates; and, in this case for a primary ingredient in the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics and is a natural even edible product that is also made into tapioca flour - it is a starchy, slightly sweet, white flour.  </li>
            <li>I almost cant live without this brand.</li>
            <li>I then thought, I have to do something, so I got a new Norelco shaver and began using Williams Lectric shave as a preshave prep.</li>
            <li>I purchased a new electric shaver and I added this pre-electric lotion, thinking that it is what it says...</li>
            <li>I really was surprised at how clean they were, no gummy residue like other preelectrics I had used.</li>
            <li>Afta has less of an &#x60;oily&#x27; feel to it that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>- Afta has less of an &#x60;oily&#x27; feel to it that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different kind&#x27;s of pre-shave gel&#x27;s and lotion&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I used it with my old Norelco, my Braun and my new Norelco...</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth with less rubbing over and over the face.  </li>
            <li>The pity, for me, is the punguent scent which I find too strong for a facial product.</li>
            <li>For some reason its very hard to find in stores around these parts, and I not only recommend it, but suggest you buy it right here on Amazon in the twin pack... : )</li>
            <li>It still irritated my neck, and it did not cut near as close as my old Norelco and not even remotelt close to a razor.   </li>
            <li>Electric Glide Formula is a very close second</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s like Old Spice, but it&#x27;s how I imagine Old Spice would smell.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and like to shave after a shower with my trusty Norelco.  </li>
            <li>but since I can&#x27;t get it local, don&#x27;t have much choice.</li>
            <li>this is going straight back.</li>
            <li>I mean this is suppose to be a top of the line shaver, Right?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike the water or should I say liquid there is no mess.</li>
            <li>Pat dry your skin and allow your skin to thoroughly dry; if you are in a hurry you may want to try using a blow dryer on a low comfortable</li>
            <li>There is very little &#x27;gumming&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;- Electric Glide Formula has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>(they were right next to each other on the shelf, and often still are).  </li>
            <li>but they apparently stopped manufacturing it.</li>
            <li>In addition to finding the Lectric shaves scent rather foul and stale, I really do feel that this Afta works much better at what its actually supposed to do as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally you may want to wet a washcloth with comfortably hot water and hold it against you beard or stubble for a minute or two - this should further help soften your whiskers.  </li>
            <li>After 5 months of shaving wet with my new panasonic 8249S</li>
            <li>I did that for my whole upper face, and it was pretty irritating, something that should be unheard of from electric shaving.</li>
            <li>The Mennen is a lotion style and even if my face is slightly damp it dries in maybe 30 second and is ready to shave.</li>
            <li>I use only this and one other brand only for my VERY SENSITIVE skin.</li>

            <li> Finding it at Azamon.com, and, in quanity was great.</li>
            <li> I have also tried many others thru the years but this works best for me.</li>
            <li> I like this pre shave because it smoothes things out, doesn&#x27;t clog my razor, and has a pleasant after scent.</li>
            <li> I always loved afta pre-electric shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> I am puzzled because in my opinion it is superior to anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Could not find a good pre electric lotion that worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Despite the superior application and lower &#x60;oily&#x27; feel of Afta, I had to go with Williams Lectric Shave.</li>
            <li> He smells good also.</li>
            <li> aftershave smells good</li>
            <li> really good deal.</li>
            <li> Trial and error will help you determine what your best adequate amount is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good product.. still very effective for so many years.</li>
            <li> Began having problems finding it in stores, so I turned to Amazon, and found that is available at a very good price.</li>
            <li> , my favorite brushless shave cream that works great with everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Does not smell as good, kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> I did not, I hated it lol.</li>
            <li> but I love to use it as an after shave!</li>
            <li> you have finished shaving, if the residual fragrance of the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is agreeable then you can choose to use an after shave lotion of your selection or not; if the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is not agreeable with you, you may want to use a warm washcloth to remove the residual lotion from your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice smell non-oily.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an excellent pre-electric cream to use before you shave, we highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is OK , but not as good.</li>
            <li> It worked great as PreElectric and when I went to clean the head</li>
            <li> Good smelling, works great, and smells fresh &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> This is a like a lotion, which you&#x27;d think would clog your razor, but it doesn&#x27;t at all, which just makes your skin smooth, makes your whiskers stand-up, and smells good.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to using Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion check your electric shaver to ensure is has a good battery charge and the shaver head is clean and functioning correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The powder sticks were OK but preferred this since it went on better and had a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> Transaction was very smooth and prompt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the fanciar brands over the years, as well as the popular and easy to find Lectric Shave.  </li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to take an extra minute or two that will make your shaving experience the best</li>
            <li> most people here seem to use this with their electric razor and put it on before they shave</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Mennen ought to market it better</li>
            <li> so they can get it into a lot more stores and states.</li>
            <li> The Norelco&#x27;s cut better.     </li>
            <li> It is easy to wash off (if you wish) and has a mild and pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Most of the products cause &#x60;gumming&#x27; of the beard trimmings in the shaver blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These will all stay with you for many hours, so you better like what you pick (ranked in order of preference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> better, closer shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad they still make this</li>
            <li> As a side note I also use the Neutrogena SPF20 after shave cream which I like better than any of the liquid</li>
            <li> Was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> I need to write 13 more words for some asinine reason, so here they are</li>
            <li> I have using this product for many years, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> much better than the Nivea</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> the reviews say its pretty good.</li>
            <li> WLS is pretty good, but still my neck would get \\&quot;somewhat\\&quot; irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many pre-electric shave lotions, powders, oils, and combinations to choose from and in my opinion Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion ranks in the top 15% to 20% of the products available; only you will be able to judge which one(s) work best for you and your unique skin and whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is perfectly easy to apply, unlike most pre-shaves which are in liquid form,because it is in the form of  a lotion.</li>
            <li> I felt this was the best pre-electric lotion and missed it when it seems to only be available on line.</li>
            <li> They can make a lot more money with this fine product.</li>
            <li> On occasion I like to use my electric Panasonic Arc IV, its a great shaver, just not as fun as wet shaving lol.</li>
            <li> Glad its available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love good old fashioned Afta!  </li>
            <li> I have used Mennen Afta skin conditioner original for many years.</li>
            <li> Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> - Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.  </li>
            <li> So easy to obtain it from this seller, with timely delivery to my door.  </li>
            <li> Afta has a strong musty &#x60;woodsy&#x27; odor.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> - Afta has a strong musty &#x60;woodsy&#x27; odor.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using after once because the smell is sooo strong and pungent.&lt;br /&gt;seemed</li>
            <li> It is soothing to my face, smells good without being over powering, and it causes no negative reactions on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have fine whiskers and this product helps my whiskers stand up.</li>
            <li> For my beard, the alcohol in this stuff tightens up my skin, but once it dries, the cassava flour leaves my skin very smooth and the razor just glides right over my face.</li>
            <li> The possitives about it are it smells kinda nice, and it was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> it feels great after I shave with a regular razor blade and shaving cream and just put afta on as an after shave.</li>
            <li> it feels really nice and really smoothes out my skin after I shave.</li>
            <li> Happily it is available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I remember 25 years ago shaving with a Panasonic foil and Old Spice shaving powder and use to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old Mennen pre Shave.</li>
            <li> to work ok on first shave interms of increasing the hair grasp and cut</li>
            <li> I ordered Afta original AFTER SHAVE, not pre-electric shave...</li>
            <li> This Afta blend is a light lotion unlike the Lectric shave, and is a good cross between a liquid that tends to roll out of your hand when applying, and the shave sticks that can tend to gum up some of the finer shavers.  </li>
            <li> This is an old product that has been around for many years, and I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising: you&#x27;d think they would all be scrambling to offer the superior gel consistency or, at least, put the liquids it into a spray pump.</li>
            <li> Pretty good pre save cream, have tried different brands and this is one of the better ones I believe.</li>
            <li> I did pick it up at Wally-World and OMG, the reviews on Amazon were right!</li>
            <li> final consideration regarding shaving - be gentle and thorough - allowing an extra minute or two when shaving will produce the most comfortable great shave you can get!</li>
            <li> Williams Lectric Shave is much easier to apply and smells better.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing on the skin, makes your beard stand up and allows the razor to glide easily  resulting in a comfortable close shave.  </li>
            <li> Electric Glide Formula has a mild citrus odor</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot and enjoy its very manly scent.  </li>
            <li> , it would alomost be gone by the time my hand had reached my face either some ran off my hand or my hand absorbed it</li>
            <li> Once it was on my face, just like it did on myhand, it did a vanishing act, my skin absorbed it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving this as a 3 star review because I can&#x27;t comment on how effective the product actually is.</li>
            <li> None, zero, zilch neck irritaiton and my newer Norelco has never cut better (and my blades are old).  </li>
            <li> This will require more frequent cleaning of the shaver than shaving without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will require more frequent cleaning of the shaver than shaving without them.    </li>
            <li> It works just as well, and smells far better in my (and my wife&#x27;s) opinion.</li>
            <li> Washes right off.  </li>
            <li> The products tried were (in order of preference): Williams Lectric Shave, Electric Glide Formula (California North), Afta Pre-electric by Mennen (original), Skin Bracer, Eltron Prep and Kinexium Shave Oil by King-Of-Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used an electric shaver for more than 30 years and, for the first time in over 20 years, am trying these pre-electric lotions again after having shaved without these the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> Allow your lathered up shave area to soak for about half a minute or more then rinse completely with warm water - this should help soften your beard and clean your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply an adequate (not too much)</li>
            <li> ; then, let it thoroughly and completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave as recommended by your shaver&#x27;s operating instructions and make sure you do not apply too much pressure against your skin to avoid cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes his shaving experience that much more enjoyable due to this high quality product.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s so greasy that I cringed with disgust after using it the first time.  </li>
            <li> Washed face first then put this on.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> and I alternate between the two, but use Williams Lectric Shave much more often.</li>
            <li> gel consistency of Afta is much better for application than the liquids (which run through your fingers, like water), but only Afta is a gel.</li>
            <li> and this is the only one that gives me the close shave I am looking for without an overwhelming fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I had bought a store brand of this item from CVS, but I wanted to try this because it was a better price for the two-pack, and I assumed it would have the same fragrance as the store brand.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> When I run out I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Evidently I misread something because I was searching for pre-shave (Mennen).  </li>
            <li> It actually gives me a better shave with out any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> good product...sometimes not available in the store...</li>
            <li> An old favorite for an old friend.  </li>
            <li> A new ad campaign, new packaging, etc., anything to have it more accessible to the public.</li>
            <li> There is no &#x27;gumming&#x27; (clumping of the beard trimmings in the blades).&lt;br /&gt;- Williams Lectric Shave has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is somewhat easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> - Williams Lectric Shave has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is somewhat easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> - Electric Glide Formula has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> My husband has super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Finally got a 97% good dry shave.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my first Afta PreElectric thinking that I was buying the basic Afta</li>
            <li> Really does do what it promises.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave with my Braun 8985 when I use Afta.</li>
            <li> who wants a bumpy ride.</li>
            <li> With this pre-shave it allows for a very close shave and the shaver just glides along my face.</li>
            <li> very close second&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.    </li>
            <li> This is only available through the marketplace and I recommend TeeBop over Deal Buzz Health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A better shave with minimal irritation.   </li>
            <li> It really soothed my skin before using my electric razor.</li>
            <li> He loves this product because it really helps when using an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like the other reviewers, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I needing something that would help my sensitve facial skin whne I decided to go with a clean face.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad if you are buying packs of two, quite reasonable actually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears to me to work well when I only apply an adequate amount (not too much).  </li>
            <li> My husband would love to comment on the pre-electric, but we received after shave instead and it is not worth the hassle to return it and try again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the smell is soo strong (similar to classic old spice but 1000 times stronger)</li>
            <li> I found I suddenly absolutely had to use a pre shave with this new shaver.</li>
            <li> If you put the Williams Lectric Shave and Electric Glide Formula into sample-sized spray pumps, spray them on your face then spread with your hand, you will have a much better and less wasteful</li>
            <li> Likely most of the following you already know; however, since many men want to shave in a hurry some of these basic and essential comfort/closeness steps get missed.  </li>
            <li> - Electric Glide Formula has a mild citrus odor  - Skin Bracer has a moderate lime odor  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is that my face doesn&#x27;t like the high alcohol content of either the pre or after shaves.</li>
            <li> Flour\\&quot; - Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae native to South America and is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy, tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates; and, in this case for a primary ingredient in the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion.  </li>
            <li> Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics and is a natural even edible product that is also made into tapioca flour - it is a starchy, slightly sweet, white flour.  </li>
            <li> I almost cant live without this brand.</li>
            <li> I then thought, I have to do something, so I got a new Norelco shaver and began using Williams Lectric shave as a preshave prep.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new electric shaver and I added this pre-electric lotion, thinking that it is what it says...</li>
            <li> I really was surprised at how clean they were, no gummy residue like other preelectrics I had used.</li>
            <li> Afta has less of an &#x60;oily&#x27; feel to it that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> - Afta has less of an &#x60;oily&#x27; feel to it that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different kind&#x27;s of pre-shave gel&#x27;s and lotion&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used it with my old Norelco, my Braun and my new Norelco...</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth with less rubbing over and over the face.  </li>
            <li> The pity, for me, is the punguent scent which I find too strong for a facial product.</li>
            <li> For some reason its very hard to find in stores around these parts, and I not only recommend it, but suggest you buy it right here on Amazon in the twin pack... : )</li>
            <li> It still irritated my neck, and it did not cut near as close as my old Norelco and not even remotelt close to a razor.   </li>
            <li> Electric Glide Formula is a very close second</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s like Old Spice, but it&#x27;s how I imagine Old Spice would smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and like to shave after a shower with my trusty Norelco.  </li>
            <li> but since I can&#x27;t get it local, don&#x27;t have much choice.</li>
            <li> this is going straight back.</li>
            <li> I mean this is suppose to be a top of the line shaver, Right?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike the water or should I say liquid there is no mess.</li>
            <li> Pat dry your skin and allow your skin to thoroughly dry; if you are in a hurry you may want to try using a blow dryer on a low comfortable</li>
            <li> There is very little &#x27;gumming&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;- Electric Glide Formula has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> (they were right next to each other on the shelf, and often still are).  </li>
            <li> but they apparently stopped manufacturing it.</li>
            <li> In addition to finding the Lectric shaves scent rather foul and stale, I really do feel that this Afta works much better at what its actually supposed to do as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally you may want to wet a washcloth with comfortably hot water and hold it against you beard or stubble for a minute or two - this should further help soften your whiskers.  </li>
            <li> After 5 months of shaving wet with my new panasonic 8249S</li>
            <li> I did that for my whole upper face, and it was pretty irritating, something that should be unheard of from electric shaving.</li>
            <li> The Mennen is a lotion style and even if my face is slightly damp it dries in maybe 30 second and is ready to shave.</li>
            <li> I use only this and one other brand only for my VERY SENSITIVE skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very spicy, with a heavy clove scent, and it lingers long after I have shaved.</li>
            <li> In my shopping area, it was becoming difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> flat out does what it is supposed to do.    </li>
            <li> However, as much as I like it, I find that it is hard to purchase in local stores</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this stuff and it is hard to find in local retail stores.</li>
            <li> But, as long as amazon supplies a source to purchase it, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it here.</li>
            <li> I begin shaving and it really felt worse than dry shaving, my skin would fold, there was no gliding, constant friction and my skin folding as I tried to get a different angle on the hair.</li>
            <li> Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion to your completely dry face</li>
            <li> I tried shaving dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; Got to keep trying the dry shave.</li>
            <li> So I usually shave with my DE safety razor or my Trac II razor with a brush and Taylor of old Bond St. shave cream.</li>
            <li> This was not Mennen&#x27;s Afta after shave conditioner, but rather their pre-electric lotion which is impossible to find any more.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several bottles online because they were out of it for several weeks where I usually buy it.</li>
            <li> Last year I acquired an Arcitec electric shaver from Norelco to replace my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other as long as I can buy this one.</li>
            <li> I have a really rough beard and this softens and conditions before I shave whether I use a blade or an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Spent unnessasary money on Lab Series, Williams,and Remington powder stick.</li>
            <li> To me, the regular Williams Lectric pre shave is too messy, although it works well.</li>
            <li> I was using this until the stores stopped carrying it for some unknown reason.</li>
            <li> and I would say my hair appeared darker and my skin slightly stung while I waited for it to dry as it says to do.</li>
            <li> I have not received this product which was due about a week ago according to your advice,  Please advise.................</li>
            <li> Being that I&#x27;d not tried this product before I relied on the comments from other purchasers who reviewed this and gave it an well deserved approval rating.</li>
            <li> Not sticky and does not attract dirt on your skin like some other creams.&lt;br /&gt;Decent scent, not overpowering.</li>

            <li> So I usually shave with my DE safety razor or my Trac II razor with a brush and Taylor of old Bond St. shave cream. On occasion I like to use my electric Panasonic Arc IV, its a great shaver, just not as fun as wet shaving lol. So I decided to try out this afta stuff cause the reviews say its pretty good. I begin putting it in my skin, and it was very odd, it would alomost be gone by the time my hand had reached my face either some ran off my hand or my hand absorbed it lol. So I had to pump some out for each portion of my face and neck (side, jawline, chin, neck, and upper lip). Once it was on my face, just like it did on myhand, it did a vanishing act, my skin absorbed it and I would say my hair appeared darker and my skin slightly stung while I waited for it to dry as it says to do. Time to commence shaving. I begin shaving and it really felt worse than dry shaving, my skin would fold, there was no gliding, constant friction and my skin folding as I tried to get a different angle on the hair. I did that for my whole upper face, and it was pretty irritating, something that should be unheard of from electric shaving. Then I got to m neck and could only properly shave portion of it. I finally gave up, rinsed my neck and put some Cremo Cream on it, my favorite brushless shave cream that works great with everything. This was my experience with it, you may like it, I did not, I hated it lol. The possitives about it are it smells kinda nice, and it was very inexpensive. No harm in trying it I say.</li>
            <li> Great product, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like raw chemicals.  Which isn&#x27;t a surprise, because that&#x27;s what it is, but I thought at least they could mask the smell.  Also, it&#x27;s so greasy that I cringed with disgust after using it the first time.  I bought two bottles but I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use this product again.  Maybe you&#x27;d get used to it over time but I can&#x27;t stand its qualities.  I&#x27;m leaving this as a 3 star review because I can&#x27;t comment on how effective the product actually is.</li>
            <li> Likely most of the following you already know; however, since many men want to shave in a hurry some of these basic and essential comfort/closeness steps get missed.  My recommendation is to take an extra minute or two that will make your shaving experience the best it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion check your electric shaver to ensure is has a good battery charge and the shaver head is clean and functioning correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash the area of your face where you will be shaving it with a non-irritating facial cleansing lotion/soap.  Allow your lathered up shave area to soak for about half a minute or more then rinse completely with warm water - this should help soften your beard and clean your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally you may want to wet a washcloth with comfortably hot water and hold it against you beard or stubble for a minute or two - this should further help soften your whiskers.  Pat dry your skin and allow your skin to thoroughly dry; if you are in a hurry you may want to try using a blow dryer on a low comfortable setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply an adequate (not too much) Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion to your completely dry face; then, let it thoroughly and completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave as recommended by your shaver&#x27;s operating instructions and make sure you do not apply too much pressure against your skin to avoid cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you have finished shaving, if the residual fragrance of the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is agreeable then you can choose to use an after shave lotion of your selection or not; if the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is not agreeable with you, you may want to use a warm washcloth to remove the residual lotion from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion bottle indicates the 3rd ingredient after SD Alcohol 40 and Water is \\&quot;Cassava Flour\\&quot; - Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae native to South America and is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy, tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates; and, in this case for a primary ingredient in the Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion.  Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics and is a natural even edible product that is also made into tapioca flour - it is a starchy, slightly sweet, white flour.  It has been noted that Cubans commonly use cassava to treat irritable bowel syndrome for its calming effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to me to work well when I only apply an adequate amount (not too much).  Applying a lavish amount when it dries may produce a thick starchy feel to your skin.  Trial and error will help you determine what your best adequate amount is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many pre-electric shave lotions, powders, oils, and combinations to choose from and in my opinion Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion ranks in the top 15% to 20% of the products available; only you will be able to judge which one(s) work best for you and your unique skin and whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final consideration regarding shaving - be gentle and thorough - allowing an extra minute or two when shaving will produce the most comfortable great shave you can get!</li>
            <li> I always loved afta pre-electric shaving lotion. most people here seem to use this with their electric razor and put it on before they shave that is great!..... but I love to use it as an after shave! it feels great after I shave with a regular razor blade and shaving cream and just put afta on as an after shave. it feels really nice and really smoothes out my skin after I shave. I almost cant live without this brand. I just love it. I recommend this brand both as a pre electric lotion and as an after shave lotion. it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for years. During that time, I have used several pre-electric lotions. This product is the best that I have ever used. I will not use any other as long as I can buy this one. Sometimes it is hard to find.  I don&#x27;t know why. I ordered several bottles online because they were out of it for several weeks where I usually buy it. I was desperate. I can&#x27;t even find it out in the western states. I am puzzled because in my opinion it is superior to anything else on the market. Mennen ought to market it better so they can get it into a lot more stores and states. A new ad campaign, new packaging, etc., anything to have it more accessible to the public. They can make a lot more money with this fine product.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and yet I have a very tough beard. The worst combination possible. So for years I cut, irritated my skin with regular shaving razors. Then I thought I would switch to an electric razor. Had a lower end Norelco that worked \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but not as close as a blade and my neck still got chewed up. So then I got a Braun 5 Series here on Amazon. It still irritated my neck, and it did not cut near as close as my old Norelco and not even remotelt close to a razor.   I then thought, I have to do something, so I got a new Norelco shaver and began using Williams Lectric shave as a preshave prep. I used it with my old Norelco, my Braun and my new Norelco... WLS is pretty good, but still my neck would get \\&quot;somewhat\\&quot; irritated. The Braun still would not cut my beard.  The Norelco&#x27;s cut better.     I lived with this for two years and still got plenty of comments from my wife about my \\&quot;chewed up neck\\&quot;.    At the end of my rope, I was searching Amazon and saw the reviews for Afta Pre-Electric. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a tryl    I went to my local Walgreens, but they did not have it. I did pick it up at Wally-World and OMG, the reviews on Amazon were right! None, zero, zilch neck irritaiton and my newer Norelco has never cut better (and my blades are old).  It is unreal how great my skin feels and looks. No redness at all. My shaving heads are not clogged and no issues with skin burning. I like the scent and the product flat out does what it is supposed to do.    Finally....</li>
            <li> I have a really rough beard and this softens and conditions before I shave whether I use a blade or an electric razor. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Best stuff, nothing else compares.  Others burn and causes redness (I&#x27;ve been corrected; this does contain alcohol), and are greasy.  This is a like a lotion, which you&#x27;d think would clog your razor, but it doesn&#x27;t at all, which just makes your skin smooth, makes your whiskers stand-up, and smells good.  Washes right off.  Hard to find; online&#x27;s about the only way I can get it anymore.</li>
            <li> After 5 months of shaving wet with my new panasonic 8249S I tried shaving dry.  Could not find a good pre electric lotion that worked. Spent unnessasary money on Lab Series, Williams,and Remington powder stick. Nothing seemed to work with out dragging on my face.  I remember 25 years ago shaving with a Panasonic foil and Old Spice shaving powder and use to get a good shave. (not made anymore)&lt;br /&gt; Got to keep trying the dry shave. I mean this is suppose to be a top of the line shaver, Right?&lt;br /&gt; Bought the Afta and Boom!  This is the one! Washed face first then put this on.  Finally got a 97% good dry shave. Does not smell bad to me, and seems to linger on all day.  Maybe I will wash face off after shaving, next time.&lt;br /&gt;  P.S.  I still have to touch up the neck area a little with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that does what it is supposed to--improve the shave.  It is perfectly easy to apply, unlike most pre-shaves which are in liquid form,because it is in the form of  a lotion. It is very soothing on the skin, makes your beard stand up and allows the razor to glide easily  resulting in a comfortable close shave.  The pity, for me, is the punguent scent which I find too strong for a facial product. I don&#x27;t care for scented cosmetics on my face to begin with, but decided  to take a chance here despite ample warning. Big mistake.  But if you want a pre-electric that really does the job well and don&#x27;t mind  a heavy woodsy odor that harkens back to the barbershop days of the fifties,  this may well be for you.  If I could remove the scent, or if Mennen could produce it fragrance-free,  I&#x27;d use it every time and give it 5 stars+.</li>
            <li> Last year I acquired an Arcitec electric shaver from Norelco to replace my previous Norelco. I found I suddenly absolutely had to use a pre shave with this new shaver. To me, the regular Williams Lectric pre shave is too messy, although it works well. I did like, and used, their gel lotion but they apparently stopped manufacturing it. The Afta product is my fallback solution. It works, isn&#x27;t as messy as the regular Williams, but it smells awful to me - kind of like the barbershops of the 50&#x27;s, as I remember them.</li>
            <li> Really does do what it promises. I get a much closer shave with my Braun 8985 when I use Afta. But why did they name it \\&quot;afta\\&quot;? Sounds like \\&quot;after.\\&quot; Consider changing the name to \\&quot;prefta.\\&quot; Just kidding.</li>
            <li> This product dries out so you have to keep splashing water on it.  That way my electric razor can glide on my face. who wants a bumpy ride.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different kind&#x27;s of pre-shave gel&#x27;s and lotion&#x27;s. This is by far the best I have used. I have never used a pre-shave that had alcohol in it, which this does. I shave with an electric shaver actually the Braun 9595 series. With this pre-shave it allows for a very close shave and the shaver just glides along my face. This is the only product I will use from now on. I would highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> My husband would love to comment on the pre-electric, but we received after shave instead and it is not worth the hassle to return it and try again.</li>
            <li> I use only this and one other brand only for my VERY SENSITIVE skin. I do buy 2-4 at a time !!!</li>
            <li> Afta Pre Electric.  One of the few left that does not contain \\&quot;green Tea\\&quot;.  Transaction was very smooth and prompt.</li>
            <li> My son uses this on his shaved head.  It works well.</li>
            <li> I have not received this product which was due about a week ago according to your advice,  Please advise.................Laurie Middleweek</li>
            <li> This is the best preshave I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried some of the fanciar brands over the years, as well as the popular and easy to find Lectric Shave.  In addition to finding the Lectric shaves scent rather foul and stale, I really do feel that this Afta works much better at what its actually supposed to do as well. This Afta blend is a light lotion unlike the Lectric shave, and is a good cross between a liquid that tends to roll out of your hand when applying, and the shave sticks that can tend to gum up some of the finer shavers.  I like this stuff a lot and enjoy its very manly scent.  For some reason its very hard to find in stores around these parts, and I not only recommend it, but suggest you buy it right here on Amazon in the twin pack... : )</li>
            <li> And the winner is ... Williams Lectric Shave with Electric Glide Formula being a very close second&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a review of six products and this same review is posted on each product&#x27;s Amazon site. The products tried were (in order of preference): Williams Lectric Shave, Electric Glide Formula (California North), Afta Pre-electric by Mennen (original), Skin Bracer, Eltron Prep and Kinexium Shave Oil by King-Of-Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used an electric shaver for more than 30 years and, for the first time in over 20 years, am trying these pre-electric lotions again after having shaved without these the last 20 years. In general, these all provide a noticeably smoother and less irritating shaving experience. They don&#x27;t speed up the process, but do allow for a close shave while minimizing the shaver &#x60;burn&#x27; sensation that follows shaving. The trick is to find the one that you prefer based upon application, performance and odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Despite the superior application and lower &#x60;oily&#x27; feel of Afta, I had to go with Williams Lectric Shave. It is easy to wash off (if you wish) and has a mild and pleasant odor. Electric Glide Formula is a very close second and I alternate between the two, but use Williams Lectric Shave much more often. Williams Lectric Shave has the least amount of &#x27;gumming&#x27; in the blades vs. the Electric Glide Formula (which can be heavy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel consistency of Afta is much better for application than the liquids (which run through your fingers, like water), but only Afta is a gel. It&#x27;s surprising: you&#x27;d think they would all be scrambling to offer the superior gel consistency or, at least, put the liquids it into a spray pump. If you put the Williams Lectric Shave and Electric Glide Formula into sample-sized spray pumps, spray them on your face then spread with your hand, you will have a much better and less wasteful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application (applying it to your face):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a spray pump for the water consistency products is a must. Without a spray pump, application is difficult and wastes product (as it runs off your hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.&lt;br /&gt;- Electric Glide Formula has a water consistency and no sting when applied.&lt;br /&gt;- Williams Lectric Shave has a water consistency and can sting.&lt;br /&gt;- Skin Bracer has a water consistency and can sting.&lt;br /&gt;- Eltron Prep has a water consistency and can sting.&lt;br /&gt;- Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are ranked in order of preference. Most of the products cause &#x60;gumming&#x27; of the beard trimmings in the shaver blades. This will require more frequent cleaning of the shaver than shaving without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Afta has less of an &#x60;oily&#x27; feel to it that is easy to wash off. There is no &#x27;gumming&#x27; (clumping of the beard trimmings in the blades).&lt;br /&gt;- Williams Lectric Shave has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is somewhat easy to wash off.

Heavier &#x27;gumming&#x27; vs. the above two.&lt;br /&gt;- Skin Bracer has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is difficult to wash off and can cause &#x60;gumming&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;- Eltron Prep has a moderate &#x60;oily&#x27; feel that is difficult to wash off and can cause &#x60;gumming&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent following sink washing of the face:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will all stay with you for many hours, so you better like what you pick (ranked in order of preference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Williams Lectric Shave has an &#x60;evergreen&#x27; odor.&lt;br /&gt;- Electric Glide Formula has a mild citrus odor&lt;br /&gt;- Skin Bracer has a moderate lime odor&lt;br /&gt;- Afta has a strong musty &#x60;woodsy&#x27; odor.&lt;br /&gt;- Eltron Prep has a &#x60;skunk&#x27; type of odorspray pump, application is difficult and wastes product (as it runs off your hand)    - Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.  - Electric Glide Formula has a water consistency and no sting when applied.  - Williams Lectric Shave has a water consistency and can sting.  - Skin Bracer has a water consistency and can sting.  - Eltron Prep has a water consistency and can sting.  - Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.

            <li> This item from Mennen is difficult to find, and being over eighty I dislike shopping around town.  So easy to obtain it from this seller, with timely delivery to my door.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every pre-electric shave lotion on the market and this is the only one that gives me the close shave I am looking for without an overwhelming fragrance.  This is only available through the marketplace and I recommend TeeBop over Deal Buzz Health.</li>
            <li> I had bought a store brand of this item from CVS, but I wanted to try this because it was a better price for the two-pack, and I assumed it would have the same fragrance as the store brand. I&#x27;ve decided that cassava flour-based pre-shave lotions are the best choice for me. For my beard, the alcohol in this stuff tightens up my skin, but once it dries, the cassava flour leaves my skin very smooth and the razor just glides right over my face. There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind I&#x27;m getting a better, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem, however, is the fragrance. It&#x27;s very spicy, with a heavy clove scent, and it lingers long after I have shaved. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s like Old Spice, but it&#x27;s how I imagine Old Spice would smell. It&#x27;s really overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the CVS-branded pre-shave lotion. It works just as well, and smells far better in my (and my wife&#x27;s) opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this pre shave off and on for a number of years. Began having problems finding it in stores, so I turned to Amazon, and found that is available at a very good price. I like this pre shave because it smoothes things out, doesn&#x27;t clog my razor, and has a pleasant after scent.</li>
            <li> I have used Mennen Afta skin conditioner original for many years. This product smells great and does not burn or sting when applied after shaving. It makes your face feel smooth and soft. I can no longer find it in local stores. Glad its available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was not Mennen&#x27;s Afta after shave conditioner, but rather their pre-electric lotion which is impossible to find any more.  I felt this was the best pre-electric lotion and missed it when it seems to only be available on line.</li>
            <li> This is an old product that has been around for many years, and I have used it for many years.  However, as much as I like it, I find that it is hard to purchase in local stores so I order it from Amazon.  It is soothing to my face, smells good without being over powering, and it causes no negative reactions on my skin.</li>
            <li> After reading online reviews, I bought Mennen Afta. Mistake. Williams Lectric Shave is much easier to apply and smells better.</li>
            <li> An old favorite for an old friend.  I am glad they still make this and it is the same formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like the other reviewers, I love this stuff. I have also tried many others thru the years but this works best for me. The only problem is, like the other reviewers have stated, it&#x27;s hard to find. But, as long as amazon supplies a source to purchase it, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it here.</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this product.  He smells good also.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my first Afta PreElectric thinking that I was buying the basic Afta After Shave (they were right next to each other on the shelf, and often still are).  I actually used it as After Shave awhile, until I noticed the extra printing \\&quot;PreElectric\\&quot;. It worked great as PreElectric and when I went to clean the head I really was surprised at how clean they were, no gummy residue like other preelectrics I had used. Then applying it, it all goes on your face and it doesn&#x27;t drip from your hand to the sink. That was years ago.  I have used it ever since, but now I find that it is hard to find in stock.  Some stores don&#x27;t  even carry it. That doesn&#x27;t make sense.  Are they playing hard to get!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband - he loves this for travel (plastic bottle and non-liquid), rather than the glass-bottled liquid alternative.</li>
            <li> Love good old fashioned Afta!  Good smelling, works great, and smells fresh &amp; clean! This is a GREAT for two!</li>
            <li> aftershave smells good</li>
            <li> Pretty good pre save cream, have tried different brands and this is one of the better ones I believe. Would buy again</li>
            <li> This item has been unavailable in drug stores for several years.  Happily it is available on Amazon.  I have sensitive skin and like to shave after a shower with my trusty Norelco.  My skin is slightly damp and with no pre shave I end up with razor burn. The liquid pre shaves sting and I also end up with irritation. The Mennen is a lotion style and even if my face is slightly damp it dries in maybe 30 second and is ready to shave. The shave is smooth with less rubbing over and over the face.  A better shave with minimal irritation.   As a side note I also use the Neutrogena SPF20 after shave cream which I like better than any of the liquid after shaves.  My conclusion is that my face doesn&#x27;t like the high alcohol content of either the pre or after shaves.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new electric shaver and I added this pre-electric lotion, thinking that it is what it says... Sadly, when I received the product, instead of the pre-shave lotion, I got the after shave lotion... As I look at the picture now, I see the picture shows the after shave lotion, but the description and all reviews are for the pre-shave lotion, so there is a big disconnect here... I&#x27;m hesitant to buy another &amp;#34;pre-electric&amp;#34; lotion, who knows what they ship me...</li>
            <li> Having always had either a beard or goatee I needing something that would help my sensitve facial skin whne I decided to go with a clean face. This product does the job.</li>
            <li> good product.. still very effective for so many years. nice smell non-oily. Would definitely purchase again. really good deal. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding these locally for my husband. Was glad to find it here. Exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> good product...sometimes not available in the store...I need to write 13 more words for some asinine reason, so here they are</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband because the local stores stopped carrying it. This makes his shaving experience that much more enjoyable due to this high quality product. I dislike having to pay for shipping but since I can&#x27;t get it local, don&#x27;t have much choice. The price is not bad if you are buying packs of two, quite reasonable actually. If you are looking for an excellent pre-electric cream to use before you shave, we highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent after shave product! Very good for sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this stuff and it is hard to find in local retail stores.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old Mennen pre Shave. Does not smell as good, kind of sticky. When you have a winner, don&#x27;t change the formula. It is OK , but not as good.</li>
            <li> I have using this product for many years, I absolutely love it.  In my shopping area, it was becoming difficult to find.  Finding it at Azamon.com, and, in quanity was great.</li>
            <li> I stopped using after once because the smell is sooo strong and pungent.&lt;br /&gt;seemed to work ok on first shave interms of increasing the hair grasp and cut&lt;br /&gt;the smell is soo strong (similar to classic old spice but 1000 times stronger) it lasted on shaver even after washing it three times with soap for almost a week</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT IS SHOWN IN PIC....I ordered Afta original AFTER SHAVE, not pre-electric shave...this is going straight back.</li>
            <li> Being that I&#x27;d not tried this product before I relied on the comments from other purchasers who reviewed this and gave it an well deserved approval rating. I&#x27;ve used it for a week and am very pleased with the results. It really soothed my skin before using my electric razor. When I run out I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Wanted pre-shave.  Looked for hours.  Evidently I misread something because I was searching for pre-shave (Mennen).  Got two bottles of after shave instead.  I hate it.  Already had Afta After Shave and  already was tired of the antique smell.......</li>
            <li> My husband has super sensitive skin. He loves this product because it really helps when using an electric razor. He would recommend it for all those who use an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I was using this until the stores stopped carrying it for some unknown reason. The powder sticks were OK but preferred this since it went on better and had a nice smell to it. It actually gives me a better shave with out any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> This is a gel product. Unlike the water or should I say liquid there is no mess. Just rub in a little on the face and wait 30 seconds to dry then shave. I have fine whiskers and this product helps my whiskers stand up.</li>
            <li> clogs the Norelco shaver heads</li>
            <li> much better than the Nivea I&#x27;ve been getting locally. Not sticky and does not attract dirt on your skin like some other creams.&lt;br /&gt;Decent scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a conditioner for Pete&#x27;s sake. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
