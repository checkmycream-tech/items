            <li>Best price I can find.  </li>
            <li>, product arrived in great condition!</li>
            <li>This is the best product to use to get a close non-abrasive shave.</li>
            <li>Best shaving cream ever.</li>
            <li>He feels that it is the best product on the market</li>
            <li>The shave you get with Premier is excellent.</li>

            <li>great moisturizer...</li>
            <li>Great product for men who get ingrowing hair after they shave.  </li>

            <li>husband loved how close a shave he got from using this product.  </li>
            <li>, tried demitage.. not so good,  then derma-e ..was pretty good smells great!)</li>
            <li>I first purchased the shaving cream, it was $40.00 a tube and got a wonderful bargain at Amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t believe that a product which did not create a foam could produce an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>If you follow directions, it gives a smooth shave and leaves the face feeling great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>I was happy to see it being sold on Amazon at a much better price and very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This is by far THE best shave cream that I have come across.</li>
            <li>Just amazing - will recommend to others and the \\&quot;innovation\\&quot; of having this effect without a foam is simply astonishing</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Many friends have asked what have I been doing to my face......any type of injections, etc.  </li>
            <li>I tried this years ago from a mall kiosk like many people on here.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product that delivers a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I guess you could say it smells like an \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; product, for lack of a better word/phrase.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin with a nice smooth feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this for many years and raves about it.  </li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love the samples you provided.</li>
            <li>So smooth and works amazingly.</li>
            <li>and the top wouldn&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li>u will love it .</li>
            <li>I would love to continue using this product if I could find an,American,reseller.</li>
            <li>Because of this smell, I thought I&#x27;d try Nivea shaving cream for men, which gives a nice cool menthol smell.</li>
            <li>I wish the description was more accurate.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shaving cream, period.  </li>
            <li>I get a closer shave and my face feels smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Contains oils which make for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>His face is sooooo smooth after he shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product provided a light, almost moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>It delivered a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>His face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, which I can&#x27;t say it ever was before.</li>
            <li>like it almost as much as hydroderm, so bought more.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;is not good, but truly gives the best shave&lt;br /&gt;ever.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth consistent shave without all the foam.</li>
            <li>I put this on first, then shaving cream over it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s exactly what he wanted</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product at a temporary kiosk in a mall when traveling on business.</li>
            <li>i switch off with proraso&lt;br /&gt;shave cream, which i use ten times more</li>
            <li>This stuff works so much better than regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon.com,,,,Oh yea,,,the cream,delivers a close lasting shave,,face is very smooth after shaving,,and</li>
            <li>but it was a positive experience.</li>
            <li>As long as they are both Israeli products, I love em both</li>
            <li>It is great, but very thick.</li>
            <li>I recall reading a couple of reviews where they said that the cream clogged their blades -I believe they might&#x27;ve put on too much-</li>
            <li>I like this brand very much, so much that I am a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li>This is not a cream,it&#x27;s a gel, very misleading.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and extremely clean shaven after one round with razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I feel like it ran out too fast, but worked fine and only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and very soft.  </li>
            <li>con was the high price and has to be ordered online.</li>
            <li>Love this product, little to no irritation is used as directed.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this product because I love the premier dead sea</li>
            <li>If you have the time, I have found that if you can wait a few minutes after you put it on, it seems to work even better.  </li>
            <li>Very little of the product is needed for each shave so the tube lasts for many months.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have a close comfortable shave with less skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Everything works fine, and definitely \\&quot;a little dab &#x27;</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be much the same.</li>
            <li>although it only gives a normal shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product on my whole face, the razor gets clogged, making shaving difficult, but i have started using this just for my upper lip area, where I always get small cuts and nicks, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is pretty thick and really protects your face, giving you a close shave.</li>

            <li> I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is pretty thick and really protects your face, giving you a close shave.</li>
            <li> not sure what this really is.  </li>
            <li> I noticed is that when I had a sensitive spot on my face, the Premier Dead Sea Shaving Cream sort of took away that \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; feeling and made it easier to shave in that area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is strange stuff that provides the closest&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li> It just takes too long to order and receive the product from,Israel.  </li>
            <li> But since my last purchase six months ago the price almost doubled, so now I am looking at other brands.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head and this product is the only one that leaves no residue or tight dry skin feeling...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You definitely won&#x27;t cut yourself using this, but it can clog and be difficult to rinse out of your razor, not allowing for a shave that is as close as a regular high quality cream</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product in the middle of a mall, very expensive.  </li>
            <li> However, it lathers ever-so-slightly, that I keep going back to the Premier Dead Sea Shaving Cream for Men because I&#x27;ve grown to not like lather, as I mentioned earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No better than any other shave gel costing far less</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> No more cuts, and I can make several passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It allows a closer shave than any other shave gel or cream that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and my skill was less oily troughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell, but wish it were a little scented.</li>
            <li> Use in the field shaving and still has little or no irritation even in winter.  </li>
            <li> Probably the worse brushless shaving cream (gel, actually)</li>
            <li> not available in my area.</li>
            <li> Hence, the stuff dried out.</li>
            <li> does not have a heavy aroma or greasiness to it.</li>
            <li> He has paid over $40.00 for it until I came into his life and found it for way less!</li>
            <li> very odd, like glue, maybe from&lt;br /&gt;the dead sea mud, does not have much&lt;br /&gt;slipperiness.</li>
            <li> no strong perfume and genial on his face.</li>
            <li> a little dab will do ya ?!!</li>
            <li> it is so thick that it gets stuck in your shaving apparatus</li>
            <li> Unlike other Premier Dead Sea products this one is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Sadly,because of the expense and lack of availability I may be forced to find another product!  </li>
            <li> ill do</li>
            <li> my wife bought this from a mall it was expensive but found here a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Expensive at the mall, but if you buy if hear you can get it cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product until I am unable to get it.</li>
            <li> How wrong I was!</li>
            <li> This makes me very sad as when I find a product that I like I tend to stick with it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to get the soap out of the knives</li>
            <li> Worst shaving cream</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use this with my regular shaving cream. I put this on first, then shaving cream over it. I get a closer shave and my face feels smooth all day.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the Deep Sea After Shave Balm for several years and loves it.  When I went to order the After Shave Balm I found the Shaving Cream and desided to also order that.  He has been using it since it arrived and says he is getting a closer shave without any irritation.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine, and definitely \\&quot;a little dab &#x27;ill do ya\\&quot;  and I haven&#x27;t run out soon, but it seems to be coming.. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I feel like it ran out too fast, but worked fine and only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Good product, prompt service.  I have been using hydroderm for 5 years (luv it!), tried demitage.. not so good,  then derma-e ..was pretty good smells great!) Then my husband bought me this... like it almost as much as hydroderm, so bought more.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE best shave cream that I have come across.Leaves my skin smooth and extremely clean shaven after one round with razor.NO razor burn and skin feels nourished.</li>
            <li> This product has made a difference in my facial skin.  Many friends have asked what have I been doing to my face......any type of injections, etc.  No, I said...and told them of this product.    romarie</li>
            <li> If you follow directions, it gives a smooth shave and leaves the face feeling great.  I would give it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and found it to be the best of the many I have tried.  Contains oils which make for a smooth shave.  Very little of the product is needed for each shave so the tube lasts for many months.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Premier Shaving Cream and says he would not be without it.  His face is sooooo smooth after he shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first purchased the shaving cream, it was $40.00 a tube and got a wonderful bargain at Amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin</li>
            <li> I tried this years ago from a mall kiosk like many people on here. I loved it with a gillette mach 3/fusion. It is great, but very thick. I now use a double edge safety razor to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use this product on my whole face, the razor gets clogged, making shaving difficult, but i have started using this just for my upper lip area, where I always get small cuts and nicks, and it works great. No more cuts, and I can make several passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely won&#x27;t cut yourself using this, but it can clog and be difficult to rinse out of your razor, not allowing for a shave that is as close as a regular high quality cream</li>
            <li> After being accosted at a mid-mall kiosk for &amp;#34;Dead Sea&amp;#34; products, I decided to see what was offered on Amazon. This is a nice product that delivers a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is my third tube-type shaving cream that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m loving it -I can&#x27;t go back to foam. I recall reading a couple of reviews where they said that the cream clogged their blades -I believe they might&#x27;ve put on too much- all you need is a light/thin coat of this on your face. This shaving cream is pretty thick and really protects your face, giving you a close shave. I suggest you rinse your shaver as you shave, this way it keeps the blades unclogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not too keen about is its smell. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell, but wish it were a little scented. I guess you could say it smells like an \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; product, for lack of a better word/phrase. Because of this smell, I thought I&#x27;d try Nivea shaving cream for men, which gives a nice cool menthol smell. It also leaves your skin with a nice smooth feeling after shaving. However, it lathers ever-so-slightly, that I keep going back to the Premier Dead Sea Shaving Cream for Men because I&#x27;ve grown to not like lather, as I mentioned earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed is that when I had a sensitive spot on my face, the Premier Dead Sea Shaving Cream sort of took away that \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; feeling and made it easier to shave in that area. It also leaves my skin with a clean/smooth feeling after shaving. Were it not for the smell, I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for many years and raves about it.  It is gentle and very soft.  Would recommend.  Best price I can find.  He has paid over $40.00 for it until I came into his life and found it for way less!</li>
            <li> my wife bought this from a mall it was expensive but found here a lot cheaper.  It allows a closer shave than any other shave gel or cream that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream from one of those mall carts,,,four times the money,,,easily,,I felt like a total fool,,,now that I see it on Amazon,,,I will still use it,,1/4 the money,,,and probably the price it should be ??  Thanks to Amazon.com,,,,Oh yea,,,the cream,delivers a close lasting shave,,face is very smooth after shaving,,and a little dab will do ya ?!!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  Expensive at the mall, but if you buy if hear you can get it cheaper.  Be warned, if you buy it from hear, it will take about 2 weeks to get it.  It arrived faster than their &amp;#34;estimated arrival&amp;#34;, but it did take a while.  But it&#x27;s exactly what he wanted, product arrived in great condition!</li>
            <li> This product provided a light, almost moisturizing effect.  Noticed my makeup blended in well and my skill was less oily troughout the day.  Skin feels smooth after use.  Looking forward to buying the moisturizing cream to follow.  Love the samples you provided.</li>
            <li> Worst shaving cream it is so thick that it gets stuck in your shaving apparatus and it&#x27;s impossible to get the soap out of the knives</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product in the middle of a mall, very expensive.  I did not buy it again because of the price.  I was happy to see it being sold on Amazon at a much better price and very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Probably the worse brushless shaving cream (gel, actually) I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t soften my beard, and doesn&#x27;t create enough lubrication for the razor . Unlike other Premier Dead Sea products this one is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t believe that a product which did not create a foam could produce an excellent shave. How wrong I was! This is the best product to use to get a close non-abrasive shave.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream ever. So smooth and works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at a temporary kiosk in a mall when traveling on business. Since using this product, I have a close comfortable shave with less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> husband loved how close a shave he got from using this product.  ordered tubes for each man in my life. con was the high price and has to be ordered online. not available in my area.</li>
            <li> I purchaced this item at the mall kiosk also. I shave my head and this product is the only one that leaves no residue or tight dry skin feeling...great moisturizer...all my shaving is done with a dime size of this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. No better than any other shave gel costing far less and the top wouldn&#x27;t close. Hence, the stuff dried out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  Before he started using this product he would get in growing hair after he shaved.  So I bought this product because I love the premier dead sea and I talked him in to using it and he loves it.  He will not shave with out it.  Great product for men who get ingrowing hair after they shave.  Try it.....u will love it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, like it a lot.  does not have a heavy aroma or greasiness to it.</li>
            <li> The non-foaming cream worked well. It delivered a smooth comfortable shave. I have only used it once so far but it was a positive experience.</li>
            <li> I like this brand very much, so much that I am a repeat customer.  But since my last purchase six months ago the price almost doubled, so now I am looking at other brands.  I don&#x27;t see the value now,</li>
            <li> not sure what this really is.  it&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;like any shave cream.  has blue dye&lt;br /&gt;so it comes out radioactive blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels very odd, like glue, maybe from&lt;br /&gt;the dead sea mud, does not have much&lt;br /&gt;slipperiness. i switch off with proraso&lt;br /&gt;shave cream, which i use ten times more&lt;br /&gt;often although it only gives a normal shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the premier has a chemically smell that&lt;br /&gt;is not good, but truly gives the best shave&lt;br /&gt;ever.  i think the glue effect creates a suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is strange stuff that provides the closest&lt;br /&gt;of close shaves.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my son each Christmas. He feels that it is the best product on the market</li>
            <li> This is not a cream,it&#x27;s a gel, very misleading.  I ended up returning it.  I wish the description was more accurate.</li>
            <li> I am a user of Ahava Shaving Cream for men and I thought this would be much the same. The shave you get with Premier is excellent. The thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it feels like rubbing Vaseline on your face. That aside, the shave was great. Might stay with Ahava but might switch back and forth. As long as they are both Israeli products, I love em both</li>
            <li> Just amazing - will recommend to others and the \\&quot;innovation\\&quot; of having this effect without a foam is simply astonishing</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shaving cream, period.  I have not came across anything that tops it yet.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, a little goes a long way.  If you have the time, I have found that if you can wait a few minutes after you put it on, it seems to work even better.  Yes it is more expensive then others, but once you use it, you will never go back,  If you are considering it, try it you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, little to no irritation is used as directed.  Use in the field shaving and still has little or no irritation even in winter.  It gets only 4 stars b/c of the price.  Lasts 4-6 months if you use the amount recommended too.</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth consistent shave without all the foam.</li>
            <li> This product gives me the closes shave that I have ever had!  I discovered this product a couple of years ago and I have used it ever since!  Sadly,because of the expense and lack of availability I may be forced to find another product!  This makes me very sad as when I find a product that I like I tend to stick with it.  It just takes too long to order and receive the product from,Israel.  I would love to continue using this product if I could find an,American,reseller.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used. This stuff works so much better than regular shaving cream. I will continue to use this product until I am unable to get it.</li>
            <li> husband loves this. no strong perfume and genial on his face.</li>
            <li> My husband raves how great a shave he gets with this shaving cream.  His face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, which I can&#x27;t say it ever was before.</li>
