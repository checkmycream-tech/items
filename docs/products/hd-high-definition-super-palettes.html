            <li> This makeup isn&#x27;t too heavy and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little hard to remove the make up, even after scrubbing and using a face wash</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I wanted to find good colors for contouring and these seemed really nice.  I bought both Warm #3 &amp; #1 the colors were perfect for it (#2 was too close to my skin tone).  They are so creamy and blendable and a little goes a long way!  The only con (which I was prepared for) is that they contain oil and I have extremely oily/acne prone skin.  It&#x27;s also a little hard to remove the make up, even after scrubbing and using a face wash I  saw some traces of make up on my cotton pad with toner.  My primer helps a lot for the first couple of hours but by the end of the day (without touching up) my T zone was very shiny.  But the results after applying it makes up for it because it has really good coverage and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Colors where too dark for my Latin olive skin. Great product however</li>
            <li> This is a nice warm palette for highlighting and contouring your face especially as a woman of color. It allows me to create perfectly arched, clean and manicured brows which I like a lot. This makeup isn&#x27;t too heavy and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> These are the best concealers!!! So worth the money!! If you have a lot to cover up you will need this palette I also use as foundation</li>
            <li> This was the first cream contouring product I bought two whole years ago and I still use it. It has a good range of colors for everyday contouring to when you want to look like a chiseled goddess! Lol. Very easy to blend. Good consistency. Not too dry or too wet.</li>
            <li> Second time I buy it... good performance, but I wish its components (ingredient list) wasn&#x27;t as harmful. Good coverage, matches my skin tone great.</li>
            <li> I looked at the picture and kinda bought a darker shade than I originally thought i did but it works great for contouring. I have olive/yellow skin and the darkest shade it a chocolate color, but still the shade did and excellent job contouring my face with out making it look like I had too much makeup on. But again the lightest shade I thought would be lighter but turned out it was actually a bit darker than my skin which I was a bit upset with cause I wanted to use that for a brighter concealer to highlight my eyes, but the color doesn&#x27;t seem to be light at all.... but if you are looking for a great contouring pallet which involves the shading part I would recommend this great product, it works well blending with a brush and mixes well on the face.</li>
            <li> I use this palette to highlight and contour my face. It is great. It provides great coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> bummed - the color shown here at the left is WAY lighter than the actual stuff I received; also the variance of color is minute - not nearly as drastic as the picture appears. I thought the lighter colors on this pallet would work for light/tan latin skin. no way. Maybe for an African American.</li>
            <li> Great as a concealer. I use it to contour and love how it blends. My skin is naturally oily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this Beautiful, small, easy to use &amp; carry product. I am glad i bought it. Recommended for contouring</li>
            <li> Very rich and smooth , so far I really like</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this product. Bought it to use as a foundation but decided to use the darker shades as an under eye concealer instead. A little goes a long way and blends very well with my Beauty Blender sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each palette contains a spectrum of shades and they are darker than how they appear in the photo. I may consider buying Warm 2 to see if I can find a perfect foundation match. For reference I wear MUFE HD 170.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation that I have ever purchased. It blends so well and it is so light on my skin. I feel like Im not wearing any makeup at all when I apply this foundation. Well worth the money. Highly recommend this foundation</li>
            <li> very cool! I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I have oily skin and it does not smear, run or look too &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; I like it, and can&#x27;t wait to use it more!</li>
            <li> Darker than it looks in the pic. Not a very high quality makeup.</li>
            <li> Better than MAC, its my secret weapon</li>
            <li> Best Creme Palette ever i buy a new one ever couple months - that&#x27;s how good it is</li>

            <li> love it will continue to order</li>
            <li> Amazing Product. blends unbelievably well and goes well with most skin tones. Fast delivery. Ordering another one soon cos i love it soo much.</li>
            <li> Im a makeup artis and i use this foundation with all my clients it blends so good with all types of skin types n photographs amazingly is a perfect foundation for brides.</li>
            <li> Not as creamy as I thought it would be...</li>
