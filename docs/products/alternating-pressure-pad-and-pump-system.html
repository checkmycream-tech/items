            <li>I do love this thing, and it has help up well!</li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t say how well this pad would work for a much heavier person, but Mom weighs about 130 pounds and it&#x27;s perfect for her.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to set up.</li>
            <li>As part of that disease, she has gradually lost the ability to move on her own, and hasn&#x27;t been able to shift or turn over in her bed for most of that time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered for my Dad who is 94 and spends most of his time in bed.</li>
            <li>I find that I am sleeping much better, not getting the pains in my sides, not having to flip over every hour.</li>
            <li>The quality of this pad is much better than the one provided through a rental company.  </li>
            <li>Ordered on one day and 3 days later it was delivered in perfect condition and the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li>He is more ambulatory and does not need the hospital bed</li>
            <li>I bought this for my handicapped brother who is for the most part bedridden.</li>
            <li>No need for a pricey system that does nothing better than this model.</li>
            <li>Would like a more durable pump.</li>
            <li>We have had it a couple months now and the patch has held up great and it works really well.</li>
            <li>a massage and ointments used without (Alternating Pressure Pump And Pad System Deluxe Pad) did nothing to help but so far so good.</li>
            <li>but but about 4&#x27; wider) under it and another 2&amp;#34; on top of it to make it even more comfortable and that helps to protect the air pad too.  </li>
            <li>My mom is bedridden with Parkinson&#x27;s and we bought this pad to make her hospital bed mattress more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>She said it was more comfortable than the one she had at home.</li>
            <li>Easy to hook up</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and operate.</li>
            <li>It is easy to inflate, deflate, adjust and maneuver.</li>
            <li>2 months of co pay was more then the cost of buying the item here online in full.  </li>
            <li>-After using this for a year and a half, I have to say it has been WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but does not have an adjustment knob we wanted.</li>
            <li>however, after one month it has been working fine...</li>
            <li>It is a super product and everything I hoped for!</li>
            <li>Has been a huge help in her sleeping thru the night.</li>
            <li>he has used this item non stop since it arrived and he loves it so much that he took this item into his own bed that he shares with his wife.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I would give this item 10 stars if they were available.</li>
            <li>My 94 year old mother has no complaints at all which is as good a compliment as one could expect to get.</li>
            <li>and I got the higher limit thinking it would be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>thanks, i liked ,super deal.</li>
            <li>I do put one 2&amp;#34; memory foam pad (full length</li>
            <li>if you have a decent mattress to put it on top of, I think it would work well.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, there was a patch kit and we patched it up.</li>
            <li>First, I found I had to put it UNDER the 2\\&quot; foam, not just under the sheet, to be really comfortable.</li>
            <li>For less than $25 per year, you will have a great product.</li>
            <li>For less than $25 per year, you will have a great product.</li>
            <li>This item was received very well packaged and very quickly.   </li>
            <li>I have requested from a couple of the suppliers that they send me information regarding the model number of this new-and-improved model of pump, and NO ONE WILL RESPOND TO MY EMAIL, making me think that they are all just trying to pull a fast one on us consumers, by not having a model number in the ad they just sell a product that LOOKS just like the photo in the ad, and DOES NOT MATCH THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!!</li>

            <li>The deluxe with adjustable pressure is just like the one we were renting from a medical supply for $30 a month for my father after he got out of the hospital.  </li>
            <li>not so I think I got my money&#x27;s worth out of it.  </li>
            <li>Very good sometimes it&#x27;s gets a little warm and they feel a little itchy</li>
            <li>Even adjustable air mattresses and special foam coverings have never made much of a difference for me.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could be better would be to make a WIDER version - while this is wide enough, it would be nice if it allowed me to move around on the bed a bit more!</li>
            <li>It not only provides alternating support to the body but is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Certainly getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan</li>
            <li>Certainly getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan</li>
            <li>(8 liters per minute) of air pressure, which means it will inflate and deflate more easily and with less strain on the pump.</li>
            <li>(8 liters per minute) of air pressure, which means it will inflate and deflate more easily and with less strain on the pump.</li>
            <li>Gel overlay I bought through medical company worked way better.</li>
            <li>In fact, over the last two days, I&#x27;ve slept for more than 10 hours at a time (except for bathroom breaks).  </li>
            <li>Putting this on my hospital bed has helped relieve pain enough that I have been able to sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a paraplegic for 45 years and had one of these when first injured</li>
            <li>The alternating pressure pump bought accomplished what it was desined for at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY quiet and set up is easy.  </li>
            <li>It costs less than most air mattress you&#x27;d buy at a department store, so it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>And my lower back feels just fine.</li>
            <li>She really likes it</li>
            <li>She still has to be turned regularly to prevent bedsores, but this pad helps keep her comfortable until she gets turned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to stay in bed more than a few hours without my back, knees, hips, etc.</li>
            <li>This one is tougher feeling and is longer so it covers the whole bed from end to end.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this pressure mattress out of desperation, in order to try and keep from having to put her in the hospital for her remaining days, because none of my family wants her to die alone and among people who never knew her when she was her real self.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This is a very economical pad and pump compared with what a medical supply house would charge for a comparable unit.  </li>
            <li>However this is a minor issue easily dealt with - still</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy as one time cost less than three months&#x27; rental from a medical supply place.  </li>
            <li>And I sleep SO COMFORTABLY all night long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may seem to be a cheaper alternative to a full alternating pressure mattress, but you&#x27;ll likely end up buying one of those after finding out</li>
            <li>It has a STRONG vinyl smell when first taken out of the box, but it was gone in less than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Being only about 30\\&quot; wide or so, you need to make sure you are on the right area.</li>
            <li>My mother in law is more than 200lbs but less than 250lb.</li>
            <li>Decent surface area.</li>
            <li>This item has also made my life so much easier, because I no longer have to make sure Mom is turned every couple of hours to relieve pressure points, and that&#x27;s something I was having to do round the clock,</li>
            <li>The material is heavy-gauge and has stood up wonderfully to all the pulling and tugging that&#x27;s necessary to readjust bedding when caring for a person who has to be rolled, pulled and twisted around in order to care for them without removing them from the bed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this vender.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It provides alternating pressure to the body with minimal sound.</li>
            <li>The pump is failing, so I decided to get a new one, and found that NOW they are advertising a pump which has been IMPROVED and puts out 8LPM</li>
            <li>The pump is failing, so I decided to get a new one, and found that NOW they are advertising a pump which has been IMPROVED and puts out 8LPM</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without one at my age.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this exact item that the local DME company provided ...</li>
            <li>I pushed it a bit further onto the bed (initially it was right at the edge, so the air hoses could be hanging straight</li>
            <li>Been over a year now and still works fine although it&#x27;s got a little noisier.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product nearly a year ago to use for my 89-year old mother, who has been bedfast for nearly 2 years with late-stage Alzheimers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you could put this on an old, saggy mattress and it would be a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Very helpful, he got rid of his wounds on his back.</li>
            <li>so far this item works as promised....</li>
            <li>It did wonders during that time to prevent pressure sores on my 92 year old mothers bottom.</li>
            <li>so I knew the end was near.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain because I left it on 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Delivery was FAST and the price was quite reasonable considering other products on the market.  </li>
            <li>More than 6 - months of work without failure or problems.</li>
            <li>I went for a more expensive and higher quality product.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The hose sometimes slips out, and I ended up putting some epoxy on the projections to be certain the hose didn&#x27;t come loose.  </li>
            <li>then got a new foam mattress and didn&#x27;t need it until my later years when I started having problems with bed sores</li>
            <li>Very quiet too and fits the whole mattress well on a standard hospital bed.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the NEW model, as advertised here, BUT I received the OLD model, with the same model number on the pump, and the product package inserts telling me in six different languages that the pump has an output of 4LPM.</li>

            <li>due to his condition he did not get out of bed much and soon developed sores on various parts of his body regardless of how often we turned him.  </li>
            <li>There are other more expensive models but the one bought combined quality, need satisfaction and economical price.  </li>
            <li>pump is very quiet as advertised, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone due to the fact that there just isn&#x27;t much cushioning going on.</li>

            <li> Definitely a good buy as one time cost less than three months&#x27; rental from a medical supply place.  </li>
            <li> And I sleep SO COMFORTABLY all night long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may seem to be a cheaper alternative to a full alternating pressure mattress, but you&#x27;ll likely end up buying one of those after finding out</li>
            <li> It has a STRONG vinyl smell when first taken out of the box, but it was gone in less than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> Being only about 30\\&quot; wide or so, you need to make sure you are on the right area.</li>
            <li> My mother in law is more than 200lbs but less than 250lb.</li>
            <li> Decent surface area.</li>
            <li> This item has also made my life so much easier, because I no longer have to make sure Mom is turned every couple of hours to relieve pressure points, and that&#x27;s something I was having to do round the clock,</li>
            <li> The material is heavy-gauge and has stood up wonderfully to all the pulling and tugging that&#x27;s necessary to readjust bedding when caring for a person who has to be rolled, pulled and twisted around in order to care for them without removing them from the bed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this vender.</li>

            <li> It provides alternating pressure to the body with minimal sound.</li>
            <li> The pump is failing, so I decided to get a new one, and found that NOW they are advertising a pump which has been IMPROVED and puts out 8LPM</li>
            <li> The pump is failing, so I decided to get a new one, and found that NOW they are advertising a pump which has been IMPROVED and puts out 8LPM</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t live without one at my age.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this exact item that the local DME company provided ...</li>
            <li> I pushed it a bit further onto the bed (initially it was right at the edge, so the air hoses could be hanging straight</li>
            <li> Been over a year now and still works fine although it&#x27;s got a little noisier.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product nearly a year ago to use for my 89-year old mother, who has been bedfast for nearly 2 years with late-stage Alzheimers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you could put this on an old, saggy mattress and it would be a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Very helpful, he got rid of his wounds on his back.</li>
            <li> so far this item works as promised....</li>
            <li> It did wonders during that time to prevent pressure sores on my 92 year old mothers bottom.</li>
            <li> so I knew the end was near.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain because I left it on 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> Delivery was FAST and the price was quite reasonable considering other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> More than 6 - months of work without failure or problems.</li>
            <li> I went for a more expensive and higher quality product.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The hose sometimes slips out, and I ended up putting some epoxy on the projections to be certain the hose didn&#x27;t come loose.  </li>
            <li> then got a new foam mattress and didn&#x27;t need it until my later years when I started having problems with bed sores</li>
            <li> Very quiet too and fits the whole mattress well on a standard hospital bed.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the NEW model, as advertised here, BUT I received the OLD model, with the same model number on the pump, and the product package inserts telling me in six different languages that the pump has an output of 4LPM.</li>

            <li> due to his condition he did not get out of bed much and soon developed sores on various parts of his body regardless of how often we turned him.  </li>
            <li> There are other more expensive models but the one bought combined quality, need satisfaction and economical price.  </li>
            <li> pump is very quiet as advertised, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone due to the fact that there just isn&#x27;t much cushioning going on.</li>

            <li> please disregard the previous.</li>
            <li> No return or warranty!!The person this was used for is less than 160lbs</li>
            <li> It seemed no matter how hard I tried to keep turning her and adjusting things to avoid bedsores, she still developed a few in areas where her already delicate and fragile skin is particularly thin.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint that I have is that when opened the package and began to inflate the pad, it had a hole in it!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few that goes up to 300lb limit.</li>
            <li> Again, I use it under a 2\\&quot; foam pad (regular foam) because the lumps were uncomfortable for me when I placed it just under the sheet.</li>
            <li> Theirs will be really, really thick</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very hard to please.  </li>

            <li> As he was laying on the hard bump right between his cheeks. It&#x27;s supposed to alternate, but it got incredibly hard (every other bump) and unfortunately created sores instead of making them better. Gel overlay I bought through medical company worked way better.</li>
            <li> a quality product...one of the best alternating pressure systems I have had in the 20 years of using this type of system.</li>
            <li> Even at the softest setting, this overlay is very hard! Instead of preventing bedsores, it creates them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may seem to be a cheaper alternative to a full alternating pressure mattress, but you&#x27;ll likely end up buying one of those after finding out this isn&#x27;t what you had hoped it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is very quiet as advertised, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone due to the fact that there just isn&#x27;t much cushioning going on.</li>
            <li> My mom is bedridden with Parkinson&#x27;s and we bought this pad to make her hospital bed mattress more comfortable.  She really likes it and she&#x27;s very hard to please.  It&#x27;s VERY quiet and set up is easy.  Delivery was FAST and the price was quite reasonable considering other products on the market.  She still has to be turned regularly to prevent bedsores, but this pad helps keep her comfortable until she gets turned.  It has a STRONG vinyl smell when first taken out of the box, but it was gone in less than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> This product is what we had anticipated to receive, everything matched what we ordered. I buy a lot of products from Amazon and I never had any problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time in bed because I&#x27;m wiped out from chemotherapy.  I&#x27;ve never been able to stay in bed more than a few hours without my back, knees, hips, etc. hurting (I have previous injuries to all these areas).  Even adjustable air mattresses and special foam coverings have never made much of a difference for me.  I&#x27;ve had this alternating pressure pad for about a week now, and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not having the pains I always suffer from.  In fact, over the last two days, I&#x27;ve slept for more than 10 hours at a time (except for bathroom breaks).  I don&#x27;t think you could put this on an old, saggy mattress and it would be a miracle worker.  It&#x27;s fairly thin, so if you have a decent mattress to put it on top of, I think it would work well.  It costs less than most air mattress you&#x27;d buy at a department store, so it&#x27;s worth a try.  YOU CAN&#x27;T RETURN THIS so don&#x27;t buy it just to try it out.  I knew I&#x27;d like it because I had a low air-loss mattress in the hospital and an alternating pressure pad after one of my surgeries.  If you want to try one out, go to a medical supply store and ask to lay on one of theirs.  Theirs will be really, really thick and they can&#x27;t rent you one without a hospital bed (and a prescription), the reason being that if the mattress were to suddenly lose air, you&#x27;d need the rails on the side of the bed to pull yourself up so you wouldn&#x27;t smother in the plastic mattress.  This thinner version of the type you&#x27;d get at a medical supply store works for me and I think it would be great for anyone who wakes up with aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my Dad who is 94 and spends most of his time in bed. I was worried about pressure points and even worse bedsore.  Medicare does not cover cost, I felt price was affordable.  Very easy to set up. It is not quiet, makes humming, viberating from box on foot of bed.  I put a towel under box and helped.  I am happy, happy, happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have lower back issues (the pelvic area is sort of corkscrewed...one hip bone tilts forward, the other backwards...been like that all my life). I sleep on my side, but even with foam cushioning have to flip over several times a night due to increasing pain on one or the other hip from the pressure. So I was thinking about getting an air bed, then I saw this. Decided to try it. It has been just over a week now, and I LIKE IT! First, I found I had to put it UNDER the 2\\&quot; foam, not just under the sheet, to be really comfortable. It apparently will inflate/deflate slightly every 5 minutes, so it is not noticeable. The motor is very quiet, but as a side sleeper, I do hear the vibration, even thru my thick feather pillow. I find that I am sleeping much better, not getting the pains in my sides, not having to flip over every hour. And my lower back feels just fine. I have a king sized bed, and turn this on when I go to bed, turn it off when I get up. Being only about 30\\&quot; wide or so, you need to make sure you are on the right area. But it works for me, so I guess the message is that it can be used for reasons other than someone who is bedridden. I would give it a 5 if I could figure out how to stop the vibrating (created by the air coming in and going out of the pad.)&lt;br /&gt;DEC 30,2013 -After using this for a year and a half, I have to say it has been WONDERFUL. I pushed it a bit further onto the bed (initially it was right at the edge, so the air hoses could be hanging straight down)and no longer hear the air swooshing in or out. And I sleep SO COMFORTABLY all night long. No longer awake with burning pain on my hip (I always sleep on my side, flipping over during the nite). The only thing that could be better would be to make a WIDER version - while this is wide enough, it would be nice if it allowed me to move around on the bed a bit more! Again, I use it under a 2\\&quot; foam pad (regular foam) because the lumps were uncomfortable for me when I placed it just under the sheet. I do love this thing, and it has help up well! Certainly getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan 31 2014 update: BEWARE OF SCAM SUBSTITUTION!!&lt;br /&gt;The pump I received 2 years ago (reported on above) is model 14005E, and the pump and pad set is 14001E. The pump is a 4LPM pump, as described in the literature which comes with the product. The pump is failing, so I decided to get a new one, and found that NOW they are advertising a pump which has been IMPROVED and puts out 8LPM (8 liters per minute) of air pressure, which means it will inflate and deflate more easily and with less strain on the pump. The OLD model which I previously ordered is now under $50 for the set. So I ordered the NEW model, as advertised here, BUT I received the OLD model, with the same model number on the pump, and the product package inserts telling me in six different languages that the pump has an output of 4LPM. So since they are not posting the MODEL number, THIS PRODUCT IS NOW A SCAM!! I have returned that product and Amazon took it back, since it is not what was advertised. I have requested from a couple of the suppliers that they send me information regarding the model number of this new-and-improved model of pump, and NO ONE WILL RESPOND TO MY EMAIL, making me think that they are all just trying to pull a fast one on us consumers, by not having a model number in the ad they just sell a product that LOOKS just like the photo in the ad, and DOES NOT MATCH THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!! Do not get scammed...just order the cheaper one. For less than $25 per year, you will have a great product.I do love this thing, and it has help up well!

            <li> The deluxe with adjustable pressure is just like the one we were renting from a medical supply for $30 a month for my father after he got out of the hospital.  Some company, model, etc.</li>
            <li> The quality of this pad is much better than the one provided through a rental company.  When my mother was taken off hospice I had to replace the pad they provided.  This one is tougher feeling and is longer so it covers the whole bed from end to end.  Definitely a good buy as one time cost less than three months&#x27; rental from a medical supply place.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ordered on one day and 3 days later it was delivered in perfect condition and the price could not be beat. Removed from packaging and product tested perfect.  The firmness dial is a plus at this price point.  Highly recommend this vender.</li>
            <li> Purchased for wife to alleviate back pain.  Pump very quiet.  Pressure is adjustable.  Has been a huge help in her sleeping thru the night.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few that goes up to 300lb limit. My mother in law is more than 200lbs but less than 250lb. We got this to put on a bed at our house and I got the higher limit thinking it would be more comfortable. She said it was more comfortable than the one she had at home. Very quiet too and fits the whole mattress well on a standard hospital bed.</li>
            <li> My wife is in bed 18 hours a day, and this helps to prevent bed sores.  Easy to hook up --- if I were designing this unit I&#x27;d make the air hose projections a bit longer so they could be secured with a clip.  The hose sometimes slips out, and I ended up putting some epoxy on the projections to be certain the hose didn&#x27;t come loose.  However this is a minor issue easily dealt with - still rate it 5 stars.  This is a very economical pad and pump compared with what a medical supply house would charge for a comparable unit.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My father came from the hospital and was bed bound.  He was discharged to home with a hospital bed.  due to his condition he did not get out of bed much and soon developed sores on various parts of his body regardless of how often we turned him.  Insurance provided a rental but there was a montly copay.  2 months of co pay was more then the cost of buying the item here online in full.  So I purchased this exact item that the local DME company provided ... he has used this item non stop since it arrived and he loves it so much that he took this item into his own bed that he shares with his wife.  He is more ambulatory and does not need the hospital bed but so loves this mattress he continues to use it.</li>
            <li> This product had a misleading listing. It was not the brand I thought I was getting. It works fine, but does not have an adjustment knob we wanted. It vibrates against the bed so I&#x27;ve put a cloth behind it. Good for the price, but again, it&#x27;s not what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Like sleeping on plastic. Returned it after only one sleepless night. Do not waste your money. Stick with foam.</li>
            <li> Es justo lo que andabamos buscando, nos ha dado muy buen servicio lo tenemos prendido día y noche y ni se siente</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and operate. low noise. Decent surface area. There is no guidance in the manual on what criteria to use to set the firmness of the pad. Also there are multiple models of this product, and you have to read the descriptions carefully to understand the difference between the different models.</li>
            <li> This item was received very well packaged and very quickly.   If necessary, I would use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have a disintegrating spine which makes about all positions painful.  Putting this on my hospital bed has helped relieve pain enough that I have been able to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pad lasted only 2 years, but I just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my handicapped brother who is for the most part bedridden. It is a super product and everything I hoped for! It provides alternating pressure to the body with minimal sound. It is easy to inflate, deflate, adjust and maneuver. He is very pleased with it also. It not only provides alternating support to the body but is very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone who has to spend any extended time in bed to help prevent skin breakdown and promote circulation. Arrived promptly in pristine condition and exceeded my expectations! Wonderful product and wonderful service from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This pressure pump and pad are simply EXCELLENT! No need for a pricey system that does nothing better than this model. My 94 year old mother has no complaints at all which is as good a compliment as one could expect to get. It either works or doesn&#x27;t and this product performs as designed. I give five stars because of great price and great function.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well.  Hoping to prevent pressure sores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product nearly a year ago to use for my 89-year old mother, who has been bedfast for nearly 2 years with late-stage Alzheimers. As part of that disease, she has gradually lost the ability to move on her own, and hasn&#x27;t been able to shift or turn over in her bed for most of that time.  I care for her in my home.  It seemed no matter how hard I tried to keep turning her and adjusting things to avoid bedsores, she still developed a few in areas where her already delicate and fragile skin is particularly thin.  I ordered this pressure mattress out of desperation, in order to try and keep from having to put her in the hospital for her remaining days, because none of my family wants her to die alone and among people who never knew her when she was her real self.  Let me tell you, it&#x27;s the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made for her care!  After receiving it, it was only a few weeks before the most stubborn of her sores (which I had been battling for months just to keep from getting worse) was completely healed, and we have had no problem at all with them since. This item has also made my life so much easier, because I no longer have to make sure Mom is turned every couple of hours to relieve pressure points, and that&#x27;s something I was having to do round the clock, 24/7. It was EXHAUSTING! Now, I can&#x27;t say how well this pad would work for a much heavier person, but Mom weighs about 130 pounds and it&#x27;s perfect for her.  It&#x27;s very quiet and the pressure is fully adjustable.  The material is heavy-gauge and has stood up wonderfully to all the pulling and tugging that&#x27;s necessary to readjust bedding when caring for a person who has to be rolled, pulled and twisted around in order to care for them without removing them from the bed. All in all, I would give this item 10 stars if they were available. It has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> More than 6 - months of work without failure or problems. My father is 82 years. He lies in bed for 2 years. Very helpful, he got rid of his wounds on his back. Of course we also need a massage and ointments used without (Alternating Pressure Pump And Pad System Deluxe Pad) did nothing to help but so far so good. Thank you for such a product.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Mother in laws bedsores are healed. I would recomend this to any one that is bedridden and needs relief.</li>
            <li> This was a big help after my mother was bed ridden. She had bedsores that have healed since we got it,</li>
            <li> Very good sometimes it&#x27;s gets a little warm and they feel a little itchy but there is no scars</li>
            <li> Works well and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a backup for a previous purchase.  Mattress inflates, pressure does not alternate.  Non- returnable, guess I&#x27;m screwed out of $98 (including shipping).  Had no problem with the previous purchase.</li>
            <li> regarding my previous review-- my bad! i did not realize the unit was nonreturnable-- just reread the list. please disregard the previous.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Extremely quiet operation.  Performs as promised.</li>
            <li> Brought mattress and air pad though DRIVE and Mecelicine never showed up!!! I will never order another Drive product. My mom is bedbound and she almost got up and walk waiting for their product!! It never showed!!</li>
            <li> so far this item works as promised....durability has yet to be seen ....however, after one month it has been working fine...</li>
            <li> Works well. I&#x27;ve purchased several. Pump lasts 6 mos. to a year @ 24/7 operation. Would like a more durable pump.</li>
            <li> After 6 short moths already not working! No return or warranty!!The person this was used for is less than 160lbs and it already failed to work.</li>
            <li> Inflation pressure is adjustable. Pump is quiet. I have only been using it for a week and it works great. I will up date this review in a month or so.      I am adding to this review one year later. The pump worked very well during the past year but the pressure mattress finally developed a leak so rather than try to repair it, (a small hole patching repair kit is included) I went for a more expensive and higher quality product.  So one year of continuous service without problems. It did wonders during that time to prevent pressure sores on my 92 year old mothers bottom.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my mother who has Alzheimer&#x27;s to PREVENT pressure sores from beginning.  It works as described.  Only complaint that I have is that when opened the package and began to inflate the pad, it had a hole in it!  Luckily, there was a patch kit and we patched it up. We have had it a couple months now and the patch has held up great and it works really well. If it weren&#x27;t for the hole, it would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
            <li> makes sleeping much more easier then sleeping on a mattress air circulation is great workes like a charm</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected.  Holds air and alternates filling 1/2 cells at a time</li>
            <li> Too hard, uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Whew!  Finally solved a problem I had.  Been over a year now and still works fine although it&#x27;s got a little noisier.  EDITED 3/31/2015:  I purchased this back in September, 2013 and it has finally quit working.  A few months ago the &#x27;humming&#x27; was a little noisier, not bad but noticeable so I knew the end was near.  Motor vibrating and a low hum but no air coming out.  I really can&#x27;t complain because I left it on 24 hrs. a day whether I was in bed or not so I think I got my money&#x27;s worth out of it.  I came on here to order another one and found one for $50 (Prime shipping) from another vendor here on Amazon  I think they are all manufactured by the same company but I will see. FYI I&#x27;ve been a paraplegic for 45 years and had one of these when first injured and I used it for a couple of years then got a new foam mattress and didn&#x27;t need it until my later years when I started having problems with bed sores but this thing solved the problem.  Note:  I do put one 2&amp;#34; memory foam pad (full length but but about 4&#x27; wider) under it and another 2&amp;#34; on top of it to make it even more comfortable and that helps to protect the air pad too.  Great sleeping now and I couldn&#x27;t live without one at my age.</li>
            <li> The alternating pressure pump bought accomplished what it was desined for at a very reasonable price.  There are other more expensive models but the one bought combined quality, need satisfaction and economical price.  Delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> this is not and alternating pad and the pump is not adjustable&lt;br /&gt;not the product that is described or pictured</li>
            <li> thanks, i liked ,super deal.</li>
