            <li>Only &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; because its not the first thing I smell in the morning to wake up:)</li>

            <li>I really like this product, would recommend to anyone.</li>

            <li>Barely and lavender scent, mostly a weird chemical smell, which isn&#x27;t good for an \\&quot;aromatherapy\\&quot; product.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a little greasy but it does moisturize pretty well.  </li>

            <li> lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have looked a long time for lotion that moisturizes my legs without making them burn after shaving.</li>
            <li> your skin can be very dry.</li>
            <li> For those of you who has very dry skin</li>
            <li> I made a mistake with this scent it has something in it that gives me a headache, not quite the lavender scent I expected.</li>
            <li> This body butter is quite thick, so i actually cut it with another type of lotion, which makes it last longer, and cuts down on the amount I go through.  </li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased this product at my local Wal-Mart.</li>

            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Scentless and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they apparently don&#x27;t carry it there any longer</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and I like that a lot.</li>
            <li> so i was somewhat forced to buy online.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> may be poor trying to buy this product to keep West Texan Girl, Billie</li>
            <li> I tried really expensive, non-scented lotions and everything else.</li>
            <li> It also smells AWFUL.</li>

            <li> I was really excited when I got this product. Unfortunately it sucks. It&#x27;s greasy when you put it on, but somehow doesn&#x27;t even moisturize very well. It also smells AWFUL. Barely and lavender scent, mostly a weird chemical smell, which isn&#x27;t good for an \\&quot;aromatherapy\\&quot; product.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent at all. It&#x27;s not lavender chamomile to me. I haven&#x27;t used it more than once since I bought it months ago. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this Body Butter for my roommate, because she loves lavender. She even looks for fabric softener with Lavender in it.  So I knew she would just love this product, and she did.  She uses it every night.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and makes your skin very soft. I really like this product, would recommend to anyone who needs to relax and who doesn&#x27;t today.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is very thick and creamy.  It is a great moisturizer and leaves your skin feeling really soft.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but is a wonderful moisturizer.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i like the smell, although i wouldn&#x27;t say it was lavender, really.  it&#x27;s a little greasy but it does moisturize pretty well.  lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> In the past I have purchased this product at my local Wal-Mart. They have quit handling the product so I tried online and found it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in place of after shave lotion and it works fantastically for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream..scent a bit stronger than I&#x27;d like...but dissipates....</li>
            <li> Also bought this for my sister, Goes with the body spray.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very Calming.  Teachers need this.</li>
            <li> Got this at another store on clearance and fell in love. The scent is amazing if you love lavender. It&#x27;s thick and creamy at the same time. It works very well.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product. Living here in West Texas your skin can be very dry. Oh this feels so good to your dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be poor trying to buy this product to keep West Texan Girl, Billie</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good to me, I&#x27;ve smelled the BBW Lavender Chamomile Aromatherapy and it smells real similar. It does go on a little greasy but it soaks into the skin. It&#x27;s thick and I like that a lot. This is my second jar so that&#x27;s saying something lol</li>
            <li> Smells go good. I get compliments off the smell all the time.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake with this scent it has something in it that gives me a headache, not quite the lavender scent I expected.</li>
            <li> I first used this after purchasing at a local wal mart.  Unfortunately they apparently don&#x27;t carry it there any longer so i was somewhat forced to buy online.  I ordered two, and both came packed in separate bags very securely.  Both containers were nice and full and smelled wonderfully.  This body butter is quite thick, so i actually cut it with another type of lotion, which makes it last longer, and cuts down on the amount I go through.  Very lovely smell that is not terribly overpowering, and works wonderfully on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> For those of you who has very dry skin this product is great. After using this body butter the first time I fell in love with it. My skin is very soft and no longer dry. You must try this. Love Love Love</li>
            <li> Scentless and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because a friend of mine had some.  I am so glad I decided to purchase, the aroma is so nice and pleasant.  I use it on my feet and hands every night before bed.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a real good product.  It makes our skin so smooth and soaks in.  My hands, arms and legs get so dry in the winter and this is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell it is not over powering. And the other plus it is non-greasy</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer with a heavenly scent! Love it *almost* as much as the body wash in the same scent:) Only &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; because its not the first thing I smell in the morning to wake up:)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that I recomend to all. It smells so good and goes on smooth. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase, this should say it all. I use it daily, mostly on my hands only and it is a must before bed.</li>
            <li> I have looked a long time for lotion that moisturizes my legs without making them burn after shaving. I tried really expensive, non-scented lotions and everything else. Then, I came across this. My skin is very sensitive and this is the only lotion that leaves my legs feeling super silky and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
