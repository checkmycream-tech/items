            <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon because this is one of my all time favorite mascaras!</li>
            <li>but the product wasnt so good</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t flake and was good against water without being a waterproof variety.</li>
            <li>This product is good without the accompaniment of eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>Love my mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about a month and it has been my favorite!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>LOVE the volume I get with this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing at unclumping your lashes.</li>
            <li>So I got a great product for cheap and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting Loreal telescopic extension waterproof, and I liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clumpy and just not my kind of mascara.</li>
            <li>If you want a nice colonizing mascara, try loreal voluminous.</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled when I saw it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I own everything from eyebrow pencils, foundation , blush, eye shadow brushes,  </li>
            <li>I GOT THIS MASCARA REALLY FAST, I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>it looks great and goes on smoothly..and the price is not bad</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a great mascara.</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful, i love it so much.</li>
            <li>I have long-fine lashes and they tangle very easy.</li>
            <li>Best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>My wife really loved this product when they were available on shelves.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite the brush doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my lashes look sooooo perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>This mascara is perfect for those women like me who struggle with barely any lashes.</li>
            <li>Glides on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>However, this product was so cost efficient and I liked the reviews that said it could easily be removed.</li>
            <li>The mascara applies well, the color is nice, but it has a tendency to clump, it runs easily when you sweat or cry.</li>
            <li>Love this product when it is the waterproof brand.</li>
            <li>I BETTER</li>
            <li>It was okay..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, but I love the formula of this one.</li>
            <li>It really defines your lashes,lengthens gives great volume.</li>
            <li>she says it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>so ok then</li>
            <li>A+ love it</li>
            <li>my be my favorite mascara now.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the color it comes in.</li>
            <li>of bought more</li>
            <li>but this is like most others I have tried...</li>
            <li>but I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>I love this Mascara..</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I want to preface this review by stating that Maybelline is my favorite drug store makeup brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was better than expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Love how my lashes look with this Mascara</li>
            <li>Love it and here on time</li>
            <li>Love the way this product turned out.</li>
            <li>The high points of this product, in my opinion, are: it does not clump, it does not flake, it does not smudge, and it provides great length and separation.</li>
            <li>It lengthens and defines the eyelashes with pretty good volume..</li>
            <li>This mascara does lift and thicken the lashes, but they droop very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily,</li>
            <li>Not clumpy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>But it clumped too easily</li>
            <li>I liked very much this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>and it shipped fairly quick!</li>
            <li>and I own a large variety of their products.</li>
            <li>Clump free.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t clump or have a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>Now I know why the price was so cheap .</li>
            <li>Mascara came much faster than what I expected, great product I loved it.</li>
            <li>Do not care for....clumps and globs terribly....was hoping for a smooth cover</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s made cheap.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to ash off.  </li>
            <li>So so worth it!</li>
            <li>How many mascaras say washable and stay stuck on your lashes until you wash too much sometimes causing you to lose lashes!</li>
            <li>It feels very natural and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Good seller, so I would order again when necessary.</li>
            <li>Good for an every day basic mascara.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok wouldn&#x27;t really but this buy again ...</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to getting this mascara b/c it has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>This mascara separates, makes them look full, it does not flake/</li>
            <li>not a bad mascara.  </li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>It could have been a good one, however, i received a very dry one.</li>
            <li>It came fast in the mail and aslo free shipping..</li>
            <li>Really defines and lengthens lashes, and looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>So I received it in a few days which was great.</li>
            <li>For the price it is worth the try, I know I will be buying this instead of wasting $30 on a mascara.</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite mascara by far.</li>
            <li>The only nice thing about my orders was the shipping speed which was very fast.</li>
            <li>I suppose they&#x27;re applying it right because they never have that Gothic eye look when they put this on.</li>
            <li>I do experience some slight flaking with this product, which is why I like Great Last mascara more.</li>
            <li>Obviously, everyone has preferences and I realize some people will want something more bold but for a well put together, daytime mascara, you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a lot of high end mascaras and low end ones,of course many high end mascaras are as good and better than this one but for someone with a tight budget</li>
            <li>First of all it arived on time</li>
            <li>Standing alone, your eyelashes will look long and lovely.</li>
            <li>So I follow up with Soft and Full mascara</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly will by another one when this finishes.</li>
            <li>I am really bummed.</li>
            <li>and they really arent so</li>
            <li>i put this on, i got so much length and definition.</li>
            <li>Really longer than nature lashes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was within a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>It works really well when you combine the two mascaras...</li>
            <li>This mascara may work well for others, but it did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It does thicken lashes and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The wand actually feels quite cheap.  </li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t really clump or flake at all.  </li>
            <li>I normally like the bristles on the brush to be longer because usually that gives you good volume and length.  </li>
            <li>And now I have a new fav mascara ;)</li>
            <li>Super black and make them look HUGE.</li>
            <li>This is ok, but it dried out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this wasn&#x27;t too good to be true, unfortunately it was.</li>
            <li>Seems okay, but I seem to end up with dark shadows</li>
            <li>it goes on really dark which I love.  </li>
            <li>I really like my new mascara.</li>
            <li>The first one broke after the first week, with daily use.  </li>
            <li>But if  you are particularly looking for more volume and thick lashes ,this may not be the right product for you..</li>
            <li>I used this mascara for all of high school.</li>
            <li>It take a bits longer to dry than most the mascaras I&#x27;ve had, but due to how fantastically it defines your eyes, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>(I used \\&quot;very black\\&quot;) looks natural,</li>
            <li>My wife really didn&#x27;t like it, she said it was too clumpy and felt like it was some kinda old stock and didn&#x27;t work quite well.</li>
            <li>I love this one for everyday use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the natural makeup-I was born with long, fabulous lashes-look, then this is your product.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s ok, not great but not bad either...</li>
            <li>I recommend this as the best little secret</li>
            <li>THEN THE NEW ONES.</li>
            <li>I continue to repurchase the Maybelline New York</li>
            <li>It makes them look very long, and it dries quickly, but doesn&#x27;t flake after it dries.</li>
            <li>I think this was ok, I still have a problem with flaking and because of that at the end of my work day I usually have the darker circles under my eyes</li>
            <li>It worked like a charm... but only the first time :|</li>
            <li>works great lashes are long and thick !</li>
            <li>but so far no luck</li>
            <li>It worked but it really didn&#x27;t define unless I put on multiple layers.</li>
            <li>I really wish Maybelline would bring this one back out in all stores!</li>
            <li>and it was almost a year old.</li>
            <li>/flakes underneath my eye by early afternoon.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a lengthening mascara in my opinion, though it does provide decent volume.</li>
            <li>now I use it as a brush for separating my lashes since It dried out so quick..</li>
            <li>I always get it in very black and true to its name</li>
            <li>This must be very old because I&#x27;ve only ever had a mascara smelling like this</li>
            <li>although I think sometimes it seems just a tad more dried out than expected; then again it is terribly cold right now so that could also be a factor :).</li>
            <li>Apparently it&#x27;s been discontinued?</li>
            <li>I use it more for daytime because it is not so dramatic whereas the clump crusher creates a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>However the first time I used it it seemed like it was/is dried out.</li>

            <li> and it shipped fairly quick!</li>
            <li> and I own a large variety of their products.</li>
            <li> Clump free.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t clump or have a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> Now I know why the price was so cheap .</li>
            <li> Mascara came much faster than what I expected, great product I loved it.</li>
            <li> Do not care for....clumps and globs terribly....was hoping for a smooth cover</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s made cheap.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy to ash off.  </li>
            <li> So so worth it!</li>
            <li> How many mascaras say washable and stay stuck on your lashes until you wash too much sometimes causing you to lose lashes!</li>
            <li> It feels very natural and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Good seller, so I would order again when necessary.</li>
            <li> Good for an every day basic mascara.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok wouldn&#x27;t really but this buy again ...</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting this mascara b/c it has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> This mascara separates, makes them look full, it does not flake/</li>
            <li> not a bad mascara.  </li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> It could have been a good one, however, i received a very dry one.</li>
            <li> It came fast in the mail and aslo free shipping..</li>
            <li> Really defines and lengthens lashes, and looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> So I received it in a few days which was great.</li>
            <li> For the price it is worth the try, I know I will be buying this instead of wasting $30 on a mascara.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite mascara by far.</li>
            <li> The only nice thing about my orders was the shipping speed which was very fast.</li>
            <li> I suppose they&#x27;re applying it right because they never have that Gothic eye look when they put this on.</li>
            <li> I do experience some slight flaking with this product, which is why I like Great Last mascara more.</li>
            <li> Obviously, everyone has preferences and I realize some people will want something more bold but for a well put together, daytime mascara, you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of high end mascaras and low end ones,of course many high end mascaras are as good and better than this one but for someone with a tight budget</li>
            <li> First of all it arived on time</li>
            <li> Standing alone, your eyelashes will look long and lovely.</li>
            <li> So I follow up with Soft and Full mascara</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly will by another one when this finishes.</li>
            <li> I am really bummed.</li>
            <li> and they really arent so</li>
            <li> i put this on, i got so much length and definition.</li>
            <li> Really longer than nature lashes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was within a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> It works really well when you combine the two mascaras...</li>
            <li> This mascara may work well for others, but it did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It does thicken lashes and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> The wand actually feels quite cheap.  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t really clump or flake at all.  </li>
            <li> I normally like the bristles on the brush to be longer because usually that gives you good volume and length.  </li>
            <li> And now I have a new fav mascara ;)</li>
            <li> Super black and make them look HUGE.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but it dried out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this wasn&#x27;t too good to be true, unfortunately it was.</li>
            <li> Seems okay, but I seem to end up with dark shadows</li>
            <li> it goes on really dark which I love.  </li>
            <li> I really like my new mascara.</li>
            <li> The first one broke after the first week, with daily use.  </li>
            <li> But if  you are particularly looking for more volume and thick lashes ,this may not be the right product for you..</li>
            <li> I used this mascara for all of high school.</li>
            <li> It take a bits longer to dry than most the mascaras I&#x27;ve had, but due to how fantastically it defines your eyes, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> (I used \\&quot;very black\\&quot;) looks natural,</li>
            <li> My wife really didn&#x27;t like it, she said it was too clumpy and felt like it was some kinda old stock and didn&#x27;t work quite well.</li>
            <li> I love this one for everyday use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the natural makeup-I was born with long, fabulous lashes-look, then this is your product.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s ok, not great but not bad either...</li>
            <li> I recommend this as the best little secret</li>
            <li> THEN THE NEW ONES.</li>
            <li> I continue to repurchase the Maybelline New York</li>
            <li> It makes them look very long, and it dries quickly, but doesn&#x27;t flake after it dries.</li>
            <li> I think this was ok, I still have a problem with flaking and because of that at the end of my work day I usually have the darker circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm... but only the first time :|</li>
            <li> works great lashes are long and thick !</li>
            <li> but so far no luck</li>
            <li> It worked but it really didn&#x27;t define unless I put on multiple layers.</li>
            <li> I really wish Maybelline would bring this one back out in all stores!</li>
            <li> and it was almost a year old.</li>
            <li> /flakes underneath my eye by early afternoon.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a lengthening mascara in my opinion, though it does provide decent volume.</li>
            <li> now I use it as a brush for separating my lashes since It dried out so quick..</li>
            <li> I always get it in very black and true to its name</li>
            <li> This must be very old because I&#x27;ve only ever had a mascara smelling like this</li>
            <li> although I think sometimes it seems just a tad more dried out than expected; then again it is terribly cold right now so that could also be a factor :).</li>
            <li> Apparently it&#x27;s been discontinued?</li>
            <li> I use it more for daytime because it is not so dramatic whereas the clump crusher creates a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> However the first time I used it it seemed like it was/is dried out.</li>
            <li> It does go on a bit thick but with the right technique</li>
            <li> I usually like maybelline really just for their mascaras but had yet to ever try this one.  </li>
            <li> It dried out so fast even though I always carefully closed its lid.</li>
            <li> a little bit so if I&#x27;m going for more of a dramatic look I&#x27;ll layer it under my maybelline mega plush mascara.</li>
            <li> Gave u 3 stars just because it didn&#x27;t feel wet enough do I gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> I live this mascara in dark black.</li>
            <li> it makes my lashes very long and curly.</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes long without clumping due to the plastic piece that keeps the mascara from coming all out like some mascaras are.</li>
            <li> Shoot read carefully.</li>
            <li> I  ordered regular in  Very black</li>
            <li> it gets all the lashes, covers well, adds volume and doesn&#x27;t flake after a long day of ruling the world !!!!</li>
            <li> I have few lashes, but still makes them look long and bushy and no lumps !!</li>
            <li> it dried out faster then expected I keep having to scrape the sides of the container trying to get a little mascara in it</li>
            <li> Does the job but does get a little clumpy at times and also, it&#x27;s not that waterproof like it says it is</li>
            <li> My tube dried out, so I threw it out and went to repurchase.</li>
            <li> When I received this item it was all dried up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for the heavy makeup-</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t catch me dead with this stuff on.</li>
            <li> and I threw it away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a huge problem..</li>
            <li> Makes my eye lashes long n thick!</li>
            <li> If you want dramatic volume, you&#x27;ll either have to build it up a bit or opt for a different mascara.</li>
            <li> I purchased Maybeline define a lash mascara in very black and was crossing my fingers.  </li>
            <li> guess you get what you pay for :/</li>
            <li> I do like it for my bottom lashes because of the small brush.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> I usually use maybelline mascaras</li>
            <li> I did notice that the formula is a little on the thin side.  </li>
            <li> it makes the application clumsy.  </li>
            <li> It sucks that I cant buy it in the store anymore</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes long and thick!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara was very black and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Standing with eyeliner, your eyelashes will look like poorly placed fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I guess they discontinued this</li>
            <li> think it makes my eye lashes look very thin</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money or time....does not define any lashes, just looks nasty.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Maybelline, have used their mascara for years!</li>
            <li> I was very sad when I couldn&#x27;t find this mascara anymore in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is no longer made.</li>
            <li> , it is by no means a bad mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Also, mine smells terrible and the packaging of the mascara was awful.</li>

            <li> Me encanto!!! Tengo pocas pestañas, pero aún así hace que se vean largas y tupidas pero sin grumos!! para mí 5 estrellas!! // I loved !!! I have few lashes, but still makes them look long and bushy and no lumps !! 5 stars for me !!</li>
            <li> Does the job but does get a little clumpy at times and also, it&#x27;s not that waterproof like it says it is</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  My lashes looked the same after using as they did after using.  Gave away.  I ended up getting Loreal telescopic extension waterproof, and I liked it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the product. it didn&#x27;t clump or have a cheap brush. for the price is another bonus! and it shipped fairly quick!</li>
            <li> I live this mascara in dark black. It does go on a bit thick but with the right technique it&#x27;s not a huge problem.. I received it on time and had no issues upon delivery.</li>
            <li> I have worn Maybelline mascaras since, well forever.....This has a tendency to create spikes. So I follow up with Soft and Full mascara and it&#x27;s fine.  I do like it for my bottom lashes because of the small brush.</li>
            <li> Love my mascara! So so worth it! Makes my eye lashes long n thick! N it&#x27;s a very very good price!💕</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about a month and it has been my favorite! I&#x27;ve owned a lot of high end mascaras and low end ones,of course many high end mascaras are as good and better than this one but for someone with a tight budget this is just perfect! It really defines your lashes,lengthens gives great volume. For the price it is worth the try, I know I will be buying this instead of wasting $30 on a mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy and just not my kind of mascara.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! When I received this item it was all dried up. Now I know why the price was so cheap .</li>
            <li> Gave u 3 stars just because it didn&#x27;t feel wet enough do I gave it to my daughter she says it&#x27;s ok so ok then</li>
            <li> I gave this mascara a try after reading all the great reviews...I would say it&#x27;s ok, not great but not bad either...I will continue my search for the perfect mascara</li>
            <li> Really longer than nature lashes.</li>
            <li> A+ love it my be my favorite mascara now. Received quickly. Great price. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> It worked but it really didn&#x27;t define unless I put on multiple layers. It didn&#x27;t flake and was good against water without being a waterproof variety.</li>
            <li> Great lash-defining mascara. Glides on very smoothly. It&#x27;s long-lasting and does not clump! Maybe she&#x27;s born with it maybe it&#x27;s Maybelline!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a lengthening mascara in my opinion, though it does provide decent volume. The high points of this product, in my opinion, are: it does not clump, it does not flake, it does not smudge, and it provides great length and separation. It&#x27;s a great mascara! If you want dramatic volume, you&#x27;ll either have to build it up a bit or opt for a different mascara. I love this one for everyday use. It&#x27;s dependable and not clumpy or spidery. It&#x27;s pretty great. Obviously, everyone has preferences and I realize some people will want something more bold but for a well put together, daytime mascara, you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have short lashes and they give my lashes that extention they need. I love the color it comes in. It came fast in the mail and aslo free shipping..cant beat that!</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a great mascara. It take a bits longer to dry than most the mascaras I&#x27;ve had, but due to how fantastically it defines your eyes, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my fav mascara:  it gets all the lashes, covers well, adds volume and doesn&#x27;t flake after a long day of ruling the world !!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 mascaras.  The first one broke after the first week, with daily use.  I&#x27;ve started the second one and already the wand feels as though it may break.  I&#x27;ve used this brand of mascara for years and never had this problem.  Shipping was within a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites. I will be purchasing this again but in waterproof. This is a must have in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis. It&#x27;s great. But sometimes it does leaves clumps. Good seller, so I would order again when necessary.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. Color. (I used \\&quot;very black\\&quot;) looks natural, max volume and there Are NO clumps.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!! By far my favorite the brush doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my lashes look sooooo perfect I recommend this stuff to anyone!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing at unclumping your lashes. It makes them look very long, and it dries quickly, but doesn&#x27;t flake after it dries. I recommend this mascara!!! (:</li>
            <li> Mascara came much faster than what I expected, great product I loved it.</li>
            <li> This product is good without the accompaniment of eyeliner. Standing alone, your eyelashes will look long and lovely. Standing with eyeliner, your eyelashes will look like poorly placed fake eyelashes. If you&#x27;re looking for the natural makeup-I was born with long, fabulous lashes-look, then this is your product. If you&#x27;re not looking for the heavy makeup- I was out all night boozin&#x27; it up, and just rolled out of bed an hour ago- look, then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> works great lashes are long and thick ! in the price i paid and do have he volume&lt;br /&gt;would of bought more</li>
            <li> I really wish Maybelline would bring this one back out in all stores! Meanwhile I can find it inexpensively on Amazon. Thankful for that.</li>
            <li> This is the best!!!  Makes my lashes long and thick!!!</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful, i love it so much. My eyelashes are very nice. I recommend it to all women. Use it !</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! Better than the expensive mascara&#x27;s and last all day. I recommend this as the best little secret</li>
            <li> This is ok, but it dried out pretty fast. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This mascara does lift and thicken the lashes, but they droop very quickly. Also, mine smells terrible and the packaging of the mascara was awful. This must be very old because I&#x27;ve only ever had a mascara smelling like this and it was almost a year old. The only nice thing about my orders was the shipping speed which was very fast. If you want a nice colonizing mascara, try loreal voluminous. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> I was very sad when I couldn&#x27;t find this mascara anymore in the drug stores. So I was thrilled when I saw it on Amazon. It separates your lashes, builds and lengthens them as well without clumping or flaking. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I used this mascara for all of high school. I&#x27;ive tried different ones and yet always find my way back to this one. i dont get any clumps fron this mascara .</li>
            <li> No clumping...cheaper than store price.  Happy with purchase.  Good for an every day basic mascara.  Will purchase again in future.</li>
            <li> It could have been a good one, however, i received a very dry one. couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Do not care for....clumps and globs terribly....was hoping for a smooth cover but this is like most others I have tried...don&#x27;t waste your money or time....does not define any lashes, just looks nasty.</li>
            <li> Seems okay, but I seem to end up with dark shadows/flakes underneath my eye by early afternoon.  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> This mascaria is very good, it works great and gives you a great lash</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite mascara by far. It goes on easily, although I think sometimes it seems just a tad more dried out than expected; then again it is terribly cold right now so that could also be a factor :). Either way 5 star quality!</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect for those women like me who struggle with barely any lashes. This mascara makes your eyes pop</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Really defines and lengthens lashes, and looks fabulous. I do experience some slight flaking with this product, which is why I like Great Last mascara more.</li>
            <li> Great product great price! Can&#x27;t go wrong with Maybelline mascara. Ordered four of them! Next time maybe I&#x27;ll gift one or two?</li>
            <li> I usually use maybelline mascaras but I love this mascara... it looks great and goes on smoothly..and the price is not bad</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara.. Great product for the price! It lengthens and defines the eyelashes with pretty good volume.. But if  you are particularly looking for more volume and thick lashes ,this may not be the right product for you..</li>
            <li> I purchased Maybeline define a lash mascara in very black and was crossing my fingers.  I normally like the bristles on the brush to be longer because usually that gives you good volume and length.  However, this product was so cost efficient and I liked the reviews that said it could easily be removed. How many mascaras say washable and stay stuck on your lashes until you wash too much sometimes causing you to lose lashes! So I received it in a few days which was great. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and it&#x27;s super easy to ash off.  It does make my lashes long without clumping due to the plastic piece that keeps the mascara from coming all out like some mascaras are. So I got a great product for cheap and couldn&#x27;t be happier. And now I have a new fav mascara ;)</li>
            <li> I thought this item was discontinued because I could not find it ANYWHERE in the stores. I was so happy to find it on Amazon because this is one of my all time favorite mascaras! I use Maybelline Define-A-Lash Lengthening mascara as well. It works really well when you combine the two mascaras...one coat of each. LOVE the volume I get with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Maybelline carries the best products. Happy to know Amazon stocks them when they leave the shelf.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it makes my lashes very long and curly. The only thing is it lacks on volume a little bit so if I&#x27;m going for more of a dramatic look I&#x27;ll layer it under my maybelline mega plush mascara.</li>
            <li> Excellent, i&#x27;m very happy for the shopping, it was that ai needed and the price is perfect , , ,</li>
            <li> This mascara may work well for others, but it did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes. No lengthening nor any volume.</li>
            <li> The mascara applies well, the color is nice, but it has a tendency to clump, it runs easily when you sweat or cry.</li>
            <li> its not waterproof...which is a MUST for me....otherwise would have been 5 stars! will be using for my in case of emergency mascara</li>
            <li> This was a great mascara.  Not clumpy and easy to apply.  It does thicken lashes and the price is reasonable.  Too bad it is no longer made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man. You won&#x27;t catch me dead with this stuff on. But my wife uses it. So does a daughter. I suppose they&#x27;re applying it right because they never have that Gothic eye look when they put this on.</li>
            <li> Never tried this before and was nervous because I&#x27;m picky with mascara, but this make my lashes look amazing! Super black and make them look HUGE. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok wouldn&#x27;t really but this buy again ...brush is way to brittle for me plus doesn&#x27;t makes my eyelash look fuller</li>
            <li> I want to preface this review by stating that Maybelline is my favorite drug store makeup brand and I own a large variety of their products. I own everything from eyebrow pencils, foundation , blush, eye shadow brushes,  bronzer you name it I probably have owned it or it&#x27;s currently in my beauty rotation . I continue to repurchase the Maybelline New York Define a Lash Lengthing mascara and once I picked up the Maybelline Denfine a Lash Volume mascara.  What I did like about the volume mascara just like with the lengthing is the color. I always get it in very black and true to its name it goes on really dark which I love.  However I do not care for the wand being as flexible as it is. To someone else having a flexible wand tip might be a benefit but to me it&#x27;s to flexible/soft it makes the application clumsy.  The wand actually feels quite cheap.  Also with the volume mascara it is not buildable when I apply a second coat my lashes freeze and start to feel brittle and spikey. I have not repurchased the volume mascara. Personally for volume I prefer Estee Lauder Sumptuous mascara (sample size last about 90 days)</li>
            <li> The tip of it broke off, so now I cannot use the product. I think it&#x27;s made cheap. So I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm... but only the first time :| It dried out so fast even though I always carefully closed its lid.</li>
            <li> This mascara was very black and not too expensive. But it clumped too easily and I threw it away after a few uses. Now using CK mascara from Ulta which is pricey but never clumps.</li>
            <li> I really like my new mascara. Adds great volume and makes my lashes look fuller. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting this mascara b/c it has been my favorite. However the first time I used it it seemed like it was/is dried out. I was hoping this wasn&#x27;t too good to be true, unfortunately it was.</li>
            <li> I liked very much this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly will by another one when this finishes.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara.  I usually like maybelline really just for their mascaras but had yet to ever try this one.  It was being sold here on amazon for under $4.00 so Ithought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I do like it, it is by no means a bad mascara.  I doesn&#x27;t really clump or flake at all.  I did notice that the formula is a little on the thin side.  And I do all in all prefer cover girl clump crusher.  But at $4 this is def. not a bad mascara.  I use it more for daytime because it is not so dramatic whereas the clump crusher creates a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. It sucks that I cant buy it in the store anymore so I have to buy it offline.</li>
            <li> Love how my lashes look with this Mascara</li>
            <li> Love it and here on time</li>
            <li> My wife really loved this product when they were available on shelves. Unfortunately, I guess they discontinued this so we ordered it online. My wife really didn&#x27;t like it, she said it was too clumpy and felt like it was some kinda old stock and didn&#x27;t work quite well.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product turned out. I have long-fine lashes and they tangle very easy. This mascara separates, makes them look full, it does not flake/crumble. It feels very natural and looks amazing.</li>
