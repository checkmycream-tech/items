            <li> Don&#x27;t get the hair all that well.</li>
            <li> Awesome. As expected and wife loved it.</li>
            <li> My first one was given to me as a gift. Fell in love with it. After 4 years I&#x27;ve ordered my second one as the first one&#x27;s button to turn on finally stopped making a connection.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  Well made and the tweezer tips are of a great quality.  The light feature is designed perfectly and lights up the unsightly hairs I was missing.  I tried a cheaper brand prior to these and they ended up in the trash.  I highly recommend these</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much I included them in my family gift baskets for Christmas. Perfect for anyone - young or old.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister as a present and she wanted me to get her another one to keep at work.  it truly has many uses.  My kids used it at the bowling alley to get the finger sticky out of it, and then at soccer to untie the laces.  the light is exceptional!</li>
            <li> Nice. Compact but good size. Easy to use. Bright light. Sharp. Easy to pack away in the holder for travel. What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> Great light.  Some problem with adjusting to the tweezers.  On a slant and i prefer horizontal cut.</li>
            <li> I have been using La Tweeze tweezers for years, the light on it is absolutely worth the money.  You can see even the finest lightest hairs!  Works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Thank u!</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with these. Wife loved them!</li>
            <li> It is a great item--except my battery was drained when I got it and I have hurt my wrist trying to get it open to change the battery.</li>
            <li> The tweezers line up perfectly and the light is a big help.  There is a shadow but I think there will just be a bit of a learning curve there.</li>
            <li> I gave one of these to each of my daughters and granddaughters.  They all loved them.  The light &amp;#34;lit&amp;#34; them up,</li>
            <li> Truly happy with this- am 75 and now can see where shadows would otherwise interfere. Excellent quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great/ learning curve for shadow.</li>
            <li> This is the product I&#x27;ve wished for! The light is never bright enough normally, and when I used these tweezers for the first time with the light I was amazed at what I saw! Now I can tweeze all of the fine hairs that I&#x27;ve been missing for years!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This product illuminates those pesky hairs with the LED light. Even bought a second one to have as a back-up!!</li>
            <li> I was wondering if these tweezers could possibly live up to the awesome reviews I read before purchasing. I took the plunge and bought them for Christmas gifts. They lived up to the reviews and more. I just purchased another one for myself after trying out the one I bought for my daughter. These are the best tweezers I have ever used. Buy them, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are amazing!  With the illumination turned on you can see every lash for easy tweezing.  I&#x27;m buying one for all my lady friends for Christmas!  Makes a great gift!</li>
