            <li>I loved Chapstick brand naturals but its no longer available.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I think this one is going into the purse. :)</li>
            <li>It also helps the lip stick stay in place better and longer.</li>
            <li>Simply, both the seller and the product are the absoulte best.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find this lip balm in the stores.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love it.  </li>
            <li>Love that I can get it here when I can&#x27;t find in the stores and</li>
            <li>Love the soothing and softness the lip balm had on my lips.</li>
            <li>love it because it is not greasy and keeps my lips moisturized and conditioned.  </li>

            <li>Glad to find it online.</li>
            <li>I was glad I could order on line.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I love the non greasy feel, it has no flavor which is a must for me.</li>
            <li>I love this line of products.</li>
            <li>Really love this lip balm, which seems to work as well as the La Mer lip balm that I also use.  </li>
            <li>Smells refreshing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why no one&#x27;s able to do this as well as Chapstick Naturals.  </li>
            <li>I really love this because I have acne</li>
            <li>This could be a better product if they took out the menthol.</li>
            <li>and I love the flavor.</li>
            <li>After trying many paraben free chap sticks, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product...</li>
            <li>Just a light hint of smell and the flavor doesn&#x27;t seep in to my mouth like some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moisturing and smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels nice &amp; light and really does nourish.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Chapstick!</li>
            <li>Most lip balms become somewhat sticky as time goes on , but this one feels just as fresh as when i first put it on.</li>
            <li>one is effective and doesn&#x27;t have a scent all natural</li>
            <li>I am a total chappy addict, and have been for a good 20 years.</li>
            <li>Natural scent, and glides nicely on</li>
            <li>After several hours, it is still nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very consistent in quality, as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>the price for what I got was just a tad better than major retailers, when they carry it that is.</li>
            <li>Really love all natural items, because I&#x27;m very allergic to sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, isn&#x27;t overpowering, doesn&#x27;t have any strong odors etc.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and it does not make your lips more dry and needing more chap stick, sometimes I use it to blend my lip liner and just skip the lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Great lip moisturizer, with no petroleum or other less healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I really underestimated this lip balm!  </li>
            <li>The price is also pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She likes that they&#x27;re natural and the flavor and scent aren&#x27;t too strong and they&#x27;re very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do the job it&#x27;s intended to do, but it&#x27;s not too sticky at all, and the taste isn&#x27;t offensive or strong.</li>
            <li>Other brands like Chapstick (makes my lips peel), Burt Bees (drys out very quickly), and EOS (drys out quickly</li>
            <li>I received this as an online gift and didn&#x27;t expect much of it beyond being another chapstick to conveniently keep around.   </li>
            <li>Who wants to have petroleum on their lips?</li>
            <li>Actually, it has a light, pleasing smell.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonable comparison to the chapstick brand.</li>
            <li>Much, much cheaper than La Mer.  </li>
            <li>This chappy delivers lasting moisture with a pleasant slightly minty flavor.</li>
            <li>so I usually stock up and buy 5 or more off Amazon!</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t contain some of the harmful chemicals that other lip balms do.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is light enough to put under lipstick, it doesn&#x27;t make my lips all chapped, and it&#x27;s not thick and goopy.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s natural so there are no weird chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>better than any other lip product!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for I. Have a hard time finding these in stores these days so this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Most products have sunscreen and it is extremely hard to find products without.  </li>
            <li>I had used the product for just 2 days when I noticed my lips were suddenly REALLY soft.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making all natural make up as well.  </li>
            <li>I also find that it moisturizes really well (almost as well as the Aveeno - the blue one).</li>
            <li>Gentle balm for the lips that leave them soft and even a little tingle when first applied like a peppermint tingle.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is becoming harder and harder to find, but of course Amazon had it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product that is seems virtually impossible to find on the shelf.</li>
            <li>No other chapstick compares.</li>
            <li>It glides on thinly, unlike sticky/waxy lip balms I&#x27;ve tried, and the scent and taste are very light (minty).</li>
            <li>and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that is gentle enough to use several times a day.</li>
            <li>Plus, overall the ingrdients are mostly natural.</li>

            <li> Ever since I stumbled across Neutrogena Naturals Lip Balm using any other lip balms, including other all natural brands, fall way short of this product.</li>
            <li> The menthol adds nothing to the quality, and for users like me who are on oxygen therapy day and night, the menthol tends to dry out our lips.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the other reviews!</li>
            <li> Generally, I hate putting anything on my lips, but this lip balm is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore and go through a tube in roughly a months time, so</li>
            <li> I have a reaction to all other types I have tried.</li>
            <li> I figured it was like any other lip balm and didn&#x27;t use for a while.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm and have a difficult time finding it in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I am not allergic to this lip balm, I apparently have sensitive lips that react badly to some lip products.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding lip balm that I like that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I use Vaseline on my lips at bedtime, but I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it works just as well overnight!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oddly enough I find this product difficult to find in stores now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever mess with my flow of my fix!!</li>
            <li> I bought 9 boxes on Amazon because it is sometimes hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t thick or have an overpowering scent or taste.</li>
            <li> I hate anything too sticky or glossy, and God forbid a lip balm is sticky enough that my hair sticks to my lips.</li>
            <li> Unable to find the product in brick and mortar stores</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this lip balm and have a difficult time finding it in the stores anymore.  Was very glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> Great lip moisturizer, with no petroleum or other less healthy ingredients.  No fragrance or oils.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. Generally, I hate putting anything on my lips, but this lip balm is amazing. It smells just like chocolate mint and it goes on so well! After several hours, it is still nice and smooth. Most lip balms become somewhat sticky as time goes on , but this one feels just as fresh as when i first put it on. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Best natural lip balm by Neutrogena. Moisturizes and softens lips. Makes my lips feel supple throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Cannot find it in the store anymore!</li>
            <li> My only choice for a lip balm. I have a reaction to all other types I have tried.</li>
            <li> I received this as an online gift and didn&#x27;t expect much of it beyond being another chapstick to conveniently keep around.   I had used the product for just 2 days when I noticed my lips were suddenly REALLY soft. I really underestimated this lip balm!  It glides on thinly, unlike sticky/waxy lip balms I&#x27;ve tried, and the scent and taste are very light (minty). It&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t like to notice your lip-wear, like me.   I think this one is going into the purse. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Not only does this lip moisturizer wear well under your lip stick, but it heals them from that any season dryness too. It also helps the lip stick stay in place better and longer. You can&#x27;t beat that!  Males can also wear it for the healing and moisture that it provides without the shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because some times the scented chopsticks don&#x27;t help in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is effective and doesn&#x27;t have a scent all natural</li>
            <li> I have tried every lip balm there is &amp; Neutrogena naturals is the best...no taste..no stickiness...keeps my lips moist all day &amp; I wear it under my lipstick for a moist feeling but not glossy or greasy.  Fantastic product...no waxiness.</li>
            <li> Simply, both the seller and the product are the absoulte best. Unable to find the product in brick and mortar stores so this is the only place to get it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find this lip balm in the stores.  My daughter and I both love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your lips feeling slimy or look as if you have a white film on them.  Also, it&#x27;s natural so there are no weird chemicals in it.  Who wants to have petroleum on their lips?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for I. Have a hard time finding these in stores these days so this fit the bill. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I stumbled across Neutrogena Naturals Lip Balm using any other lip balms, including other all natural brands, fall way short of this product. It&#x27;s by far the best at easing away chapped lips. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I scour the stores for this chap stick. I&#x27;m an addict. Love that I can get it here when I can&#x27;t find in the stores and the price for what I got was just a tad better than major retailers, when they carry it that is. Don&#x27;t ever mess with my flow of my fix!!</li>
            <li> These were for my wife and she loves them. She likes that they&#x27;re natural and the flavor and scent aren&#x27;t too strong and they&#x27;re very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Really love all natural items, because I&#x27;m very allergic to sunscreen.  Most products have sunscreen and it is extremely hard to find products without.  Thank you for making all natural make up as well.  Love the soothing and softness the lip balm had on my lips.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well. I&#x27;m on a medication that dries my lips out and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that is gentle enough to use several times a day. All natural ingredients and no chemicals make it perfect. It feels nice &amp; light and really does nourish.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is becoming harder and harder to find, but of course Amazon had it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it because it is not greasy and keeps my lips moisturized and conditioned.  If you don&#x27;t like mint, this is not for you as it has a mintiness to it you can smell after applying it.</li>
            <li> The product does a good job when combined with glycerine or aloe vera to seal in moisture and keeping my lips moisturized. Plus, overall the ingrdients are mostly natural.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and it does not make your lips more dry and needing more chap stick, sometimes I use it to blend my lip liner and just skip the lipstick.  I bought 9 boxes on Amazon because it is sometimes hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is seems virtually impossible to find on the shelf. Very consistent in quality, as well.</li>
            <li> Lip gold. No other chapstick compares. I love it. Target used to sell this product and for some reason stopped. Glad to find it online.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the other reviews! I have trouble finding lip balm that I like that isn&#x27;t thick or have an overpowering scent or taste. This one is perfect! Just a light hint of smell and the flavor doesn&#x27;t seep in to my mouth like some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I use Vaseline on my lips at bedtime, but I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it works just as well overnight!</li>
            <li> I am a total chappy addict, and have been for a good 20 years. I&#x27;m also quite the chappy snob. This chappy delivers lasting moisture with a pleasant slightly minty flavor. I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore and go through a tube in roughly a months time, so I order 3-6 at a time.</li>
            <li> Last year I got this lip balm with some sunscreen. I figured it was like any other lip balm and didn&#x27;t use for a while. Then one day I decided to use it and it has changed my makeup routine. This lip balm is light enough to put under lipstick, it doesn&#x27;t make my lips all chapped, and it&#x27;s not thick and goopy. I definitely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> After trying many paraben free chap sticks, this one is my favorite. It keeps my lips moisturized and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> Thank you for still carrying this online as I cannot find it in stores anymore and this is the only chapstick I like(not waxy) that will not melt in my pocket!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> In my books it&#x27;s the best lip balm out there. I like that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, isn&#x27;t overpowering, doesn&#x27;t have any strong odors etc. I also find that it moisturizes really well (almost as well as the Aveeno - the blue one). The price is also pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough I find this product difficult to find in stores now so I usually stock up and buy 5 or more off Amazon!</li>
            <li> The only lip balm that I am not allergic to. And I cannot find in any store. I was glad I could order on line. I have about 10 now and they last for a while even using every day and all throughout the day. Moisturing and smooth. Not overly glossy and can be used under lip stick or lip gloss.  No taste and not smell.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Great non toxic ingredients! Works great!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm - period!  I will go to the ends of the earth to always have these in my purse etc. better than any other lip product!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm ever. I&#x27;m a bit of a weirdo about lip balm. I hate anything too sticky or glossy, and God forbid a lip balm is sticky enough that my hair sticks to my lips. That drives me nuts, as does tasting lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is wonderful. Not only does it do the job it&#x27;s intended to do, but it&#x27;s not too sticky at all, and the taste isn&#x27;t offensive or strong. Actually, it has a light, pleasing smell. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t contain some of the harmful chemicals that other lip balms do.</li>
            <li> Love this product this is the only place I can find it</li>
            <li> Nice lip balm. Goes on smoothly, smells nice, and lips feel good after using it for a while. It lacks a sunscreen making it necessary to buy a second lip balm to use when going outside. I find it a bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> This is a good Chapstick. I loved Chapstick brand naturals but its no longer available. This is a reasonable comparison to the chapstick brand. I love the non greasy feel, it has no flavor which is a must for me.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Chapstick! I purchase them from Amazon three at a time because I can&#x27;t be without one and I can&#x27;t find them in any stores anymore. I would be devastated if these were ever discontinued! I love this line of products.</li>
            <li> Really love this lip balm, which seems to work as well as the La Mer lip balm that I also use.  Much, much cheaper than La Mer.  And on the plus side, I can order the 3 pack and always have one at my office desk, by my bedside table and in my purse.  A great find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minty scent, but I like it.  Smells refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is just that I was looking for but could never find. Please bring it back, why stop making something that people like.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have looked and looked in local stores and they never have it, so I found it online, thankfully. Gentle balm for the lips that leave them soft and even a little tingle when first applied like a peppermint tingle.</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to this lip balm, I apparently have sensitive lips that react badly to some lip products.  This is a soothing lip balm.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used. It keeps my lips moisturized. Other brands like Chapstick (makes my lips peel), Burt Bees (drys out very quickly), and EOS (drys out quickly also).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why no one&#x27;s able to do this as well as Chapstick Naturals.  I also don&#x27;t understand why Chapstick stopped manufacturing Chapstick Naturals.  Nothing else works as well and no one else was making anything like it!  I&#x27;d pay 5 or 6 a tube for that stuff but instead, they just stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I really love this because I have acne and this does not cause pimples to break out around my mouth !&lt;br /&gt;It also feels wonderful and no nasty taste :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm for over a year now and I LOVE IT!  Natural scent, and glides nicely on and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This could be a better product if they took out the menthol. The menthol adds nothing to the quality, and for users like me who are on oxygen therapy day and night, the menthol tends to dry out our lips. Just thought you need to know, menthol is not needed.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite lip balm. It keeps my lips moist, it is not waxy at all and I love the flavor.</li>
            <li> This is a non-waxy lip balm and it keeps your lips so moist.  I used Accutane and it ruined my lips but this product makes all the difference.</li>
