            <li>Leven Rose Rosehip Oil is the handiest oil in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>My opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>

            <li>All opinions are my own and based on my own use of and experience with the item.</li>

            <li>I just received the rose hip oil 2 days ago</li>
            <li>I have however never purchased rose oil before.</li>
            <li>Why I LIKED THIS rosehip oil&lt;</li>
            <li>The bottle with the stopper is a nice way to use the oil.</li>
            <li>Leven Rose makes the highest quality products I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>and I am already loving it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing a good job of minimizing the fine age lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it along with a drop of Leven Rose Jojoba oil which I also love....</li>
            <li>First, I have to say, what beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect but had been reading that rose</li>
            <li>Thank you Leven Rose and Frances :)</li>
            <li>Leven Rose&#x27;s Rosehip oil is clearly much better quality, and is what Rosehip oil should look and feel like.  </li>
            <li>Their products are absolutely amazing and are top notch.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to use on my over sensitive skin, absorbs beautifully and left my skin feeling great, wonderful product!</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil is a great product, light amber color, and it soaks into the skin easily.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>the two - Leven Rose is far more superior in texture and richness!</li>
            <li>I apply this nightly, and it seems to have alleviated that problem.</li>
            <li>This product has given my skin a more even tone and has also moisturized and balanced it like nothing else</li>
            <li>it a try, You will love it too.</li>

            <li>I love the color and label</li>
            <li>I love what it&#x27;s doing for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>He was able to relax and go to sleep.</li>
            <li>The Leven Rosehip Oil has become one of my favorite morning and night time moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth it is!</li>
            <li>I love this oil; I have used the jojoba and emu oils of this brand as well</li>
            <li>am also impressed with the personal customer service from this company!  </li>
            <li>and I love how this moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in a dropper to avoid any skin contamination.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this as I don’t like to have any sort of oily feeling when it comes to my face.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel more oily of greasy after using it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs okay into my skin</li>
            <li>It would be better with a light rose scent.</li>
            <li>I love the way it works the way it says it will.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be unrefined but according to what I&#x27;ve been able to read...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I received this rosehip oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li>and you should always use your best judgement and consult your doctor when necessary.</li>
            <li>My skin had a more even tone, was supple and had a dewy look.  </li>
            <li>It comes with an eye dropper to help you use it sparingly to get the most out of the product.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this oil.</li>
            <li>but it seems okay.</li>
            <li>and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the results I get with more time.</li>
            <li>and I swear my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad that I had the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>It is exotic.</li>
            <li>I have many allergies and this does not bother them.  </li>
            <li>Love this in a skin blend I just did.</li>
            <li>I was already using the Leven Rose Jojoba Oil (also fantastic)</li>
            <li>My friends say my complexion never looked better.</li>
            <li>What I really love most about this oil is the texture.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!..</li>
            <li>and as I said before it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything this company has to offer and their rosehip oil just rocks, I’m sure their other products are just as great!</li>
            <li>My new, now go to Company for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I like that it is not as strong in the smell that most resehip oils I tried, and</li>
            <li>This however got the go ahead from him because the scent is so mild when applied on it’s own</li>
            <li>This brand is wonderful and smells much better than the other brand I was using.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe the most important aspect:</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be ordering more! :)</li>
            <li>I also have purchased other oils from this seller and have been very happy with those also.  </li>
            <li>This is high quality oil that I would surely recommend! :)</li>
            <li>Very light, absorbs quickly, and I do not notice a scent.</li>
            <li>Amazing Price for stellar product..</li>
            <li>I switched to natural soap and an apple cider vinegar toner and those changes paired with these oils has made an amazing difference!</li>
            <li>and I saw beautiful results the next morning!</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was suggested that it helps with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I received Leven Rose Products from my husband for Christmas, him really not knowing what to order, so proud of his effort, because it sure payed off, so hooked on her products, good quality, smooth skin and mixes well with my essential oils..</li>
            <li>This pure rosehip oil feels nice on my face and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a pure product.</li>
            <li>husband is a huge fan of their beard oil, so he tried this oil on his hands.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing huge results.</li>
            <li>I have found myself in love with Leven Rose Rosehip oil for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or clog pores.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Its a great moisturizer and it left my skin glowing and radiant.</li>
            <li>I remove my eye makeup with it, moisturize my face and body, apply to my hair sparingly for deep conditioning and as needed for fly aways/frizz.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic product Leven has made here.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a free product for a review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a free product for a review.</li>
            <li>I got this rosehip oil for free to review.</li>
            <li>and this is great for that, along with removing makeup and acting as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Smooth, light oil.</li>
            <li>Received The Product For Free or DISCOUNT In Exchange For Review</li>
            <li>The Leven Rosehip Oil has been a fabulous addition to my skincare regime.  </li>
            <li>This oil is free of added junk.</li>
            <li>I have received this product for free for testing and review.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, supple and bright.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the oil itself, it works well with my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using the jojoba oil for a few weeks and now the rosehip oil, they are both great!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The oil I received is very light in color and smells to me exactly like vitamin E or sunflower oil.</li>
            <li>Heals my skin quickly without any strong smell.</li>
            <li>and this one is my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>so I was excited for the Rosehip oil to arrive.</li>
            <li>I made sure to wash well and used aloe at first, but then switched to this oil to help keep my skin moisturized and heal.</li>
            <li>Excited to see what else you will create for us with oils.  </li>
            <li>Not sure which I like best between the rosehip and jojoba.</li>
            <li>The seller has been so sweet and contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase, which was pleasantly unexpected!</li>
            <li>This was my 2nd Leven Rose Oil review, and I LOVE these guys.</li>
            <li>The company even contacted me personally to make sure I liked it and answered questions that I had.</li>
            <li>He also really liked it as a moisturizer - he confessed he has occasionally rubbed the beard oil on his hands because he likes it so much, so he&#x27;s glad to have another</li>
            <li>The oil is absorbed very quickly into the skin and there are no signs of a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This works great in my daughters dry hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying this oil to see if it would soothe some of the turmoil, and so far I&#x27;m satisfied that it delivers!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised and charmed and his coat is looking lovely!</li>
            <li>( most oils need moisturizer or damp skin to sink in or they will just stay on the surface of your face), and it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The oil is light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Thank Leven Rose for making these natural oils...</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li>Use this after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>She says that she uses is all over her body and that it leaves the skin smooth and moisturized right away.</li>
            <li>I have not found anything else that clears my face up as quickly as this.  </li>
            <li>Super oil.</li>
            <li>I am much more comfortable with natural products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>the oil is quickly absorbed(Score for no oily/shiny skin).</li>
            <li>so it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>So silky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I noticed it absorbed right away and smoothed out my skin!</li>
            <li>My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**hat although the packaging and labeling has absolutely nothing to do with how the product works, I kind of adore the pink</li>
            <li>I have never used this oil before, but after even the first use, my face felt softer and after four uses, I can already see a difference in the fine lines around my lips (smile lines).</li>
            <li>I have bought many product by Leven Rose and they always ships in a DARK glass bottle which help protect the properties of the oil.</li>
            <li>so in all fairness, the three stars come more from a let down of my own expectations about this product.  </li>
            <li>Absorbed well, and just feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I believe skin care should be simple and effective...</li>
            <li>also it is more clear.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft and gives it a healthy look.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd purchase from Leven Rose</li>
            <li>The coconut oil I had used previously left my face feeling a bit greasy (not purchased through this company, just fyi) and the rosehip oil blends in so nicely</li>
            <li>use the Leven Rose 100% Organic Beard Oil on a daily basis and it does wonders for me, so I decided to try this Rosehip Oil to see what it could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love the soft feel.</li>
            <li>Can I just add real quick that although the packaging and labeling has absolutely nothing to do with how the product works, I kind of adore the pink</li>
            <li>If you love her other oils, I have no doubt you will love this one too.</li>
            <li>The oil itself feels rich and somewhat more viscous than I anticipated, but once applied it absorbs instantly with no</li>
            <li>Wife loves the feel and it smells good, not like a lot of other organic oils.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I like to use it at night right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Is scentless and it soaked into my skin right away.  </li>
            <li>Shipped right away and came as described.</li>
            <li>Personally I burn very easy</li>
            <li>Am currently using the Leven Rose Rosehip Oil for many different applications.  </li>
            <li>This company hands down has great price and high quality product.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s 100% pure organic and unrefined!  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and my skin is looking great!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>Also, it helped to gently remove hair dye from my forehead!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely  be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>am pleased that the only ingredient is cold-pressed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Will add more to my review later on.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying rosehip oil</li>
            <li>Will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li>I love that there isn&#x27;t any extra chemicals</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first oil I have bought that did not bother me in some way.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure which one I love the most.</li>
            <li>It really does!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick,  but having used Keven Rose products before it doesn&#x27;t really bother me,  but the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I initially thought.</li>
            <li>Leven Rose oils are my personal favorites as well due to the personal touch of the company, the great bottles and the eye dropper makes them much easier to work with than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is lovely and sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>The fatty acids linoleic, linolenic, oleic, and palmitic are excellent for dry wrinkles and dehydrated skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it more on my face to chase away those little fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have purchased from Leven Rose in the past and am not disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>I am starting to age and this absorbed into my fine lines perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is super rich and I can feel the difference instantly.</li>
            <li>the medicines I take cause frequent breakouts no matter how diligent I am keeping my face clean.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly think that it is actually helping clear my blemishes.</li>
            <li>It may take me a few more days to see what this oil is fully capable of but so far I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite beauty supplement!</li>
            <li>I have added a few drops of my favorite essential oils and this has been amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty much, acne, scars, and wrinkles are no match for this stuff</li>
            <li>Applying this oil gave relief pretty much over night.</li>
            <li>I intended to use this as a moisturizer for my face, however, I seem to be make better use tackling my extremely dry hands, lips, feet and hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling super soft and my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Love it since it is a dry oil.</li>
            <li>I read that rosehip is usually yellow/orange/amber in color with a light scent that most people tend to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a dry oil</li>
            <li>My favorite part about the oil is that so much can go a long way.</li>
            <li>I was laying down on the couch and using the dropper when I accidentally spilled the bottle on my pajamas, rubbed most of the spill into my skin, dropped my &#x27;rose hip oil pajamas&#x27; on the floor to change into new ones and my male miniature pinscher puppy</li>
            <li>I like that fact that it&#x27;s  100 percent pure organic and unrefined.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic &amp; Unrefined Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li>The smell tells it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 and am starting to notice some fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it and does the trick.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really liking the results.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m all greasy after I use it, it rubs in very well.</li>
            <li>This has really simplified my beauty</li>
            <li>I used this straight from the bottle</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Really helping scares from two hip surgeries in 30 days.</li>
            <li>and I put it on my whole face in the morning.</li>
            <li>I gently rub it in and let it absorb overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The seller as also very caring</li>
            <li>SO I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>well really helps when you are going through the itching and peeling stages, though you will still peel nothing can stop that.</li>
            <li>No offensive odor and absorbs readily into my skin.  </li>
            <li>For those needs, this works really well.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>So be careful, but enjoy!</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product came as advertised.  </li>
            <li>the oil really does seem to vanish into the skin and plump it up.</li>
            <li>oil isn&#x27;t too oily and it absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to rub into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second Leven Rose product that I have tried and once again they only produced the highest in quality.</li>
            <li>I have been using Leven Rose Jojoba and Rosehip oils as my facial moisturizer for the last couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add a little grapefruit oil or frankincense to it, but it&#x27;s wonderful plain too.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil seems to be the trendiest thing right now, the Huffington Post went so far as to call it</li>
            <li>My elbows are even getting soft and smooth - major accomplishment.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried most of the other brands.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, smoother, and more clear than it has been in a long time!</li>
            <li>I have also been using it on my lips, which often tend to be chapped and dry no matter how much emollient I use on them, and they are unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li>Although I have severely dry skin above my lip and it works amazing with keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful amber/orangey color, packaged in the responsible and easy to use amber bottle with dropper vs. the drip top that I hate on other brands.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily as other products and can be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>, they care about their customers and it totally shows :) definitely would recommend this oil!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a few times but it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my hands, nails, and cuticles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the Rosehip oil has an initial scent that i&#x27;m not as fond of in comparison to the Jojoba, however this scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog</li>
            <li>and it left it soft and frizz free without being oily.</li>
            <li>High quality oil.  </li>
            <li>highly reocomend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Many of the other oils I have tried have a stronger odor that I have to mask, but rosehip oil is almost completely odorless.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the seller contacts you directly to ensure quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll clear my dark spots,  but I haven&#x27;t been able to tell yet.</li>
            <li>I normally use jojoba oil as my carrier.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t have a long term review yet, but really enjoying this product in my essential oils routine</li>
            <li>I am always weary when trying out a new product</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and live in the desert.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a dry oil meaning it soaks into your skin quickly</li>
            <li>I also apply this on my skin once I shower and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and regovated.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so it goes very far.</li>
            <li>After reading about different oils, I specifically chose to go with rosehip because it seemed more of a variant from the other oils I already had.</li>
            <li>Its light application smooths on quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when first purchasing, but this oil has helped to decrease the visibility of fine smile lines on my face (where cheek bones meet eyes)</li>
            <li>After only a few weeks of use, I can see a huge improvement around my lips and eyes!</li>
            <li>clear oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an oil like this before, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I cannot believe how soft it has made my hands and face.</li>
            <li>Not oily and leaves my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and suffer from oily skin, acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li>I used it in a hair mask with castor oil and argon oil and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell what results she&#x27;ll see from it, but she says that she&#x27;ll keep using it because &amp;#34;it just feels good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Just go easy on the drops of oil as a very little WILL go</li>
            <li>It is in a dark colored bottle to help with storage and comes in an easy open bottle.  </li>
            <li>but you can add it to moisturizers or other lotions or spa like recipes!This oil can also be used as a carrier oil with any other essential oil you love, so you can boost the awesomeness in this bottle by adding any EO that suits your need!</li>
            <li>I use it at night to help moisturize my dry skin caused by the hot Texas sun.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now for acne (especially along my chin line and neck), fine lines, and dark spots on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>You may save a few dollars getting your oils elsewhere, but the packaging alone makes this worth it!</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again and forward these new finds to friends and family!</li>
            <li>you are looking for a high quality and well crafted night moisturizer, look no further.</li>
            <li>I didn’t mark it down more because it still seems to work as well as those other oils</li>
            <li>oil is very silky and works wonders on my dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>it really does take only 2-3 drops for my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I received no other compensation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as natural remedy , the continious use smooths, improves, prevents and tones wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, sun burns, insect bites, stretch marks and more.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer on my tough spots (heels, elbows, knees) and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Only soft skin.  </li>
            <li>It really did help with the itching though, especially if I exfoliated really well in the shower and then put a few drops of oil on my burnt areas after towel drying off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old routine once this oil is gone.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am a young male, I still face acne problems</li>
            <li>Organic Rosehip Oil is a natural moisturizer composed by essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins, which makes it a powerful skin regenerator.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with Leven Rose.</li>
            <li>I’ve heard it mentioned before as a secret for those who suffer from age spots or uneven skin and even heard it mentioned a few times by celebrities as giving them that flawless skin look.</li>
            <li>After only a few days my face went from dry and flaky to soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>light colored rosehip oil usually mean it&#x27;s a lower quality or refined oil.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and have learned that rosehip oil is the only oil that really works for this.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it but a few days but really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Looking critically at ingredient lists and product packaging is pretty depressing, especially when I have considerations like fine lines, eczema, and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit of a thick oil, but when you rub it on your skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>But when your little one is crying and can&#x27;t stop scratching from all the bug bites, that is pretty much all you can think about.</li>
            <li>So far my eyes do look less tired in the morning, and I love that if I put on makeup it doesn&#x27;t just slide off -</li>

            <li> It absorbs okay into my skin</li>
            <li> It would be better with a light rose scent.</li>
            <li> I love the way it works the way it says it will.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be unrefined but according to what I&#x27;ve been able to read...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I received this rosehip oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> and you should always use your best judgement and consult your doctor when necessary.</li>
            <li> My skin had a more even tone, was supple and had a dewy look.  </li>
            <li> It comes with an eye dropper to help you use it sparingly to get the most out of the product.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil.</li>
            <li> but it seems okay.</li>
            <li> and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results I get with more time.</li>
            <li> and I swear my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad that I had the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> It is exotic.</li>
            <li> I have many allergies and this does not bother them.  </li>
            <li> Love this in a skin blend I just did.</li>
            <li> I was already using the Leven Rose Jojoba Oil (also fantastic)</li>
            <li> My friends say my complexion never looked better.</li>
            <li> What I really love most about this oil is the texture.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!..</li>
            <li> and as I said before it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything this company has to offer and their rosehip oil just rocks, I’m sure their other products are just as great!</li>
            <li> My new, now go to Company for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I like that it is not as strong in the smell that most resehip oils I tried, and</li>
            <li> This however got the go ahead from him because the scent is so mild when applied on it’s own</li>
            <li> This brand is wonderful and smells much better than the other brand I was using.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe the most important aspect:</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be ordering more! :)</li>
            <li> I also have purchased other oils from this seller and have been very happy with those also.  </li>
            <li> This is high quality oil that I would surely recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Very light, absorbs quickly, and I do not notice a scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing Price for stellar product..</li>
            <li> I switched to natural soap and an apple cider vinegar toner and those changes paired with these oils has made an amazing difference!</li>
            <li> and I saw beautiful results the next morning!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was suggested that it helps with fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I received Leven Rose Products from my husband for Christmas, him really not knowing what to order, so proud of his effort, because it sure payed off, so hooked on her products, good quality, smooth skin and mixes well with my essential oils..</li>
            <li> This pure rosehip oil feels nice on my face and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a pure product.</li>
            <li> husband is a huge fan of their beard oil, so he tried this oil on his hands.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing huge results.</li>
            <li> I have found myself in love with Leven Rose Rosehip oil for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or clog pores.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Its a great moisturizer and it left my skin glowing and radiant.</li>
            <li> I remove my eye makeup with it, moisturize my face and body, apply to my hair sparingly for deep conditioning and as needed for fly aways/frizz.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product Leven has made here.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a free product for a review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a free product for a review.</li>
            <li> I got this rosehip oil for free to review.</li>
            <li> and this is great for that, along with removing makeup and acting as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Smooth, light oil.</li>
            <li> Received The Product For Free or DISCOUNT In Exchange For Review</li>
            <li> The Leven Rosehip Oil has been a fabulous addition to my skincare regime.  </li>
            <li> This oil is free of added junk.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free for testing and review.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, supple and bright.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the oil itself, it works well with my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the jojoba oil for a few weeks and now the rosehip oil, they are both great!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The oil I received is very light in color and smells to me exactly like vitamin E or sunflower oil.</li>
            <li> Heals my skin quickly without any strong smell.</li>
            <li> and this one is my new favorite!  </li>
            <li> so I was excited for the Rosehip oil to arrive.</li>
            <li> I made sure to wash well and used aloe at first, but then switched to this oil to help keep my skin moisturized and heal.</li>
            <li> Excited to see what else you will create for us with oils.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which I like best between the rosehip and jojoba.</li>
            <li> The seller has been so sweet and contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase, which was pleasantly unexpected!</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd Leven Rose Oil review, and I LOVE these guys.</li>
            <li> The company even contacted me personally to make sure I liked it and answered questions that I had.</li>
            <li> He also really liked it as a moisturizer - he confessed he has occasionally rubbed the beard oil on his hands because he likes it so much, so he&#x27;s glad to have another</li>
            <li> The oil is absorbed very quickly into the skin and there are no signs of a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This works great in my daughters dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this oil to see if it would soothe some of the turmoil, and so far I&#x27;m satisfied that it delivers!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised and charmed and his coat is looking lovely!</li>
            <li> ( most oils need moisturizer or damp skin to sink in or they will just stay on the surface of your face), and it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil is light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Thank Leven Rose for making these natural oils...</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li> Use this after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> She says that she uses is all over her body and that it leaves the skin smooth and moisturized right away.</li>
            <li> I have not found anything else that clears my face up as quickly as this.  </li>
            <li> Super oil.</li>
            <li> I am much more comfortable with natural products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> the oil is quickly absorbed(Score for no oily/shiny skin).</li>
            <li> so it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> So silky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I noticed it absorbed right away and smoothed out my skin!</li>
            <li> My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**hat although the packaging and labeling has absolutely nothing to do with how the product works, I kind of adore the pink</li>
            <li> I have never used this oil before, but after even the first use, my face felt softer and after four uses, I can already see a difference in the fine lines around my lips (smile lines).</li>
            <li> I have bought many product by Leven Rose and they always ships in a DARK glass bottle which help protect the properties of the oil.</li>
            <li> so in all fairness, the three stars come more from a let down of my own expectations about this product.  </li>
            <li> Absorbed well, and just feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I believe skin care should be simple and effective...</li>
            <li> also it is more clear.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft and gives it a healthy look.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase from Leven Rose</li>
            <li> The coconut oil I had used previously left my face feeling a bit greasy (not purchased through this company, just fyi) and the rosehip oil blends in so nicely</li>
            <li> use the Leven Rose 100% Organic Beard Oil on a daily basis and it does wonders for me, so I decided to try this Rosehip Oil to see what it could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love the soft feel.</li>
            <li> Can I just add real quick that although the packaging and labeling has absolutely nothing to do with how the product works, I kind of adore the pink</li>
            <li> If you love her other oils, I have no doubt you will love this one too.</li>
            <li> The oil itself feels rich and somewhat more viscous than I anticipated, but once applied it absorbs instantly with no</li>
            <li> Wife loves the feel and it smells good, not like a lot of other organic oils.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I like to use it at night right before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Is scentless and it soaked into my skin right away.  </li>
            <li> Shipped right away and came as described.</li>
            <li> Personally I burn very easy</li>
            <li> Am currently using the Leven Rose Rosehip Oil for many different applications.  </li>
            <li> This company hands down has great price and high quality product.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s 100% pure organic and unrefined!  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my skin is looking great!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Also, it helped to gently remove hair dye from my forehead!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely  be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> am pleased that the only ingredient is cold-pressed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Will add more to my review later on.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love that there isn&#x27;t any extra chemicals</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first oil I have bought that did not bother me in some way.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure which one I love the most.</li>
            <li> It really does!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick,  but having used Keven Rose products before it doesn&#x27;t really bother me,  but the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I initially thought.</li>
            <li> Leven Rose oils are my personal favorites as well due to the personal touch of the company, the great bottles and the eye dropper makes them much easier to work with than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is lovely and sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> The fatty acids linoleic, linolenic, oleic, and palmitic are excellent for dry wrinkles and dehydrated skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it more on my face to chase away those little fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased from Leven Rose in the past and am not disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am starting to age and this absorbed into my fine lines perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is super rich and I can feel the difference instantly.</li>
            <li> the medicines I take cause frequent breakouts no matter how diligent I am keeping my face clean.  </li>
            <li> and I honestly think that it is actually helping clear my blemishes.</li>
            <li> It may take me a few more days to see what this oil is fully capable of but so far I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite beauty supplement!</li>
            <li> I have added a few drops of my favorite essential oils and this has been amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty much, acne, scars, and wrinkles are no match for this stuff</li>
            <li> Applying this oil gave relief pretty much over night.</li>
            <li> I intended to use this as a moisturizer for my face, however, I seem to be make better use tackling my extremely dry hands, lips, feet and hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling super soft and my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love it since it is a dry oil.</li>
            <li> I read that rosehip is usually yellow/orange/amber in color with a light scent that most people tend to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a dry oil</li>
            <li> My favorite part about the oil is that so much can go a long way.</li>
            <li> I was laying down on the couch and using the dropper when I accidentally spilled the bottle on my pajamas, rubbed most of the spill into my skin, dropped my &#x27;rose hip oil pajamas&#x27; on the floor to change into new ones and my male miniature pinscher puppy</li>
            <li> I like that fact that it&#x27;s  100 percent pure organic and unrefined.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic &amp; Unrefined Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li> The smell tells it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 and am starting to notice some fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it and does the trick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really liking the results.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m all greasy after I use it, it rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> This has really simplified my beauty</li>
            <li> I used this straight from the bottle</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> Really helping scares from two hip surgeries in 30 days.</li>
            <li> and I put it on my whole face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I gently rub it in and let it absorb overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The seller as also very caring</li>
            <li> SO I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> well really helps when you are going through the itching and peeling stages, though you will still peel nothing can stop that.</li>
            <li> No offensive odor and absorbs readily into my skin.  </li>
            <li> For those needs, this works really well.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> So be careful, but enjoy!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product came as advertised.  </li>
            <li> the oil really does seem to vanish into the skin and plump it up.</li>
            <li> oil isn&#x27;t too oily and it absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to rub into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second Leven Rose product that I have tried and once again they only produced the highest in quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using Leven Rose Jojoba and Rosehip oils as my facial moisturizer for the last couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add a little grapefruit oil or frankincense to it, but it&#x27;s wonderful plain too.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil seems to be the trendiest thing right now, the Huffington Post went so far as to call it</li>
            <li> My elbows are even getting soft and smooth - major accomplishment.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried most of the other brands.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, smoother, and more clear than it has been in a long time!</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on my lips, which often tend to be chapped and dry no matter how much emollient I use on them, and they are unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li> Although I have severely dry skin above my lip and it works amazing with keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful amber/orangey color, packaged in the responsible and easy to use amber bottle with dropper vs. the drip top that I hate on other brands.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily as other products and can be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> , they care about their customers and it totally shows :) definitely would recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times but it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my hands, nails, and cuticles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the Rosehip oil has an initial scent that i&#x27;m not as fond of in comparison to the Jojoba, however this scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog</li>
            <li> and it left it soft and frizz free without being oily.</li>
            <li> High quality oil.  </li>
            <li> highly reocomend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Many of the other oils I have tried have a stronger odor that I have to mask, but rosehip oil is almost completely odorless.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the seller contacts you directly to ensure quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll clear my dark spots,  but I haven&#x27;t been able to tell yet.</li>
            <li> I normally use jojoba oil as my carrier.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t have a long term review yet, but really enjoying this product in my essential oils routine</li>
            <li> I am always weary when trying out a new product</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and live in the desert.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a dry oil meaning it soaks into your skin quickly</li>
            <li> I also apply this on my skin once I shower and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and regovated.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so it goes very far.</li>
            <li> After reading about different oils, I specifically chose to go with rosehip because it seemed more of a variant from the other oils I already had.</li>
            <li> Its light application smooths on quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when first purchasing, but this oil has helped to decrease the visibility of fine smile lines on my face (where cheek bones meet eyes)</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of use, I can see a huge improvement around my lips and eyes!</li>
            <li> clear oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil like this before, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I cannot believe how soft it has made my hands and face.</li>
            <li> Not oily and leaves my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and suffer from oily skin, acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I used it in a hair mask with castor oil and argon oil and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell what results she&#x27;ll see from it, but she says that she&#x27;ll keep using it because &amp;#34;it just feels good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just go easy on the drops of oil as a very little WILL go</li>
            <li> It is in a dark colored bottle to help with storage and comes in an easy open bottle.  </li>
            <li> but you can add it to moisturizers or other lotions or spa like recipes!This oil can also be used as a carrier oil with any other essential oil you love, so you can boost the awesomeness in this bottle by adding any EO that suits your need!</li>
            <li> I use it at night to help moisturize my dry skin caused by the hot Texas sun.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now for acne (especially along my chin line and neck), fine lines, and dark spots on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> You may save a few dollars getting your oils elsewhere, but the packaging alone makes this worth it!</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again and forward these new finds to friends and family!</li>
            <li> you are looking for a high quality and well crafted night moisturizer, look no further.</li>
            <li> I didn’t mark it down more because it still seems to work as well as those other oils</li>
            <li> oil is very silky and works wonders on my dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> it really does take only 2-3 drops for my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I received no other compensation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as natural remedy , the continious use smooths, improves, prevents and tones wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, sun burns, insect bites, stretch marks and more.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer on my tough spots (heels, elbows, knees) and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Only soft skin.  </li>
            <li> It really did help with the itching though, especially if I exfoliated really well in the shower and then put a few drops of oil on my burnt areas after towel drying off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old routine once this oil is gone.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am a young male, I still face acne problems</li>
            <li> Organic Rosehip Oil is a natural moisturizer composed by essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins, which makes it a powerful skin regenerator.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Leven Rose.</li>
            <li> I’ve heard it mentioned before as a secret for those who suffer from age spots or uneven skin and even heard it mentioned a few times by celebrities as giving them that flawless skin look.</li>
            <li> After only a few days my face went from dry and flaky to soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> light colored rosehip oil usually mean it&#x27;s a lower quality or refined oil.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have learned that rosehip oil is the only oil that really works for this.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but a few days but really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Looking critically at ingredient lists and product packaging is pretty depressing, especially when I have considerations like fine lines, eczema, and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit of a thick oil, but when you rub it on your skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li> But when your little one is crying and can&#x27;t stop scratching from all the bug bites, that is pretty much all you can think about.</li>
            <li> So far my eyes do look less tired in the morning, and I love that if I put on makeup it doesn&#x27;t just slide off -</li>
            <li> After recently having some skin irritation due to facial products I was using, I decided I needed to try something natural, without all the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Again, the Leven Rose brand had less color and only a faint smell of jojoba.</li>
            <li> husband, who works outside, has been using rosehip oil in his hands and we&#x27;ve noticed that the deep cracking from dry skin is healing nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have actually used this on my lips (which also tend to dry out and crack)</li>
            <li> but my face is already dramatically less oily and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> After only a couple of days, it eliminated a dry skin spot I had on my cheek.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sinks in fast and I feel like I have nothing on my face after a few moments.</li>
            <li> I plan on mixing it with my jojoba oil (that I buy from the same company religiously) and with other oils as well.  </li>
            <li> : I probably should have waited a little longer to review - my face feels so soft after using the oil for a bit.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t been using this oil for long</li>
            <li> It seems like it is helping with my acne because my blemishes are less red and smaller.</li>
            <li> marked this down one star because it seems to be a bit thinner and lighter in color than other rosehip seed oils I have used.</li>
            <li> You only need a little amount so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> I mixed with other oils to make a serum for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> And I use it as part of my daily makeup routine to help with crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes due to the effects of aging.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin after having a facelift.</li>
            <li> This product cured some dry and flaky skin I had around my hands.</li>
            <li> It helps with my dry skin (hands) and I’ve used it on some of my scars too.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin on my face</li>
            <li> Also does wonders for dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I just put about 4-6 drops in my palm and applied to towel damp hair before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> Even though it is oil it works well with my combo skin keeping my dry patches moisturized</li>
            <li> I have not had any breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on my winter time dry cuticles and fingertips.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles don&#x27;t seem so vivid and I have a few dark spots on my face and hands and they have faded some.</li>
            <li> I put one on one hand, the other on the other hand, trying to compare absorption and softness, and I like them equally.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little for whatever you use it for, so the bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I use it mixed with a little bit of moisturizer</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely not into spending hundreds of dollars on a skin care regimen every few months.  </li>
            <li> and if I am careful about application my oily areas do not become any oilier.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops around on my face and then use my finger tips to rub it in well to my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife has started to use a few drops of this oil on her face (especially around her eyes).</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops from each with my facial cream, I also mix it with my hair products (me and my daughter have curly hairs).</li>
            <li> I am not going to lie, I&#x27;ve forgotten a few times but there&#x27;s definitely a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only a teaspoon or so was missing from the bottle</li>
            <li> This is the base for my DIY facial moisturizer, it is extremely important to have a good base</li>
            <li> It has been a supreme performer for all of these purposes at a fraction of the cost I have spent on other products.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my skin is thanking me for it!  </li>
            <li> I will go on to see what other uses I can find for it.</li>
            <li> And a few drops go a really long way.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil seems to absorb quicker then the Jojoba but doesn&#x27;t quite work as well on my extreme face dryness like the Jojoba does.</li>
            <li> so I’m not sure how big of a deal the consistency and coloring</li>
            <li> The oil does not have an overpowering scent and is extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my acne has gone away and my skin is a lot softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have the Jojoba oil (same company) and now the Rosehip oil, and I&#x27;m in trouble!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that over time, it will also diminish my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The dark bottle it comes in also extends shelf</li>
            <li> I use it during the day to help with the dark spots on my arms and hands.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the smell of the oil itself.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the wrinkle reducer as I&#x27;ve been only using it for few days but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have hands down recommended this product to my family and friends of all ages.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have acne-pro skin and at first I was a little skeptical since I have used so many expensive products that did not help my skin at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve also gotten hubby to let me apply it to his acne trouble zones on his face, he has refused all other treatments because he doesn’t like how it feels or didn’t want to smell girly.</li>
            <li> Very little scent and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Seriously, just a couple of drops will cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> I even have oily skin, and somehow it seems like my skin is producing LESS oil than it did before I started treating it with rosehip.  </li>
            <li> have used it for less than a week</li>
            <li> , it makes it less oily looking.</li>
            <li> I seriously noticed a difference the very next morning after using this oil as my moisturizer the night before.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight smell from bottle</li>
            <li> To me it smells slightly (emphasis on slightly) rancid.</li>
            <li> Also, I felt like I&#x27;d spilled half of the bottle on myself but</li>
            <li> I mix a little lavendar with it to help me sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little think</li>
            <li> I waited a little bit to review this product so I would not jump into any biased conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair everyday  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil is packed with antioxidants, fatty acids and vitamins.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops covers my nail bed and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try out the product a few days before posting a review.</li>
            <li> I can feel a difference after a few days&#x27; using.</li>
            <li> It has perfected my skin care routine and does not leave my skin with that heavy oil feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my face, neck, and decollete.</li>
            <li> It’s been a few days since I received my Rosehip oil</li>
            <li> I have read reviews on rose hip oil smelling bad, but this brand has minimal smell, and it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because half of the contents spilled out and it&#x27;s not that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that expensive compared to other skin product.</li>
            <li> was worried about oily residue, but it was a pointless worry.</li>
            <li> This product unfortunately led to breakouts on my face, so I limited use to around my eyes and scalp.</li>
            <li> It helps bring some life to her dull hair.</li>
            <li> i mean that I can put it on in the mornings and it keeps my fingertips moisturized throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I believe it is unscented, but it does have a smell that is a little weird.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick</li>
            <li> Oil has only helped my skin when I thought it would just make it worse!!!</li>
            <li> I am even fond of the very faint scent, and I usually can&#x27;t stand scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does not leave behind an oily feeling at all!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> and I absolutely hate greasy products (like moisturizers, sunscreen lotions, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this oil!!! Smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or clog pores. A little goes a long way and my skin is thanking me for it!  Great company as well, they care about their customers and it totally shows :) definitely would recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin after having a facelift. Especially on my neck. I apply this nightly, and it seems to have alleviated that problem. I will go on to see what other uses I can find for it.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd Leven Rose Oil review, and I LOVE these guys. If you are looking for excellent oils in perfect packaging, look no further! This rosehip oil is great as a moisturizer, and i&#x27;ve been using it to condition my eyelashes and eyebrows to prevent breakage, and it&#x27;s working wonderfully! You may save a few dollars getting your oils elsewhere, but the packaging alone makes this worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Rosehip oil. The oil is light and quickly absorbed. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy and does not clog my pores. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I have tried the Rosehip oil and am happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it and does the trick. It works well in my beard too!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!!! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or clog up pores. A little goes a long way and my skin is looking great! Great company as well, they care about their customers, I definitely would recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. It has improved my skin and nails 100%. This is a product I will use from now on. It&#x27;s really not that expensive compared to other skin product. This product cured some dry and flaky skin I had around my hands. My fiance had some scarring on his face from acne as a teenager and sunspots. After just short time using it you can see a noticeable difference. This product has given my skin a more even tone and has also moisturized and balanced it like nothing else&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, You will love it too.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wife loves the feel and it smells good, not like a lot of other organic oils. Shipping was fast and the seller contacts you directly to ensure quality. Leven Rose is the best!</li>
            <li> All I can say is holy skin softness!! After only a few days my face went from dry and flaky to soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is a great product, light amber color, and it soaks into the skin easily. It helps with my dry skin (hands) and I’ve used it on some of my scars too.</li>
            <li> I use these oils to make a homemade beard oil. Many of the other oils I have tried have a stronger odor that I have to mask, but rosehip oil is almost completely odorless. Leven Rose oils are my personal favorites as well due to the personal touch of the company, the great bottles and the eye dropper makes them much easier to work with than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have only used this oil twice since receiving it on yesterday!  I love how my face feels.  I use it along with a drop of Leven Rose Jojoba oil which I also love....Thank Leven Rose for making these natural oils...Will definitely purchase again and forward these new finds to friends and family!</li>
            <li> The oil is fantastic! I used a couple of drops on my face every night, and it improved my complexion greatly. My skin became more even toned, and it prevented blackheads from forming! My favorite part about the oil is that so much can go a long way. Seriously, just a couple of drops will cover your entire face. Its a great moisturizer and it left my skin glowing and radiant.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil seems to be the trendiest thing right now, the Huffington Post went so far as to call it the &amp;#34;new coconut oil&amp;#34;.  With all the buzz, I had to try it!  I don&#x27;t have the loveliest complexion right now-- the medicines I take cause frequent breakouts no matter how diligent I am keeping my face clean.  I&#x27;ve been trying this oil to see if it would soothe some of the turmoil, and so far I&#x27;m satisfied that it delivers!  I even have oily skin, and somehow it seems like my skin is producing LESS oil than it did before I started treating it with rosehip.  Go figure that one!  It may take me a few more days to see what this oil is fully capable of but so far I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite beauty supplement!</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the oil. It works great on my beard. I believe it is unscented, but it does have a smell that is a little weird. Personally, this would keep me from buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Leven Rose products so I was excited for the Rosehip oil to arrive. I intended to use this as a moisturizer for my face, however, I seem to be make better use tackling my extremely dry hands, lips, feet and hair. Leaves my skin feeling super soft and my hair shiny and manageable. And a few drops go a really long way. If you love her other oils, I have no doubt you will love this one too.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I use this on my hair everyday  and it strength my hair and gives it shine. I also apply this on my skin once I shower and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and regovated. I been noticing that some scar marking that I had has been disappearing. I like that fact that it&#x27;s  100 percent pure organic and unrefined. Definitely restocking</li>
            <li> First, I have to say, what beautiful packaging. I love the color and label is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Very clear oil. No cloudiness whatsover, and virtually no scent! I am starting to age and this absorbed into my fine lines perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about oily residue, but it was a pointless worry. Absorbed well, and just feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have a surgery scar on my neck and am looking forward to come back with results.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick so I only use a couple drops.  I mix it with my MSM cream and put it on before I go to bed.  I plan on mixing it with my jojoba oil (that I buy from the same company religiously) and with other oils as well.  Love Leven Rose!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for everything...and love it!  I remove my eye makeup with it, moisturize my face and body, apply to my hair sparingly for deep conditioning and as needed for fly aways/frizz.</li>
            <li> I love what it&#x27;s doing for my complexion.  I&#x27;m 48 and am starting to notice some fine lines and wrinkles.  I believe skin care should be simple and effective...and I&#x27;m definitely not into spending hundreds of dollars on a skin care regimen every few months.  I get compliments on my skin all the time.  It glows.  And, yes, it is helping to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. This has no smell, which I prefer.  Sometimes I add a little grapefruit oil or frankincense to it, but it&#x27;s wonderful plain too.</li>
            <li> Yes I know this oil is great for so many more things than just bug bites. But when your little one is crying and can&#x27;t stop scratching from all the bug bites, that is pretty much all you can think about. I applied a drop of Rosehip oil to each bite, it soothed the itching and reduced the redness. He was able to relax and go to sleep. If that was all this oil did, I would be happy. Everything else is an added bonus. It is a great moisturizer and helps fade fine lines. It is a bit of a thick oil, but when you rub it on your skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue. It is also great for moisturizing sun burns and I use it in conjunction with aloe for sun burn relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount coupon in exchanged for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I think Leven Rose is absolutely the best! I had another brand and compared the two - Leven Rose is far more superior in texture and richness! I will never buy another brand of rosehip oil. This is the base for my DIY facial moisturizer, it is extremely important to have a good base so I can put my best face forward!</li>
            <li> So far so good!.. Amazing Price for stellar product.. Look at labels ! don&#x27;t be fooled by all the additives the expensive brands use to try to stretch the product and to charge more money..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leven Rose is my family&#x27;s go to brand !</li>
            <li> I like to put this on my hair, blemishes and fever blister. Heals my skin quickly without any strong smell. Also, it helped to gently remove hair dye from my forehead!</li>
            <li> The Leven Rosehip Oil has become one of my favorite morning and night time moisturizers. It leaves my skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy. It also seems to have soften my forehead &amp;#34;squinting&amp;#34; crease. It&#x27;s only been two weeks of use and I&#x27;m really liking the results. I&#x27;m hoping that over time, it will also diminish my dark spots.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! My face feels and looks so good since I started using this. I even use it to fade acne scars on my back. I have read reviews on rose hip oil smelling bad, but this brand has minimal smell, and it isn&#x27;t bad at all. The company even contacted me personally to make sure I liked it and answered questions that I had. I will continue to use this product, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil like this before, and I was pleasantly surprised. I put some on my face, and it seems to have done a nice job moisturizing. I am even fond of the very faint scent, and I usually can&#x27;t stand scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is a huge fan of their beard oil, so he tried this oil on his hands. He also really liked it as a moisturizer - he confessed he has occasionally rubbed the beard oil on his hands because he likes it so much, so he&#x27;s glad to have another option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I probably should have waited a little longer to review - my face feels so soft after using the oil for a bit. I&#x27;m pretty impressed at how non-oily this oil is, if that makes sense. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m all greasy after I use it, it rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> Leven Rose is a great company with great products (I also use their jojoba oil). The rose hip oil is good for my face. You only need a little amount so it should last awhile. I mix it with the jojoba oil and essential oils for my face daily.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve only used a few times but it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it is!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was suggested that it helps with fine lines.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for several days now and have definitely noticed an improvement.  This product works great!  Plus, it&#x27;s 100% pure organic and unrefined!  I highly suggest this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil; I have used the jojoba and emu oils of this brand as well and this one is my new favorite!  I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now for acne (especially along my chin line and neck), fine lines, and dark spots on my cheeks.  It has been a supreme performer for all of these purposes at a fraction of the cost I have spent on other products.  I have not found anything else that clears my face up as quickly as this.  Additionally, my face looks radiant and younger.  This has really simplified my beauty routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also impressed with the personal customer service from this company!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Leven Rose.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect but had been reading that rose hip oil is great for skin. I have really dry skin on my face and I love how this moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for less than a week and I cannot believe how soft it has made my hands and face. I am now using it as my facial moisturizer both night and day. It even works great under make-up. I have also been using it on my lips, which often tend to be chapped and dry no matter how much emollient I use on them, and they are unbelievably smooth. My elbows are even getting soft and smooth - major accomplishment. I will definitely  be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Leven Rose Rosehip Oil is the handiest oil in my bathroom cabinet. My boys use it on blemishes every time one pops up. I use it on my stretch marks (they are fading!). I use it more on my face to chase away those little fine lines around my eyes. It only takes a little for whatever you use it for, so the bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great rosehip oil. I like that it is not as strong in the smell that most resehip oils I tried, and also it is more clear. I use it mixed with a little bit of moisturizer ( most oils need moisturizer or damp skin to sink in or they will just stay on the surface of your face), and it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product Leven has made here.  I use this as a carrier oil for some of my essential oil facial blends.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I use it as a moisturizer on my tough spots (heels, elbows, knees) and have been pleased with the results.  I have also used this on my nail and cuticles to make them stronger.  Very pleased with this oil.  The oil is absorbed very quickly into the skin and there are no signs of a greasy residue.  Only soft skin.  Great product.  Love that it comes in a dropper to avoid any skin contamination.  A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have enjoyed using it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is packed with antioxidants, fatty acids and vitamins. I’ve heard it mentioned before as a secret for those who suffer from age spots or uneven skin and even heard it mentioned a few times by celebrities as giving them that flawless skin look. It also contains lycopene which fights premature aging! Pretty much, acne, scars, and wrinkles are no match for this stuff so start treating the areas you hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dry oil meaning it soaks into your skin quickly and it does not leave behind an oily feeling at all! I love this as I don’t like to have any sort of oily feeling when it comes to my face. You can treat sunburns, dehydrated skin or damaged skin with this also with great results. I used this straight from the bottle but you can add it to moisturizers or other lotions or spa like recipes!This oil can also be used as a carrier oil with any other essential oil you love, so you can boost the awesomeness in this bottle by adding any EO that suits your need! I can think of some pretty awesome pairings, keep this oil in mind. The dark bottle it comes in also extends shelf life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have brittle nails or cuticles that need some help this oil is also great for that! I myself seem to have issues with my cuticles and the area surrounding my nails every time the seasons change. Applying this oil gave relief pretty much over night. I just learned this trick so I’ll be doing it every time the issue presents itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve also gotten hubby to let me apply it to his acne trouble zones on his face, he has refused all other treatments because he doesn’t like how it feels or didn’t want to smell girly. This however got the go ahead from him because the scent is so mild when applied on it’s own and as I said before it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything this company has to offer and their rosehip oil just rocks, I’m sure their other products are just as great! Can I just add real quick that although the packaging and labeling has absolutely nothing to do with how the product works, I kind of adore the pink label!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**hat although the packaging and labeling has absolutely nothing to do with how the product works, I kind of adore the pink label!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review.

            <li> This pure rosehip oil feels nice on my face and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have oily skin and this rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel more oily of greasy after using it. It absorbs okay into my skin it just takes some time for it to fully absorb. It seems like it is helping with my acne because my blemishes are less red and smaller. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot when you put it on your face. I use it on my hair as well and it makes my hair soft and gives it a healthy look. I have an oily scalp and this rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair oil or greasy. Also it seems to be having with my dandruff flakes and with the itchiness of my scalp. I got this rosehip oil for free to review.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff!  Great for dry skin.  I added some essential oils and use it as a moisturizer.  Also does wonders for dry hands and feet.  High quality oil.  Definitely buying from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I have recently switched to moisturizing my face with oil. I have very dry skin and have learned that rosehip oil is the only oil that really works for this. This brand is wonderful and smells much better than the other brand I was using. It leaves my skin soft and fresh. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I have purchased from Leven Rose in the past and am not disappointed with this product. I am big on Oil Cleansing my face and this is great for that, along with removing makeup and acting as a moisturizer. Very light, absorbs quickly, and I do not notice a scent. It arrived in a nice glass bottle with a dropper. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when first purchasing, but this oil has helped to decrease the visibility of fine smile lines on my face (where cheek bones meet eyes) I have shared it with my friends and family because I am honestly blown away! Will continue to use FOREVER!</li>
            <li> This oil is really awesome. I find it evens out your skin tone and for me, a guy with oily skin, it makes it less oily looking. Go figure lol</li>
            <li> Super oil. Really helping scares from two hip surgeries in 30 days. Also eye puffiness, diminished that a lot. Love it since it is a dry oil.</li>
            <li> Smooth, light oil. It would be better with a light rose scent.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Received The Product For Free or DISCOUNT In Exchange For Review&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Rosehip Oil for a week or so. I love the way it works the way it says it will. I use it as a moisturizer at night and I put it on my whole face in the morning. I have noticed that it is evening my skin tone and taking away my lines and wrinkles. My skin feels so much better and I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li> The Leven Rosehip Oil has been a fabulous addition to my skincare regime.  I use it mainly for my hands, nails, and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very silky and works wonders on my dry, cracked skin.  I like to use it at night right before bedtime. Just a few drops covers my nail bed and cuticles.  I gently rub it in and let it absorb overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased that the only ingredient is cold-pressed rosehip oil. No additives. I am much more comfortable with natural products.&lt;br /&gt;I have actually used this on my lips (which also tend to dry out and crack) a couple of times. It&#x27;s a good way to keep lips supple. Just go easy on the drops of oil as a very little WILL go a long way!&lt;br /&gt;My husband, who works outside, has been using rosehip oil in his hands and we&#x27;ve noticed that the deep cracking from dry skin is healing nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Leven Rosehip Oil for the purpose of review. I received no other compensation. All opinions are my own and based on my own use of and experience with the item.</li>
            <li> This is a great Rosehip Seed Oil! I noticed it absorbed right away and smoothed out my skin! The seller as also very caring SO I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. It&#x27;s a great Rosehip Seed Oil. I mixed with other oils to make a serum for my face and neck. I&#x27;m so happy with the results. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use this as my body lotion and noticed that my skin would stay moisturized for hours. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use Leven Roses&#x27; Jojoba Oil and gave this oil a try. I find that they are very different. The Rosehip Oil has a bit thicker feeling consistency then the Jojoba Oil. I use Jojoba for all over face mositizer and eye makeup remover. The Rosehip oil seems to absorb quicker then the Jojoba but doesn&#x27;t quite work as well on my extreme face dryness like the Jojoba does. Also, the Rosehip oil has an initial scent that i&#x27;m not as fond of in comparison to the Jojoba, however this scent fades quickly. I did however LOVE this oil for night use on my face and under eyes and LOVED it for my hair. I just put about 4-6 drops in my palm and applied to towel damp hair before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but a few days but really like it so far.  Will add more to my review later on.</li>
            <li> This is my second Leven Rose product that I have tried and once again they only produced the highest in quality. This oil is free of added junk. It is great for dry skin. It absorbs quickly. I recommend this for anyone looking at Rosehip oils.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying rosehip oil so in all fairness, the three stars come more from a let down of my own expectations about this product.  After reading about different oils, I specifically chose to go with rosehip because it seemed more of a variant from the other oils I already had. I read that rosehip is usually yellow/orange/amber in color with a light scent that most people tend to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;. The oil I received is very light in color and smells to me exactly like vitamin E or sunflower oil. It&#x27;s supposed to be unrefined but according to what I&#x27;ve been able to read...light colored rosehip oil usually mean it&#x27;s a lower quality or refined oil. I also purchased their jojoba oil and compared it to a bottle I have from another brand. Again, the Leven Rose brand had less color and only a faint smell of jojoba. The price of the oils were significantly discounted which would&#x27;ve been a plus, but I&#x27;m more concerned with finding a quality organic product than the best buy. Again, without being an expert, I&#x27;m simply going to go with my gut on this one and won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog and I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it at night as a moisturizer and my skin has never looked better! I thought it would cause breakouts since it is an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t! Very little scent and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied. I used this after using a dermaroller on my face and neck.it healed overnight and I saw beautiful results the next morning! This is high quality oil that I would surely recommend! :)</li>
            <li> I received this rosehip oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. I have taken to using rosehip seed oil as my daily facial moisturizer instead of lotions. Even though it is oil it works well with my combo skin keeping my dry patches moisturized and if I am careful about application my oily areas do not become any oilier. I put a few drops around on my face and then use my finger tips to rub it in well to my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked this down one star because it seems to be a bit thinner and lighter in color than other rosehip seed oils I have used. I didn’t mark it down more because it still seems to work as well as those other oils so I’m not sure how big of a deal the consistency and coloring is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this oil as a moisturizer after getting sunburned. I am not giving medical advice at all and you should always use your best judgement and consult your doctor when necessary. Personally I burn very easy and I never tan. I made sure to wash well and used aloe at first, but then switched to this oil to help keep my skin moisturized and heal. Moisturizing well really helps when you are going through the itching and peeling stages, though you will still peel nothing can stop that. It really did help with the itching though, especially if I exfoliated really well in the shower and then put a few drops of oil on my burnt areas after towel drying off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!  I seriously noticed a difference the very next morning after using this oil as my moisturizer the night before.  My skin had a more even tone, was supple and had a dewy look.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever be without this product.  The communication from the seller (Frances) from the time I ordered until I received the product was great.  She truly cares about the customer and how this product works for you.  I have hands down recommended this product to my family and friends of all ages.  Thank you Leven Rose and Frances :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love it! Using with Jojoba oil and Tamanu oil as a facial cleanser for my acne. Works great so far. Very Happy with quality of product.</li>
            <li> Am currently using the Leven Rose Rosehip Oil for many different applications.  I use it at night to help moisturize my dry skin caused by the hot Texas sun.  I use it during the day to help with the dark spots on my arms and hands.  And I use it as part of my daily makeup routine to help with crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes due to the effects of aging.  This product has a shelf life of 6 months from the purchase date.  It is in a dark colored bottle to help with storage and comes in an easy open bottle.  It comes with an eye dropper to help you use it sparingly to get the most out of the product.  It&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic &amp; Unrefined Rosehip Oil.  Can be used for healthier hair and softer skin.  PLEASE NOTE: I have received this product for free for testing and review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil. I have added a few drops of my favorite essential oils and this has been amazing on my skin. Not oily and leaves my skin amazingly soft. Plus does not cause breakouts on my acne prone skin! I will definitely be buying again!! I also use their Jojoba oil which is also amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil.  No offensive odor and absorbs readily into my skin.  Seems to be doing a good job of minimizing the fine age lines on my face.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received Leven Rose Products from my husband for Christmas, him really not knowing what to order, so proud of his effort, because it sure payed off, so hooked on her products, good quality, smooth skin and mixes well with my essential oils..My new, now go to Company for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair and skin thanks you for this absolutely wonderful product.  I will continue to buy this.  I have skin allergies and this product does not bother my skin one bit.  Excited to see what else you will create for us with oils.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I gave it to my GF and she loves it. She says that she uses is all over her body and that it leaves the skin smooth and moisturized right away. It is weightless, not greasy at all, and leaves no smell... Perfect moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service from Leven Rose is always great!</li>
            <li> i have been using it to moisturize my face at night and I honestly think that it is actually helping clear my blemishes.</li>
            <li> Good product. You can feel moisturizing effect as soon as you apply it to scars!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase from Leven Rose and once again I am very pleased! I wanted to try out the product a few days before posting a review. I have been using the Leven Rose organic rosehip oil as a night time moisturizer after apply my home made toner made from witch hazel, rose hydrosol and glycerin. Love the way my face feels in the morning! Not sure which I like best between the rosehip and jojoba. I just ordered the pomegranate oil and I&#x27;m sure it will just as amazing as the others! Thank you Leven Rose for these wonderful oils!</li>
            <li> Amazing product - feels great on your skin. Does not leave you with the feel of being oily but rather moisturized. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and already notice a difference!</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff! I use it in all my home made beauty products!</li>
            <li> Product is Wonderful!!  Is scentless and it soaked into my skin right away.  it really does take only 2-3 drops for my entire face.  I purchased because I wanted to use it on my face and to use it in my homemade lotions and cosmetics and it&#x27;s just what I wanted.  I also have purchased other oils from this seller and have been very happy with those also.  The price, quality and quanity are all very good.  I would recommend anyone purchase this oil!</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t been using this oil for long but it seems okay. It&#x27;s thick,  but having used Keven Rose products before it doesn&#x27;t really bother me,  but the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I initially thought. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll clear my dark spots,  but I haven&#x27;t been able to tell yet. Although I have severely dry skin above my lip and it works amazing with keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I can feel a difference after a few days&#x27; using. My skin is soft, supple and bright. It is not oily as other products and can be absorbed quickly. The smell tells it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> This product unfortunately led to breakouts on my face, so I limited use to around my eyes and scalp. For those needs, this works really well. I use Leven Rose Jojoba for my face as it cleanses and moisturizes. I do like it and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and suffer from oily skin, acne and acne scars. I also bleach my hair monthly so I needed something for my skin and hair. I just received the rose hip oil 2 days ago and I&#x27;m already seeing huge results. I used it in a hair mask with castor oil and argon oil and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was afterwards. I also put it in my hair after blow drying it and it left it soft and frizz free without being oily. I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times on my face and am hooked already. Having oily skin made me nervous about adding oil on my face but my face is already dramatically less oily and feels so soft. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results I get with more time.</li>
            <li> I have found myself in love with Leven Rose Rosehip oil for my sensitive skin. I am always weary when trying out a new product and now I have my go-to for my skin woes. The oil does not have an overpowering scent and is extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this rosehip oil works great with my skin and stays close to my bathroom sink so I can use it nightly. All it takes is a couple of drops to my skin and the oil is quickly absorbed(Score for no oily/shiny skin).</li>
            <li> After recently having some skin irritation due to facial products I was using, I decided I needed to try something natural, without all the chemicals.  I have been using Leven Rose Jojoba and Rosehip oils as my facial moisturizer for the last couple of weeks and I swear my skin has never looked better.  I switched to natural soap and an apple cider vinegar toner and those changes paired with these oils has made an amazing difference! I would absolutely recommend this product and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Organic Rosehip Oil is a natural moisturizer composed by essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins, which makes it a powerful skin regenerator. Highly recommended as natural remedy , the continious use smooths, improves, prevents and tones wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, sun burns, insect bites, stretch marks and more. Leaves no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I had the opportunity to review this product. I have used it for a few weeks now and can really tell a big difference in how my face looks and feels. My wrinkles don&#x27;t seem so vivid and I have a few dark spots on my face and hands and they have faded some. I will definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> My skin loves Leven Rose Rosehip Oil! Drinks it in quickly and my skin feels great! I love that it&#x27;s a dry oil so it absorbs quickly. My husband has started to use it as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best rose hip oil I have ever used. So silky and absorbs quickly. Love it.</li>
            <li> Discounted product --- absolutely love the way it makes my face feel! Awesome product! Will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li> This works great in my daughters dry hair. It helps bring some life to her dull hair. I have used it on my face at night as well. I have not had any breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry when I wake up. There is a slight smell from bottle but it doesn&#x27;t remain once on skin. I love that there isn&#x27;t any extra chemicals and it works.  **Received a sample for testing.**</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the oil itself, it works well with my combination skin. Its light application smooths on quickly and a little goes a long way. The only caveat is the bottle, hence the 4 stars. The container doesn&#x27;t close well and multiple times it opened and it leaked all over the place. I am disappointed because half of the contents spilled out and it&#x27;s not that much. So be careful, but enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my face at night. I mix a little lavendar with it to help me sleep. I am happy with the product. I&#x27;ve eliminated commercial store bought moisturizer from my routine completely.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the smell of the oil itself. To me it smells slightly (emphasis on slightly) rancid. I have however never purchased rose oil before. I normally use jojoba oil as my carrier. Got a good deal on this and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old routine once this oil is gone.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Delivery was fast and product came as advertised.  Very moisturizing and absorbs quickly. I just started using the product so don&#x27;t have a long term review yet, but really enjoying this product in my essential oils routine</li>
            <li> this rosehip oil is amazing it is great on my skin and hair. I have bought many product by Leven Rose and they always ships in a DARK glass bottle which help protect the properties of the oil. This company hands down has great price and high quality product. highly reocomend.</li>
            <li> My wife has started to use a few drops of this oil on her face (especially around her eyes). She has very sensitive skin and she tells me that this oil feels really good and does not leave an oily residue and it does not break out her skin in any way. It&#x27;s too early to tell what results she&#x27;ll see from it, but she says that she&#x27;ll keep using it because &amp;#34;it just feels good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. Not sure about the wrinkle reducer as I&#x27;ve been only using it for few days but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I love the Levin Rose beard oil and this is another great product from Leven Rose... It&#x27;s a little think so my wife and I use it at night.. The product does what it says... I&#x27;d definitely recommend it..</li>
            <li> An amazing product! It has perfected my skin care routine and does not leave my skin with that heavy oil feeling. My skin is softer, smoother, and more clear than it has been in a long time!</li>
            <li> Seller was amazing. Shipped right away and came as described. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have never used this oil before, but after even the first use, my face felt softer and after four uses, I can already see a difference in the fine lines around my lips (smile lines). The seller has been so sweet and contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase, which was pleasantly unexpected! The coconut oil I had used previously left my face feeling a bit greasy (not purchased through this company, just fyi) and the rosehip oil blends in so nicely and there is no residue from it. I will absolutely be ordering more! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on my winter time dry cuticles and fingertips.  I like the ways that it stays in place.  By that i mean that I can put it on in the mornings and it keeps my fingertips moisturized throughout the day.  It lasts through several hand washings.  Also, a little bit goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t even take a drop per finger.  All I do is touch the dropper to each fingernail leaving maybe a 1/4 drop on each and then massage it in.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I waited a little bit to review this product so I would not jump into any biased conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Brief background&lt;br /&gt;I am a young male, I still face acne problems and I absolutely hate greasy products (like moisturizers, sunscreen lotions, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I use the Leven Rose 100% Organic Beard Oil on a daily basis and it does wonders for me, so I decided to try this Rosehip Oil to see what it could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Why I LIKED THIS rosehip oil&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way. I use about 3 drops to moisturize my entire face. This means saving money, and I like that!&lt;br /&gt;- It is an oil, but it is definitely not greasy (it blew my mind, honestly)!&lt;br /&gt;- Maybe the most important aspect: IT WORKS! After only a couple of days, it eliminated a dry skin spot I had on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;- I can use as an aftershave or after using a facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;- It is exotic. C&#x27;mon, the roses are cultivated in the mountains of Chile!!! That is pretty awesome :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Verdict&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a high quality and well crafted night moisturizer, look no further. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;And rest assured: if you happen to have any problems with your product, Leven Rose has one of the best customer services I have seen. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Love all the leven rose products!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face for about two months now and I just love it! I have oily skin and live in the desert. Oil has only helped my skin when I thought it would just make it worse!!! It sinks in fast and I feel like I have nothing on my face after a few moments. I LOVE this because I can have one (beautiful) bottle for both face and eyes....or anywhere else for that matter. I appreciate that it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff helps with any redness and keeps my skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> This is the first oil I have bought that did not bother me in some way.  It is lovely and sinks in quickly.  I have many allergies and this does not bother them.  The bottle with the stopper is a nice way to use the oil. Nice to have a pure product.</li>
            <li> Love this in a skin blend I just did.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this oil! I was already using the Leven Rose Jojoba Oil (also fantastic) when Frances asked me to try the Rosehip Oil. I use this everyday on my face, neck, and decollete. After only a few weeks of use, I can see a huge improvement around my lips and eyes! I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle today so I may never run out!</li>
            <li> Use this after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is the smoothest! Leven Rose makes the highest quality products I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried most of the other brands. This oil totally smooths out my wrinkles- it is super rich and I can feel the difference instantly. My friends say my complexion never looked better. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It’s been a few days since I received my Rosehip oil and I am already loving it. Unfortunately, I have acne-pro skin and at first I was a little skeptical since I have used so many expensive products that did not help my skin at all. I have been using the jojoba oil for a few weeks and now the rosehip oil, they are both great! I am not sure which one I love the most. What I am surprise is that I have not break out since I started using these oils. On the other hand, my acne has gone away and my skin is a lot softer.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe I am putting oil on my face!! This show the excellent quality of these products and I hope they never stop making them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Leven Rose!!!</li>
            <li> I have the Jojoba oil (same company) and now the Rosehip oil, and I&#x27;m in trouble! I don&#x27;t know which one I like more! I put one on one hand, the other on the other hand, trying to compare absorption and softness, and I like them equally. So... I use them both. I mix a few drops from each with my facial cream, I also mix it with my hair products (me and my daughter have curly hairs). I just love the soft feel. I would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid endocrine disrupting ingredients like parabens and plasticizers in my hair and skin products, knowing how well our skin can absorb them.  Looking critically at ingredient lists and product packaging is pretty depressing, especially when I have considerations like fine lines, eczema, and sensitive skin.  Enter Rosehip Oil to save the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another brand as you will see in the photo I&#x27;m adding.  It was inexpensive and I was trying different oil combinations, but when I got this bottle to compare the two I regretted the expense.  Leven Rose&#x27;s Rosehip oil is clearly much better quality, and is what Rosehip oil should look and feel like.  It is a beautiful amber/orangey color, packaged in the responsible and easy to use amber bottle with dropper vs. the drip top that I hate on other brands.  What I really love most about this oil is the texture.  The oil itself feels rich and somewhat more viscous than I anticipated, but once applied it absorbs instantly with no greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the oil neat on my wrinkles at night, so undereye/tiny bit between brows/smile lines.  The fatty acids linoleic, linolenic, oleic, and palmitic are excellent for dry wrinkles and dehydrated skin.  I also used it in a recipe for an eye cream blended with jojoba, apricot kernel, beeswax, and carrot seed oil.  So far my eyes do look less tired in the morning, and I love that if I put on makeup it doesn&#x27;t just slide off - the oil really does seem to vanish into the skin and plump it up.</li>
            <li> This brand is great. I found this brand at Amazon on September 2014. I never looked back! Their products are absolutely amazing and are top notch.  Frances emails you to see how it&#x27;s going and gives tips on how to use the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Rosehip Oil for my scar. I read it lightens the scar and softens the scar tissue. It really does! I notice my scar is a bit softer and lighter. You&#x27;re supposed to use it twice a day for 6 weeks to show some improvement. I am not going to lie, I&#x27;ve forgotten a few times but there&#x27;s definitely a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil isn&#x27;t too oily and it absorbs really fast. You don&#x27;t need much to rub into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really glad to find this oil and this company!</li>
            <li> I was laying down on the couch and using the dropper when I accidentally spilled the bottle on my pajamas, rubbed most of the spill into my skin, dropped my &#x27;rose hip oil pajamas&#x27; on the floor to change into new ones and my male miniature pinscher puppy came along and rolled in my pjs and then took a nap on them -- I was surprised and charmed and his coat is looking lovely! Delightful product and wonderful memory for me. Also, I felt like I&#x27;d spilled half of the bottle on myself but only a teaspoon or so was missing from the bottle so it goes very far. I purchased this to use on my over sensitive skin, absorbs beautifully and left my skin feeling great, wonderful product!</li>
