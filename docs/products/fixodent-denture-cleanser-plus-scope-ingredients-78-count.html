            <li>This is my husbands favorite denture tab.  </li>

            <li>Amazon for a lower price on Subscribe &amp; Save and get free shipping to boot?</li>
            <li>Great for keeping your dentures white!</li>
            <li>My order was received within a few days and boxes were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Keeps them fresh and works much better than soap and water, which is what I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone else who has one knows they aren&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I buy these because they are cheap.  </li>
            <li>I had first received this brand from my dentist and was pleased...</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my retainers and they are cleaner after using this product vs others.</li>
            <li>So my dentist recommended that I buy a denture cleaner for my Invisalign trays.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I could just clean them up with a toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;The degree of dirtyness and grossness</li>
            <li>I got this product to clean my gemstones in the jewelry.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to clean anything else with it, so I can&#x27;t say anything on that.</li>
            <li>A full tablet didn&#x27;t fully dissolve in my retainer case anyway.</li>
            <li>It wakes up my mouth every morning &amp; keeps it fresh until lunch.</li>
            <li>Leaves dentures tasting fresh Recommend to everyone</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty useful; the retainers come out cleaner than when cleansed with just water.</li>
            <li>Despite the prevalence of Efferdent and Polident, I find that Fixodent, hard to find in some of the major store chains, does the best job of cleaning my dentures.</li>
            <li>every night after work, I would pour some hot water in a cup and a one Fixodent tablet with my trays.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I will order some more next time</li>
            <li>I will stick with Efferdent which cleans my upper dentures so much better and feel cleaner than when I use the Fixodent.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>This is the first product of it</li>
            <li>If you wear a night guard, dentures or some other kind of mouthpiece, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Before I was utterly grossed out by my night guard and tried everything to get it clean!</li>
            <li>Fixodent is clear and fresh, just what I want.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely worked when the plastic began to get cloudy.</li>
            <li>Works very well for cleaning</li>
            <li>Good products at reasonable costs mean a lot to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with its ability to cleanse my dentures completely with little effort</li>
            <li>I like this brand cleaner because it cleans better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>This apparently works significantly better then them, and is the only one we use now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Fixodent Cleanser with Scope.</li>
            <li>Does not dissolve in the water so smooth like other leading products...</li>
            <li>This is what my dentist recommended for my new dentures.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product specifically to clean mine and my husband&#x27;s invisalign retainers, based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>Anything out of the ordinary, don&#x27;t like going to a dozen different places to find what you want, and like everyone else if you want to save money go the easy route - choose Amazon for all your shopping.  </li>
            <li>I initially hestitated to buy this brand because it cost a little more than other comparable brands.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it hardly fizzes at all, but so far as I can tell it cleans better than any other them.</li>
            <li>I also love the subscribe and save, this is always the one thing I forget at the store, no more!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are sooo much better than name brand/generic. I use this to clean my retainers and they are cleaner after using this product vs others.</li>
            <li> This is what my dentist recommended for my new dentures.  Amazon is the only place I can seem to find it and at a great bargain as well.  Anything out of the ordinary, don&#x27;t like going to a dozen different places to find what you want, and like everyone else if you want to save money go the easy route - choose Amazon for all your shopping.  I did and my family loves it!!!  Amazon you are the best at bringing the products we want to us.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I initially hestitated to buy this brand because it cost a little more than other comparable brands.  I wear a night guard every night when I go to bed and I soak it in Fixodent during the day.  I used to use Efferdent but it would stain both my guard and the plastic container it comes in blue.  Fixodent is clear and fresh, just what I want.  I&#x27;ve purchased the 78 count box, which I have set up to automatically ship to me every 2 months.  If you wear a night guard, dentures or some other kind of mouthpiece, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> We both use this product....it&#x27;s a good one, better than others I believe because of the added Scope mouthwash. This is one of those routine products you have to buy just about every month. Why not just purchase @ Amazon for a lower price on Subscribe &amp; Save and get free shipping to boot? Simple!</li>
            <li> If you are unfortunate and must wear dentures I highly recommend Fixodent Cleanser with Scope. It cleans thoroughly. It wakes up my mouth every morning &amp; keeps it fresh until lunch.</li>
            <li> My wife prefers it to other brands but I believe that Proctor &amp; Gamble is no longer making it.</li>
            <li> When at the dentist one day they soaked my partial and when given back noticed a stain that I had been unable to get rid of was gone and it tasted great.  This is the product that they used.  I began having trouble finding this but finally found in Walgreens.  The Walgreens that I have been shopping in no longer carries it, don&#x27;t know about others.  So what did I do?  Went to my computer and pulled up Amazon, as they have everything including stuff you can&#x27;t find anywhere else.  This product is better then the one&#x27;s advertised that everyone knows the name.  It works better than fantastic and the scope included in the tablet gives it a great after taste.</li>
            <li> It cleans my dentures great. Removes stains and I am a coffee drinker.  Leaves dentures tasting fresh Recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> Would give it a five if cheaper, but I use it a couple of times a week and then the rest of the time use a cheaper product... extends the use.  But, hard to find and Amazon has it.  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I had first received this brand from my dentist and was pleased...but when I received this shipment the packaging was terrible.  The packets were not perforated and I had to use a sissors to get them apart.  Wouldn&#x27;t order from this source again... they looked like they had been around for some time.</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE AS GOOD AS POLIDENT. PACKAGING FOR TABLETS IS POOR IN COMPARISION. WOULD BUY AGAIN ONLY IF ON SALE AT A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. She had previously used efferdent and stainaway, and didn&#x27;t care for either of them. This apparently works significantly better then them, and is the only one we use now. Also recommend [[ASIN:B004PBHAQC Brush Buddies Denture Bath, Colors May Vary]] to use with it.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your dentures white!</li>
            <li> Could not find this product in stores anywhere.  My order was received within a few days and boxes were in perfect condition. I love this cleaner, as opposed to others on the market. There is no after taste and it does a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not as happy with these as the Polydent.  They dont &amp;#34;SIZZLE ENOUGH&amp;#34;.  Just very little bubbling.  Can&#x27;t even tell its doing anything.  Will not buy again.  Do they work?  Yeah, I guess they do.  They smell good.  But after soaking anything in perfumed water it would smell good.  I don&#x27;t think they clean as it good as the polydent ones.  You put in a Polydent and it looks like a volcano is erupting.</li>
            <li> Good product - cleans dentures better than competitive products</li>
            <li> This product does a great job.  Even if you&#x27;re only soaking for approx. 20-minutes.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the advice of my dentist for a night time bite guard for teeth grinding.  Easy to use for cleaning - just \\&quot;set it and forget it\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I use this to soak my retainers (which are the invisaline-like plastic, not metal). It does a great job of removing stains and freshening them up.</li>
            <li> So my dentist recommended that I buy a denture cleaner for my Invisalign trays.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I could just clean them up with a toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;The degree of dirtyness and grossness became unbearable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So every night after work, I would pour some hot water in a cup and a one Fixodent tablet with my trays.&lt;br /&gt;Just for about 2-3 hours until I&#x27;m done eating dinner and taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans (and hopefully disinfects some) so well, my trays are looking beautiful after all!</li>
            <li> I got these for my mom who is a heavy coffee drinker. The coffee has stained her dentures quite a bit. I used every tablet in the box until none were left and mom&#x27;s dentures still look as stained as always.</li>
            <li> I bought this product specifically to clean mine and my husband&#x27;s invisalign retainers, based on other reviews. It absolutely worked when the plastic began to get cloudy.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipper.</li>
            <li> very good I always stick to this product thanks</li>
            <li> Got them to cleanse retainers. They&#x27;re pretty useful; the retainers come out cleaner than when cleansed with just water. Doesn&#x27;t remove the yellow spots, though. Don&#x27;t know what can.</li>
            <li> Good and all things considered the price is not eccesive for the type of product recieved.  Good products at reasonable costs mean a lot to me.</li>
            <li> This was truly a natural selection for cleansing since I was so happy with their adhesive cream  I&#x27;m very pleased with its ability to cleanse my dentures completely with little effort</li>
            <li> I use this for my retainer and night guard. Keeps them fresh and works much better than soap and water, which is what I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also just use half a tablet if you don&#x27;t want to have to buy these as often, and it works just as well in my experience. A full tablet didn&#x27;t fully dissolve in my retainer case anyway.</li>
            <li> Fixodent doesn&#x27;t have a hyperactive fizz like some of the others. In fact, it hardly fizzes at all, but so far as I can tell it cleans better than any other them.</li>
            <li> Better than the Polident I used to use. Very pleased with this product, have it now on &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34;. Has a nice fresh feeling after soaking overnight.</li>
            <li> I will order some more next time</li>
            <li> i love this brand.does a great job cleaning. to bad i can&#x27;t find it close to me.i have no problem ordering it on line</li>
            <li> Great purchase and fast delivery!!!  Will buy again when I run out.  Great price and exactly as described. I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> have used several different national advertised brands and this brand meets all required standards.  good product with a good price.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try Fixodent but dislike it greatly.  I will stick with Efferdent which cleans my upper dentures so much better and feel cleaner than when I use the Fixodent.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The only Denture cleaner thhat has worked for me and I can&#x27;t find it in local stores, only on line.</li>
            <li> I use this for my retainer and bite guard that I wear when I sleep.  This works great and they taste good when I&#x27;m putting them in.  I also love the subscribe and save, this is always the one thing I forget at the store, no more!!!</li>
            <li> What can you say about denture cleanser? It keeps my fake tooth clean and white.</li>
            <li> Works quick! Nice scope ingredients to freshen partial/dentures! I purchased this product to add to the cleaning regimen&lt;br /&gt;for my partial.</li>
            <li> It is not available in any of the stores here. I find it is the best cleaner for me. I look forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Despite the prevalence of Efferdent and Polident, I find that Fixodent, hard to find in some of the major store chains, does the best job of cleaning my dentures.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite denture tab.  This item should be on a subscribe list so we can just auto ship every 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> I got this product to clean my gemstones in the jewelry. It does great job. I haven&#x27;t tried to clean anything else with it, so I can&#x27;t say anything on that.</li>
            <li> Would like to reorder.</li>
            <li> Bought this product based on the overwhelmed reviews. Does not dissolve in the water so smooth like other leading products...</li>
            <li> I like this brand cleaner because it cleans better than other brands.  It also leaves a the smell of Scope.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, though admittedly I have nothing to compare it to! This is the first product of it&#x27;s kind I&#x27;ve purchased and have found no need to switch. Before I was utterly grossed out by my night guard and tried everything to get it clean! Anyone else who has one knows they aren&#x27;t cheap and so I wanted to make sure mine lasts a while. This is the easiest way I&#x27;ve found to make sure it&#x27;s clean between uses. I pop it in a glass of water before I leave to work and let it soak all day and rinse it out when I get home. No more funny smells and my eyes could be deceiving me but I think the plastic is looking a bit lighter than it used to as well. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone else who uses a night guard like I do.</li>
            <li> Works very well for cleaning</li>
            <li> this denture clenser is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I use this for my retainers every couple days to keep them from smelling.  Even with brush cleaning you need some sort of anti-microbial cleaner for retainers.  I got it because it was one of the cheaper ones and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I soak my retainers in this and it&#x27;s wonderful. Removes stains and leaves them smelling and tasting great when I use them again at night.</li>
            <li> I buy these because they are cheap.  They are not the best of the bunch, but for me they are fine.</li>
