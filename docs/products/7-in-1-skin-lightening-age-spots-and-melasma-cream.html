            <li>It looks nice, like it should do the trick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
            <li>Would not use it so I don&#x27;t know effective it would be.</li>
            <li>and it is a nice skin care product.</li>
            <li>: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I received this product gratuity for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li>Still looking for an effective skin lightener to remove melasmsa and age spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I am noticing a difference.</li>
            <li>: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why when I was offered a complimentary sample of NaturaBRIGHT 7 in 1 skin lightening cream, I was all to happy to test it out and post my honest and unbiased opinion, here, in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have tried many more well known brands none of which work like this product!  </li>
            <li>The cream is made up of all natural ingredients which is great!</li>
            <li>She likes the smell, she says it is a very light smell</li>
            <li>This one is not drying at all, it leaves skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>, company refunded me my money after only using about 1/2 the product, very happy with that.  </li>
            <li>Melanin is the substance that gives your skin its pigment, and the more you have, the darker your skin will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>helps erase discolorations and revive skin&#x27;s healthy tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am also looking forward to a freckle free summer as well!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found this.</li>
            <li>I anticipate on using more products by this company.</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this but saw many 4 and 5 star reviews and thought it was a safe bet.....</li>
            <li>I received this for free as part of a promotion to test and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>This product works better than the ones I have used  but not as well as I would like</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>A 20% Vitamin C serum works much better for lightening skin and fading spots.</li>
            <li>this product in Amazon and read all most 100 reviews :)  </li>
            <li>well Fingers crossed :)</li>
            <li>, however I believe that with continued use the spots will lighten even more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Is there any better way to get better result?</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>But so far so good!</li>
            <li>Also, it has a kind of odd smell that i was not so impressed with.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this 7-in-1 Skin Lightening Cream from Natura Science Labs for a great deal to try and share my  honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it.</li>
            <li>This is really amazing works effectively at very first use.</li>
            <li>Like with most beauty products, it takes time to see any significant difference.</li>
            <li>When I read that this product was supposed to help with that I was extremely excited to be getting a sample of it and be able to share my experience with it here with you.</li>
            <li>Now with that being said and taken the amount of time that I have been using this product, I can easily see that my skin tone is getting a bit lighter.</li>
            <li>7in1 is easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>I always look for the best products to lighten some of my dark spots, and this works very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and she can already see a difference in her age spots and that is huge for her.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a free sample, but no its 1 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Plus it is risk free</li>
            <li>, I received this free to review it</li>
            <li>and i am so happy I did, she has only used it twice</li>
            <li>It is a smooth cream</li>
            <li>I think I would need to use it longer too o really give an honest opinion  </li>
            <li>But people around me start to mention that my face look smooth</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and spreads evenly over your skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it, especially since it contains Kojic acid which I have had wonderful results with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Arbutin, which is a very popular ingredient in skin whitening and brightening creams such as this cream by NaturaBRIGHT because it helps decrease skin discoloration by inhibiting melanin.</li>
            <li>I love how light it feels, but most of all I love how it actually reduces the sun discoloration on my skin!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice is that its very moisturizing, non greasy and your skin drinks it in quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item on promo and have been very pleased with it thus far.</li>
            <li>I originally started using something that had carcinogenic ingredients in it that my doctor prescribed for my &amp;#34;blotches&amp;#34; on both of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I have been applying this lightening lotion two times per day and using sunscreen every day, it has been more than one week from the first time I applied it, nothing got improved, all freckles are getting darker and darker.</li>
            <li>I know I have enjoyed sharing my knowledge, experience and own personal opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>I like the odorless, goes on colorless, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice enough in that it is smooth and absorbs easily, but I see no evidence of any effectiveness as a lightening agent.</li>
            <li>I received product at a special price.</li>
            <li>so many of the highly rated reviews were written by people who had received free samples in exchange for a review which I think had to influence them, certainly if I received it for nothing I would have been more favorably disposed , but paying $20 for a partially full jar feels like a rip off.</li>
            <li>It allows a smooth finish, much better than not wearing anything under makeup because I would rather have pores filled with this than directly with makeup.</li>
            <li>Will try a full 2 weeks and see what happens.</li>
            <li>This one is good after only 7 days.</li>
            <li>Give me time to finish the product then I will give a full review.</li>
            <li>I have been very self conscience about the scars and have tried many products on them.</li>
            <li>Quick results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>So far after 3 weeks for me there is no difference in what many people call liver slots or age spots.  </li>
            <li>I suspect laser treatments are the only effective method of eliminating these spots.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this product to test as a consumer and offer my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>It took my skin toning effort right where i wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>It seems like it has the right ingredients but couldn&#x27;t get by smell</li>
            <li>I will continue using Natural Bright 7 in 1 lightening cream for as I said it has been the only product that have shown any difference.</li>
            <li>Overall this product so far so good.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great product that does what it says, it comes with a money back satisfaction guarantee</li>
            <li>This product that I received seems to be working good, but I wish it would work a little faster.  </li>
            <li>The cream dried very quickly and I was able to apply my tinted moisturizer and makeup right after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so funny, when I opened it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with your product, it only  product been 3 weeks, Thank You.</li>
            <li>Plus works fast!</li>
            <li>but its goes on smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Love that this 7-in-1 Lighting cream never left my face oily or gave me any type of</li>
            <li>I do splash my face and hair to manage the hot weather.</li>
            <li>I will update my review later on once i give it more time.</li>
            <li>I mask it by following up with my favorite scented hand cream.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Thanks you!</li>
            <li>and at first I was hesitant to give a review at all.</li>
            <li>Was really excited to try this 7-in-1 skin lightening cream because I have some old acne spots and discoloration on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to give this product more time because I think it could be a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product for removing dark spots and evening out the skin tone without a &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>but they take so long to work that I never bought more.</li>
            <li>I think the product was easy to use although I wished it came in a larger quantity as I was trying to use it on my arms and hands as well as my face.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on skin and basically has no known side</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just like to know how much time before I quit.</li>
            <li>Still using as directed, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference on my skin yet...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a milky white looking substance and when applied, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help my melisma.  </li>
            <li>But nothing really does.  </li>
            <li>This is working very well.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Tried to return but company was very cordial and refunded the cost.</li>
            <li>I use7in1 as a light cream daily after a couple of splashes.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product it absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>but it is soft and quickly absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li>I like your product,  all ready seeing results.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on my wifes hands where she had age spots developing.</li>
            <li>and I have seen them really diminishing.  </li>
            <li>This one really is helping to lighten the discoloration.</li>
            <li>I developed two very prominent dark patches on my forehead from the sun.  </li>
            <li>I dye my hair red, which kind of looks cute, but seriously, who wants all those spots all over their face?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited that my skin is starting to look like one shade without any foundation!</li>
            <li>I can tell with further use that I will be able to see a more subtle appearance.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to lighten or remove age spots.</li>
            <li>Have tried products such as Esoterica etc, and they do work, but they dont contain the same safe ingredients as are found in the 7 in 1 lightening cream.  </li>
            <li>, I have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but I saw no difference</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received these items for testing and review purposes only&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This skin lightening cream was hyped up to high limits.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I have many scars that turned a very dark color when it was all said and done.</li>
            <li>Am really liking this product so far.</li>
            <li>I wished it worked faster as I am very self conscious about these spots.</li>
            <li>So since I am getting up in years and want to make sure to keep my skin tone even without the few spots that are popping up, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I am very hopeful that these spots will largely disappear shortly.</li>
            <li>Applying it for the first time there is no bad odor, the cream is an orange color which threw me off a little</li>
            <li>After using this cream every night for a month, I have notice no lightening of my new melasma patch on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is this cream is not creamy, it looks and feels more like serum, which is not a real problem for me.</li>
            <li>Since I have age spots on my hands, I didn&#x27;t think it would go very far</li>
            <li>It is a very natural feeling product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>First, let&#x27;s go over the ingredients in this cream because knowledge is power and that power gives you the ability to make an informed decision on whether or not to purchase specific products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy the consistency of this dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li>but when i saw the shipping cover is was so small and cute .At</li>
            <li>I have been using other good products on my aging skin but this provided the breakthrough my skin needed in a few weeks  (3-4) of use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply,the consistency was a little runny</li>
            <li>Glad I won this, I&#x27;m  using it to remove my black spot left by acne.</li>
            <li>That means that kojic acid is completely natural and not something that’s man-made in a laboratory by a group of scientists and dermatologists.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kakadu Plum which is a flowering plant native to Australia, contains the highest concentration of vitamin C which we all know is a natural antioxidant that helps nourish skin and gives it a natural, youthful glow.</li>
            <li>It also aids in the healing a number of skin conditions so the addition of this spice in this cream makes it a completely well rounded</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know a natural skin regime could work</li>
            <li>so far, I feel like it is lightening the splotches, but it is doing it gradually.  </li>
            <li>It may be because of the Arbutin in it which is like a natural form of Hydroquinone which seems to also make my marks darker instead of fading them.</li>
            <li>That means there are no harsh chemicals to do any harm to your face or wherever you wish to use the product.</li>
            <li>far as the product itself goes...</li>
            <li>I have tried about every product under the sun and nothing has really worked, especially for the melasma.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t last much longer.</li>
            <li>Not seeing much change in my skin using twice daily.</li>
            <li>but so far, it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that really sems to work.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I understand though that it&#x27;s a consequence of an all natural product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands extremely soft.</li>
            <li>So far I have seen a difference and my coworker noticed.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have started to notice the aging process beginning.</li>
            <li>I have tried about every product under the sun and nothing has really worked, especially for the melasma.</li>
            <li>I really like that there is a money back guarantee for this product, even if you have used it for longer than a year.</li>
            <li>I served in the military for 15 years since the military cap kept most of my face protected with the exception of my shin, lips, and bottom of my face.</li>
            <li>I have a dark spot on my face from when i got pregnant.</li>
            <li>The contains  is half full.</li>
            <li>It took a long few weeks to see results, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li>My melasma is mainly around my upper lip and to test this product out</li>
            <li>; H X1.5&amp;#34; W.  Will advise in three months if product really works (if it even lasts that long).  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is made with natural ingredients because sometimes I wonder what the chemicals that are in other products you are using to remove that dark spots are doing to your skin in return!</li>
            <li>so I can use it long enough to really give my complete review.</li>
            <li>Most staph infections end up leaving scars and when they do it is usually a dark brown to greyish black colored scar.</li>
            <li>This is great although I was shocked</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to tell you much</li>
            <li>from natural ingredients such as Kojic Acid, Kakadu Plum Extract, Vitamin C, Licorice, Arbutin and Curcuminoids</li>
            <li>I can see a bit of a difference between all the things I am doing, but for sure, this is not amazing cream, and it comes in a TINY, TINY JAR.</li>
            <li>Using itI only for a short time I am unable to evaluate it fairly.  </li>
            <li>after the package arrived and I opened the (TINY) jar it appeared to be only half full</li>
            <li>Hopefully, their other products are just as good, if not better than this dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li>I want to rate higher , since I just start using the cream for less than two weeks.</li>
            <li>It comes in a decent size jar that should last for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Licorice helps in the fading of hyper- pigmentation and sun damage for all skin tones and gently works on all skin types, be it oily skin, irritated, sensitive or uneven</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I was surprised how small the container was.</li>
            <li>After one week, a large dark patch on my hand become noticeably lighter.  </li>
            <li>First, the product makes my black spots darker and the surrounding area lighter , just the opposite of my expectation.</li>
            <li>Gentle for under the eye area, but also didn&#x27;t help with my dark circles</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much change from trying to lessen the appearance of dark spots.</li>
            <li>I have used this off and on, but its least a full week when I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only in my third week of using this cream for dark spots I have on my left arm, as well as on a few light brown patches on my face...</li>
            <li>I was expecting a larger jar, however it seems you dont need to use much, so it should last maybe a month and a half.</li>
            <li>This is pretty irritating because it only means I&#x27;m getting older.</li>

            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> It says to use before moisturizer, but honestly I like using it by itself.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, like it should do the trick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
            <li> Would not use it so I don&#x27;t know effective it would be.</li>
            <li> and it is a nice skin care product.</li>
            <li> : I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I received this product gratuity for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> Still looking for an effective skin lightener to remove melasmsa and age spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I am noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> : I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why when I was offered a complimentary sample of NaturaBRIGHT 7 in 1 skin lightening cream, I was all to happy to test it out and post my honest and unbiased opinion, here, in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried many more well known brands none of which work like this product!  </li>
            <li> The cream is made up of all natural ingredients which is great!</li>
            <li> She likes the smell, she says it is a very light smell</li>
            <li> This one is not drying at all, it leaves skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li> , company refunded me my money after only using about 1/2 the product, very happy with that.  </li>
            <li> Melanin is the substance that gives your skin its pigment, and the more you have, the darker your skin will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> helps erase discolorations and revive skin&#x27;s healthy tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also looking forward to a freckle free summer as well!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found this.</li>
            <li> I anticipate on using more products by this company.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this but saw many 4 and 5 star reviews and thought it was a safe bet.....</li>
            <li> I received this for free as part of a promotion to test and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> This product works better than the ones I have used  but not as well as I would like</li>
            <li> My skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> A 20% Vitamin C serum works much better for lightening skin and fading spots.</li>
            <li> this product in Amazon and read all most 100 reviews :)  </li>
            <li> well Fingers crossed :)</li>
            <li> , however I believe that with continued use the spots will lighten even more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Is there any better way to get better result?</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> But so far so good!</li>
            <li> Also, it has a kind of odd smell that i was not so impressed with.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this 7-in-1 Skin Lightening Cream from Natura Science Labs for a great deal to try and share my  honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is really amazing works effectively at very first use.</li>
            <li> Like with most beauty products, it takes time to see any significant difference.</li>
            <li> When I read that this product was supposed to help with that I was extremely excited to be getting a sample of it and be able to share my experience with it here with you.</li>
            <li> Now with that being said and taken the amount of time that I have been using this product, I can easily see that my skin tone is getting a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> 7in1 is easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> I always look for the best products to lighten some of my dark spots, and this works very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and she can already see a difference in her age spots and that is huge for her.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a free sample, but no its 1 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Plus it is risk free</li>
            <li> , I received this free to review it</li>
            <li> and i am so happy I did, she has only used it twice</li>
            <li> It is a smooth cream</li>
            <li> I think I would need to use it longer too o really give an honest opinion  </li>
            <li> But people around me start to mention that my face look smooth</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and spreads evenly over your skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it, especially since it contains Kojic acid which I have had wonderful results with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Arbutin, which is a very popular ingredient in skin whitening and brightening creams such as this cream by NaturaBRIGHT because it helps decrease skin discoloration by inhibiting melanin.</li>
            <li> I love how light it feels, but most of all I love how it actually reduces the sun discoloration on my skin!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice is that its very moisturizing, non greasy and your skin drinks it in quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on promo and have been very pleased with it thus far.</li>
            <li> I originally started using something that had carcinogenic ingredients in it that my doctor prescribed for my &amp;#34;blotches&amp;#34; on both of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying this lightening lotion two times per day and using sunscreen every day, it has been more than one week from the first time I applied it, nothing got improved, all freckles are getting darker and darker.</li>
            <li> I know I have enjoyed sharing my knowledge, experience and own personal opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> I like the odorless, goes on colorless, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The cream is nice enough in that it is smooth and absorbs easily, but I see no evidence of any effectiveness as a lightening agent.</li>
            <li> I received product at a special price.</li>
            <li> so many of the highly rated reviews were written by people who had received free samples in exchange for a review which I think had to influence them, certainly if I received it for nothing I would have been more favorably disposed , but paying $20 for a partially full jar feels like a rip off.</li>
            <li> It allows a smooth finish, much better than not wearing anything under makeup because I would rather have pores filled with this than directly with makeup.</li>
            <li> Will try a full 2 weeks and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This one is good after only 7 days.</li>
            <li> Give me time to finish the product then I will give a full review.</li>
            <li> I have been very self conscience about the scars and have tried many products on them.</li>
            <li> Quick results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> So far after 3 weeks for me there is no difference in what many people call liver slots or age spots.  </li>
            <li> I suspect laser treatments are the only effective method of eliminating these spots.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this product to test as a consumer and offer my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> It took my skin toning effort right where i wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> It seems like it has the right ingredients but couldn&#x27;t get by smell</li>
            <li> I will continue using Natural Bright 7 in 1 lightening cream for as I said it has been the only product that have shown any difference.</li>
            <li> Overall this product so far so good.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a great product that does what it says, it comes with a money back satisfaction guarantee</li>
            <li> This product that I received seems to be working good, but I wish it would work a little faster.  </li>
            <li> The cream dried very quickly and I was able to apply my tinted moisturizer and makeup right after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so funny, when I opened it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with your product, it only  product been 3 weeks, Thank You.</li>
            <li> Plus works fast!</li>
            <li> but its goes on smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Love that this 7-in-1 Lighting cream never left my face oily or gave me any type of</li>
            <li> I do splash my face and hair to manage the hot weather.</li>
            <li> I will update my review later on once i give it more time.</li>
            <li> I mask it by following up with my favorite scented hand cream.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Thanks you!</li>
            <li> and at first I was hesitant to give a review at all.</li>
            <li> Was really excited to try this 7-in-1 skin lightening cream because I have some old acne spots and discoloration on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to give this product more time because I think it could be a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for removing dark spots and evening out the skin tone without a &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> but they take so long to work that I never bought more.</li>
            <li> I think the product was easy to use although I wished it came in a larger quantity as I was trying to use it on my arms and hands as well as my face.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on skin and basically has no known side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just like to know how much time before I quit.</li>
            <li> Still using as directed, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference on my skin yet...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a milky white looking substance and when applied, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my melisma.  </li>
            <li> But nothing really does.  </li>
            <li> This is working very well.  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Tried to return but company was very cordial and refunded the cost.</li>
            <li> I use7in1 as a light cream daily after a couple of splashes.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product it absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> but it is soft and quickly absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li> I like your product,  all ready seeing results.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on my wifes hands where she had age spots developing.</li>
            <li> and I have seen them really diminishing.  </li>
            <li> This one really is helping to lighten the discoloration.</li>
            <li> I developed two very prominent dark patches on my forehead from the sun.  </li>
            <li> I dye my hair red, which kind of looks cute, but seriously, who wants all those spots all over their face?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited that my skin is starting to look like one shade without any foundation!</li>
            <li> I can tell with further use that I will be able to see a more subtle appearance.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to lighten or remove age spots.</li>
            <li> Have tried products such as Esoterica etc, and they do work, but they dont contain the same safe ingredients as are found in the 7 in 1 lightening cream.  </li>
            <li> , I have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I saw no difference</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received these items for testing and review purposes only&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This skin lightening cream was hyped up to high limits.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have many scars that turned a very dark color when it was all said and done.</li>
            <li> Am really liking this product so far.</li>
            <li> I wished it worked faster as I am very self conscious about these spots.</li>
            <li> So since I am getting up in years and want to make sure to keep my skin tone even without the few spots that are popping up, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I am very hopeful that these spots will largely disappear shortly.</li>
            <li> Applying it for the first time there is no bad odor, the cream is an orange color which threw me off a little</li>
            <li> After using this cream every night for a month, I have notice no lightening of my new melasma patch on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is this cream is not creamy, it looks and feels more like serum, which is not a real problem for me.</li>
            <li> Since I have age spots on my hands, I didn&#x27;t think it would go very far</li>
            <li> It is a very natural feeling product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> First, let&#x27;s go over the ingredients in this cream because knowledge is power and that power gives you the ability to make an informed decision on whether or not to purchase specific products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy the consistency of this dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> but when i saw the shipping cover is was so small and cute .At</li>
            <li> I have been using other good products on my aging skin but this provided the breakthrough my skin needed in a few weeks  (3-4) of use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply,the consistency was a little runny</li>
            <li> Glad I won this, I&#x27;m  using it to remove my black spot left by acne.</li>
            <li> That means that kojic acid is completely natural and not something that’s man-made in a laboratory by a group of scientists and dermatologists.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kakadu Plum which is a flowering plant native to Australia, contains the highest concentration of vitamin C which we all know is a natural antioxidant that helps nourish skin and gives it a natural, youthful glow.</li>
            <li> It also aids in the healing a number of skin conditions so the addition of this spice in this cream makes it a completely well rounded</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a natural skin regime could work</li>
            <li> so far, I feel like it is lightening the splotches, but it is doing it gradually.  </li>
            <li> It may be because of the Arbutin in it which is like a natural form of Hydroquinone which seems to also make my marks darker instead of fading them.</li>
            <li> That means there are no harsh chemicals to do any harm to your face or wherever you wish to use the product.</li>
            <li> far as the product itself goes...</li>
            <li> I have tried about every product under the sun and nothing has really worked, especially for the melasma.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t last much longer.</li>
            <li> Not seeing much change in my skin using twice daily.</li>
            <li> but so far, it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really sems to work.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I understand though that it&#x27;s a consequence of an all natural product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands extremely soft.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen a difference and my coworker noticed.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have started to notice the aging process beginning.</li>
            <li> I have tried about every product under the sun and nothing has really worked, especially for the melasma.</li>
            <li> I really like that there is a money back guarantee for this product, even if you have used it for longer than a year.</li>
            <li> I served in the military for 15 years since the military cap kept most of my face protected with the exception of my shin, lips, and bottom of my face.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my face from when i got pregnant.</li>
            <li> The contains  is half full.</li>
            <li> It took a long few weeks to see results, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li> My melasma is mainly around my upper lip and to test this product out</li>
            <li> ; H X1.5&amp;#34; W.  Will advise in three months if product really works (if it even lasts that long).  </li>
            <li> I love that this product is made with natural ingredients because sometimes I wonder what the chemicals that are in other products you are using to remove that dark spots are doing to your skin in return!</li>
            <li> so I can use it long enough to really give my complete review.</li>
            <li> Most staph infections end up leaving scars and when they do it is usually a dark brown to greyish black colored scar.</li>
            <li> This is great although I was shocked</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell you much</li>
            <li> from natural ingredients such as Kojic Acid, Kakadu Plum Extract, Vitamin C, Licorice, Arbutin and Curcuminoids</li>
            <li> I can see a bit of a difference between all the things I am doing, but for sure, this is not amazing cream, and it comes in a TINY, TINY JAR.</li>
            <li> Using itI only for a short time I am unable to evaluate it fairly.  </li>
            <li> after the package arrived and I opened the (TINY) jar it appeared to be only half full</li>
            <li> Hopefully, their other products are just as good, if not better than this dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> I want to rate higher , since I just start using the cream for less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> It comes in a decent size jar that should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Licorice helps in the fading of hyper- pigmentation and sun damage for all skin tones and gently works on all skin types, be it oily skin, irritated, sensitive or uneven</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I was surprised how small the container was.</li>
            <li> After one week, a large dark patch on my hand become noticeably lighter.  </li>
            <li> First, the product makes my black spots darker and the surrounding area lighter , just the opposite of my expectation.</li>
            <li> Gentle for under the eye area, but also didn&#x27;t help with my dark circles</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change from trying to lessen the appearance of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on, but its least a full week when I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my third week of using this cream for dark spots I have on my left arm, as well as on a few light brown patches on my face...</li>
            <li> I was expecting a larger jar, however it seems you dont need to use much, so it should last maybe a month and a half.</li>
            <li> This is pretty irritating because it only means I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li> While the results of this product aren&#x27;t right away and as stated, can take up to a month, I could start to see some of my dark spots and acne spots starting to seem less visible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not competently gone, but it is lighter, improving for certain.</li>
            <li> her skin started to clear her dark spots got lighter so I would recommend this product to Anyone</li>
            <li> The bottle is on the small side but its not something you will use to cover your whole face .</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, very small container only half full.  </li>
            <li> After using it now for some time I have noticed some of the dark spots on my face have become lighter, sun spots going away and overall my skin starting to look younger.</li>
            <li> Its really hard for me to find products i can actually use on my face because i usually have to stop after day 1 due to the strong fragrances on them but not with this product.</li>
            <li> This product did lighten some dark spots, but just barely</li>
            <li> apply it before the bed it keeps moisture all night long</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long term solution then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> The cream has 7 active ingredients that reduce age spots, sun spots and freckles: Kojic Acid, Kakadu Plum, Niacinamide, Arbutin, Vitamin C, Licorice and Curcuminoids that will not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> and I had not sensitive skin reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made up of 7 natural ingredients, none of which are harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I realize 3 weeks isn&#x27;t long at all...</li>
            <li> I have some minor discoloration on one side of my face that is quite noticeable if I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> The melasma is not completely gone</li>
            <li> Use sparingly as this is a very small jar and not meant for large areas of skin.</li>
            <li> It has worked extremely well for me and with all the aforementioned ingredients, I believe this cream to be truly a skin lightener and brightener.</li>
            <li> ited so long to get this!</li>
            <li> This product has the same results as all the other spot removers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The pod is very small but you don&#x27;t use a whole lot</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and it made my skin feel soft without irritating or aggravating it.</li>
            <li> the main problem I have with the cream is that the jar is SO SMALL!</li>
            <li> It definitely helps get rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this  Skin Lightening Cream from Natura Science Labs for anyone who has dark spots that they would like to see faded.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of using it, a dark spot on my cheek actually looks darker.</li>
            <li> I have only had NaturaBright for less than a month.</li>
            <li> Im about 4/5 finished with this darling little blue jar.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I will of course continue to use the product until the entire bottle is used hoping after a few months it will make a difference.</li>
            <li> And within a few days not only did they get lighter but</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly not reorder it or recommend it.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a larger jar, but it is very little.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that it was such a small amount</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> A little bit of this cream goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am happy with it, because it is working &amp; it isn&#x27;t a dangerous product or with dangerous</li>
            <li> small, not sure how long it will last to get rid of spots on my legs &amp; arms.</li>
            <li> have a black spots on my cheeks both sides so tried Neutorgena UltraSheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen SPF 70 for many days but did not see any changes :(.Saw</li>
            <li> This cream is packed with 7 active ingredients that help to fight the signs of aging and to lighten dark spots, regardless of the cause.</li>
            <li> It depends on how dark of the spots.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t stand out as dark as they were a week or so ago.</li>
            <li> This is helping my skin tone even out so that I don&#x27;t have blotches of dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skin</li>
            <li> and it appears to be lightening up the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I think over time, it will lighten my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> it is not worth risking skin buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have started noticing dark spots all over my cheek area on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream in April 2015 to help even out my skin tone and lighten dark areas.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a day on a dark spot on my neck.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lightens dark spots&lt;br /&gt;Formulated</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on the dark circles that are under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see subtle changes.</li>
            <li> The box is one and a half inches square.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using it for about a week and a half now</li>
            <li> and I think I noticed a slight lightening of the sunspots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Im still waiting to see the difference after a jar and a half...</li>
            <li> it bettered my doctor&#x27;s formula -- with less money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried products from the drug store for half the price</li>
            <li> Fancy little cream, I bought this to lighten up the dark circles under my eyes, I hope it&#x27;ll work for that.</li>
            <li> I am not good at constantly applying creams and scrums for my face.</li>
            <li> , so I know a little bit about what works and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I saw little to no changes once I started using this product.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is rub a little bit onto the spots that you would like to &amp;#34;vanish&amp;#34; and let the cream do the work.</li>
            <li> Made the dark spot disappear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> added boon is that the cream, which smells a little like mayo, did NOT cause any breakouts, like vitamin C oil does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles</li>
            <li> anyway hope it works, trying it on a few select spots on hands and legs,&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and my brown spots have not changed at all.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> After using it for few days, I got rash all over my face and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Will review once again after few days .</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Was sad to see it only had a small effect, unlike other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Small quantity for the price.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with small dark spots you want to lighten without using a harsh, irritating product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few lightening creams lately.</li>
            <li> The small jar lasted about a month</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes longer to work, but the JAR IS SO SMALL.....</li>
            <li> It was so small I need to play closer attention to the size.</li>
            <li> and i can see a small difference.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use alot of concealer and powder to cover it up but have not had to this week.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if what rating , but for  now , it&#x27;s  2 ....</li>
            <li> I started using this product not sure what to expect but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Hard to give a review on a product that takes months to offer results.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to give a review</li>
            <li> At least skin feels smoother and soften.</li>
            <li> At least for me, it reminds me of vanilla extract.  </li>
            <li> AS I AM A WEEK LATE.  </li>
            <li> It says you need to use it twice a day for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> This is a NO RISK purchase, If you are not satisfied they will return your money!  </li>
            <li> I recomend you to buy two at least, because it comes in a very small presentation..</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL JAR</li>
            <li> My mom just turned 70 and is having serious self esteem issues.</li>
            <li> Hell no not good at all</li>
            <li> The odor of the product is not pleasant but it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> and I am using the cream on very delicate skin</li>
            <li> I researched one of the ingredients on the internet &amp; saw it&#x27;s warnings, which I was not happy about.  </li>
            <li> I have always been freckled but they are the dark like freckles making it very difficult to make it lighter.</li>
            <li> one time i felt its very expensive spending 20$ for 30ml but after reading reviews i got little satisfaction .</li>
            <li> Just get frustrated because I can&#x27;t see even a little results at the end of a week.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed  about the packaging of this product, but that being said i have to give this item 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lighten my spots sadly.  </li>
            <li> Every year without fail, whenever I am in the sun, my face freckles.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Expensive product.  </li>
            <li> Value questionable.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I used two bottles of my dermatologist&#x27;s dark-spot remover which did work, but it was unable to remove a couple of areas that NatureBright IS removing.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately, I cannot say this cream has helped with either of my problems.  </li>
            <li> Smells bad in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I just got this product today, but I was shocked when I  opened it, seems like it was already used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed, it broke me out</li>
            <li> hate to buy something again</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> VERY SMALL JAR, OOPS THEY FORGOT TO MENTION THE SIZE&lt;br /&gt;This is so funny, when I opened it I thought this was a free sample, but no its 1 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;Very small, not sure how long it will last to get rid of spots on my legs &amp; arms. I may need&lt;br /&gt;20 jars this size. anyway hope it works, trying it on a few select spots on hands and legs,&lt;br /&gt;will update.</li>
            <li> They forgot to mention how tiny of an amount you get! Hope it works! The jar is as big as a quarter! I&#x27;ve read great stuff about this product, I have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> It arrived promply as advertised. Very easy to apply. As to the effectiveness, that may take a while to determine. I bought it mainly to lighten or remove age spots.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lighten my spots sadly.  I had high hopes, but I saw no difference, company refunded me my money after only using about 1/2 the product, very happy with that.  Maybe I just have stubborn spots?</li>
            <li> bottle is smaller than I thought. The product is worked some. It depends on how dark of the spots. At least skin feels smoother and soften. apply it before the bed it keeps moisture all night long</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed  about the packaging of this product, but that being said i have to give this item 5 stars. This is an amazing product for removing dark spots and evening out the skin tone without a &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; look. I have been using other good products on my aging skin but this provided the breakthrough my skin needed in a few weeks  (3-4) of use. It took my skin toning effort right where i wanted it to be. It is easy to apply,the consistency was a little runny but that&#x27;s fine.  I will definitely buy again but i hope that the manufacturers pay attention to sealing the jar and box as a quality and safety precaution for its customers.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell you much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with your product, it only  product been 3 weeks, Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and my brown spots have not changed at all. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Every year without fail, whenever I am in the sun, my face freckles. I dye my hair red, which kind of looks cute, but seriously, who wants all those spots all over their face? I know I don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why when I was offered a complimentary sample of NaturaBRIGHT 7 in 1 skin lightening cream, I was all to happy to test it out and post my honest and unbiased opinion, here, in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a licensed Cosmetologist, so I know a little bit about what works and what doesn&#x27;t. I can tell you that after having tried this specific formula that it does, indeed, work! First, let&#x27;s go over the ingredients in this cream because knowledge is power and that power gives you the ability to make an informed decision on whether or not to purchase specific products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kojic Acid is an all-natural compound derived from fungi, similar to mushrooms. That means that kojic acid is completely natural and not something that’s man-made in a laboratory by a group of scientists and dermatologists. Kojic acid works to stop the production of melanin in your skin. Melanin is the substance that gives your skin its pigment, and the more you have, the darker your skin will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kakadu Plum which is a flowering plant native to Australia, contains the highest concentration of vitamin C which we all know is a natural antioxidant that helps nourish skin and gives it a natural, youthful glow. It also combats premature aging of the skin and helps protect our skin from the damaging rays of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niacinamide is essentially vitamin b3, which improve skin&#x27;s elasticity, helps erase discolorations and revive skin&#x27;s healthy tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arbutin, which is a very popular ingredient in skin whitening and brightening creams such as this cream by NaturaBRIGHT because it helps decrease skin discoloration by inhibiting melanin. It is gentle on skin and basically has no known side affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licorice helps in the fading of hyper- pigmentation and sun damage for all skin tones and gently works on all skin types, be it oily skin, irritated, sensitive or uneven skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curcuminoids which is essentially Curcumin or otherwise known as the spice turmeric. That is what gives this cream it&#x27;s yellow color. It also aids in the healing a number of skin conditions so the addition of this spice in this cream makes it a completely well rounded product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that you know what&#x27;s in this cream, don&#x27;t you think maybe you should try it? It has worked extremely well for me and with all the aforementioned ingredients, I believe this cream to be truly a skin lightener and brightener. I hope you have found this review helpful. I know I have enjoyed sharing my knowledge, experience and own personal opinion about this product. I am also looking forward to a freckle free summer as well!</li>
            <li> Hard to give a review on a product that takes months to offer results. This is the second skin lightning product I&#x27;ve been using this year (for 5-6 months), and I&#x27;m still waiting for results. All skin lightning products say it takes time. I&#x27;d just like to know how much time before I quit.</li>
            <li> Am really liking this product so far. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red after its use and I&#x27;m already seeing a huge difference. I didn&#x27;t know a natural skin regime could work so well but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found this. If you are looking for a long term solution then this is the product for you. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received these items for testing and review purposes only&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Still using as directed, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference on my skin yet...I will update my review when I finish using the rest of the product.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be working. I have not had any skin irritation. That&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Received promptly.  It definitely fades spots, and after tanning in Florida throughout my youth it had caught up with me.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the price was in the $15 range, since you&#x27;re paying for an ounce.  That&#x27;s a key reason for the 4 stars.  A second reason&lt;br /&gt;for 4 stars is the spots are still there.  they&#x27;ve faded, but still noticeable.  Wish they&#x27;d disappear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I&#x27;m starting to see subtle changes. Like with most beauty products, it takes time to see any significant difference. Now with that being said and taken the amount of time that I have been using this product, I can easily see that my skin tone is getting a bit lighter. My sun spots are still there but they don&#x27;t stand out as dark as they were a week or so ago. This is helping my skin tone even out so that I don&#x27;t have blotches of dark spots on my face. I can tell with further use that I will be able to see a more subtle appearance. I enjoy the consistency of this dark spot corrector. It&#x27;s a milky white looking substance and when applied, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and radiant. It&#x27;s not greasy so you don&#x27;t get an oily, shiny look. It says to use before moisturizer, but honestly I like using it by itself. I purchased this item on promo and have been very pleased with it thus far. I anticipate on using more products by this company. Hopefully, their other products are just as good, if not better than this dark spot corrector. The cream has 7 active ingredients that reduce age spots, sun spots and freckles: Kojic Acid, Kakadu Plum, Niacinamide, Arbutin, Vitamin C, Licorice and Curcuminoids that will not dry out your skin. Plus it is risk free if you do no like the cream they will refudn your money what do you have to lose?!</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> it had a smoothing effect but my age spots did not lighten at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, very small container only half full.  No order info included, I want to return for money back guarantee but there is no return address or info.  Sorry I purchased this.  Money wasted.</li>
            <li> Shipping very good. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Hopefully in time it will work</li>
            <li> This product that I received seems to be working good, but I wish it would work a little faster.  I originally started using something that had carcinogenic ingredients in it that my doctor prescribed for my &amp;#34;blotches&amp;#34; on both of my cheeks.  It also came from a compound pharmacy of all places.  After I received the stuff (from the compound pharmacy) I researched one of the ingredients on the internet &amp; saw it&#x27;s warnings, which I was not happy about.  That&#x27;s when I decided to order your product &amp; so far, I feel like it is lightening the splotches, but it is doing it gradually.  Anyway, I am happy with it, because it is working &amp; it isn&#x27;t a dangerous product or with dangerous ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This skin lightening cream was hyped up to high limits. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be. I&#x27;m dark skin and I saw little to no changes once I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for couple of weeks but not regularly. Hence don&#x27;t yet see a remarkable difference. Will keep readers posted</li>
            <li> So far after 3 weeks for me there is no difference in what many people call liver slots or age spots.  I will of course continue to use the product until the entire bottle is used hoping after a few months it will make a difference.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet but will keep using.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me. Actually it made my spots darker. It may be because of the Arbutin in it which is like a natural form of Hydroquinone which seems to also make my marks darker instead of fading them. I really wanted to like it, especially since it contains Kojic acid which I have had wonderful results with.</li>
            <li> I like it ...it&#x27;s working...good! !</li>
            <li> After using this cream every night for a month, I have notice no lightening of my new melasma patch on my forehead.  I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen and avoided the sun, the melasma is still obvious.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Gentle for under the eye area, but also didn&#x27;t help with my dark circles</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my melisma.  But nothing really does.  Service was great!</li>
            <li> Use sparingly as this is a very small jar and not meant for large areas of skin. It is for age spots, so perhaps it should be meant to be &#x27;dabbed on&#x27;. I like the way it feels on the skin and I had not sensitive skin reaction. I use it only on my knees, elbows and under arms. Great results. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels in my face! Plus works fast! I have very dark circles so I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day morning and afternoon I just wash my face when I go to bed , I received this free to review it and I will gladly tell my friend about this and buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is working very well.  I see a difference in the clarity of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a larger jar, but it is very little. Also, it has a kind of odd smell that i was not so impressed with.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this but saw many 4 and 5 star reviews and thought it was a safe bet.....after the package arrived and I opened the (TINY) jar it appeared to be only half full (see attached photo taken immediately on opening) then I went back and read the reviews....so many of the highly rated reviews were written by people who had received free samples in exchange for a review which I think had to influence them, certainly if I received it for nothing I would have been more favorably disposed , but paying $20 for a partially full jar feels like a rip off. The cream is nice enough in that it is smooth and absorbs easily, but I see no evidence of any effectiveness as a lightening agent. I would certainly not reorder it or recommend it.</li>
            <li> Expensive product.  Bottle measures approx. 1.5&amp;#34; H X1.5&amp;#34; W.  Will advise in three months if product really works (if it even lasts that long).  Small quantity for the price.  Value questionable.  Three weeks into using product and it appears to be lightening up the dark spots.  Will give another review when the product runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week.  It seems to be working.</li>
            <li> This cream is great. It is very creamy and absorbs well into the skin. It feels very nice. Not too heavy. My skin is sensitive and it made my skin feel soft without irritating or aggravating it. I think over time, it will lighten my dark spots.  I received this for free as part of a promotion to test and give my honest opinion. I would recommend it to anyone with small dark spots you want to lighten without using a harsh, irritating product.</li>
            <li> This is tiny. The box is one and a half inches square.</li>
            <li> After using it for few days, I got rash all over my face and had to return it. I guess not for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;But it is not worth risking skin buying this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It is amazing I have spots on my face after I had my son! And within a few days not only did they get lighter but I felt like my skin got smoother!! Also it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it! I have oily skin so this is a plus since it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy!! ited so long to get this! Every mom on the go needs this!! I received my product at a complimentary/ discount for review.</li>
            <li> I always look for the best products to lighten some of my dark spots, and this works very quickly.  It&#x27;s made up of 7 natural ingredients, none of which are harsh or drying. I travel a lot, so the convenient 1oz. jar  is great to throw in my travel bag and gets through security.  This is a NO RISK purchase, If you are not satisfied they will return your money!  I received product at a special price.</li>
            <li> I ordered NaturaBright through a review site where I got a discount to test the product. The cream is scentless and it has the consistency of lotion. All you have to do is rub a little bit onto the spots that you would like to &amp;#34;vanish&amp;#34; and let the cream do the work. The cream is made up of all natural ingredients which is great! That means there are no harsh chemicals to do any harm to your face or wherever you wish to use the product. I plan to use this product everyday. It definitely helps get rid of dark spots. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on, but its least a full week when I do. Just get frustrated because I can&#x27;t see even a little results at the end of a week. Will try a full 2 weeks and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I have started noticing dark spots all over my cheek area on my face. This is pretty irritating because it only means I&#x27;m getting older. So when I was offered this 7-in-1 Skin Lightening Cream from Natura Science Labs for a great deal to try and share my  honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it. I&#x27;ve  been using it for about a week and a half now and I can see some fading! I&#x27;m excited that my skin is starting to look like one shade without any foundation! I definitely recommend this  Skin Lightening Cream from Natura Science Labs for anyone who has dark spots that they would like to see faded.</li>
            <li> This really works. I have been using it in my hands, face and neck .  I have tried many more well known brands none of which work like this product!  Quick results.</li>
            <li> Was sad to see it only had a small effect, unlike other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my third week of using this cream for dark spots I have on my left arm, as well as on a few light brown patches on my face...and I can&#x27;t see any discernible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I realize 3 weeks isn&#x27;t long at all...the main problem I have with the cream is that the jar is SO SMALL! 1 ounce doesn&#x27;t last long...and into the third week, I&#x27;ve already used three-quarters of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself goes...I like the consistency and the ease of how it can be applied, but I&#x27;m fearing that no results will be seen as the tiny jar depletes itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to buy something again that I have no idea will work or not.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week or so but I do see a difference in my age spots. Although the jar is very tiny, it only takes a drop to apply to several places on my face and the back of my hands. I am very hopeful that these spots will largely disappear shortly. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change from trying to lessen the appearance of dark spots. Wont purchase again</li>
            <li> Fancy little cream, I bought this to lighten up the dark circles under my eyes, I hope it&#x27;ll work for that. It looks nice, like it should do the trick. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**</li>
            <li> Love it..Thank you great product and results. Rapid delivery.</li>
            <li> I have tried about every product under the sun and nothing has really worked, especially for the melasma.This has a very pleasant smell! At least for me, it reminds me of vanilla extract.  I would recommend this product to anyone.Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**</li>
            <li> This product works better than the ones I have used  but not as well as I would like</li>
            <li> Great! Made the dark spot disappear! Faded the sun damage too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it claims to remove freckles, which intrigued me, as I have tons of freckles on my face.  So since I am getting up in years and want to make sure to keep my skin tone even without the few spots that are popping up, I decided to give this a try. I was very happy with the results.  It did not make my freckles disappear, but it has made them fade and when I put on my makeup you cannot see them.  So all in all I am very happy with theis 7 in 1 lightening cream, as when I put on my make up each day, my skin looks clean with even skin tones. I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few lightening creams lately. No luck. I have some minor discoloration on one side of my face that is quite noticeable if I don&#x27;t wear makeup. After one week of using this cream is already giving me some hope. It&#x27;s not competently gone, but it is lighter, improving for certain. This product has a potential. I will continue using it. The only downside is this cream is not creamy, it looks and feels more like serum, which is not a real problem for me. I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this cream. I finally found that work for me. I love how light it feels, but most of all I love how it actually reduces the sun discoloration on my skin! I use this daily. I use sunscreen every day, but some sun still seems to get through and if I use this Lightening Cream before bed, when I wake, the day&#x27;s sun damage is all but gone. This product was received for the purpose of testing and review.</li>
            <li> Smells bad in my opinion. Would not use it so I don&#x27;t know effective it would be. Tried to return but company was very cordial and refunded the cost. It seems like it has the right ingredients but couldn&#x27;t get by smell</li>
            <li> This product did lighten some dark spots, but just barely and it is a nice skin care product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that it was such a small amount</li>
            <li> Was really excited to try this 7-in-1 skin lightening cream because I have some old acne spots and discoloration on my face. Applying it for the first time there is no bad odor, the cream is an orange color which threw me off a little but its goes on smooth and clear. The cream dried very quickly and I was able to apply my tinted moisturizer and makeup right after. Love that this 7-in-1 Lighting cream never left my face oily or gave me any type of breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the cons to me is that the directions for use are only printed on the box the cream comes in and not on the actual jar of the product. Make sure you read the box before you throw it away! It says to apply to your face twice a day, morning and night. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now. While the results of this product aren&#x27;t right away and as stated, can take up to a month, I could start to see some of my dark spots and acne spots starting to seem less visible. It comes in a decent size jar that should last for a long time. I&#x27;m definitely going to give this product more time because I think it could be a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This product has the same results as all the other spot removers I have tried.  Darker skin (olive, Oriental) resists lightening because of the denser pigmentation.  I suspect laser treatments are the only effective method of eliminating these spots.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.  IT IS JUNE 12TH.  I GAVE IT A GOOD CHANCE AND NOW THE COMPANY SAYS THAT I CAN NOT RETURN IT AS I AM A WEEK LATE.  GO FIGURE.  NOT THE WAY I RUN MY COMPANY.</li>
            <li> it did nothing for the spots I was trying to lighten</li>
            <li> I am not good at constantly applying creams and scrums for my face. 7in1 is easy for me to use. I do splash my face and hair to manage the hot weather. I use7in1 as a light cream daily after a couple of splashes. My skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes as a short term. But I will continued use this product and will update the review later.</li>
            <li> My mom just turned 70 and is having serious self esteem issues. When this was offered to me during a promotion I had to grab it for her to try and i am so happy I did, she has only used it twice and she can already see a difference in her age spots and that is huge for her. She likes the smell, she says it is a very light smell and it doesnt leave her face greasy. She is actually thinking about going out on a date with a man that has been asking her for about a year now.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product it absolutely does not work. After three weeks of using it, a dark spot on my cheek actually looks darker. A 20% Vitamin C serum works much better for lightening skin and fading spots.</li>
            <li> 7 in 1 Skin Lightening Cream is the Best product I have found that has given me the results I need it. I have always been freckled but they are the dark like freckles making it very difficult to make it lighter. I have tried product after product with no avail. 7 in 1 Skin Lightening cream was finally the one that have shown the improvement in my skin that I have been looking for. The cream it self is a tan color but it is soft and quickly absorbed by your skin. I served in the military for 15 years since the military cap kept most of my face protected with the exception of my shin, lips, and bottom of my face. I will continue using Natural Bright 7 in 1 lightening cream for as I said it has been the only product that have shown any difference. I received this product gratuity for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> The small jar lasted about a month and I think I noticed a slight lightening of the sunspots on my face.  I think it would take  2 or 3 months to make a big difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this Item ordered by my friend who has prime shipping .I have a black spots on my cheeks both sides so tried Neutorgena UltraSheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen SPF 70 for many days but did not see any changes :(.Saw this product in Amazon and read all most 100 reviews :)  and people experience in using this product and I hope it will work for me too as i used just 1 time and need to wait and see .Inititally i thought it would be big in size but when i saw the shipping cover is was so small and cute .At one time i felt its very expensive spending 20$ for 30ml but after reading reviews i got little satisfaction . So hope it works for me well Fingers crossed :) Will review once again after few days .</li>
            <li> I have been using this about a month now. Maybe it takes longer to work, but the JAR IS SO SMALL..... it won&#x27;t last much longer. I have also been trying the &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; lighteners,,, hydrogen perioxide, with hazel, lemon juice, too. I can see a bit of a difference between all the things I am doing, but for sure, this is not amazing cream, and it comes in a TINY, TINY JAR.</li>
            <li> I applied this twice a day for a month.  There was absolutely no difference.  I went to return it but I didn&#x27;t realize you had to return it within 30 days.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  I feel taken.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is great although I was shocked It was so small I need to play closer attention to the size. Other than that this works wonders I see improvements after one week of use!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on backs of my hands to counter act age spots. I have used it only approx. 3 weeks, and do see some improvement, however I believe that with continued use the spots will lighten even more. Have tried products such as Esoterica etc, and they do work, but they dont contain the same safe ingredients as are found in the 7 in 1 lightening cream.  This one is not drying at all, it leaves skin very smooth.  I was expecting a larger jar, however it seems you dont need to use much, so it should last maybe a month and a half. As for now, 4 stars. If I see continued improvement, would up that to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great service.  Not seeing much change in my skin using twice daily.</li>
            <li> I have only had NaturaBright for less than a month. I don&#x27;t always remember to use it every day but so far, it seems to be helping. It is a smooth cream and I had no adverse reactions to the cream. I feel that using it as directed it will be beneficial in reducing my brown spots.</li>
            <li> Skin showed some lightening after a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I just started to use it and I feel it&#x27;s good for me it helps to tighten my skin and I hope it will also help my melisma to fade</li>
            <li> Helps with my melasma, I use this for day time and another product at night</li>
            <li> Hell no not good at all</li>
            <li> Im still waiting to see the difference after a jar and a half...</li>
            <li> The odor of the product is not pleasant but it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product . I have some spots in my arms. This is the only product that really sems to work.&lt;br /&gt;But I recomend you to buy two at least, because it comes in a very small presentation..</li>
            <li> The product was bought for my wife she said it work quite well she started seeing results in just around 3 weeks her skin started to clear her dark spots got lighter so I would recommend this product to Anyone</li>
            <li> Saw miniscule lightening after one month. Still looking for an effective skin lightener to remove melasmsa and age spots.</li>
            <li> works great, i will buy this again</li>
            <li> Using itI only for a short time I am unable to evaluate it fairly.  I do see some improvement with the lighting up my brown spot, but it is too soon to tell</li>
            <li> Overall this product so far so good. I have a dark spot on my face from when i got pregnant. So it has been bothering me . So when i got the chance to try it out as a sample with Karmas reviews i did . I have been using it for a few days and i can see a small difference. I usually have to use alot of concealer and powder to cover it up but have not had to this week. I will update my review later on once i give it more time. The bottle is on the small side but its not something you will use to cover your whole face . Smell is great. I have sensitive skin and i did not break out which is a plus. Its really hard for me to find products i can actually use on my face because i usually have to stop after day 1 due to the strong fragrances on them but not with this product.</li>
            <li> Im about 4/5 finished with this darling little blue jar.  Believe it or not, I used two bottles of my dermatologist&#x27;s dark-spot remover which did work, but it was unable to remove a couple of areas that NatureBright IS removing.  The bottom line:  it bettered my doctor&#x27;s formula -- with less money.  I do not know if NatureBright will fix my problem areas entirely, but I will keep using it for another month or two.  It took a long few weeks to see results, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up.  If my skin continues to show improvement I will give NatureBright 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added boon is that the cream, which smells a little like mayo, did NOT cause any breakouts, like vitamin C oil does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark spot removal requires ongoing maintenance, as sun-discolorations hide under the dermis, waiting to surface as the skin exfoliates over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep at it!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this product to test as a consumer and offer my opinion. When it first arrived, I was surprised how small the container was. Since I have age spots on my hands, I didn&#x27;t think it would go very far but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. I mask it by following up with my favorite scented hand cream. I understand though that it&#x27;s a consequence of an all natural product. What&#x27;s nice is that its very moisturizing, non greasy and your skin drinks it in quickly. It leaves my hands extremely soft. I use it twice a day as directed and in just two weeks I&#x27;m noticing that my skin tone is leveling out and the spots are getting lighter. It&#x27;s a nice product but I think it is a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve tried products from the drug store for half the price but they take so long to work that I never bought more.</li>
            <li> I think I would need to use it longer too o really give an honest opinion  but these are the things I found.  I think the product was easy to use although I wished it came in a larger quantity as I was trying to use it on my arms and hands as well as my face.  I have only used it for  maybe 2 to 3 weeks and I did notice some fading.  It says you need to use it twice a day for at least a month.  I wished it worked faster as I am very self conscious about these spots. I am already out of the product and need to reorder it so I can use it long enough to really give my complete review.</li>
            <li> I have freckle on my face, and I was expecting to see freckle got lightening. I have been applying this lightening lotion two times per day and using sunscreen every day, it has been more than one week from the first time I applied it, nothing got improved, all freckles are getting darker and darker.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the amazing reviews. I&#x27;m highly disappointed, it broke me out</li>
            <li> I like your product,  all ready seeing results.</li>
            <li> I just got this product today, but I was shocked when I  opened it, seems like it was already used. The contains  is half full. I will  start using it. I just hope  it works  . I am not sure if what rating , but for  now , it&#x27;s  2 .... I will rate it again when I  see  the results.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen a difference and my coworker noticed. After using bee&#x27;s, roseship oil, ponds has not help any. This one is good after only 7 days.</li>
            <li> This is really amazing works effectively at very first use.</li>
            <li> I just got the product. It was on time and excelent condition. It is too soon to see any results on my skin so i will update my review later about the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> I loved.It&#x27;s the best produc I ever used.</li>
            <li> I want to rate higher , since I just start using the cream for less than two weeks. But people around me start to mention that my face look smooth, that make me feel good. Give me time to finish the product then I will give a full review.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on my wifes hands where she had age spots developing.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color and I have malasma.  I bought this cream in April 2015 to help even out my skin tone and lighten dark areas. Today is August 1st and unfortunately, I cannot say this cream has helped with either of my problems.  It feels good on my skin, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.  Therefore, I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly and seems to be working as advertised.</li>
            <li> Kits really good for skin! Balance the skin. Thanks you!</li>
            <li> No effect on me. I used it for two weeks and dont see any difference.</li>
            <li> After one week, a large dark patch on my hand become noticeably lighter.  Two smaller ones are fading but not gone. I am still applying the ointment and hopefully the spots will be gone soon.</li>
            <li> Glad I won this, I&#x27;m  using it to remove my black spot left by acne. I will do another review on it when I finish it. But so far so good!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I developed two very prominent dark patches on my forehead from the sun.  I have been using this product at night and I have seen them really diminishing.  My skin looks brighter and clearer!  Great product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work on my age spots, although they keep coming back.  Still, there is a lightening effect with continued use.</li>
            <li> I am still trying your product. First, the product makes my black spots darker and the surrounding area lighter , just the opposite of my expectation. Do I need an extra supplement? Is there any better way to get better result? Thks.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have started to notice the aging process beginning. I have acne scars and melasma. I have tried about every product under the sun and nothing has really worked, especially for the melasma. When I read that this product was supposed to help with that I was extremely excited to be getting a sample of it and be able to share my experience with it here with you. The pod is very small but you don&#x27;t use a whole lot so I would think that this product will last for a while. I love that this product is made with natural ingredients because sometimes I wonder what the chemicals that are in other products you are using to remove that dark spots are doing to your skin in return! My melasma is mainly around my upper lip and to test this product out and I just used it in that area. I&#x27;ve used it day and night for 4 days now and I can honestly say that I am noticing a difference. The melasma is not completely gone but it does look diminished. Overall I think this is a great product that does what it says, it comes with a money back satisfaction guarantee so you have nothing to worry about!</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a day on a dark spot on my neck.  Absolutely no difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> With age comes aging skin and every women is always on the lookout for a product that will help them look younger and refresh our skin. I started using this product not sure what to expect but decided to give it a try. After using it now for some time I have noticed some of the dark spots on my face have become lighter, sun spots going away and overall my skin starting to look younger. I will continue to use this product and hope to continue seeing great results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Lightens dark spots&lt;br /&gt;Formulated from natural ingredients such as Kojic Acid, Kakadu Plum Extract, Vitamin C, Licorice, Arbutin and Curcuminoids&lt;br /&gt;Freckle remover&lt;br /&gt;Helps reduce sun spots&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients like Vitamin C, Kakadu Plum Extrac and Kojic Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I use multiple products at a time so it is hard to give a review and at first I was hesitant to give a review at all. I like the odorless, goes on colorless, clean feeling. I use it after I wash my face and under concealer. It allows a smooth finish, much better than not wearing anything under makeup because I would rather have pores filled with this than directly with makeup. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog pores. It is a very natural feeling product. I will continue to monitor the lightening effects.</li>
            <li> I received this 7 in 1 skin lightening cream for a  product review and I really love it. I have many scars that turned a very dark color when it was all said and done. I had surgery in two specific places that ended up getting a staph infection in them. Most staph infections end up leaving scars and when they do it is usually a dark brown to greyish black colored scar. I have been very self conscience about the scars and have tried many products on them. This one really is helping to lighten the discoloration. I have also been using it on the dark circles that are under my eyes. This cream is great for all skin types. I have very sensitive skin and I am using the cream on very delicate skin and I have not had any adverse reactions. A little bit of this cream goes a very long way. It is silky smooth and spreads evenly over your skin. This cream is packed with 7 active ingredients that help to fight the signs of aging and to lighten dark spots, regardless of the cause. I really like that there is a money back guarantee for this product, even if you have used it for longer than a year. If you are dissatisfied for any reason you can have your money back, no questions asked. You cannot beat that.</li>
            <li> Works only problem being it&#x27;s not enough.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!! Thank you!</li>
