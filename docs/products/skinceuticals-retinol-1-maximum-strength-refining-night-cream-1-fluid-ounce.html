            <li>Delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>(loved it, was as good as prescription strength retinol) but that company quit making it</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong!!  </li>
            <li>This is a nice feeling cream, and makes a pleasant night cream.</li>
            <li>It is a retinol and it is very potent.</li>
            <li>I was also very satisfied with the seller, GEO Marketing -</li>
            <li>Very potent as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with product, and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Very potent.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the dispensing mechanism and the product.  </li>
            <li>This product is as potent as it claims which is great because it is OTC.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and bright!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I started using it every night because I look so much better when I wake up!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and looks better !</li>
            <li>Will order more once I run out!,</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and excellent price.</li>
            <li>Was the perfect product to prep my skin for real Retin-A.</li>
            <li>but I thought if that one was so good, maybe one that is twice the price will be even better?</li>
            <li>It was my own fault for not building up to this formula.</li>
            <li>and not having to spend a fortune at beautician for a peeling.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and effective from the moment you start using it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my skin looks so much better!</li>
            <li>, however this product is only making it better, the difference of my skin and fine lines is incredible since I have started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions to make sure you get the best results.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and works amazingly well on overall appearance of wrinkles and problem skin.</li>
            <li>Have tried many retin-a products over the years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>My wife (who is 52) followed those directions, and is glad that she did, because this is indeed a very strong product, and your skin will peel.  </li>
            <li>Even better than Obagi.</li>
            <li>(more isn&#x27;t better).   </li>
            <li>and you are surely to see improvements.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it is working somewhat, just slower/less potent than I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave it try because now I can get all my refills online :-)</li>
            <li>Love this cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>sometimes what works for most of my esthetician&#x27;s clients doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>and I feel better.  </li>
            <li>During the day I use Skinceuticals serums - I&#x27;ve tried all of them and love them.  </li>
            <li>Reading the reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be a counterfeit thing, or burn my face off.  </li>
            <li>I used this product once on my crows feet which extend from my eyes to the top of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I thought my face would be able to handle it as I&#x27;ve used many over the counter retinol products, but after three days of night application my face was burning and peeling.</li>
            <li>but you have to make sure that you are wearing a sun block 50 spf and more&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>fast and great product</li>
            <li>Having used many retinol products, I did not expect this one to work as well as it does.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product I thought it would Ok, but it is better than ok.  </li>
            <li>But once that was over my skin had more of a glow.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel of it and</li>
            <li>even more the results on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and plan to continue to do so.</li>
            <li>but I think I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>more often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That stuff is almost magical.</li>
            <li>but if you want to use it i suggest once a week ok product</li>
            <li>Not my favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li>I think roc&#x27;s products are better and for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>that is a 2% Retinol, and I REALLY love it</li>
            <li>I thought maybe somehow this Skinceuticals was somehow better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a results snob more than a brand snob.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with acne, which I was fighting for many years now, so I tried a lot of things for it.</li>
            <li>but I still give it a five star rating because it is potent as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>Think it will help my skin look better with continued application.</li>
            <li>I love the skinceutical retinol.</li>
            <li>I did have the flakiness but not terrible</li>
            <li>I see a difference in the depth of the wrinkles on the top of my cheekbones under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I am sure I will love this as soon as I get used to its strength .</li>
            <li>I love skincueuticals and this retinol did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I have been using this products for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I will surely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen results because I&#x27;ve yet to be able to use it nightly.</li>
            <li>Excellent value, saved big $$.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking so much better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now at the suggestion of my esthetician to start an anti-aging regime and in particular that this was a great product</li>
            <li>My face is plumped out, but more surprisingly tho, my skin tone has been really improved.</li>
            <li>Not to forget, I put a lot of emphasis on face care and use many fine serums and creams including Biological Recherche and Sisley.</li>
            <li>This product was awesome on clearing my skin, but made it very dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I don&#x27;t have anywhere important I must be.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it thus far.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother, the complexion is refined and in my mirror I nearly lost some years;) Just an awesome product.</li>
            <li>If you have been using a retinol before your skin won&#x27;t react as strongly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong for my skin</li>
            <li>If this product is as strong as they say it is then</li>
            <li>This is really strong stuff.</li>
            <li>to strong... pealed my face...</li>
            <li>lucky to have pretty good skin</li>
            <li>Not bad, just ok.</li>
            <li>At  62, my skin was beginning to show fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I then ordered the 0.5 and am doing fine on it.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>Glad it was my first!</li>
            <li>I will always purchase from this company as their product was the most fresh container of Skinceuticals retinol I have purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my way to being make up free.  </li>
            <li>Came sealed under the cap &amp; genuine.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks great after only 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.  </li>
            <li>I have used Retin-A 0.05 cream of Cilag Ltd (Swiss) usually available in pharmacies for USD10 per 20g tube.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I used it nightly for about a week before I noticed light peeling.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth to the touch now.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it was working until I put too much on:)</li>
            <li>and I have fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Please be very cautious when going outdoors!!!  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on, my skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is easily applied, doesn&#x27;t smell much, and it gives a healthy glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>The product came (I ordered 2 items of this night cream) without the original SkinCeutical Box, both tubes were wrinkled and  looked like somebody used them before and then returned.</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely worth the price!  </li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant scent instead of the odor the generic retin a&#x27;s have.</li>
            <li>I started w a .15% first &amp; felt my skin ws acclimated enough after finishing tht tube &amp; went straight to the Skinceuticals 1.0% w no issues, just great skin!!</li>
            <li>This product really works!!!!!But be careful,if your skin is sensible use every other day and apply a rich moisturizer over this cream!!!I loved!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I recommend it for anyone who wants to get rid of fine lines because it actually works!!!</li>
            <li>Like many women I spend so much money on my skin.</li>
            <li>On second day I received comments on how good my skin was looking.  </li>
            <li>The retinol is very drying to the skin so be sure to use a good moisturizer the following day.  </li>
            <li>But seriously, seems to have the greatest strength I have ever seen in any OTC product .</li>
            <li>I used it mainly around my eye area and felt ok for two days..</li>
            <li>I love the product even more since I can actually get it out of the package.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the peeling, it tells me that it&#x27;s most likely revealing newer (better?)</li>
            <li>Overall great products dermatologist recommended, and reasonably priced when considering the alternatives to get these results.</li>
            <li>I will be coming back to update as I notice any changes to my skin, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Havent had the 1 retinol long , but i loved the .5</li>
            <li>Mine ws damaged during shipping &amp; Seller offered a replacement or refund, which was very much appreciated!!</li>
            <li>, I have a very sensitive skin, and I found a way to make sure the powerful retinol doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin:</li>
            <li>I only use this product at night and this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is really helping to smooth out the lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many lines -- I&#x27;m just in my early 30s -- but it almost got rid of them</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>AND MY SKIN PROVES</li>
            <li>Even the weaker stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li>At this point, I am still deciding if this was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>but I feel has been worth it.</li>
            <li>More like every other night after getting more used to it.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this a try due to all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I now use it every other night and its good.  </li>
            <li>And the reviews are right -- this stuff DOES work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start using it only once a month, because it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>The fine lines under my eyes  pretty much disappeared after that first three day consecutive application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty powerful for me</li>
            <li>The product did irritate my skin at first because this is powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>The new packaging is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>I look as though I&#x27;ve aged 5 years more after using it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Skinceuticals product for over a year and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Started out very intense.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>It is strong, and so must be used with caution on more sensitive parts of the face, but definitely works!</li>
            <li>Works great, I just need to be careful not to use too much because when I do, the skin around my eyes gets very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Experiencing some peeling is expected but the way face feels is amazing.</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do, thanks for being there when the product was needed!</li>
            <li>Can be drying, and cause some skin peeling, so go lite at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the first product I&#x27;ve used on my face</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve had a skin care routine</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will definitely see results.  </li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews most ppl only use a couple times a week.   </li>
            <li>I guess my face is enormous :)  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described in that it does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>For me its the best non prescription retinol in the market, all Skinceuticals products delivery its promises, expensive yes...</li>
            <li>I am glad I finally tried the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different retinol products with no results.</li>
            <li>I think it really works!</li>
            <li>I love the product and use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it every day at first.</li>
            <li>At first I used it twice and did not notice a difference</li>
            <li>This was not the first time I&#x27;d used Retinol.</li>
            <li>I have had multiple skin treatments and went with the most concentrated cream.....</li>
            <li>My face peeled pretty severely for a day or so.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to say it works great.</li>
            <li>But maybe those were first time users of Retinol, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t necessarily make it better.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thinking and I used it EVERY day for the first three or four days.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will continue to use.......in moderation, because I only need the size of a pea each day not a tablespoon.</li>
            <li>I see so many people here saying they stopped using this or only use this once a week because of the peeling.</li>
            <li>overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li>so after the yucky neutragena I decided to try this to see if it was like the la Roche brand and sure enough it works just as well.  </li>
            <li>Use sparingly, a very good product if you want some serious retinol!</li>
            <li>Authentic product, coming from and Esthetician whom has used this line in the past for professional spa services... Love the brand!</li>
            <li>I believe because the new skin is super soft and smooth....</li>
            <li>I mix daily with moisturizer and periodically alone under moisturizer for more intense effect.</li>
            <li>Very strong, be very careful using this.  </li>
            <li>Skinceuticals Retinol 1.0 is potent, in that it works, but no side effects lk dry &amp; peeling skin.</li>
            <li>The dispenser system makes it easy to use and apply, without contaminating the entire product with each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I will downgrade to .5 after my tube runs out, because I think this is simply too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is red, blotchy and peeling, so it definitely is a strong retinal.</li>
            <li>It is really pure 1% retinol.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this night cream has helped reduce fine lines that I was starting to develop.</li>
            <li>Studies show retinol helps diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, and my wife, who grew up in Southern California, used to put butter on her skin and bake in the sun.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after a few days, my skin was smooth and acne free.  </li>
            <li>Does not work like the real Retin-A.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The InstaNaturals really worked, very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this after much research, reading, and visiting with friends.</li>
            <li>This stuff really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin seems to feel firmer although brown spots have not faded as much as I thought they would</li>
            <li>Really will cause skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li>Really make my skin peel</li>
            <li>Great science behind it</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>After about five weeks, t does seem to be making a real improvement to the texture and appearance of my skin</li>
            <li>and I really like it:</li>
            <li>and I feel this product has helped much.</li>
            <li>It made my skin real flakey.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>There is really only one day, that if someone were to look at you up close, they would see a light peeling.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see any reason to pay twice as much.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Nice overall product, can&#x27;t wait to look younger!!</li>
            <li>Some people with sensitive skin might be better off starting with the .5%.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you start out slow with one to two times a week because other wise this product will make your skin peel off.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other creams and none has achieved anything like this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly a hormonal issue, but I very much wanted to avoid taking hormones to fix it.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m too lazy to go to a Dermatologist to get my own prescription</li>
            <li>In past I have used 1% retinol RX, this is just as effective.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I graduated from high school, people actually compliment me on my beautiful skin and want to know my secret.</li>
            <li>But now my skin has become much smoother than it was before I started using the Skinceuticals retinols, and it has a new glow.  </li>
            <li>It has made my face look smooth, clear and years younger.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product but use with caution.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this product still.</li>
            <li>My neck seems to be a little better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll concur with other reviewers in stating right off the bat that this product is very strong; please be careful when using it.  </li>
            <li>I only use this about 2 times a week right now because it&#x27;s still very new for my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as I was expecting though, based on other&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants to clear up their skin.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for awhile, I can really see a difference in this 59 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>The problem with on line skin product purchasing is normally their age and</li>
            <li>It does create a bit of a peeling (more of a flaking) effect a few days after beginning to use it.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning looking almost normal.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you want to remove the top dead skin on your face.</li>
            <li>Peeling, red, puffy right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>Cure aqua gel is my favorite exfoliator to use following on this, since it&#x27;s very gentle and removes all of the flaking dead skin.</li>
            <li>Used every other day at first and cut back as my skin started peeling very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It gives a new skin</li>
            <li>I used carefully under instruction and still got a red, puffy and swollen face and doesn&#x27;t seem to get better.</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After complete usage, I have had no effects whatsoever!</li>
            <li>I also bought another brand that was labeled as &amp;#34;Retrinal 0.05% Cream&amp;#34; and again, it was no better than the one I was using before just more $.</li>
            <li>Anyone starting out on any retinal products should not jump to the higher strength formula like I did.</li>
            <li>I think the 1% may be a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Wear a broad spectrum sunscreen always!!!   </li>
            <li>It definitely does give me positive results , however.  </li>
            <li>But definitely notice a positive change in my skin since using this.</li>
            <li>I had gotten so use to the lesser strength , I have to relearn the art of less is more.  </li>
            <li>May try choosing to use it less than I originally did and see what happens</li>
            <li>I like Obagi matte sunscreen or banana boat clear zinc oxide.   </li>
            <li>but I can clearly see results.</li>
            <li>The directions make it clear that you should start once or twice a week and then increase as your skin becomes accustomed to the product.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a fan so far...</li>
            <li>I can truly see a difference which surprised me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps my adult acne under control and my t zone</li>
            <li>I tested the cream on the tender underside of my forearm for a few days and didn&#x27;t see any performance - or irritation - so I felt comfortable giving it a go on my face.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and it is not too old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>I AM 78 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for people who have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The peeling surprised me but altho</li>
            <li>watch out you will get red and flaky but it does work very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult onset cystic acne for over a year now.</li>
            <li>but I had nowhere near that type of reaction to it</li>
            <li>Box was completely flatten inside a soft mailing envelope</li>
            <li>So far I have not noticed any change in my wrinkles, pores or sunspots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old and am using this product to combat sun damage.  </li>
            <li>You can imagine the brown spots and melasma that she developed as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks my sundamages are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>Actually I like it better because it is not quite as harsh.  </li>
            <li>I am skeptical about face products and would never write a good review if I didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li>Very creamy with less irritation despite the higher percentage.</li>
            <li>but when I needed clear skin the next day, I added a pea size of over the counter super hydrating moisturizer for dry hands and this worked.</li>
            <li>I took it easy as I have had reactions to skin creams in the past, however, my skin LOVES this.  </li>
            <li>How long before I can expect some positive results???</li>
            <li>I alternate evenings between lactic acid and retinol, and until your face is used to it, I very much suggest you follow their instructions and do the same.  </li>
            <li>This product is very strong and it burned a little so be careful!</li>
            <li>Last year I had a prescription for 2% Retinol from my dermatologist and it worked well for removing dark spots on my face, reducing wrinkles and making my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>When using alone I will start mid week, it takes a couple days, so peeling is mainly on weekend, to spare everyone else :0) .  </li>
            <li>The tiny skin bumps, clogged pores, scars and other skin imperfections have been reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY recommend that you do the same.  </li>
            <li>It took a week for my skin to get back to normal</li>
            <li>This is a must for your night skincare regimen, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it daily but twice a week, as your skin will peel (normal) renewing it</li>
            <li>Use it sparingly and not very often at first.  </li>
            <li>I like this new tube as opposed to the pump version because you can use every last drop!</li>
            <li>Of course, this cream hasn&#x27;t stopped the passing of time for me, but I can say that overall my skin looks quite a lot younger than my real age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;The Big Guns&amp;#34; - to be used only as directed and when your skin is ready.  </li>
            <li>I have not been using it for long at all, but I have noticed a slight reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I am not experiencing any major discomfort, but face is itchy and my eyes hurt when I see my reflection.</li>
            <li>I cannot even wash my face without a major burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I apply the cream at night every other day at most, and I follow with a little bit of almond oil.</li>
            <li>look forward to saving hundreds of dollars (A MONTH) by only (maybe) getting a basic facial now, along with consistent use of the retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They started with a major peel (Melanage), which got rid of about 35% of the melasma.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>I just try and be careful about how much I am using.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the leading acne treatments to clear it up, and a couple have worked somewhat for a short period of time, but Skinceuticals has been the only skin treatment that has completely healed my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li>With careful application this cream works very well for sun damage.</li>
            <li>I will use the rest of this up, but then I&#x27;m going back to my old cream.</li>
            <li>I did this because I&#x27;m 100% Italian with thick skin even though I&#x27;m in my mid-60s.....and didn&#x27;t expect any problems like someone with thinner, more tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;But this week, I found these peeling areas on various parts of my face....</li>
            <li>Used this product as instructed for a week and developed intense redness, skin felt raw and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have had the product for a few weeks and began using it right away.  </li>
            <li>my skin was noticeably softer,small brown blotches on forehead were gone and lines on forehead were not as pronounced.wpuld put on about a half hour before bedtime and wait till first thing in morning to wash face with water and than moisturize</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in wrinkles or dark circles but was pleasantly surprised at its ability to unclog my facial pores.  </li>
            <li>I have been using other retinal products which could very well be the reason I haven&#x27;t seen a reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>This sounds like what every other woman her age wants.  </li>
            <li>Yes I have some flaking skin and a little red but worth it already.</li>
            <li>Still follow directions (start with the milder strength, only use once every 2-3 days, work up to daily, etc) but your skin&#x27;s going to be sensitive</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I see a major difference and some of the spots I had hoped to change seem the same.</li>
            <li>I was using a prescription Retinol cream from my dermatologist, which became very expensive; and I wanted to try something new that would still be effective.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin which I think helps keep the flaking down.</li>
            <li>For the first three weeks the areas were dry due to the peeling from the product.</li>
            <li>I thought I had prepared my skin by using a weaker retinal before using this product, but evidently not long enough.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to use it since the first time which was a little over a month ago!</li>
            <li>I use it every other night on my whole face and then every night on any new little pimples that might be coming up</li>

            <li> Delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> (loved it, was as good as prescription strength retinol) but that company quit making it</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong!!  </li>
            <li> This is a nice feeling cream, and makes a pleasant night cream.</li>
            <li> It is a retinol and it is very potent.</li>
            <li> I was also very satisfied with the seller, GEO Marketing -</li>
            <li> Very potent as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, I will purchase it again.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the dispensing mechanism and the product.  </li>
            <li> This product is as potent as it claims which is great because it is OTC.</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and bright!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I started using it every night because I look so much better when I wake up!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and looks better !</li>
            <li> Will order more once I run out!,</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent price.</li>
            <li> Was the perfect product to prep my skin for real Retin-A.</li>
            <li> but I thought if that one was so good, maybe one that is twice the price will be even better?</li>
            <li> It was my own fault for not building up to this formula.</li>
            <li> and not having to spend a fortune at beautician for a peeling.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and effective from the moment you start using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my skin looks so much better!</li>
            <li> , however this product is only making it better, the difference of my skin and fine lines is incredible since I have started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions to make sure you get the best results.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and works amazingly well on overall appearance of wrinkles and problem skin.</li>
            <li> Have tried many retin-a products over the years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> My wife (who is 52) followed those directions, and is glad that she did, because this is indeed a very strong product, and your skin will peel.  </li>
            <li> Even better than Obagi.</li>
            <li> (more isn&#x27;t better).   </li>
            <li> and you are surely to see improvements.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> so I guess it is working somewhat, just slower/less potent than I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave it try because now I can get all my refills online :-)</li>
            <li> Love this cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  </li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> sometimes what works for most of my esthetician&#x27;s clients doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> and I feel better.  </li>
            <li> During the day I use Skinceuticals serums - I&#x27;ve tried all of them and love them.  </li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be a counterfeit thing, or burn my face off.  </li>
            <li> I used this product once on my crows feet which extend from my eyes to the top of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I thought my face would be able to handle it as I&#x27;ve used many over the counter retinol products, but after three days of night application my face was burning and peeling.</li>
            <li> but you have to make sure that you are wearing a sun block 50 spf and more&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> fast and great product</li>
            <li> Having used many retinol products, I did not expect this one to work as well as it does.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I thought it would Ok, but it is better than ok.  </li>
            <li> But once that was over my skin had more of a glow.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel of it and</li>
            <li> even more the results on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and plan to continue to do so.</li>
            <li> but I think I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> more often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That stuff is almost magical.</li>
            <li> but if you want to use it i suggest once a week ok product</li>
            <li> Not my favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li> I think roc&#x27;s products are better and for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> that is a 2% Retinol, and I REALLY love it</li>
            <li> I thought maybe somehow this Skinceuticals was somehow better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a results snob more than a brand snob.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with acne, which I was fighting for many years now, so I tried a lot of things for it.</li>
            <li> but I still give it a five star rating because it is potent as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Think it will help my skin look better with continued application.</li>
            <li> I love the skinceutical retinol.</li>
            <li> I did have the flakiness but not terrible</li>
            <li> I see a difference in the depth of the wrinkles on the top of my cheekbones under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I am sure I will love this as soon as I get used to its strength .</li>
            <li> I love skincueuticals and this retinol did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li> I will surely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen results because I&#x27;ve yet to be able to use it nightly.</li>
            <li> Excellent value, saved big $$.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking so much better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now at the suggestion of my esthetician to start an anti-aging regime and in particular that this was a great product</li>
            <li> My face is plumped out, but more surprisingly tho, my skin tone has been really improved.</li>
            <li> Not to forget, I put a lot of emphasis on face care and use many fine serums and creams including Biological Recherche and Sisley.</li>
            <li> This product was awesome on clearing my skin, but made it very dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I don&#x27;t have anywhere important I must be.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it thus far.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, the complexion is refined and in my mirror I nearly lost some years;) Just an awesome product.</li>
            <li> If you have been using a retinol before your skin won&#x27;t react as strongly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong for my skin</li>
            <li> If this product is as strong as they say it is then</li>
            <li> This is really strong stuff.</li>
            <li> to strong... pealed my face...</li>
            <li> lucky to have pretty good skin</li>
            <li> Not bad, just ok.</li>
            <li> At  62, my skin was beginning to show fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I then ordered the 0.5 and am doing fine on it.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> Glad it was my first!</li>
            <li> I will always purchase from this company as their product was the most fresh container of Skinceuticals retinol I have purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my way to being make up free.  </li>
            <li> Came sealed under the cap &amp; genuine.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks great after only 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.  </li>
            <li> I have used Retin-A 0.05 cream of Cilag Ltd (Swiss) usually available in pharmacies for USD10 per 20g tube.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I used it nightly for about a week before I noticed light peeling.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth to the touch now.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it was working until I put too much on:)</li>
            <li> and I have fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Please be very cautious when going outdoors!!!  </li>
            <li> When I first put it on, my skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is easily applied, doesn&#x27;t smell much, and it gives a healthy glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> The product came (I ordered 2 items of this night cream) without the original SkinCeutical Box, both tubes were wrinkled and  looked like somebody used them before and then returned.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely worth the price!  </li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant scent instead of the odor the generic retin a&#x27;s have.</li>
            <li> I started w a .15% first &amp; felt my skin ws acclimated enough after finishing tht tube &amp; went straight to the Skinceuticals 1.0% w no issues, just great skin!!</li>
            <li> This product really works!!!!!But be careful,if your skin is sensible use every other day and apply a rich moisturizer over this cream!!!I loved!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I recommend it for anyone who wants to get rid of fine lines because it actually works!!!</li>
            <li> Like many women I spend so much money on my skin.</li>
            <li> On second day I received comments on how good my skin was looking.  </li>
            <li> The retinol is very drying to the skin so be sure to use a good moisturizer the following day.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, seems to have the greatest strength I have ever seen in any OTC product .</li>
            <li> I used it mainly around my eye area and felt ok for two days..</li>
            <li> I love the product even more since I can actually get it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the peeling, it tells me that it&#x27;s most likely revealing newer (better?)</li>
            <li> Overall great products dermatologist recommended, and reasonably priced when considering the alternatives to get these results.</li>
            <li> I will be coming back to update as I notice any changes to my skin, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Havent had the 1 retinol long , but i loved the .5</li>
            <li> Mine ws damaged during shipping &amp; Seller offered a replacement or refund, which was very much appreciated!!</li>
            <li> , I have a very sensitive skin, and I found a way to make sure the powerful retinol doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin:</li>
            <li> I only use this product at night and this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is really helping to smooth out the lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many lines -- I&#x27;m just in my early 30s -- but it almost got rid of them</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> AND MY SKIN PROVES</li>
            <li> Even the weaker stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li> At this point, I am still deciding if this was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> but I feel has been worth it.</li>
            <li> More like every other night after getting more used to it.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try due to all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I now use it every other night and its good.  </li>
            <li> And the reviews are right -- this stuff DOES work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start using it only once a month, because it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> The fine lines under my eyes  pretty much disappeared after that first three day consecutive application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerful for me</li>
            <li> The product did irritate my skin at first because this is powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li> The new packaging is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I look as though I&#x27;ve aged 5 years more after using it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Skinceuticals product for over a year and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Started out very intense.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> It is strong, and so must be used with caution on more sensitive parts of the face, but definitely works!</li>
            <li> Works great, I just need to be careful not to use too much because when I do, the skin around my eyes gets very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Experiencing some peeling is expected but the way face feels is amazing.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, thanks for being there when the product was needed!</li>
            <li> Can be drying, and cause some skin peeling, so go lite at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first product I&#x27;ve used on my face</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve had a skin care routine</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you will definitely see results.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews most ppl only use a couple times a week.   </li>
            <li> I guess my face is enormous :)  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as described in that it does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> For me its the best non prescription retinol in the market, all Skinceuticals products delivery its promises, expensive yes...</li>
            <li> I am glad I finally tried the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different retinol products with no results.</li>
            <li> I think it really works!</li>
            <li> I love the product and use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it every day at first.</li>
            <li> At first I used it twice and did not notice a difference</li>
            <li> This was not the first time I&#x27;d used Retinol.</li>
            <li> I have had multiple skin treatments and went with the most concentrated cream.....</li>
            <li> My face peeled pretty severely for a day or so.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to say it works great.</li>
            <li> But maybe those were first time users of Retinol, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t necessarily make it better.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thinking and I used it EVERY day for the first three or four days.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to use.......in moderation, because I only need the size of a pea each day not a tablespoon.</li>
            <li> I see so many people here saying they stopped using this or only use this once a week because of the peeling.</li>
            <li> overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> so after the yucky neutragena I decided to try this to see if it was like the la Roche brand and sure enough it works just as well.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly, a very good product if you want some serious retinol!</li>
            <li> Authentic product, coming from and Esthetician whom has used this line in the past for professional spa services... Love the brand!</li>
            <li> I believe because the new skin is super soft and smooth....</li>
            <li> I mix daily with moisturizer and periodically alone under moisturizer for more intense effect.</li>
            <li> Very strong, be very careful using this.  </li>
            <li> Skinceuticals Retinol 1.0 is potent, in that it works, but no side effects lk dry &amp; peeling skin.</li>
            <li> The dispenser system makes it easy to use and apply, without contaminating the entire product with each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I will downgrade to .5 after my tube runs out, because I think this is simply too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is red, blotchy and peeling, so it definitely is a strong retinal.</li>
            <li> It is really pure 1% retinol.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this night cream has helped reduce fine lines that I was starting to develop.</li>
            <li> Studies show retinol helps diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, and my wife, who grew up in Southern California, used to put butter on her skin and bake in the sun.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after a few days, my skin was smooth and acne free.  </li>
            <li> Does not work like the real Retin-A.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The InstaNaturals really worked, very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after much research, reading, and visiting with friends.</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin seems to feel firmer although brown spots have not faded as much as I thought they would</li>
            <li> Really will cause skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li> Really make my skin peel</li>
            <li> Great science behind it</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li> After about five weeks, t does seem to be making a real improvement to the texture and appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> and I really like it:</li>
            <li> and I feel this product has helped much.</li>
            <li> It made my skin real flakey.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> There is really only one day, that if someone were to look at you up close, they would see a light peeling.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see any reason to pay twice as much.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Nice overall product, can&#x27;t wait to look younger!!</li>
            <li> Some people with sensitive skin might be better off starting with the .5%.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you start out slow with one to two times a week because other wise this product will make your skin peel off.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other creams and none has achieved anything like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly a hormonal issue, but I very much wanted to avoid taking hormones to fix it.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m too lazy to go to a Dermatologist to get my own prescription</li>
            <li> In past I have used 1% retinol RX, this is just as effective.</li>
            <li> and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For the first time since I graduated from high school, people actually compliment me on my beautiful skin and want to know my secret.</li>
            <li> But now my skin has become much smoother than it was before I started using the Skinceuticals retinols, and it has a new glow.  </li>
            <li> It has made my face look smooth, clear and years younger.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product but use with caution.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this product still.</li>
            <li> My neck seems to be a little better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll concur with other reviewers in stating right off the bat that this product is very strong; please be careful when using it.  </li>
            <li> I only use this about 2 times a week right now because it&#x27;s still very new for my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as I was expecting though, based on other&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants to clear up their skin.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for awhile, I can really see a difference in this 59 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> The problem with on line skin product purchasing is normally their age and</li>
            <li> It does create a bit of a peeling (more of a flaking) effect a few days after beginning to use it.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning looking almost normal.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you want to remove the top dead skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Peeling, red, puffy right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> Cure aqua gel is my favorite exfoliator to use following on this, since it&#x27;s very gentle and removes all of the flaking dead skin.</li>
            <li> Used every other day at first and cut back as my skin started peeling very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It gives a new skin</li>
            <li> I used carefully under instruction and still got a red, puffy and swollen face and doesn&#x27;t seem to get better.</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After complete usage, I have had no effects whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I also bought another brand that was labeled as &amp;#34;Retrinal 0.05% Cream&amp;#34; and again, it was no better than the one I was using before just more $.</li>
            <li> Anyone starting out on any retinal products should not jump to the higher strength formula like I did.</li>
            <li> I think the 1% may be a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Wear a broad spectrum sunscreen always!!!   </li>
            <li> It definitely does give me positive results , however.  </li>
            <li> But definitely notice a positive change in my skin since using this.</li>
            <li> I had gotten so use to the lesser strength , I have to relearn the art of less is more.  </li>
            <li> May try choosing to use it less than I originally did and see what happens</li>
            <li> I like Obagi matte sunscreen or banana boat clear zinc oxide.   </li>
            <li> but I can clearly see results.</li>
            <li> The directions make it clear that you should start once or twice a week and then increase as your skin becomes accustomed to the product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a fan so far...</li>
            <li> I can truly see a difference which surprised me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps my adult acne under control and my t zone</li>
            <li> I tested the cream on the tender underside of my forearm for a few days and didn&#x27;t see any performance - or irritation - so I felt comfortable giving it a go on my face.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it is not too old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> I AM 78 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for people who have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The peeling surprised me but altho</li>
            <li> watch out you will get red and flaky but it does work very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult onset cystic acne for over a year now.</li>
            <li> but I had nowhere near that type of reaction to it</li>
            <li> Box was completely flatten inside a soft mailing envelope</li>
            <li> So far I have not noticed any change in my wrinkles, pores or sunspots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and am using this product to combat sun damage.  </li>
            <li> You can imagine the brown spots and melasma that she developed as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks my sundamages are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> Actually I like it better because it is not quite as harsh.  </li>
            <li> I am skeptical about face products and would never write a good review if I didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> Very creamy with less irritation despite the higher percentage.</li>
            <li> but when I needed clear skin the next day, I added a pea size of over the counter super hydrating moisturizer for dry hands and this worked.</li>
            <li> I took it easy as I have had reactions to skin creams in the past, however, my skin LOVES this.  </li>
            <li> How long before I can expect some positive results???</li>
            <li> I alternate evenings between lactic acid and retinol, and until your face is used to it, I very much suggest you follow their instructions and do the same.  </li>
            <li> This product is very strong and it burned a little so be careful!</li>
            <li> Last year I had a prescription for 2% Retinol from my dermatologist and it worked well for removing dark spots on my face, reducing wrinkles and making my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> When using alone I will start mid week, it takes a couple days, so peeling is mainly on weekend, to spare everyone else :0) .  </li>
            <li> The tiny skin bumps, clogged pores, scars and other skin imperfections have been reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY recommend that you do the same.  </li>
            <li> It took a week for my skin to get back to normal</li>
            <li> This is a must for your night skincare regimen, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it daily but twice a week, as your skin will peel (normal) renewing it</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly and not very often at first.  </li>
            <li> I like this new tube as opposed to the pump version because you can use every last drop!</li>
            <li> Of course, this cream hasn&#x27;t stopped the passing of time for me, but I can say that overall my skin looks quite a lot younger than my real age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Big Guns&amp;#34; - to be used only as directed and when your skin is ready.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using it for long at all, but I have noticed a slight reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am not experiencing any major discomfort, but face is itchy and my eyes hurt when I see my reflection.</li>
            <li> I cannot even wash my face without a major burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I apply the cream at night every other day at most, and I follow with a little bit of almond oil.</li>
            <li> look forward to saving hundreds of dollars (A MONTH) by only (maybe) getting a basic facial now, along with consistent use of the retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They started with a major peel (Melanage), which got rid of about 35% of the melasma.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> I just try and be careful about how much I am using.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the leading acne treatments to clear it up, and a couple have worked somewhat for a short period of time, but Skinceuticals has been the only skin treatment that has completely healed my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li> With careful application this cream works very well for sun damage.</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of this up, but then I&#x27;m going back to my old cream.</li>
            <li> I did this because I&#x27;m 100% Italian with thick skin even though I&#x27;m in my mid-60s.....and didn&#x27;t expect any problems like someone with thinner, more tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;But this week, I found these peeling areas on various parts of my face....</li>
            <li> Used this product as instructed for a week and developed intense redness, skin felt raw and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have had the product for a few weeks and began using it right away.  </li>
            <li> my skin was noticeably softer,small brown blotches on forehead were gone and lines on forehead were not as pronounced.wpuld put on about a half hour before bedtime and wait till first thing in morning to wash face with water and than moisturize</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in wrinkles or dark circles but was pleasantly surprised at its ability to unclog my facial pores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using other retinal products which could very well be the reason I haven&#x27;t seen a reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> This sounds like what every other woman her age wants.  </li>
            <li> Yes I have some flaking skin and a little red but worth it already.</li>
            <li> Still follow directions (start with the milder strength, only use once every 2-3 days, work up to daily, etc) but your skin&#x27;s going to be sensitive</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I see a major difference and some of the spots I had hoped to change seem the same.</li>
            <li> I was using a prescription Retinol cream from my dermatologist, which became very expensive; and I wanted to try something new that would still be effective.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin which I think helps keep the flaking down.</li>
            <li> For the first three weeks the areas were dry due to the peeling from the product.</li>
            <li> I thought I had prepared my skin by using a weaker retinal before using this product, but evidently not long enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use it since the first time which was a little over a month ago!</li>
            <li> I use it every other night on my whole face and then every night on any new little pimples that might be coming up</li>
            <li> have pretty sensitive skin AND am prone to psoriasis (on my scalp only, but my other family members have it badly on their faces etc), so I should have been even more careful and only done it once a week to start with.  </li>
            <li> Due to the price, I will continue to use this product and maybe due to the condition of my skin, a real change is going to take longer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long and only apply it 2 times a week with several days in between applications.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I saw dark spots on the person for whom I had bought it completely disappear.</li>
            <li> i look like I have a sunburn and my eyes look red and strange.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for long enough to tell how well it will work on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see any results yet, apart from some peeling and burning.</li>
            <li> I have never seen any pealing, any skin changes, no redness (if you apply too much) or any other typical Retinol effects.</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t follow the advice of the other reviewers, put to much on, looked a mess.  </li>
            <li> Since I have only used it every other day for only a week, it seems to have met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Only use a tiny amount every other day to avoid your face from peeling.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The peeling is horrible, but the end result is fresh baby soft, spot free skin.  </li>
            <li> A pea sized amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Do not yet know the long term results yet.</li>
            <li> how long they have been sitting on the shelf.</li>
            <li> My forehead is not near as defined by the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> One tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so decided to use it daily and at that point I started seeing it begin to work and had to back down a bit.  </li>
            <li> This Retinol product is the same 1% I have used via prescription only half the cost.</li>
            <li> so this was a bit of a shock, and left me looking a little strange at work with a swollen, peeling, red face.</li>
            <li> Just now my skin is adjusting and I will apply it every 3rd night, then ease into every other night.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waged this long to buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> do use other products from this same brand.</li>
            <li> I backed off using any other product with &amp;#34;actives&amp;#34; and extra exfoliation during the adjustment period, which took weeks</li>
            <li> I caution anyone using a retinol for the first time, go slow!</li>
            <li> When I did put foundation on, it looked as if my skin was dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> My skin is can be dry.</li>
            <li> She also uses the Skinceuticals Resveratrol at night, as well as their pigment corrector and overnight dry moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had been using neutragena rapid wrinkle repair ( because the price was much cheaper) and can honestly say that after about 6 months of use with it, my skin was awful!  </li>
            <li> so I just back off a few days before I go back to it.  </li>
            <li> In those areas - red acne scars have all but disappeared and dark sun damage is fading.</li>
            <li> For all of my adult life, I have had small acne bumps under the surface of the skin all over my face.</li>
            <li> After two weeks my skin turned red and peeled slightly in areas.  </li>
            <li> Before this I used the same product in half the strength, but now my skin tolerates the maximum strength retinol.  </li>
            <li> It has turned my skin red and it is slightly peeling which is what you want to increase cell turn over.</li>
            <li> I mean wow!  </li>
            <li> There has been little to no real reaction such as redness or burning.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines are no where near as bad as they were when I started with Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li> Lol, I look awful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since cut back to using it once or twice a week, and only on my chin and jawline, where I know it won&#x27;t irritate delicate skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the MASSIVE amount of peeling after one use.</li>
            <li> so results are harder to obtain.   </li>
            <li> Follow directions carefully.</li>
            <li> If you get red and irritated...just wait a few days and start again.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It says to use a pea size amount and to only use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no reaction to this at all.</li>
            <li> I did notice that when I went in the sun, even with a heavy layer of sunscreen, my face stung a bit and got red, but it didn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> Even being careful, I looked like I had a sunburn for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> You will get sensitive and a little raw and flaky.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and do be careful to avoid the creases around the nose....</li>
            <li> After a week of using it every other day I wasn&#x27;t seeing anything happening</li>
            <li> I had small pimples that are disappearing daily.  </li>
            <li> As some of the other women mentioned in their reviews...it is quite strong.after</li>
            <li> I have used Retinol several times in the past and it works.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate skin if used if directed, would  use their other products</li>
            <li> But try every other day if you get irritation.  </li>
            <li> I use it every two other days</li>
            <li> After this I started using it every other night</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of retinol and found them ineffective by comparison.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other that measures up to it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t even shop other brands.</li>
            <li> Use every other day until acclimated, I also started out at the .5%.</li>
            <li> She ordered this Retinol cream, in addition to other Skinceuticals products.</li>
            <li> It digs under the skin to get rid of any acne, including painful cystic acne, pimples , white heads black heads, scars old and new and just erases them away.  </li>
            <li> After not having any retinol on my face and using this I had slight peeling (as is expected from a retinol)</li>
            <li> The second week I had sufficient peeling, makeup only made it look worse</li>
            <li> --I can&#x27;t comment on whether this would work well for wrinkles, or for severe active acne.</li>
            <li> Got this product for wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I hope I see a difference in wrinkles and dark circles soon.</li>
            <li> I probably should have started out with the 0.05 strength, as I have needed to start slow, with application only 2 x&#x27;s a week.  </li>
            <li> I really never want to be without this product; I know it works because it gets rid of dead skin cells and has help prevent facila lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> But be careful it will make your skin peel if you use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if using everyday as it may burn the skin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed smaller pores, less surface congestion (small little whiteheads), and undereye lines have almost disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I am going to have to go down to the .5 strength.</li>
            <li> Start using it a few nights a week, then every other night, then every night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the half strength of this and see if I can&#x27;t work up to this max strength.</li>
            <li> Still get slight peeling, but no redness.</li>
            <li> For the price of a tube you can get tightened pores, smoother texture and less hormonal acne</li>
            <li> I know 1.0 % is less than 2.0%, but my 2% never made me peel, so</li>
            <li> Has changed my skin in less than a week.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - this tube lasts me for at least 5 months.</li>
            <li> In other words, I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that just doesn&#x27;t work well for my type of skin or doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> If I use it every day it can make my face sting a little and itch</li>
            <li> My skin is still peeling a little bit, but not severely...  </li>
            <li> It is a little thicker</li>
            <li> and it is a little too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li> I had been using my moms prescription retinol cream that was too harsh for her..</li>
            <li> I have been using 0.5 retinol for a few months and decided to go stronger.  </li>
            <li> Be careful of this dose if your skin is retinol naive.</li>
            <li> This year I wanted to finish up a few spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> plus I hadn&#x27;t anticipated was that I have a glow missing for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and already notice an improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have few wrinkles</li>
            <li> I use this Retinol cream for a few weeks now and can see a difference.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t use this cream everyday unlike a close friend of mine.</li>
            <li> My skin got so dried out, it was almost like getting a chemical peal.</li>
            <li> I got severe Rush on my throat and face after few days of using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my from lines for a few months now, and while I don&#x27;t ever expect them to disappear totally, they are markedly decreased in severity.</li>
            <li> When the peeling subsided I was amazed that the lines are shorter and much less noticeable and some are even gone!</li>
            <li> No longer pale and washed out.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, start out really slow to avoid irritation.  </li>
            <li> No more dark circles or lines under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> I applied it everyday for 2 weeks with very little results.</li>
            <li> This cream usually does wonders, however it does feel a bit too harsh, with peeling all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> for some reason this area can get really raw and sore.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little drier than the prescription one that I was using, but you will peel after about three days (at least this is my experience).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a face lift in a tube, but it does get rid of dullness and small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Use no more than directed.</li>
            <li> I can tell a small difference already.</li>
            <li> No more pepperoni pizza face.</li>
            <li> , no more pimple poppin, or squeezing .  </li>
            <li> I have used stronger products in the past but couldn&#x27;t find what I used before.  </li>
            <li> That effect has continued over the past month or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will ever stop.</li>
            <li> It works for a day then the next day you use it, it looks like it makes your wrinklles look worse not good for youner skin</li>
            <li> Nope... not better, just twice the price.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my late 20s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you must transition slowly because it is stronger.  </li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m not mistaken either sold out to skincueticals or the la Roche brand changed their name to skincueticals (not completely positive on that so please forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong)</li>
            <li> It leaves skin vulnerable to the sun and other elements.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about their skincare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve beaten back the worst of it through diet changes, a huge list of supplements, and acupuncture, but I am still very unhappy with my skin</li>
            <li> I had bad experiences with the pump bottle packaging of this same product.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way!  </li>
            <li> after about the third application (every other day), holy crap!  </li>
            <li> It was very disappointing to send them back.</li>
            <li> have never experienced any burning but again, I have very thick tough skin.</li>
            <li> It was a bit irritating in the beginning, and caused quite a bit of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My wife was not happy with that reduction, so she has continued to search for products to lighten the skin and brown spots, as well as reduce wrinkles and stop the aging process.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced something like this in my life.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, poor and dangerous choice,  wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works!</li>
            <li> Over application will result in dry, irritated skin; don&#x27;t complain about this, there are plenty of worthless creams you can slather on to no effect.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not repurchasing, not worth a bunny or beagles life :(</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I will order again because it&#x27;s rather expensive for marginal results.</li>
            <li> Sad to know that this seller just trying to make  money on SkinCeuticals name by selling suspicious items.</li>
            <li> But it is not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> So the lesson I learned was, expensive price and high-brow names</li>
            <li> and unfortunately you have to go through it to get results.</li>
            <li> ITS PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> I had to take a sick day at work because my face hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> wish I could post before and after pictures. :(</li>
            <li> This crap doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> packaging was awful.  </li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I probably should have started out with the 0.05 strength, as I have needed to start slow, with application only 2 x&#x27;s a week.  Just now my skin is adjusting and I will apply it every 3rd night, then ease into every other night.  I have noticed smaller pores, less surface congestion (small little whiteheads), and undereye lines have almost disappeared.  So I&#x27;m a fan so far...</li>
            <li> This is a brand that my dermatologist dispenses.  It is really pure 1% retinol.  Use it with care.  I use it once a day with a break every three or four days.  My neck seems to be a little better.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works. Superior results!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, thanks for being there when the product was needed!</li>
            <li> This crap doesn&#x27;t work. I used carefully under instruction and still got a red, puffy and swollen face and doesn&#x27;t seem to get better.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It does everything it claims to do. Even better than Obagi.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of my acne (hormones!) over night. A pea sized amount goes a long way. Can be drying, and cause some skin peeling, so go lite at first.</li>
            <li> Very strong, be very careful using this.  If you have been using a retinol before your skin won&#x27;t react as strongly.  Use sparingly, a very good product if you want some serious retinol!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife. Fast delivery and excellent price.</li>
            <li> this works... almost too good. I have to be careful not to use too much otherwise I will peel for days. Does its job! very happy. highly recommend. Also great customer service.</li>
            <li> Arrived without product instructions insert in a zip lock bag. Obviously a re-packaged product. Since this product contains retinol, caution must be used when applying.</li>
            <li> Does not work like the real Retin-A. I applied it everyday for 2 weeks with very little results.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!  Please be very cautious when going outdoors!!!  Wear a broad spectrum sunscreen always!!!   I like Obagi matte sunscreen or banana boat clear zinc oxide.   I only use this product at night and this product is amazing.  It&#x27;s not the first product I&#x27;ve used on my face and it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve had a skin care routine so results are harder to obtain.   I can truly see a difference which surprised me and I will definitely buy again and purchase some for gifts!! For me One tube lasts a couple of months.  Use sparingly (more isn&#x27;t better).   Just stick with it and I&#x27;m sure you will definitely see results.  After reading some of the reviews most ppl only use a couple times a week.   Great skin takes time and doesn&#x27;t happen over night so stick with a skin care regimen  am and pm and you are surely to see improvements.  Also sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen is a must, rain or shine!!</li>
            <li> It is a retinol and it is very potent. Follow directions carefully. I have had a lot of peeling and redness, but it takes time to get used to retinols.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I had been using my moms prescription retinol cream that was too harsh for her.. This one is definitely weaker (not the same form of vitamin A as prescription lotions). Not bad, just ok. After not having any retinol on my face and using this I had slight peeling (as is expected from a retinol) so I guess it is working somewhat, just slower/less potent than I wanted. If I&#x27;m too lazy to go to a Dermatologist to get my own prescription I&#x27;ll probably order this one again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit- this company tests on animals so I&#x27;m not repurchasing, not worth a bunny or beagles life :(</li>
            <li> I prefer the 1.0 because of its strength. Experiencing some peeling is expected but the way face feels is amazing.</li>
            <li> This Cyrene has made my popes smaller and skin look tighter. I have been using it for 3 weeks and still only use it twice a week. It&#x27;s pretty powerful for me</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and works amazingly well on overall appearance of wrinkles and problem skin.</li>
            <li> Love this. Hope to see some results in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need prescription strength retinol if you can buy this one on Amazon. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it try because now I can get all my refills online :-)</li>
            <li> Love this cream.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my adult acne under control and my t zone&lt;br /&gt;I use it both day and night and sunscreen in my powder for daytime</li>
            <li> Since I have only used it every other day for only a week, it seems to have met my expectations.  My skin has begun to peal.</li>
            <li> was not going as great a job as the all in one InstaNaturals. I compared these products couple of weeks side by side. The InstaNaturals really worked, very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have had the product for a few weeks and began using it right away.  After a week of using it every other day I wasn&#x27;t seeing anything happening so decided to use it daily and at that point I started seeing it begin to work and had to back down a bit.  Do not yet know the long term results yet.</li>
            <li> At  62, my skin was beginning to show fine lines and wrinkles. I decided to try this after much research, reading, and visiting with friends. This is really helping to smooth out the lines and wrinkles. I use it every night and it has even helped to reduce scaring I had from skin cancer removal on the bridge of my nose. A great product!!</li>
            <li> Will never give this product up!</li>
            <li> Another quality product from SkinCeuticals</li>
            <li> I already see visible change in on my skin.  I had small pimples that are disappearing daily.  I only use this at night. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and it is the best.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  I have used it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I have been using 0.5 retinol for a few months and decided to go stronger.  I love this product but you must transition slowly because it is stronger.  I did get peeling but when I needed clear skin the next day, I added a pea size of over the counter super hydrating moisturizer for dry hands and this worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now at the suggestion of my esthetician to start an anti-aging regime and in particular that this was a great product (I&#x27;m in my late 20s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a lot of people here, I&#x27;m not overwhelmed by this product.  I think my skin has gotten softer, but it&#x27;s not helping with reducing my pore size or get rid of the occasional break out.  I am Asian, so sometimes what works for most of my esthetician&#x27;s clients doesn&#x27;t work for me (she does not specialize in ethnic skin issues).  In other words, I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that just doesn&#x27;t work well for my type of skin or doesn&#x27;t work well generally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will order again because it&#x27;s rather expensive for marginal results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll concur with other reviewers in stating right off the bat that this product is very strong; please be careful when using it.  I find that using it 2 days on, 2 days off works best for me.  It definitely does give me positive results , however.  No more dark circles or lines under my eyes!  I highly recommend this product but use with caution.</li>
            <li> Combining this, a lactic acid, a simple cream with ceramides and adding a probiotic to my diet has entirely rid of the cystic acne popping up all over my face the minute I stopped nursing my son well over a year ago.  It&#x27;s clearly a hormonal issue, but I very much wanted to avoid taking hormones to fix it.  I only get a clog here and there now, my texture is evening out, the red marks are fading over time.  This stuff really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube will last me about 3-4 mos.  I have to use 1.5-2 pea-sized globs.  I guess my face is enormous :)  I think I will downgrade to .5 after my tube runs out, because I think this is simply too strong for me.  I alternate evenings between lactic acid and retinol, and until your face is used to it, I very much suggest you follow their instructions and do the same.  I learned the hard way!  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The product came (I ordered 2 items of this night cream) without the original SkinCeutical Box, both tubes were wrinkled and  looked like somebody used them before and then returned. It was very disappointing to send them back. I like Skinceuticals product and used retinol 1.0 before. Sad to know that this seller just trying to make  money on SkinCeuticals name by selling suspicious items.</li>
            <li> I started using this a week ago.. I used it mainly around my eye area and felt ok for two days.. (i only used it once).. day 3 i look like I have a sunburn and my eyes look red and strange.  I used aloe vera and I feel better.  I&#x27;d definitely start with the lower strength next time around.  Nice overall product, can&#x27;t wait to look younger!!</li>
            <li> I noticed results after a few days, my skin was smooth and acne free.  After two weeks my skin turned red and peeled slightly in areas.  THEN I started to notice hyperpigmentation on my cheeks--even with sunblock.  I&#x27;m going to start using it only once a month, because it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong for my skin and I had no problem with actual Retin-A. My skin is red, blotchy and peeling, so it definitely is a strong retinal. I tried going every third night and still get massive peeling. I&#x27;m going to try the half strength of this and see if I can&#x27;t work up to this max strength. I thought I had prepared my skin by using a weaker retinal before using this product, but evidently not long enough. Lol, I look awful and so glad I don&#x27;t have anywhere important I must be. I am not experiencing any major discomfort, but face is itchy and my eyes hurt when I see my reflection. jk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to this..within six months my skin adapted to this well and I use 2 to 3 x per week. Still get slight peeling, but no redness.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it was working until I put too much on:) works great if you can&#x27;t get Retinol A.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described in that it does what it is supposed to do.  My skin seems to feel firmer although brown spots have not faded as much as I thought they would but I have only used it for a short time.  I think the 1% may be a little too strong for me.  I can only use it 2-3 times a week.  I do like the product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I took it easy as I have had reactions to skin creams in the past, however, my skin LOVES this.  I only used it 1 x week one, 2 x week 2, by week 3 I started using it every night because I look so much better when I wake up!  I won&#x27;t be without this now. No peeling or redness.  I use only the pea size, as recommended but also do that for my decolletage and back of hands.  Why not?  For the price of a tube you can get tightened pores, smoother texture and less hormonal acne (I&#x27;m 51.)  This won&#x27;t be the last Skinceuticals product I buy.  Glad it was my first!</li>
            <li> I use this Rentinol for spot treatments for my acne.  I have been using this product for over 6 years and still works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Skinceuticals product for over a year and like it very much.  Before this I used the same product in half the strength, but now my skin tolerates the maximum strength retinol.  It was a bit irritating in the beginning, and caused quite a bit of exfoliation. But now my skin has become much smoother than it was before I started using the Skinceuticals retinols, and it has a new glow.  A little goes a long way - this tube lasts me for at least 5 months. I use it sparingly only 3 to 4 nights a week.  I&#x27;m back to redness and irritation if I apply it too often.  It&#x27;s not a face lift in a tube, but it does get rid of dullness and small wrinkles.  During the day I use Skinceuticals serums - I&#x27;ve tried all of them and love them.  Now, if they would just come out with a product to reduce sagging.....  I was also very satisfied with the seller, GEO Marketing - no problem with the order whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Really will cause skin cell turnover. Was the perfect product to prep my skin for real Retin-A. I used it nightly and got results.</li>
            <li> suits my skin, clears pores and there si some tightening</li>
            <li> It is everything it claims to be. Start using it a few nights a week, then every other night, then every night. Your skin must get used to it or you will have problems with reddness, peeling and senitivity. It is a great product for those of us who can&#x27;t afford to go to a dermatologist and pay for a perscription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be a counterfeit thing, or burn my face off.  I tested the cream on the tender underside of my forearm for a few days and didn&#x27;t see any performance - or irritation - so I felt comfortable giving it a go on my face.  Still wasn&#x27;t expecting that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after about the third application (every other day), holy crap!  My face totally peeled!  like a sunburn.  And felt like one too!  The skin revealed is a lot smoother and younger-looking, but I did have some moments of worry I must admit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive skin AND am prone to psoriasis (on my scalp only, but my other family members have it badly on their faces etc), so I should have been even more careful and only done it once a week to start with.  Lots of reviewers said so and I didn&#x27;t listen!  I will try it again in a week or so, but will ONLY use it once a week!</li>
            <li> Like many women I spend so much money on my skin. I used this product once on my crows feet which extend from my eyes to the top of my cheeks. For the first three weeks the areas were dry due to the peeling from the product. When the peeling subsided I was amazed that the lines are shorter and much less noticeable and some are even gone! This product is very strong and it burned a little so be careful! I haven&#x27;t had to use it since the first time which was a little over a month ago! I am skeptical about face products and would never write a good review if I didn&#x27;t see results. This is a great product and I recommend it for anyone who wants to get rid of fine lines because it actually works!!!</li>
            <li> Followed directions and worked as described. As some of the other women mentioned in their reviews...it is quite strong.after about 4weeks my skin was noticeably softer,small brown blotches on forehead were gone and lines on forehead were not as pronounced.wpuld put on about a half hour before bedtime and wait till first thing in morning to wash face with water and than moisturize</li>
            <li> Retinol works great for me. Research backs up its efficacy. This is an excellent OTC retinoid. I will always purchase from this company as their product was the most fresh container of Skinceuticals retinol I have purchased on Amazon. It lasts me months so the price works out to cheaper than lesser drug store brand. Be careful of this dose if your skin is retinol naive. Use no more than directed. Its a win-win for me.</li>
            <li> This night cream does a great job of resurfacing. If you get red and irritated...just wait a few days and start again. My skin got used to it. I now have smoother younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> For me its the best non prescription retinol in the market, all Skinceuticals products delivery its promises, expensive yes...but have you heard you get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> Very potent as advertised. I use a lot of skin care and this is definitely the strongest thing I&#x27;ve used. I thought my face would be able to handle it as I&#x27;ve used many over the counter retinol products, but after three days of night application my face was burning and peeling. Be careful with this stuff. I&#x27;ve cut my usage to about two days on, one day off. The fine lines under my eyes  pretty much disappeared after that first three day consecutive application.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it is not too old. The problem with on line skin product purchasing is normally their age and how long they have been sitting on the shelf. This one was perfect and i was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Authentic product, coming from and Esthetician whom has used this line in the past for professional spa services... Love the brand!</li>
            <li> This product works perfect. One of the best. It gives a new skin</li>
            <li> I am glad I finally tried the product. I wanted to purchase it for a couple of years but just didn&#x27;t. It does make my skin peel in a couple of places. I just try and be careful about how much I am using. I can tell a small difference already. I know that its actually working. I have tried many different retinol products with no results. I haven&#x27;t been using it long and only apply it 2 times a week with several days in between applications. I am happy with it thus far.</li>
            <li> Love it! Really make my skin peel</li>
            <li> Last year I had a prescription for 2% Retinol from my dermatologist and it worked well for removing dark spots on my face, reducing wrinkles and making my skin smooth.  This year I wanted to finish up a few spots on my face.  Insurance would not cover it this time and the cost for a 0.2 oz tube was $135 so I ordered tis on-line for $50.  I works just as well as the prescription.  Actually I like it better because it is not quite as harsh.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to clear up their skin.  If I use it every day it can make my face sting a little and itch so I just back off a few days before I go back to it.  It has made my face look smooth, clear and years younger.  One tube should be all you ever need.</li>
            <li> Delighted with the results. One plus I hadn&#x27;t anticipated was that I have a glow missing for years. No longer pale and washed out.</li>
            <li> I have used Retinol several times in the past and it works. This product simply put-does not work. After complete usage, I have had no effects whatsoever! I have never seen any pealing, any skin changes, no redness (if you apply too much) or any other typical Retinol effects. I would not recommend this product and should have saved my money for the prescription.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try due to all the good reviews. And the reviews are right -- this stuff DOES work. I don&#x27;t have many lines -- I&#x27;m just in my early 30s -- but it almost got rid of them overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not one that likes to follow the directions. It says to use a pea size amount and to only use it a few times a week. So, of course, I thought those instructions did not apply to me -- and used it every night. I&#x27;ve had this for 5 days and I&#x27;ve used it every night. Let me tell you, my face is on FIRE. I am red ALL over. Peeling galore. I cannot even wash my face without a major burning sensation. IT HURTS. ITS PAINFUL. My eyes are all puffy, with red, giant bags under them! I had to take a sick day at work because my face hurt so bad. I&#x27;m not joking. READ THE DIRECTIONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, 5 freakin&#x27; stars. It works, it&#x27;s worth the price. Just please, I BEG YOU, let your skin adjust or face the consequences!!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd tube. Excellent product. Highly recommend. Only use a tiny amount every other day to avoid your face from peeling. Stay away from your eyes</li>
            <li> Works.  Great science behind it and I don&#x27;t have to go to a dermatologist.  I have seen a noticeable improvement.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for who looking for vitamin A but you have to make sure that you are wearing a sun block 50 spf and more&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> saved dollars, rec. fast and great product</li>
            <li> I think it really works!</li>
            <li> This Retinol product is the same 1% I have used via prescription only half the cost. Works great and does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> After 3 day use I see a difference in skin, some sun damage spots are gone. Yes I have some flaking skin and a little red but worth it already. Will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate skin if used if directed, would  use their other products</li>
            <li> If you are a pimple poppin face picker, this stuff is for you.  It simply works.  It digs under the skin to get rid of any acne, including painful cystic acne, pimples , white heads black heads, scars old and new and just erases them away.  I mean wow!  I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this all of my adult life.  I&#x27;m now starting to see what I look like without acne.  The product did irritate my skin at first because this is powerful stuff.  But try every other day if you get irritation.  I&#x27;m on my way to being make up free.  No more pepperoni pizza face., no more pimple poppin, or squeezing .  Just simply FLAWLESS .  It&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks but I can clearly see results.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 25 YEARS AND MY SKIN PROVES IT WORKS. I AM 78 YEARS OLD AND LOOK YEARS YOUNGER, AS I AM TOLD OFTEN.</li>
            <li> I have used OTC retinol products like Roc for years and never Have had a problem with peeling or irritation - but this one, whoa. Peeling, red, puffy right off the bat.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so this was a bit of a shock, and left me looking a little strange at work with a swollen, peeling, red face. I&#x27;ve since cut back to using it once or twice a week, and only on my chin and jawline, where I know it won&#x27;t irritate delicate skin. After about five weeks, t does seem to be making a real improvement to the texture and appearance of my skin In those areas - red acne scars have all but disappeared and dark sun damage is fading.</li>
            <li> Having used many retinol products, I did not expect this one to work as well as it does. For all of my adult life, I have had small acne bumps under the surface of the skin all over my face. I have tried all the leading acne treatments to clear it up, and a couple have worked somewhat for a short period of time, but Skinceuticals has been the only skin treatment that has completely healed my stubborn skin. I love this stuff! My face is so smooth and bright! For the first time since I graduated from high school, people actually compliment me on my beautiful skin and want to know my secret. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone over the age of sixty.</li>
            <li> I have used stronger products in the past but couldn&#x27;t find what I used before.  When I ordered this product I thought it would Ok, but it is better than ok.  I love the product and use it on a regular basis.  I would not recommend it for people who have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Only used it for a week, not enought time to see results!!</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works! Plan and simple. Don&#x27;t use it every day at first. You will regret it. But you skin will come accustomed to it after a month or so. I use it every two other days and I have fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The critical catch is the product packaging. I had bad experiences with the pump bottle packaging of this same product. I love the product even more since I can actually get it out of the package.</li>
            <li> This product WORKS!  I purchased the 1.0 about 6 months ago and saw immediate results.  I began using the cream 2x a week and increased it to 3 (sometimes 4) as I realized my skin was acclimating.  It does cause dryness, so I avoid the eye area, corners of the mouth and neck.</li>
            <li> The directions suggest using the cream every couple of days to help your skin adjust.  At first I used it twice and did not notice a difference so I decided to use it every night.  I woke up the one morning and my face was on fire!  After this I started using it every other night and I love it!</li>
            <li> I really never want to be without this product; I know it works because it gets rid of dead skin cells and has help prevent facila lines and wrinkles.  I like this new tube as opposed to the pump version because you can use every last drop!</li>
            <li> QUESTION, PLEASE: I just started using this product several weeks ago. How long before I can expect some positive results???</li>
            <li> Awesome product, it works!</li>
            <li> Use as suggested.  The second week I had sufficient peeling, makeup only made it look worse But once that was over my skin had more of a glow.  I mix daily with moisturizer and periodically alone under moisturizer for more intense effect. When using alone I will start mid week, it takes a couple days, so peeling is mainly on weekend, to spare everyone else :0) .  In past I have used 1% retinol RX, this is just as effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and already notice an improvement in my skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong!!  After using it for 3 days my skin started to turn red and peeled and flaked quite abit.  It took a week for my skin to get back to normal and I didn&#x27;t notice any differences in the texture or feel of my skin.  May try choosing to use it less than I originally did and see what happens</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for two years.  Love the feel of it and even more the results on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a couple of years and I really like it: It is easily applied, doesn&#x27;t smell much, and it gives a healthy glow to my skin. Of course, this cream hasn&#x27;t stopped the passing of time for me, but I can say that overall my skin looks quite a lot younger than my real age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a very sensitive skin, and I found a way to make sure the powerful retinol doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin: I apply the cream at night every other day at most, and I follow with a little bit of almond oil. Together, they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Been using this for awhile, I can really see a difference in this 59 year old skin.  I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product if you want to use Retinol. Came sealed under the cap &amp; genuine. Mine ws damaged during shipping &amp; Seller offered a replacement or refund, which was very much appreciated!! Skinceuticals Retinol 1.0 is potent, in that it works, but no side effects lk dry &amp; peeling skin. I started w a .15% first &amp; felt my skin ws acclimated enough after finishing tht tube &amp; went straight to the Skinceuticals 1.0% w no issues, just great skin!!</li>
            <li> In my 60&#x27;s. I have few wrinkles and I feel this product has helped much. You have to use it as recommended. I have used this product for many years and plan to continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks, about 3 x a week. I did this because I&#x27;m 100% Italian with thick skin even though I&#x27;m in my mid-60s.....and didn&#x27;t expect any problems like someone with thinner, more tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;But this week, I found these peeling areas on various parts of my face....couldn&#x27;t figure out what had caused it....&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately I hadn&#x27;t read all the reviews about this product and it&#x27;s side effects. This was not the first time I&#x27;d used Retinol. The peeling surprised me but altho I don&#x27;t like the peeling, it tells me that it&#x27;s most likely revealing newer (better?) skin. And that&#x27;s a good thing. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any great changes to my complexion but I think I need to give it more time. And use an exfoliating cleaners more often.&lt;br /&gt;I have never experienced any burning but again, I have very thick tough skin. I have high hopes for this product still.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I saw dark spots on the person for whom I had bought it completely disappear. That stuff is almost magical.</li>
            <li> I use this Retinol cream for a few weeks now and can see a difference. My skin is smoother and looks better !</li>
            <li> I have had multiple skin treatments and went with the most concentrated cream.....watch out you will get red and flaky but it does work very well</li>
            <li> I feel like this night cream has helped reduce fine lines that I was starting to develop. It does create a bit of a peeling (more of a flaking) effect a few days after beginning to use it. That effect has continued over the past month or so. I&#x27;m not sure if it will ever stop. I don&#x27;t use it every night. More like every other night after getting more used to it. Some spots are immune to peeling for me...like between my eyebrows. It does a great job of regenerating skin. I&#x27;ll continue to use this as part of my night time routine as I creep farther into my 30&#x27;s. Cure aqua gel is my favorite exfoliator to use following on this, since it&#x27;s very gentle and removes all of the flaking dead skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to (exfoliate).  After several days use, caused skin sensitivity and burning, but I knew that prior to purchase. I&#x27;m very satisfied with product, and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> With careful application this cream works very well for sun damage. It requires patience. Over application will result in dry, irritated skin; don&#x27;t complain about this, there are plenty of worthless creams you can slather on to no effect.  If you want a retinol cream that actually works, try this one, learn your tolerance level and proceed accordingly. Some people with sensitive skin might be better off starting with the .5%. I used the lower concentration about three times a week for quite a while and I can&#x27;t use this cream everyday unlike a close friend of mine. Skin varies so one size never fits all. I have used other brands of retinol and found them ineffective by comparison. The new packaging is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been suing this product for about 3 weeks now. Started out very intense. My face peeled pretty severely for a day or so. I reduced my usage to once every-other day until my face grew accustomed. Now I use it once a day at night time. My skin is still peeling a little bit, but not severely...  Which I guess is what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have very oily skin which I think helps keep the flaking down.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne/skincare product.  But it is not for the faint of heart.  The peeling is horrible, but the end result is fresh baby soft, spot free skin.  I have purchased it multiple times.  And this is the cheapest price I have found.</li>
            <li> It works for a day then the next day you use it, it looks like it makes your wrinklles look worse not good for youner skin but if you want to use it i suggest once a week ok product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to say it works great. It made my skin real flakey. When I did put foundation on, it looked as if my skin was dry and cracked. Not my favorite beauty product. I think roc&#x27;s products are better and for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Excellent love it thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult onset cystic acne for over a year now. I&#x27;ve beaten back the worst of it through diet changes, a huge list of supplements, and acupuncture, but I am still very unhappy with my skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference I&#x27;ve seen in my skin tone after literally 3 days is INCREDIBLE. The tiny skin bumps, clogged pores, scars and other skin imperfections have been reduced significantly. I wake up in the morning looking almost normal. I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use of this product will do and will definitely be buying another tube when mine runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note--I can&#x27;t comment on whether this would work well for wrinkles, or for severe active acne.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my skin looks so much better! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was using a prescription Retinol cream from my dermatologist, which became very expensive; and I wanted to try something new that would still be effective. I had heard about this brand and tried it. It is a little drier than the prescription one that I was using, but you will peel after about three days (at least this is my experience). I use  the product once a week. There is really only one day, that if someone were to look at you up close, they would see a light peeling. I would recommend this product if you want to remove the top dead skin on your face.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no reaction to this at all. Definitely no peeling. This is a nice feeling cream, and makes a pleasant night cream. No complaints there. It&#x27;s not as strong as I was expecting though, based on other&#x27;s reviews. I guess we&#x27;re all individuals and respond differently, but others said they peeled but I had nowhere near that type of reaction to it and I have pretty sensitive skin. Or so I thought? But maybe those were first time users of Retinol, I don&#x27;t know. There is another brand I have been using for the last year or so that is a 2% Retinol, and I REALLY love it (and it&#x27;s only $26) but I thought if that one was so good, maybe one that is twice the price will be even better? I know 1.0 % is less than 2.0%, but my 2% never made me peel, so I thought maybe somehow this Skinceuticals was somehow better. Maybe it was a different/stronger version of Retinol?  Nope... not better, just twice the price. I will use the rest of this up, but then I&#x27;m going back to my old cream. I just don&#x27;t see any reason to pay twice as much. Oh, I will also mention, in my quest (or shall we say greed) for the ultimate Retinol cream I also bought another brand that was labeled as &amp;#34;Retrinal 0.05% Cream&amp;#34; and again, it was no better than the one I was using before just more $. So the lesson I learned was, expensive price and high-brow names don&#x27;t necessarily make it better.  I&#x27;m a results snob more than a brand snob.</li>
            <li> On second day I received comments on how good my skin was looking.  But be careful it will make your skin peel if you use it everyday.  I use it every two days and I keep moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  Very potent.  My skin feels and looks great after only 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This product really works!!!!!But be careful,if your skin is sensible use every other day and apply a rich moisturizer over this cream!!!I loved!!!!</li>
            <li> Its very good, I used it day and night to get the peeling going and it has, now I can back off and use it every night. I can&#x27;t believe I waged this long to buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thinking and I used it EVERY day for the first three or four days. My skin got so dried out, it was almost like getting a chemical peal. I now use it every other night and its good.  Haven&#x27;t had it for long enough to tell how well it will work on wrinkles. However, I&#x27;ve had cystic-like acne on my chin for the last year.  As soon as I feel one coming, I put it on at night and it goes away within a day vs a week!  Awesome for acne!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!!! Has changed my skin in less than a week. I have been getting expensive top of the line chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and cleansing facials monthly, for years; the results from this product surpass any I have seen from spa treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to saving hundreds of dollars (A MONTH) by only (maybe) getting a basic facial now, along with consistent use of the retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post before and after pictures. :(</li>
            <li> Used every other day at first and cut back as my skin started peeling very quickly.  Had some redness along with dryness.  I am noticing a lightening of my sun spots.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Have tried many retin-a products over the years and this is by far the best. Very creamy with less irritation despite the higher percentage. It also has a pleasant scent instead of the odor the generic retin a&#x27;s have. Shipped timely .</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t follow the advice of the other reviewers, put to much on, looked a mess.  Face burning, peeling and when I cried it burned!  After all that, my face is gooooood!  Love this product and will continue to use.......in moderation, because I only need the size of a pea each day not a tablespoon.</li>
            <li> Got this product for wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes.  Haven&#x27;t been using it but about a week.  Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in wrinkles or dark circles but was pleasantly surprised at its ability to unclog my facial pores.  Really like this product so far.  I hope I see a difference in wrinkles and dark circles soon.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Love what it has done for my skin!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after my facial specialist recommended it to get rid of hormonal pigmentation. Have used Murad for years without issues. Used this product as instructed for a week and developed intense redness, skin felt raw and very sensitive. Discontinued use and tried about 2 weeks later on my back. Same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it has helped at all. Will try again and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;I do use other products from this same brand. Hopefully rhe initial reaction will go away and I can truly seecthe change I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with acne, which I was fighting for many years now, so I tried a lot of things for it. Retin-A and salycilic acid products being the best for the purpose. I have used Retin-A 0.05 cream of Cilag Ltd (Swiss) usually available in pharmacies for USD10 per 20g tube. This cream usually does wonders, however it does feel a bit too harsh, with peeling all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;When it was out of stock, I purchased the Skinceupticals 1 cream and must tell that it is much weaker and is not justified for the price as compared with the simple retin-a cream from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> This works really well. It has turned my skin red and it is slightly peeling which is what you want to increase cell turn over. My skin looks smoother and younger. Just be sure you start out slow with one to two times a week because other wise this product will make your skin peel off.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 3 times now . There has been little to no real reaction such as redness or burning. I have been using other retinal products which could very well be the reason I haven&#x27;t seen a reaction to this product. I will increase the amount I am using.  If this product is as strong as they say it is then I wonder why  it does not need a prescription?</li>
            <li> This is really strong stuff. I should have started out with the weaker 0.5 formula. I burned my skin with it but I still give it a five star rating because it is potent as it claims to be. It was my own fault for not building up to this formula. I then ordered the 0.5 and am doing fine on it. Even the weaker stuff is powerful. Anyone starting out on any retinal products should not jump to the higher strength formula like I did.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see any results yet, apart from some peeling and burning. Think it will help my skin look better with continued application. If you buy this, proceed with caution. It leaves skin vulnerable to the sun and other elements.</li>
            <li> packaging was awful.  Box was completely flatten inside a soft mailing envelope&lt;br /&gt;Product does not work.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been  using  Retinol Cream 1.0 for 5 days, every  evening.  So far I have not noticed any change in my wrinkles, pores or sunspots. I don&#x27;t understand all of the comments about peeling. I have not peeled. I have not experienced dry skin. I am beginning to wonder why my skincare consultant recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I love the skinceutical retinol. I have not tried any other that measures up to it.  I use it on the body too.  This is good stuff.  Hard to find at a reasonable price.  This was a bargain</li>
            <li> At this point, I am still deciding if this was worth the money.  I have been using it for several weeks.  When I first put it on, my skin feels very smooth.  I can&#x27;t say that I see a major difference and some of the spots I had hoped to change seem the same. Due to the price, I will continue to use this product and maybe due to the condition of my skin, a real change is going to take longer.  I did have the flakiness but not terrible and there was some stinging.  I am using a Vitamin C serum with moisturizer between uses.  I did notice that when I went in the sun, even with a heavy layer of sunscreen, my face stung a bit and got red, but it didn&#x27;t burn.  I am not sure I would purchase this again.  I guess it will depend on the results over the rest of the tube.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Big Guns&amp;#34; - to be used only as directed and when your skin is ready.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my from lines for a few months now, and while I don&#x27;t ever expect them to disappear totally, they are markedly decreased in severity. I have tried many other creams and none has achieved anything like this. It is strong, and so must be used with caution on more sensitive parts of the face, but definitely works!</li>
            <li> This product was awesome on clearing my skin, but made it very dry and flaky.  Be careful if using everyday as it may burn the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for anti-aging products that actually DO SOMETHING for years.  I came across Skinceuticals through a beauty application on my phone.  It was one of the highest, AFFORDABLE, rated products outside of drugstore brands.  I started out with the .5% retinol and I HIGHLY recommend that you do the same.  DON&#x27;T just start at 1%.  You NEED to definitely work up to that.  I only use this about 2 times a week right now because it&#x27;s still very new for my skin but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  My laugh lines are no where near as bad as they were when I started with Skinceuticals.  My forehead is not near as defined by the wrinkles.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great, I just need to be careful not to use too much because when I do, the skin around my eyes gets very sensitive.  This is working great though.  I see a difference in the depth of the wrinkles on the top of my cheekbones under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using a weaker version of this product.  Very pleased with the dispensing mechanism and the product.  Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I see so many people here saying they stopped using this or only use this once a week because of the peeling. I investigated this and it&#x27;s supposed to happen. It&#x27;s called retinization, where your skin adjusts to using it and unfortunately you have to go through it to get results. Still follow directions (start with the milder strength, only use once every 2-3 days, work up to daily, etc) but your skin&#x27;s going to be sensitive and/or peel for a while. Everything I&#x27;ve reads says if you only use it weekly to avoid this, you are not going to get the benefit of retinol. I backed off using any other product with &amp;#34;actives&amp;#34; and extra exfoliation during the adjustment period, which took weeks but I feel has been worth it.</li>
            <li> Havent had the 1 retinol long , but i loved the .5 and I am sure I will love this as soon as I get used to its strength . I had gotten so use to the lesser strength , I have to relearn the art of less is more.  But seriously, seems to have the greatest strength I have ever seen in any OTC product . I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about their skincare.</li>
            <li> My skin is can be dry. I caution anyone using a retinol for the first time, go slow! I love skincueuticals and this retinol did not disappoint. In fact, I don&#x27;t even shop other brands. Use every other day until acclimated, I also started out at the .5%. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and am using this product to combat sun damage.  From what I understand, this is the strongest retinol product you can get without a prescription.  In the beginning I used it nightly for about a week before I noticed light peeling.  I&#x27;ve cut back to 2-3 times per week and am noticing a definite improvement in my skin.  My skin feels so smooth to the touch now.  A little goes a long way, and do be careful to avoid the creases around the nose....for some reason this area can get really raw and sore.  I am also putting it on the backs of my hands and forearms as these areas are also showing signs of sun damage. The retinol is very drying to the skin so be sure to use a good moisturizer the following day.  I will be coming back to update as I notice any changes to my skin, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li> Do not overdo this when you start. Pea sized amount once or twice a week to start. You will get sensitive and a little raw and flaky. Ease your way into it. But definitely notice a positive change in my skin since using this. One tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to, but definite results.  As other reviewers have stated, start out really slow to avoid irritation.  Even being careful, I looked like I had a sunburn for quite a while.  I almost gave up, but my skin finally adjusted.</li>
            <li> Another great Skinceuticals product.  Retinol is the ingredient that everyone seems to agree is a must if you want to prevent aging/reduce wrinkles.Studies show retinol helps diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, and my wife, who grew up in Southern California, used to put butter on her skin and bake in the sun. You can imagine the brown spots and melasma that she developed as a result.&lt;br /&gt;My wife sees a cosmetician once a month and has for the last four years or so.  They started with a major peel (Melanage), which got rid of about 35% of the melasma.  My wife was not happy with that reduction, so she has continued to search for products to lighten the skin and brown spots, as well as reduce wrinkles and stop the aging process.  This sounds like what every other woman her age wants.  So, she has gone through a series of products, including La Prairie, Revive, and dermatologist recommended products as well.  Over the course of the last year, she started trying the Skinceuticals products and loves them.  She ordered this Retinol cream, in addition to other Skinceuticals products. The directions make it clear that you should start once or twice a week and then increase as your skin becomes accustomed to the product. My wife (who is 52) followed those directions, and is glad that she did, because this is indeed a very strong product, and your skin will peel.  We will continue to use this and reorder.  It is a great product and does not clog pores.  The dispenser system makes it easy to use and apply, without contaminating the entire product with each use.&lt;br /&gt;My wife also loves their CE Feurilic, which she uses in the morning on her face and neck, and at night on her neck.  She also uses the Skinceuticals Resveratrol at night, as well as their pigment corrector and overnight dry moisturizer. Overall great products dermatologist recommended, and reasonably priced when considering the alternatives to get these results.</li>
            <li> A all costs - it is a great cream and it really works. After 3 weeks my sundamages are nearly gone. My skin feels smoother, the complexion is refined and in my mirror I nearly lost some years;) Just an awesome product. I will surely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great! My only complaint was the MASSIVE amount of peeling after one use. It took about a week for my skin to stop peeling. I use it 3 times a week now with no issues or complaints.</li>
            <li> I love it but I have very sensitive skin and it is a little too harsh for me.  I am going to have to go down to the .5 strength.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product. I got severe Rush on my throat and face after few days of using it. My skin was pilling out and went red. Not to forget, I put a lot of emphasis on face care and use many fine serums and creams including Biological Recherche and Sisley. I have never experienced something like this in my life. Waste of money, poor and dangerous choice,  wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Yes, Retinol in a tube! and not having to spend a fortune at beautician for a peeling.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and effective from the moment you start using it. This is a must for your night skincare regimen, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it daily but twice a week, as your skin will peel (normal) renewing it every time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky to have pretty good skin, however this product is only making it better, the difference of my skin and fine lines is incredible since I have started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions to make sure you get the best results.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. I have not been using it for long at all, but I have noticed a slight reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. My face is plumped out, but more surprisingly tho, my skin tone has been really improved. I like the silky feel too.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, but you WILL peel if you use it every day.  Use it 2x per week is plenty.  No miracles but it does keep things &amp;#34;moving&amp;#34;  in regards to skin turnover...</li>
            <li> This product is as potent as it claims which is great because it is OTC. Use it sparingly and not very often at first.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen results because I&#x27;ve yet to be able to use it nightly. I&#x27;ve used it sporadically for about 4 weeks now and it makes my skin a lil flakey but that is just the product exfoliating my skin I believe because the new skin is super soft and smooth....overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> to strong... pealed my face... start with the .05 strength if your thinking of trying this product... im not chancing even the .05 strength...</li>
            <li> Excellent value, saved big $$. Seller prompt.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely worth the price!  I had been using neutragena rapid wrinkle repair ( because the price was much cheaper) and can honestly say that after about 6 months of use with it, my skin was awful!  I look as though I&#x27;ve aged 5 years more after using it!  I had been using the retinol 60% from la Roche a year or so ago (loved it, was as good as prescription strength retinol) but that company quit making it and if I&#x27;m not mistaken either sold out to skincueticals or the la Roche brand changed their name to skincueticals (not completely positive on that so please forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong) so after the yucky neutragena I decided to try this to see if it was like the la Roche brand and sure enough it works just as well.  It is a little thicker but that&#x27;s fine...peeled my face after 1 use so this is how I know it&#x27;s working as it should!  I use it every other night on my whole face and then every night on any new little pimples that might be coming up and they are gone by the morning!  My skin is looking so much better and I&#x27;m completely happy!  Will order more once I run out!,</li>
