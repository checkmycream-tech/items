            <li>Excellent ,extremely satisfied it added to the mystique of barbershop.</li>
            <li>I love it and my customer is very happy with this item.</li>
            <li>It spins well and is bright.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my dad&#x27;s barbershop and he loved it.</li>
            <li>All things having been said, my wife was delighted and that was my hope.  </li>
            <li>so what seens like a good price turns</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>However this light is all plastic and a great piece for indoors.</li>
            <li>Very cool!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this light.</li>
            <li>I think they told me that I would not receive it before Christmas to prompt me to pay additional fees to make sure it arrived in time.  </li>
            <li>I love the Barber Pole.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to get what I wanted</li>
            <li>I have mounted this outdoors and it is holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>How do I change light bulbs?  </li>
            <li>It is extremely light for mounting.</li>
            <li>then the light burns out.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>Product was as stated and arrived early and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>special flurssent could not find another.</li>
            <li>The hardware it came with was very helpful for easy installation.</li>
            <li>Although it is plastic and not metal like the advertisement says, it was very lightweight and easy to hang.  </li>
            <li>So the bottom line is, if you want to save several hundred dollars, then this is a great alternative to the brand name while you save up enough money to buy that brand name pole.</li>
            <li>Funny, I received this item in about 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li>The lighting mechanism did not work in the first pole.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the vendor and was told to keep that I could keep or discard the first pole and a replacement was sent promptly.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>It looks just like the real ones from a distance, which is where the customers are really seeing the pole from anyway.</li>
            <li>The plastic tube breaking fast</li>
            <li>really feel like I got ripped off</li>
            <li>outto be very expencive.</li>
            <li>The second pole arrived in full working order.</li>
            <li>would most likely fog  or yellow.</li>
            <li>I just opened a new barber shop.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because the pole squeeks loudly and the holes used to hang it were off line</li>
            <li>price was right but not really for out doors.</li>
            <li>Really nice but is misleading and advertised wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The item arrived on time and it works perfectly it&#x27;s quite big though. I bought it for my dad&#x27;s barbershop and he loved it.</li>
            <li> We found the barber pole all that we could have wished.  The only thing that kept me from giving 5  stars is the lack of documentation  How do I change light bulbs?  Who is the manufacturer?  Is there any sort of warrantee?  Etc.  All things having been said, my wife was delighted and that was my hope.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Really nice but is misleading and advertised wrong. It is not metal but silver coated plastic. Will do until I can find a metal one.</li>
            <li> When I placed this order (it was for a Christmas gift) I was given a message that with regular shipping, the pole would not arrive before Christmas.  I upgraded my shipping to the arrival within 7 days.  Funny, I received this item in about 3 days.  I think they told me that I would not receive it before Christmas to prompt me to pay additional fees to make sure it arrived in time.  I would not order from them again.</li>
            <li> Started a fire  went in trash.</li>
            <li> Not really ....but being a man I made it work. No complaints here. Now a word from our sponsor...</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the pole squeeks loudly and the holes used to hang it were off line and it was scratched up...by it spins &amp;lights up so i use it</li>
            <li> Worked for 2 days then stopped working. HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> price was right but not really for out doors. great for decoration or bar room ect.....great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent ,extremely satisfied it added to the mystique of barbershop.Gave character and increased the interest from clients....</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and described. Love it!</li>
            <li> This was VERY poor quality product. We bought it, had it for 24 days of which it was used 18 days and then it quit rotating and made clicking &amp; humming noise. Very dissatisfied. Wouldn&#x27;t  recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just opened a new barber shop. I do not have the budget to spend $600 to $1000 dollars on a brand name pole with metal end caps. For the price, this pole is a wonderful product. It looks just like the real ones from a distance, which is where the customers are really seeing the pole from anyway. The mechanics function well... The pole spins and lights up very nicely. I have mounted this outdoors and it is holding up just fine. It is extremely light for mounting. So the bottom line is, if you want to save several hundred dollars, then this is a great alternative to the brand name while you save up enough money to buy that brand name pole. I will do that in the next year or two and in the meantime this pole will get me through that. For now it provides the visibility that I need for my barber shop. I recommend this for anyone who is on a budget.</li>
            <li> The lighting mechanism did not work in the first pole.  I contacted the vendor and was told to keep that I could keep or discard the first pole and a replacement was sent promptly.  The second pole arrived in full working order. Very cool!  The hardware and product appear to be of durable qualilty.  We would like to display outside, but are not certain if it will survive the elements ( ie: rust or the interior may retain moisture).</li>
            <li> loooks real nice but bulb burned out after a month or 2</li>
            <li> the rotation of this pole is noisy to the point of irritation and I would like to exchange it for another pole.  How do I get this done?</li>
            <li> The plastic tube breaking fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. It spins well and is bright. The hardware it came with was very helpful for easy installation.</li>
            <li> I love it and my customer is very happy with this item. Excellent quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Looks and works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Very good experience with no problems or hassles.</li>
            <li> it came with missing pieces &amp;there with scratches on itI really feel like I got ripped off and I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> I love the Barber Pole.  Although it is plastic and not metal like the advertisement says, it was very lightweight and easy to hang.  It works great.  I gave it 4 stars because the ad led me to believe it was metal and that was deceiving.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be beat for the money</li>
            <li> I was pleased to get what I wanted</li>
            <li> this item looks and operates great....for 4 days. then the light burns out. very difficult to change bulb. special flurssent could not find another. so what seens like a good price turns outto be very expencive. a 4 day pole that you connot use. no instructions for mounting or or bulb changing. amazon should not carry this item or make the supplier sell a product that is useable. rh</li>
            <li> So far so good... Great eye piece for the business! But I didn&#x27;t like the mounting parts... Had to make adjustments for installation</li>
            <li> Product was as stated and arrived early and in good condition.  I am very pleased with this light. However this light is all plastic and a great piece for indoors. I would not recommend this for outdoor use as the plastic would most likely fog  or yellow. But you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. It&#x27;s a great novelty piece.</li>
