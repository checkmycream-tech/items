            <li>One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>I wanted him to discover a new fragrance and read great reviews about Hanae Mori.</li>
            <li>Great smelling cologne, kind of on the fruity side but still manly enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This opens with a tremendously authentic citrus (lemon) and quickly dries with a mix of chocolate and vanilla -DA Bomb!</li>
            <li>Very sweet smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>I ordered Eau De Toilette Spray because my manager is using it and when he passes by smells so good, I had to ask, then, I checked all the reviews and realize I got the toilette and not the eau de parfum, and now I believe I will have to re-order and get the right one (parfum) spending twice the amount I originally had planned...</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any body that love the sweet smells specially in the evening</li>
            <li>Get it and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Smells great but the scent does not last all day.</li>
            <li>Fantastic service, fantastic price</li>
            <li>More on the sweet notes than spicy,yet masculine and I get a lot of lemon in it..very fresh smell and good longevity ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a success!</li>
            <li>Great aroma and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Scent lasts a very long time and is a great summer scent.</li>
            <li>So far the best price I&#x27;ve found, especially for the parfum.</li>
            <li>Very good perfume for long lasting, kind of relaxing aroma.</li>
            <li>It starts citric and turns sweet, its woody, chocolate and vanilla with that citric start.</li>
            <li>I received the item quickly and it was priced well</li>
            <li>Works perfectly in the office and last pretty much the whole day on 1 to 2 spray.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Great start and pretty good dry down, although a bit too floral in the finish for me.</li>
            <li>I love it, more than what i expected!!!</li>
            <li>Few will recognize it by name, but many will love the scent....</li>
            <li>and I still love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I buy this eau de parfum for my husband.</li>
            <li>Have everything from Creed to CKBe and this is my favorite in the collection next to St. Ives.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>, the first day I put it on, I smelled the perfume.</li>
            <li>Great smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, Thanks!</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>a pleasure tu use and very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I compared it to the fragrance at high end stores and there is no difference!</li>
            <li>much sooner than they suggested.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping by the way too.</li>
            <li>After dabbling in the more expensive, top shelf colognes, I decided I like to keep some Hanae around.</li>
            <li>It is warm and masculine, and it does last a long time</li>
            <li>Packaging could have been a little more padded.</li>
            <li>Good imitation not real</li>
            <li>Wear this normally to office and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is semi soft, yet still manly.</li>
            <li>Classy scent.  </li>
            <li>Buy at a local retailer where you know it&#x27;s real</li>
            <li>Every chick I go near luvz this fragrance...PERIOD</li>
            <li>little sweet, but still manly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This frag, especially the EDP will last an eternity - this is the longest lasting fragrance I have ever tried - right up there with A*Men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s truly a better value than any other men&#x27;s EDP on the market and a very well-kept secret amongst fragrance connoisseurs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good perfume for long lasting, kind of relaxing aroma.</li>
            <li> I used this almost exclusively since I found it shopping Michigan Avenue in Chicago about 10 years ago and I still love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and not overpowering. It&#x27;s very light. I would recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great value for money, smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Another winning men&#x27;s parfum.  To be enjoyed at any time.  Very pleased to have tried this scent.  Get it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is one EDP I never heard of.&lt;br /&gt;I happened across it in the Amazon store.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and thought I might give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately it became one of my top 5 colognes ... phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;This cologne can be worn in the office, on a date or any other social moment ...&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a broadcast cologne, it is for up close and personal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Packaging could have been a little more padded. But I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Have always been a fan of the Womens version of this fragrance. When I had a chance to smell the Mens I was blown away. It is semi soft, yet still manly. My husband loves this. He is VERY HARD TO PLEASE! To my surprise he has made this one his preference after sticking to one fragrance for forever. It mixes well with his body chemistry and is long lasting. The price  was amazing... I love deals. Shipping was great as well. Recieved it several days earlier than the ETA. All smiles over here!</li>
            <li> Product is excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I buy this eau de parfum for my husband. He usually uses Bucheron. I wanted him to discover a new fragrance and read great reviews about Hanae Mori. It is really very nice and he liked it immediately. It&#x27;s definitely a success!</li>
            <li> My go-to daytime scent.  Always getting complimented.</li>

            <li> Buy at a local retailer where you know it&#x27;s real</li>
            <li> After dabbling in the more expensive, top shelf colognes, I decided I like to keep some Hanae around. It is a good all around sweet scent that is not overpowering and the ladies like it, too.</li>
            <li> Great start and pretty good dry down, although a bit too floral in the finish for me. Still, I get lots of compliments from ladies on the scent so its not just about me! Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> the flower they make this stuff out of blooms at night so im told&lt;br /&gt;smell prettier than you are GET SOME</li>
            <li> Price and quality are exceptional and it&#x27;s always nice to hear the ladies tell you how good you smell!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> THE LADIES MOVE THE SMELL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now.</li>
            <li> Good imitation not real</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne, kind of on the fruity side but still manly enough. Works perfectly in the office and last pretty much the whole day on 1 to 2 spray.</li>
            <li> Smells great but the scent does not last all day. It was a good price for this size bottle. If you put some on in the morning, you will need to apply one more spray before dinner.</li>
            <li> I smell so good I want to lick myself. It&#x27;s a long lasting scent. Honestly 1 spray for 8 hours works for me.</li>
            <li> Nice ! It starts citric and turns sweet, its woody, chocolate and vanilla with that citric start. It´s superb combination of sensations. a pleasure tu use and very affordable price. Try it !</li>
            <li> I want my money back. Eau de Cologne is a diluted version of what I want and payed a premium for.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal! I compared it to the fragrance at high end stores and there is no difference! It arrived in 3 days...much sooner than they suggested.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is only me, the first day I put it on, I smelled the perfume. I was thinking to myself that is one that I will keep using forever. Then I stop smelling it, may be my nose was getting used to it. But I started getting compliment from my wife who said that she can&#x27;t wait to smell it when I am leaving to work and all day compliments from people at work. Great perfume.</li>
            <li> So far the best price I&#x27;ve found, especially for the parfum. Fast shipping by the way too.</li>
            <li> He loves it and I love it on him  : )</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  I will shop again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Bought two bottles!</li>
            <li> Best smell ever.  Buy 2 bottles, one for the home, and one for the car.  Scent, &amp;#34;last long time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite EDP scents of all time with a phenomenal scent profile, exquisite dry-down and strong sillage. If you enjoy gourmands you will love its creamy base and subtle notes. I receive more compliments wearing Hanae Mori HM than others 10x its price. All in all it&#x27;s truly a better value than any other men&#x27;s EDP on the market and a very well-kept secret amongst fragrance connoisseurs.</li>
            <li> I Love the hanae Mori ofcourse I would recommend it to any body that love the sweet smells specially in the evening this has been the second time I have purchase it on these site of it wasn&#x27;t good I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it again its perfect for guys that don&#x27;t like the strong scent of a Cologn this makes the deference</li>
            <li> My wife doesnt care for any mens fragrance........except this!</li>
            <li> I received the item quickly and it was priced well</li>
            <li> Great smell. little sweet, but still manly. Love it on my husband. Its not a spicy smell and definitely not a coll citrus sent. It is warm and masculine, and it does last a long time so u don&#x27;t need too many sprays of it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent. It smells delicious</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my favorites. Few will recognize it by name, but many will love the scent....very good choice.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Blends well with my own chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts well, it smells good, and it is a good value.</li>

            <li> Fantastic service, fantastic price</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances. And the price on Amazon is a steal compared to the department stores.</li>
            <li> The product seems great and would order it again.</li>
            <li> A sweet, refreshing cologne that seems perfectly suited for warm, sunny days. Intoxicating, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  Its different and lasts long.</li>
            <li> This is truly an aphrodisiac. I bought it for my boyfriend because his ran out &amp; it&#x27;s not something he would buy for himself. This ended up being the perfect gift for both of us. It smells so delicious - I melt when he wears it. I was afraid of getting a knock-off, but this seems like the real deal. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you good product really &amp; friendly customer service, will do business with you again soon.</li>
            <li> More on the sweet notes than spicy,yet masculine and I get a lot of lemon in it..very fresh smell and good longevity ..Wear this normally to office and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and was the correct product advertised</li>
            <li> One of the VERY BEST (not talked about) unisex fragrances on the market and for $40 or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This frag, especially the EDP will last an eternity - this is the longest lasting fragrance I have ever tried - right up there with A*Men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This opens with a tremendously authentic citrus (lemon) and quickly dries with a mix of chocolate and vanilla -DA Bomb!</li>
            <li> Great aroma and lasts for a long time. Fast shipping, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great price and Service.</li>
