            <li>Love it received before estimated date&lt;br /&gt;Nicely wrapped and its helping</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I listened to her.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Defense Healing Salve!!! :-)</li>
            <li>After finding another way i discovered that decolorized iodine would cure ringworm and most fungal infections.</li>
            <li>the lid should be shut and sealed better.</li>
            <li>Would love more value for my money.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect companion to the Defense Soap and the Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>She suffered with the fungus on her face for more than a month until we found this.</li>
            <li>I went to so many doctors/ dermatologist, nothing they gave me worked.</li>
            <li>Fragrance and consistency of the product are okay.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap but seams to be helping most of our skin issues.</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very soothing and nice for skin irritations, and helps prevent fungal infections.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product, really works, even on bruises.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the texture and how fast it absorbs....</li>
            <li>This stuff is actually pretty cool!</li>
            <li>It works great and a little does go along way</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soooo worth</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone that wrestles or does any kind of contact sport.  </li>
            <li>You can use this for just about any kind of scrap not just sport related.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even medicine, it says right on the bottle &amp;</li>
            <li>The company got it right with all of the products and</li>
            <li>Great product, worth of 5 stars if it was not such a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>Wrestlers are often exposed to many skin problem such as ring worm and Defense zaps it before it can turn into a problem!</li>
            <li>This consistently cures that problem.  </li>
            <li>it the first day</li>
            <li>First time using.&lt;br /&gt;Worked as described.  </li>
            <li>It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li>It just does EXACTLY what it claims.  </li>
            <li>Thanks DEFENSE!</li>
            <li>I have even used it on my cat and for the first time gotten rid of her dandruff....</li>
            <li>It was clean, clear and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much good it does yet.</li>
            <li>Nice little salve.</li>
            <li>and whoa... just really helped.</li>
            <li>I find the Defense healing salve very soothing</li>
            <li>but they work together very well</li>
            <li>Works very well, see youtube.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well.  </li>
            <li>This product really works ....</li>
            <li>This stuff really really worked.</li>
            <li>Nothing REALLY worked.</li>
            <li>I received this in the mail two days ago, and already, I am in SHOCK  how FAST the improvement was.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li>Could / should be twice as much salve, for the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the smell is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>the bump was going down in two days after no sign that it was ever a bump there will be buying some more very soon</li>
            <li>same as with the oil, it would probably work better actually using it 2 to 3 times a day, but i can&#x27;t (don&#x27;t), so i am not seeing the immediate progress others have posted.</li>
            <li>While the rash comes back periodically, just using this product puts me back in a healthy state.</li>
            <li>The rash cleared up quickly and the spots are actually fading!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>He has some spots at the back of his neck right at the hairline.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be some intense healing cream, I thought it was the Essential Oil that was giving me the rash</li>
            <li>I think the ringwork will be completely gone in a week and using iodine since day</li>
            <li>one has removed the itchy sensation completely</li>
            <li>and they look about 50% healed so far</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about the Defense line of products.  </li>
            <li>I had tried so many other products and have spent hundreds of dollars looking for something natural.  </li>
            <li>worked really well if you put on consistently for a few days</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially when used with the defense oil cured my sons Ringworm with in 3 days.</li>
            <li>Work very well for rashes and minor scrapes.  </li>
            <li>In recent months I&#x27;ve developed a rash where the torso meets the legs; both sides.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t be intimidated by the small jar size because you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the full benefits of this product.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oils and other ingredients really help against skin irritation and fungus.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful about using this salve and the other defense items but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more important to the consumer with jock itch, to have plenty of &amp;#34;ammunition&amp;#34;, against this annoying problem, than it is for Defense to make a 500-800 % profit.</li>

            <li> My only beef is that it is a tiny tub and won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but I think it is just a really concentrated product.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I swear the first night we used the healing salve by the next morning his scrap had dried and was half way healed!</li>
            <li> This seemed to help my rash, at least some itching, but a steroid salve resolved it for real.</li>
            <li> I spent a month traveling to the southern tip of Baja Mexico and back in April-May and spent a lot of time in the desert and on desert beaches.</li>
            <li> It also helps with fungus and minor bacterial infections.  </li>
            <li> but all you really need is a very small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> I used this salve for a couple of months on extremely dry patches of skin that would appear after workouts.</li>
            <li> The odor is not a favorite with my female patients but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been painful at times and I&#x27;ve tried many products to no avail.  </li>
            <li> this is some great stuff, uses of it is unlimited.. applied it to my rashes and they disappeared quickly.they were hives and horrible rashes to deal with including swelling</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going through the drama for years and no success until defense soap and other products the produce</li>
            <li> While the product did work well, it proved to be too expensive for a real solution</li>
            <li> I use this salve for covering skin problems... scrapes, bumps, even slight burns.  </li>
            <li> My daughters was gone in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other product now bit this one!!</li>
            <li> so I put this on to help cure the rash I was getting only to have it make the problem much worse.  </li>
            <li> Thi stuff did the trick when my lips dried out.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a waste to buy the soap</li>
            <li> Worked for a week then rashes came back worse than ever.</li>
            <li> My son had a severe mat burn on his shin for quite a few days and nothing over the counter was working to help heal it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small one ounce jar</li>
            <li> It was such a weird condition too, it was like ingrown hairs, forming cysts.</li>
            <li> Her skin looked so bad that it looked like she had been burned to the pink and white meat of her skin</li>
            <li> This has helped with sunburns, cuts and weird unexplained rashes.  </li>
            <li> Before I used this my balls itched so bad for nearly 2 years.</li>
            <li> but the shipping was not good.  </li>
            <li> I have been battling this awful skin issue for such a long time.</li>
            <li> I tired EVERYTHING .</li>
            <li> Made a brutally popped zit heal maybe a day earlier and seemed to have helped in preventing any scarring.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, Actually made it worst.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this line!  </li>
            <li> and SHE was shocked..</li>
            <li> Ringworm. :(</li>
            <li> It was just awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Before I used this my balls itched so bad for nearly 2 years. I tried everything lamasil, Tinactin, and even a prescription from my doctor nothing seemed to work except defense. I actually had cuts on my balls from scratching defense cleared it up in about 3-4 days I also used the defense soap to defeat the jockitch. Thank you defense my balls and asscrack are thankful for Defense</li>
            <li> This product gave me a severe rash on top of my ringworm.  This is supposed to be some intense healing cream, I thought it was the Essential Oil that was giving me the rash so I put this on to help cure the rash I was getting only to have it make the problem much worse.  This isn&#x27;t even medicine, it says right on the bottle &amp;#34;This is not medicine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product works really great!</li>
            <li> This works on everything from acne to bug bites. Good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the product in front of me to list the ingredients (beeswax, olive oil,jajoba and tea trea come to mind) and this stuff is just AWESOME at helping skin to heal.  I had a septoplasty (roto-rooter for the nose) and even after a year wasn&#x27;t fully healed.  Started using this stuff and whoa... just really helped.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Thank you!!  :-).</li>
            <li> If Steve Madiq buys this then you should too.</li>
            <li> worked really well if you put on consistently for a few days</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> same as with the oil, it would probably work better actually using it 2 to 3 times a day, but i can&#x27;t (don&#x27;t), so i am not seeing the immediate progress others have posted. It is nice though, beeswax and not petroleum based. I like that.</li>
            <li> I spent a month traveling to the southern tip of Baja Mexico and back in April-May and spent a lot of time in the desert and on desert beaches. Thi stuff did the trick when my lips dried out.</li>
            <li> I find the Defense healing salve very soothing</li>
            <li> Nice little salve. Made a brutally popped zit heal maybe a day earlier and seemed to have helped in preventing any scarring.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap but seams to be helping most of our skin issues. It&#x27;s good that a little goes a long way. Quality looks good.</li>
            <li> Nice smell easy to apply. Not sure how much good it does yet.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, Actually made it worst. Ringworm. :(</li>
            <li> In recent months I&#x27;ve developed a rash where the torso meets the legs; both sides. It&#x27;s been painful at times and I&#x27;ve tried many products to no avail.  defense soap was recommended to me by a tech at a local clinic and so I got it immediately.  Using the soap, followed by the gel (as instructions state) has relieved my pain and the redness caused by the rash.  While the rash comes back periodically, just using this product puts me back in a healthy state.</li>
            <li> Buy this and the soap together you will not regret it.. I thought it was a waste to buy the soap but they work together very well</li>
            <li> I ordered this after a staff infection from training.  Anytime I get a cut or scratch of any size I use this and love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I recommend it to anyone who is suffering from ringworm and/or athletes foot. I&#x27;ve been going through the drama for years and no success until defense soap and other products the produce</li>
            <li> Love it received before estimated date&lt;br /&gt;Nicely wrapped and its helping me recommend this  item for whatever your needs. It has a noticeable smell, tea oil, camphor but it doesn&#x27;t last long. But still takes care of problems.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend especially when used with the defense oil cured my sons Ringworm with in 3 days. Won&#x27;t use any other product now bit this one!!</li>
            <li> Works very well, see youtube.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.  Soothing and healing.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Work very well for rashes and minor scrapes.  Dont&#x27; think you should use it on larger open areas.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the athletes that are always on the mat. My son treats every pimple and scratch as a preventative with this stuff after he showers with the body wash.</li>
            <li> This ointment is HEAVEN sent!!!  My daughter tried EVERYTHING but NOTHING worked!!!  I almost didn&#x27;t order this product because I was burned out from purchasing products that DID NOT WORK!  As luck would have it, my daughter convinced me to purchase this for her and I am so glad that I listened to her.  Her skin looked so bad that it looked like she had been burned to the pink and white meat of her skin but NOW, you&#x27;d NEVER know that she had a rash!!!!  Thank you Defense Healing Salve!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Used it with the oil and soap to get rid of my sons ring worm.  worked great! will buy again when i run out</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, really works, even on bruises.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have on hand. Wrestlers are often exposed to many skin problem such as ring worm and Defense zaps it before it can turn into a problem!</li>
            <li> Semi helpful. I do not go along with the organic thesis. Chemicals are chemicals regardless of source. This seemed to help my rash, at least some itching, but a steroid salve resolved it for real. And the trick for Itching is VapoRub.😊</li>
            <li> I started using in conjunction with prescription medicine when I got ring worm. Excellent addition, but I can&#x27;t attest to how it works on its own.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I use it after i shower with the defense soap along with some Tea Tree Oil I blended with Vitamin E Oil.  Will knock out your Jock Itch and any Bacterial skin problems......Only thing is you will smell like a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> awesome skin product does the job! will reorder</li>
            <li> Worked for a week then rashes came back worse than ever. and so so itchy. After finding another way i discovered that decolorized iodine would cure ringworm and most fungal infections. its been 10 days using iodine and my skin looks great. I think the ringwork will be completely gone in a week and using iodine since day one has removed the itchy sensation completely</li>
            <li> I use this with my patients that have outdoor summer jobs and get a lot of rashes and infected hair follicles.  It helps to a degree with acne - won&#x27;t work for everyone.  It also helps with fungus and minor bacterial infections.  My patients like that it also takes away the itching so also consider with eczema and psoriasis.  I have several men with crew cuts that get lots of red raised bumps where their neck folds meet their hairline (from bacteria in their sweat infecting their hair follicles).  This consistently cures that problem.  The odor is not a favorite with my female patients but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ! Work like it&#x27;s was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The healing salve is good and I would recommend it but the shipping was not good.  The jar was leaking it contents when I opened the packaging. the lid should be shut and sealed better.</li>
            <li> I have been using defense soap salve for a while now, I practice BJJ and I use this whenever I get a scratch or irritation on my skin after rolling. I also used the body wash, which works well also. The tea tree oils and other ingredients really help against skin irritation and fungus.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it when I had Cellulitis, it did not hurt, it just soothed my face. It has a nice feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I use this salve for covering skin problems... scrapes, bumps, even slight burns.  Works great</li>
            <li> This product really works ....it&#x27;s soooo worth it the first day I had a razor bump from shaving the bump was white I  put some salve on it in a couple of minutes the bump was going down in two days after no sign that it was ever a bump there will be buying some more very soon</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my boys wrestle and are into MMA. My son had a severe mat burn on his shin for quite a few days and nothing over the counter was working to help heal it. I swear the first night we used the healing salve by the next morning his scrap had dried and was half way healed! This stuff really really worked. No offensive odors, no staining. It was clean, clear and not greasy. It&#x27;s a small one ounce jar but all you really need is a very small amount to do the job. I also purchased the defense shower gel and that product was nice as well. I definitely recommend this for anyone that wrestles or does any kind of contact sport.  You can use this for just about any kind of scrap not just sport related. It works great and a little does go along way so don&#x27;t be intimidated by the small jar size because you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the full benefits of this product. Well worth the price. 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and all of the accessories to go along with it and it seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> Great.  Very soothing and nice for skin irritations, and helps prevent fungal infections.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful about using this salve and the other defense items but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I think it helped decrease the itching but it didn&#x27;t solve it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product when used with the  Defense soap.</li>
            <li> First time using.&lt;br /&gt;Worked as described.  Got rid of rash and promoted healing.  It did not work in 2 days however, it did do a nice job of promoting the healing process.</li>
            <li> this is some great stuff, uses of it is unlimited.. applied it to my rashes and they disappeared quickly.they were hives and horrible rashes to deal with including swelling</li>
            <li> I have had some problems with what think are ingrown hairs on legs and some flea bite&#x27;s and they tend to itch so I order this stuff I use the body wash every time I shower it works great I put this salve on a couple of the itchy spots last night and with in seconds no itch and check them in the morning and they look about 50% healed so far</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually pretty cool! I&#x27;ve used it on a prickly rash from a bur and also on sun spots on my arms. The rash cleared up quickly and the spots are actually fading! Impressive. My only beef is that it is a tiny tub and won&#x27;t last long. Would love more value for my money.</li>
            <li> This product is soooooo wonderful.  It is the perfect companion to the Defense Soap and the Essential Oil.  I LOVE the texture and how fast it absorbs.... a little goes a long way.  I really can&#x27;t say enough about the Defense line of products.  The company got it right with all of the products and this one especially is most exceptional</li>
            <li> Use them together and fungus has no chance of survival. My daughters was gone in less than a week. She suffered with the fungus on her face for more than a month until we found this. Gone in  flash once we started with it.</li>
            <li> This is some great salve. Cleared up a  scrape on my knee  in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth of 5 stars if it was not such a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle. The only thing that upsets me, is that I didn&#x27;t find this sooner. I have been battling this awful skin issue for such a long time. I tired EVERYTHING . Nothing REALLY worked. It was such a weird condition too, it was like ingrown hairs, forming cysts. It was just awful. I received this in the mail two days ago, and already, I am in SHOCK  how FAST the improvement was. I saw my friend this afternoon and SHE was shocked..If you have any skin issue, give this a try. I am so happy that I did. . I went to so many doctors/ dermatologist, nothing they gave me worked. God Bless the creator of this. Your awesome.</li>
            <li> As promised by the seller, the product came in record time. It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but I think it is just a really concentrated product. I&#x27;m giving it to my nephew who is in college. He has some spots at the back of his neck right at the hairline. We think it&#x27;s eczema, but he hasn&#x27;t taken the time to go to the doctor yet. Will come back and write a review once we know if/how it works out. Fragrance and consistency of the product are okay.</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent product. It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased. I would buy it again from this seller and have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I could not imagine not having this in my &amp;#34;go to &amp;#34; drawer.  This product has been our saving grace.  From my sons MRSA scare and constant ringworm from wrestling.  I had tried so many other products and have spent hundreds of dollars looking for something natural.  This has helped with sunburns, cuts and weird unexplained rashes.  I have used the gel to wash my face and was amazed how the bumps disappeared.  I don&#x27;t know why or how it works.  I don&#x27;t really care.  It just does EXACTLY what it claims.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this line!  Thanks DEFENSE!</li>
            <li> Very good....I have even used it on my cat and for the first time gotten rid of her dandruff....she didn&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works well. A bit &amp;#34;chintzy&amp;#34;. Could / should be twice as much salve, for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;It is more important to the consumer with jock itch, to have plenty of &amp;#34;ammunition&amp;#34;, against this annoying problem, than it is for Defense to make a 500-800 % profit.</li>
            <li> I used this salve for a couple of months on extremely dry patches of skin that would appear after workouts. While the product did work well, it proved to be too expensive for a real solution and I ended up going with a medicated lotion.</li>
            <li> It works. I bought it with the Defense Soap 4oz Bar and my ringworm is almost gone. I also used it for some acne and it works. I recommend it to use it at night the smell is very relaxing.</li>
