            <li>The canker and gum disease seems to have healed (although it does show up once in a great while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together</li>
            <li>If I find a product w/o proplylene glycol that does a great job, I will switch to it.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>It has also greatly reduced the number of cankre sores that I have.</li>
            <li>Using this product helped w/ the dryness and better smelling breath!!</li>
            <li>The best way to use it is to brush with PBF toothpaste, then use PBF mouthwash and hold it in your mouth for 30 minutes or more.  </li>

            <li>The taste is pleasant and won&#x27;t make your mouth burn.</li>
            <li>Good dental check up (unlike Uncle Tom&#x27;s products which leave plaque).</li>
            <li>but like any good drug dealer gets you hooked and paying them.</li>
            <li>Good Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good product, I do notice a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I do notice it; I&#x27;m a good coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>about Biotene is good for dryness mouth</li>
            <li>Decided to give this mouth rinse a try, well along with the PBF toothpaste and brushing and flossing, I had a good check-up at the dentist yesterday.</li>
            <li>tastes good...</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is good if you use the Biotene toothpaste with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value, tastes good, feels/</li>
            <li>no burning feeling or anything mouth feels good after use.</li>
            <li>Evidently good for teeth too since my dental hygienist congratulated me and asked what I do in caring for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Packaged well, received in good condition, and received as promised.</li>
            <li>Whoever thinks this tastes great must also love McDonald&#x27;s McRib.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to wash off your teeth and your heads with more of this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow</li>
            <li>I find the taste very refreshing</li>
            <li>The taste is kind of plesent and good</li>
            <li>Very effective at reducing plaque and helping my teeth and gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li>better than retail prices!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I bought this for the first time on Amazon and found the taste to be very delightful.</li>
            <li>The large bottle is the best value.</li>
            <li>Amazing how it has helped and I will continue to use it along with SPRY mints.</li>
            <li>The taste is nice.  </li>
            <li>Stick to the original version!!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li>I found that it was much more cost effective to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Glycerin sprays and lozenges are much more effective and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I use it when I brush my teeth, but it seems to be really effective, it has to be used more often than twice a day.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with how clean my teeth felt after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, keeps mouth clean, kills bacteria</li>
            <li>Interesting stuff.  </li>
            <li>The reason I say that is because the enzymes in PBF do a much better job of cleaning your teeth than the dentist can, they can dissolve the biofilm which exists</li>
            <li>A much better solution, in many cases, is to allow the enzymes in biotene PBF to dissolve the biofilm and then allow your teeth to repair/remineralize on</li>
            <li>Plan to order some more.</li>
            <li>When comparing the ingredients (as seen below), it does seem that PFB does has more for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I searched for options online because I notice teeth more than</li>
            <li>I never want to be without PBF again, and just ordered three more bottles from Amazon to be sure I don&#x27;t run out again.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, I have noticed that my mouth is more moist all the time and my breath is fresher.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best, I take medication that dries out my mouth, especially over night.</li>
            <li>Preferred by many dentists;wife has used for some time.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it tasted better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene PBF might work better for you.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more at this price.  </li>
            <li>I love this instead of mouthwash</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but none helped.</li>
            <li>Better than Mostbof thevothers</li>
            <li>and I used many times after brushing my teeth and before I go to bed</li>
            <li>There is a canker that bleeds where the most plaque is.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for the mouth than Listerine</li>
            <li>I use it \\&quot;as directed\\&quot;, am thankful that it&#x27;s saving my gums and teeth, and I&#x27;m glad Amazon saves me some money in the process.</li>
            <li>My teeth look whiter and are in better condition.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;The enzyme approach works much better than anything</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>And your mouth will tastes better than ever.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking medication now and things are much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So I wasn&#x27;t able to floss for about six months.</li>
            <li>and then they think they need mouthwash more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how good this stuff is for your teeth, but it&#x27;s great if your mouth is dry.</li>
            <li>Seen in store at a higher price, if it works it is a good bargain.</li>
            <li>Otherwise its not a bad product, though I would have preferred it it had a nice minty taste to it.</li>
            <li>Biotene is the best for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Excellent Rinse for those of us with dry mouths.</li>
            <li>I take meds that dry out my mouth so this product is so good!!!</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is a must if you get dry mouth from your medications, plus is makes your breath smell great!</li>
            <li>For oral hygeine, which is especially important with dry mouth problems, it is definitely very effective, and if you are having problems it is worth giving this stuff a try.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep mouth moist and tastes good..</li>
            <li>(Even the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula of the original version, which is not an improvement, is better.)</li>
            <li>This biotene is better than the original formulation in part because it contains enzymes to kill some of the bacteria that attack teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it leaves your mouth fresh &amp; clean!!</li>
            <li>with regular brushing, flossing and healthy eating, Biotine PBF has helped my teeth greatly.</li>
            <li>The oral rinse helps to protect the teeth from decay and the taste is very mild.</li>
            <li>Very good product for helping to alleviate dry mouth symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I have used this rinse for some time, and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>, but I prefer Biotene PBF (aside from the added dental benefits) because my mouth \\&quot;feels cleaner\\&quot; after using this product and it has a MUCH more pleasant taste (and no gross aftertaste).  </li>
            <li>this is just a larger version than what is in the store fantastic price and great product even if you are not going through cancer.</li>
            <li>All of the Biotene products are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>No artificial sweeteners like most mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>Regular Biot&amp;egrave;ne irritates my mouth, but this formulation works great.</li>
            <li>once I started to use Biotene the light bleeding gums stopped.</li>
            <li>great buy for the big bottle</li>
            <li>understand that my story may not be relevant to you, however, if you are having symptoms like I had, please get your doctor to check on your blood/sugar levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We liked it so much that we will continue to buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I found a natural product that doesn&#x27;t taste as good, but won&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li>We have been using this product for over a year now based on our dentists recommendation, and our oral health has definitely gotten better!!</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d get excited about a mouthwash, but this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I started using Biotene original a year ago because it is alcohol free</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to help clean your teeth and gums between dental cleanings, which I thought was a bonus since I don&#x27;t enjoy flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product for those of us who have dry mouth and don&#x27;t produce much saliva.  </li>
            <li>Okay first off let me just say that i ordered this product from another store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was originally recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I doubt it increases saliva production to any significant degree</li>
            <li>I doubt it increases saliva production to any significant degree</li>
            <li>Buy this all of the time very soothing! :)</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li>And it does indeed give great relief for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>This works great for dry mouth to help prevent dental decay.</li>
            <li>The newer version says to use it up to 5 times daily, and although the PBF toothpaste is also recommended, no mention is made of the combo being more effective than the rinse</li>
            <li>This is a great mouthwash and it does help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>My mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Addresses the dry mouth and makes the dentist happy.</li>
            <li>It has been great for keeping my mouth from getting dry as well.</li>
            <li>which will probably be pretty quick.  : )&lt;</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle locally and then checked Amazon.com and have found this remarkable product in a larger size at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth at night!</li>
            <li>When you hold it in your mouth for this long, you will be able to tell that it is working because your mouth will start to fill up with air on its own, ie eventually your cheeks will start to puff out like a balloon even if you do not blow any air into them.  </li>

            <li>You know when your used to it when you don&#x27;t really taste it and its not as potent.</li>
            <li>Fast and safe delivery.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s full of alchohol.</li>
            <li>Tastes like sweet water.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>For oral hygeine, which is especially important with dry mouth problems, it is definitely very effective, and if you are having problems it is worth giving this stuff a try.associated with chronic dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it still does a great job and my dentist recently noted that my mouth looks much healthier since I switched from Listerine to Biotene PBF.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild allergic irritation to this before...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the mild taste of it.</li>
            <li>Healthy gums are essential to healthy teeth, and this product helps prevent receding gums.  </li>
            <li>It is alcohol free and very gentle.</li>
            <li>I like biotene very much!</li>
            <li>It really extends that clean mouth, plaque free teeth feel you get after brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>In most cases they will not be able to dissolve preexisting calculus or tartar, those form when you allow plaque to sit on your teeth for a long time and minerals become embedded in the biofilm.  </li>

            <li>I do not have a dry mouth issue, just loved this ever since my dentist gave me a sampl</li>
            <li>very tasty no lingering aftertaste and easy on the mouth</li>
            <li>It works immediately and is very soothing!!  </li>
            <li>My last two dental cleanings or visits have been outstanding!</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I also love the soft mint taste.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive mouth and regular mouthwashes burn, this product will provide welcome relief.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for the benefits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It left my mouth and tongue perfectly clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It does not burn like other rinses which is good.</li>
            <li>Your price was right.</li>
            <li>It really seems to help keep your mouth clean after you floss and brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for dry mouth due to medications.</li>
            <li>Biotene is the first to do the job right.  </li>
            <li>Nice flavor; doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth.</li>
            <li>My gums have improved very much.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery &amp; good price, especially since no drug or pharmacy stores even carry this product, except in the smaller size &amp; w/o PBF.  </li>
            <li>You only have to try this product once to love it.</li>
            <li>I went back to the dentist for the six month check-up, after using this stuff, the prognosis was MUCH better.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The regular Biotene tastes much better.  </li>
            <li>I have saved enough $ in dentist charges to more than pay for Biotene rinse, gel, and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>thats pretty darn</li>
            <li>My reaction to the first swish was \\&quot;spit</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I give four stars (and not five) because it tastes kinda&#x27; funny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below, if you&#x27;re interested, I&#x27;ve put a list of the ingredients of both Biotene mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/teeth, I cannot justify giving it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>This really seems to make my teeth feel cleaner and smoother!  </li>
            <li>international order it could be better</li>
            <li>I use this mouth wash first then follow up with the Crest 3D tooth whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Probably you will think you are jumping higher.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many mouth washes and now that I have found the plaque in my mouth, I will only use this Biotine PBF because it truly does loosen the plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After many years of having dental hygienists scrape tarter from under my gums, hurt them and make them bleed, lecture me, and \\&quot;advise\\&quot; that I use floss (which I had been religiously doing)</li>
            <li>do want to point out the the latest version of this PBF product is subtly different from what came before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first came across this line of products years ago at a radiology oncology convention</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>I like the blue one better</li>
            <li>And if you can keep your teeth clean they will heal themselves, areas with cavitated and demineralized enamel will repair if kept clean enough.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice alternative to the typical powerful mint taste and smell.</li>
            <li>So I am relying on the other treatments that I have found to be effective for this (sports drinks, mouth sprays, and</li>
            <li>I still have more improvements to go, but for only using these products for a few months I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Biotene feeds the good bugs and suppresses the bad bugs with enzymes with a good shot of calcium helps protect.</li>
            <li>I was very please at how quickly I was able to receive my order at my military APO and the package</li>
            <li>The PBF one is better than the straight or regular one!</li>
            <li>Sure enough it really helped.</li>
            <li>First off it tastes very slimy and</li>
            <li>was absolutely amazed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Thats why dentists take the brute force approach of drilling out the entire cavitated area and replacing it with a filling so bacteria cannot easily recolonize within the tooth.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for anybody, especially those of us with busy schedules who have trouble fitting in frequent dental cleanings/checkups/whitenings.  </li>
            <li>I was advised to use Biotene toothpaste for dry mouth and it helped so I added the mouthwash that helped even more.</li>
            <li>People rinse their mouths out with alcohol and dry out their mouths even more...</li>
            <li>(I drink 10 large glasses a day)</li>
            <li>I tried Biotene and it helped a bit, but it certainly didn&#x27;t solve my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>large bottle is too large for my sink or gym bag.  </li>
            <li>The new one burns when I use it and seems so watery, that I feel like I have to swallow more of it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it, personally.  </li>
            <li>Although the taste is a bit funny, it seems to be doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to inform you all about the differences between the Original Biotene Dry Mouth(blue bottle) vs Biotene PFB (green bottle).</li>
            <li>I like the way it tastes and the clean moisture it provides in a subtle but effective way.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash does one thing fairly well, it helps remove the tartar buildup that occurs from chronic dry mouth on teeth, and the white buildup I get on my tongue.  </li>
            <li>Much better than original Biotene mouthwash, and about on par with peroxide mouthwashes, which is what I have been relying on to keep my teeth from falling out the past six years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would suggest you buy this if you gums bleeds a little, you won&#x27;t regret it, and the after taste is nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Biotene.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This really makes a difference when you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Not a cure but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride</li>
            <li>so you should not notice it much.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like the taste and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li>After chemo I needed a gentle mouthwash, this works and does not burn your mouth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing much to say here.</li>
            <li>makes the Biotene PBF really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks for that GSK/Biotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess if people pay way too much for something they get the placebo effect.  </li>
            <li>plaque removal much easier.</li>
            <li>and it does provide much needed relief,</li>
            <li>It really works well to dissolve pllaque &amp; altho I still floss, its turnedf my mouth health health regimen  around.</li>
            <li>This is very helpful for mouth sores and for preventing mouth sores</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a tingle, but a gentle, soothing feeling in the mouth after rinsing.</li>
            <li>Although I will no longer purchase it from Amazon because it is much cheaper just buying it from Walmart, even with the sales tax.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>since I used to chew gum so much in my 20s.</li>
            <li>Original (blue):&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Propylene Glycol, Xylitol, Polyglycitol, Poloxamer 407, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, Natural Peppermint, Sodium Phosphate, Zinc Gluconate, Calcium Lactate, Aloe Vera, Potassium Thiocyanate, Natural Enzymes,Lactoferrin, Lysozyme, Lactoperoxidase, Glucose Oxidase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a peculiar taste (not bad, not good), which at first is more noticeable if you&#x27;ve always used minty mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>Taste better than some of the other rinses I&#x27;ve tried also.</li>
            <li>I did try other brands, but this was a better choice.</li>
            <li>Plus it is now much more drying due to the presence of hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I used to like the Crest night time mouthwash (name since changed to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse)</li>
            <li>[Note that enamel itself cannot be regenerated once it has been completely destoyed; however, in many cases the enamel is not completely destroyed but just damaged/demineralized.  </li>
            <li>The early version said to use 2-3 times daily, and that using it in conjunction with the PBF toothpaste (hard to find that stuff in my area, but I did manage to find an outlet) would make it more effective.</li>
            <li>All Biotene oral rinses are effective relief for dry mouth, but I like the added cleaning power of this specific formulation.</li>
            <li>Keeps dry mouth moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>burning, cost more but you use less, so Biotene is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that this mouth wash is alcohol free and helps with dry mouth</li>
            <li>It really works to clean the dry mouth film away.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly at night.</li>
            <li>, My gums use to bleed, not heavily but light once in the blue moon</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this particular mouthwash for me.  </li>
            <li>My dentist&#x27;s hygienist said my teeth never looked better at my next appointment awhile after my last treatment!</li>
            <li>The taste is ok, not bad and not good.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Biotene PBF.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for diabetics.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by my hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, even for those with no mouth issues.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, natural probiotic for the mouth.</li>
            <li>I really like the Biotene line, and my dentist has noticed its effectiveness as far as my receding gums and cavities -- my mouth is getting healthier all the time.</li>
            <li>worth noting that I&#x27;ve tried the regular [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I bought it after realizing my normal toothpaste was not removing the stains from my teeth.  </li>
            <li>i need to buy some more but not sure if it really helped me with my teeth</li>
            <li>I used it Wednesday night after brushing with my normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the PBF mouthwash and not the regular Biotene dry mouth mouthwash -</li>
            <li>So far the effects are positive, non dry mouth and fresh breath</li>
            <li>but well worth the cost, especially if you have trouble fitting frequent dental cleanings into your schedule.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the way my mouth feels and smells compared to other things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My new dental hygienist suggested this mouthwash because I have allergies.  </li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t touch S mutant&#x27;s that live it your teeth.</li>
            <li>epa report came out that&#x27;s where are law makers live.</li>
            <li>When they came out with the new PBF products I switched to them.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when my bottle is empty....</li>
            <li>possibly:&lt;br /&gt;----Sodium Benzoate, listed as the seventh ingredient, more than all of the other active ingredients, although I eat foods with this all the time at low concentrations and am fine, so I doubt it&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if you take prescription drugs that cause dry mouth or pretty much</li>
            <li>Biotene has an enzyme-containing formula that gives your old cotton-mouth the boot!</li>
            <li>My husband sleeps with his mouth open at night so it dries out his mouth and gives him a funny smelling breath.  </li>
            <li>Gums hurt, roof of mouth is swollen, tongue is irritated more than usual.  </li>
            <li>That was an unexpected surprise!  </li>
            <li>First I will say that taste is not of a regular alcohol induced mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I will be interested in seeing how I do at my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li>This does not give that really clean feeling to your mouth that other mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li>insurance changes and my new dentist doesn&#x27;t seem to remove my plaque nearly as well (he uses a water pressure type tool instead of the metal tool to scrape).  </li>
            <li>I started using Biotine PBF almost a year ago and it has helped to virtually STOP the accumulation of new plaque and it seems that it has even got rid of the old plaque.</li>
            <li>Has cut down significantly on plaque buildup and contains no alcohol as a bonus.</li>
            <li>If you have mouth sores from dry mouth or medication, this clears them right up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product about a month, so when I give it a little more time , I&#x27;ll post the results.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>as far as a mouthwash goes it does nothing.</li>
            <li>No amount of water or crest complete rinse could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all natural...</li>
            <li>It really does help to loosen the plaque which helps out IMMENSELY!</li>
            <li>Im 35 years old</li>
            <li>Part of the problem was too much use of antihistamines which I also cut back on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a lot of different medications that really dehydrate me</li>
            <li>He may be right, but even if iot works I&#x27;m not sure I will rate it any higher.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;--mutanase and dextranase enzymes, which are dissolving the plaque, would also break down the mouth cells extracellular matrix (which is also made up of polysaccharides by the way), causing more stress to the mucousal tissues (gums etc) of the mouth already inflamed from chronic dry mouth.</li>
            <li>It is the only product I use which contains it because I see no benefit in using cosmetics or dental products containing certain chemicals and any form of paraben on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Arrived a little slow but in good packaging.</li>
            <li>only reason I knock it down a star is because of the feel of it: basically I want peace of mind that when my mouth feels clean it is.  </li>
            <li>to why this might be occuring, I&#x27;m not sure, but here are some possibilities:&lt;br /&gt;--propylene glycol, which is only very mildly toxic, but present in high concentrations&lt;</li>
            <li>That and the new flossing product I found should do the trick, NO deep cleaning treatment for me!</li>
            <li>it really helps and does not taste to bad ether and it good price compare to the store</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry mouth and that condition has really improved.</li>
            <li>In the past, I have required a one hour dental prophylaxis appointment every 4 to 6 months to clean my teeth, but there is no accumulation after 5 months since I started to use these items as directed.</li>
            <li>With seemingly an overload of plaque due to dry mouth, this product appears to perform as described for a clean feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on all the positive reviews on here regarding biotene products, I wonder if there is some placebo effect to their claims regarding relieving dry mouth symptoms (low saliva)?</li>
            <li>In contrast, Biotene PBF Oral Rinse is one of the very few mouth washes that both effectively fights plaque &amp; tarter buildup AND helps you combat dry mouth (the product stimulates your salivary glands to help keep your mouth moist and the lack of alcohol doesn&#x27;t dry your mouth</li>
            <li>I have an general issue with biotene though...</li>
            <li>No burning and is alcohol free and no animal ingredients (at least when I checked).</li>
            <li>definitely improved my gum health!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was having sensitive gums and started flossing every night and using this</li>
            <li>No bitter after taste and does not harm the teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>and I never paid much attention to flossing or anything other than brushing and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product, due to a suggestion from my dentist and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Most enzymes are named more transparantly (dextranase--breaks down dextrans, another type of polysacharide).&lt;br /&gt;----I&#x27;m not saying mutanase is all bad.  </li>
            <li>, I got my first ever report that my gums were much improved, there was no more bleeding, no more \\&quot;large gaps\\&quot; between gum and tooth, and she barely needed to scrape at all.</li>
            <li>I do not like the new version of Biotene for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>use the PBF Bioteen Oral Rinse between brushings, for meetings or social activities.  </li>
            <li>Walmart was always out of this product and it was a little bit higher price there.  </li>
            <li>The name mutanase is strange...what this enzyme does is break down certain polysaccharide bonds, and it is not mutagenic.  </li>
            <li>and it caused a LOT of dark stains on my teeth - so much so that I thought for a while that I had cavities.  </li>
            <li>It really helps keep the cavities down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s helping my dry mouth because I have receding gums thanks to years of antidepressant medications.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell I have less plaque after using it.  </li>
            <li>The new ingredient list has been arranged slightly different, so you have to read carefully to spot the changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether this new version is an improvement or whether the changes were mandated by other factors is not known to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very helpful with dry mouth problems due to taking allergy medications.</li>

            <li> but like any good drug dealer gets you hooked and paying them.</li>
            <li> Good Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good product, I do notice a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I do notice it; I&#x27;m a good coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> about Biotene is good for dryness mouth</li>
            <li> Decided to give this mouth rinse a try, well along with the PBF toothpaste and brushing and flossing, I had a good check-up at the dentist yesterday.</li>
            <li> tastes good...</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is good if you use the Biotene toothpaste with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value, tastes good, feels/</li>
            <li> no burning feeling or anything mouth feels good after use.</li>
            <li> Evidently good for teeth too since my dental hygienist congratulated me and asked what I do in caring for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, received in good condition, and received as promised.</li>
            <li> Whoever thinks this tastes great must also love McDonald&#x27;s McRib.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You need to wash off your teeth and your heads with more of this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow</li>
            <li> I find the taste very refreshing</li>
            <li> The taste is kind of plesent and good</li>
            <li> Very effective at reducing plaque and helping my teeth and gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li> better than retail prices!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time on Amazon and found the taste to be very delightful.</li>
            <li> The large bottle is the best value.</li>
            <li> Amazing how it has helped and I will continue to use it along with SPRY mints.</li>
            <li> The taste is nice.  </li>
            <li> Stick to the original version!!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li> I found that it was much more cost effective to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glycerin sprays and lozenges are much more effective and convenient.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I brush my teeth, but it seems to be really effective, it has to be used more often than twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with how clean my teeth felt after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, keeps mouth clean, kills bacteria</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff.  </li>
            <li> The reason I say that is because the enzymes in PBF do a much better job of cleaning your teeth than the dentist can, they can dissolve the biofilm which exists</li>
            <li> A much better solution, in many cases, is to allow the enzymes in biotene PBF to dissolve the biofilm and then allow your teeth to repair/remineralize on</li>
            <li> Plan to order some more.</li>
            <li> When comparing the ingredients (as seen below), it does seem that PFB does has more for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I searched for options online because I notice teeth more than</li>
            <li> I never want to be without PBF again, and just ordered three more bottles from Amazon to be sure I don&#x27;t run out again.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, I have noticed that my mouth is more moist all the time and my breath is fresher.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, I take medication that dries out my mouth, especially over night.</li>
            <li> Preferred by many dentists;wife has used for some time.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it tasted better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene PBF might work better for you.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more at this price.  </li>
            <li> I love this instead of mouthwash</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, but none helped.</li>
            <li> Better than Mostbof thevothers</li>
            <li> and I used many times after brushing my teeth and before I go to bed</li>
            <li> There is a canker that bleeds where the most plaque is.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for the mouth than Listerine</li>
            <li> I use it \\&quot;as directed\\&quot;, am thankful that it&#x27;s saving my gums and teeth, and I&#x27;m glad Amazon saves me some money in the process.</li>
            <li> My teeth look whiter and are in better condition.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;The enzyme approach works much better than anything</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> And your mouth will tastes better than ever.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking medication now and things are much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So I wasn&#x27;t able to floss for about six months.</li>
            <li> and then they think they need mouthwash more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how good this stuff is for your teeth, but it&#x27;s great if your mouth is dry.</li>
            <li> Seen in store at a higher price, if it works it is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Otherwise its not a bad product, though I would have preferred it it had a nice minty taste to it.</li>
            <li> Biotene is the best for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Excellent Rinse for those of us with dry mouths.</li>
            <li> I take meds that dry out my mouth so this product is so good!!!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is a must if you get dry mouth from your medications, plus is makes your breath smell great!</li>
            <li> For oral hygeine, which is especially important with dry mouth problems, it is definitely very effective, and if you are having problems it is worth giving this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> It really helps keep mouth moist and tastes good..</li>
            <li> (Even the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula of the original version, which is not an improvement, is better.)</li>
            <li> This biotene is better than the original formulation in part because it contains enzymes to kill some of the bacteria that attack teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it leaves your mouth fresh &amp; clean!!</li>
            <li> with regular brushing, flossing and healthy eating, Biotine PBF has helped my teeth greatly.</li>
            <li> The oral rinse helps to protect the teeth from decay and the taste is very mild.</li>
            <li> Very good product for helping to alleviate dry mouth symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I have used this rinse for some time, and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> , but I prefer Biotene PBF (aside from the added dental benefits) because my mouth \\&quot;feels cleaner\\&quot; after using this product and it has a MUCH more pleasant taste (and no gross aftertaste).  </li>
            <li> this is just a larger version than what is in the store fantastic price and great product even if you are not going through cancer.</li>
            <li> All of the Biotene products are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> No artificial sweeteners like most mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> Regular Biot&amp;egrave;ne irritates my mouth, but this formulation works great.</li>
            <li> once I started to use Biotene the light bleeding gums stopped.</li>
            <li> great buy for the big bottle</li>
            <li> understand that my story may not be relevant to you, however, if you are having symptoms like I had, please get your doctor to check on your blood/sugar levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We liked it so much that we will continue to buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I found a natural product that doesn&#x27;t taste as good, but won&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for over a year now based on our dentists recommendation, and our oral health has definitely gotten better!!</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d get excited about a mouthwash, but this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I started using Biotene original a year ago because it is alcohol free</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to help clean your teeth and gums between dental cleanings, which I thought was a bonus since I don&#x27;t enjoy flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product for those of us who have dry mouth and don&#x27;t produce much saliva.  </li>
            <li> Okay first off let me just say that i ordered this product from another store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was originally recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I doubt it increases saliva production to any significant degree</li>
            <li> I doubt it increases saliva production to any significant degree</li>
            <li> Buy this all of the time very soothing! :)</li>
            <li> It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li> And it does indeed give great relief for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This works great for dry mouth to help prevent dental decay.</li>
            <li> The newer version says to use it up to 5 times daily, and although the PBF toothpaste is also recommended, no mention is made of the combo being more effective than the rinse</li>
            <li> This is a great mouthwash and it does help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Addresses the dry mouth and makes the dentist happy.</li>
            <li> It has been great for keeping my mouth from getting dry as well.</li>
            <li> which will probably be pretty quick.  : )&lt;</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle locally and then checked Amazon.com and have found this remarkable product in a larger size at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth at night!</li>
            <li> When you hold it in your mouth for this long, you will be able to tell that it is working because your mouth will start to fill up with air on its own, ie eventually your cheeks will start to puff out like a balloon even if you do not blow any air into them.  </li>

            <li> You know when your used to it when you don&#x27;t really taste it and its not as potent.</li>
            <li> Fast and safe delivery.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s full of alchohol.</li>
            <li> Tastes like sweet water.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> For oral hygeine, which is especially important with dry mouth problems, it is definitely very effective, and if you are having problems it is worth giving this stuff a try.associated with chronic dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it still does a great job and my dentist recently noted that my mouth looks much healthier since I switched from Listerine to Biotene PBF.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild allergic irritation to this before...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the mild taste of it.</li>
            <li> Healthy gums are essential to healthy teeth, and this product helps prevent receding gums.  </li>
            <li> It is alcohol free and very gentle.</li>
            <li> I like biotene very much!</li>
            <li> It really extends that clean mouth, plaque free teeth feel you get after brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> In most cases they will not be able to dissolve preexisting calculus or tartar, those form when you allow plaque to sit on your teeth for a long time and minerals become embedded in the biofilm.  </li>

            <li> I do not have a dry mouth issue, just loved this ever since my dentist gave me a sampl</li>
            <li> very tasty no lingering aftertaste and easy on the mouth</li>
            <li> It works immediately and is very soothing!!  </li>
            <li> My last two dental cleanings or visits have been outstanding!</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I also love the soft mint taste.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive mouth and regular mouthwashes burn, this product will provide welcome relief.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for the benefits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> It left my mouth and tongue perfectly clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It does not burn like other rinses which is good.</li>
            <li> Your price was right.</li>
            <li> It really seems to help keep your mouth clean after you floss and brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for dry mouth due to medications.</li>
            <li> Biotene is the first to do the job right.  </li>
            <li> Nice flavor; doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth.</li>
            <li> My gums have improved very much.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery &amp; good price, especially since no drug or pharmacy stores even carry this product, except in the smaller size &amp; w/o PBF.  </li>
            <li> You only have to try this product once to love it.</li>
            <li> I went back to the dentist for the six month check-up, after using this stuff, the prognosis was MUCH better.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The regular Biotene tastes much better.  </li>
            <li> I have saved enough $ in dentist charges to more than pay for Biotene rinse, gel, and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> thats pretty darn</li>
            <li> My reaction to the first swish was \\&quot;spit</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I give four stars (and not five) because it tastes kinda&#x27; funny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below, if you&#x27;re interested, I&#x27;ve put a list of the ingredients of both Biotene mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /teeth, I cannot justify giving it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> This really seems to make my teeth feel cleaner and smoother!  </li>
            <li> international order it could be better</li>
            <li> I use this mouth wash first then follow up with the Crest 3D tooth whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Probably you will think you are jumping higher.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many mouth washes and now that I have found the plaque in my mouth, I will only use this Biotine PBF because it truly does loosen the plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After many years of having dental hygienists scrape tarter from under my gums, hurt them and make them bleed, lecture me, and \\&quot;advise\\&quot; that I use floss (which I had been religiously doing)</li>
            <li> do want to point out the the latest version of this PBF product is subtly different from what came before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first came across this line of products years ago at a radiology oncology convention</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> I like the blue one better</li>
            <li> And if you can keep your teeth clean they will heal themselves, areas with cavitated and demineralized enamel will repair if kept clean enough.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice alternative to the typical powerful mint taste and smell.</li>
            <li> So I am relying on the other treatments that I have found to be effective for this (sports drinks, mouth sprays, and</li>
            <li> I still have more improvements to go, but for only using these products for a few months I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Biotene feeds the good bugs and suppresses the bad bugs with enzymes with a good shot of calcium helps protect.</li>
            <li> I was very please at how quickly I was able to receive my order at my military APO and the package</li>
            <li> The PBF one is better than the straight or regular one!</li>
            <li> Sure enough it really helped.</li>
            <li> First off it tastes very slimy and</li>
            <li> was absolutely amazed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Thats why dentists take the brute force approach of drilling out the entire cavitated area and replacing it with a filling so bacteria cannot easily recolonize within the tooth.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for anybody, especially those of us with busy schedules who have trouble fitting in frequent dental cleanings/checkups/whitenings.  </li>
            <li> I was advised to use Biotene toothpaste for dry mouth and it helped so I added the mouthwash that helped even more.</li>
            <li> People rinse their mouths out with alcohol and dry out their mouths even more...</li>
            <li> (I drink 10 large glasses a day)</li>
            <li> I tried Biotene and it helped a bit, but it certainly didn&#x27;t solve my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> large bottle is too large for my sink or gym bag.  </li>
            <li> The new one burns when I use it and seems so watery, that I feel like I have to swallow more of it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it, personally.  </li>
            <li> Although the taste is a bit funny, it seems to be doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to inform you all about the differences between the Original Biotene Dry Mouth(blue bottle) vs Biotene PFB (green bottle).</li>
            <li> I like the way it tastes and the clean moisture it provides in a subtle but effective way.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash does one thing fairly well, it helps remove the tartar buildup that occurs from chronic dry mouth on teeth, and the white buildup I get on my tongue.  </li>
            <li> Much better than original Biotene mouthwash, and about on par with peroxide mouthwashes, which is what I have been relying on to keep my teeth from falling out the past six years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest you buy this if you gums bleeds a little, you won&#x27;t regret it, and the after taste is nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and Biotene.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This really makes a difference when you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Not a cure but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride</li>
            <li> so you should not notice it much.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li> After chemo I needed a gentle mouthwash, this works and does not burn your mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing much to say here.</li>
            <li> makes the Biotene PBF really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks for that GSK/Biotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess if people pay way too much for something they get the placebo effect.  </li>
            <li> plaque removal much easier.</li>
            <li> and it does provide much needed relief,</li>
            <li> It really works well to dissolve pllaque &amp; altho I still floss, its turnedf my mouth health health regimen  around.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful for mouth sores and for preventing mouth sores</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tingle, but a gentle, soothing feeling in the mouth after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Although I will no longer purchase it from Amazon because it is much cheaper just buying it from Walmart, even with the sales tax.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> since I used to chew gum so much in my 20s.</li>
            <li> Original (blue):&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Propylene Glycol, Xylitol, Polyglycitol, Poloxamer 407, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, Natural Peppermint, Sodium Phosphate, Zinc Gluconate, Calcium Lactate, Aloe Vera, Potassium Thiocyanate, Natural Enzymes,Lactoferrin, Lysozyme, Lactoperoxidase, Glucose Oxidase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a peculiar taste (not bad, not good), which at first is more noticeable if you&#x27;ve always used minty mouth wash.  </li>
            <li> Taste better than some of the other rinses I&#x27;ve tried also.</li>
            <li> I did try other brands, but this was a better choice.</li>
            <li> Plus it is now much more drying due to the presence of hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li> I used to like the Crest night time mouthwash (name since changed to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse)</li>
            <li> [Note that enamel itself cannot be regenerated once it has been completely destoyed; however, in many cases the enamel is not completely destroyed but just damaged/demineralized.  </li>
            <li> The early version said to use 2-3 times daily, and that using it in conjunction with the PBF toothpaste (hard to find that stuff in my area, but I did manage to find an outlet) would make it more effective.</li>
            <li> All Biotene oral rinses are effective relief for dry mouth, but I like the added cleaning power of this specific formulation.</li>
            <li> Keeps dry mouth moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> burning, cost more but you use less, so Biotene is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that this mouth wash is alcohol free and helps with dry mouth</li>
            <li> It really works to clean the dry mouth film away.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly at night.</li>
            <li> , My gums use to bleed, not heavily but light once in the blue moon</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this particular mouthwash for me.  </li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s hygienist said my teeth never looked better at my next appointment awhile after my last treatment!</li>
            <li> The taste is ok, not bad and not good.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Biotene PBF.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for diabetics.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended by my hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, even for those with no mouth issues.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, natural probiotic for the mouth.</li>
            <li> I really like the Biotene line, and my dentist has noticed its effectiveness as far as my receding gums and cavities -- my mouth is getting healthier all the time.</li>
            <li> worth noting that I&#x27;ve tried the regular [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I bought it after realizing my normal toothpaste was not removing the stains from my teeth.  </li>
            <li> i need to buy some more but not sure if it really helped me with my teeth</li>
            <li> I used it Wednesday night after brushing with my normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the PBF mouthwash and not the regular Biotene dry mouth mouthwash -</li>
            <li> So far the effects are positive, non dry mouth and fresh breath</li>
            <li> but well worth the cost, especially if you have trouble fitting frequent dental cleanings into your schedule.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the way my mouth feels and smells compared to other things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My new dental hygienist suggested this mouthwash because I have allergies.  </li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t touch S mutant&#x27;s that live it your teeth.</li>
            <li> epa report came out that&#x27;s where are law makers live.</li>
            <li> When they came out with the new PBF products I switched to them.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when my bottle is empty....</li>
            <li> possibly:&lt;br /&gt;----Sodium Benzoate, listed as the seventh ingredient, more than all of the other active ingredients, although I eat foods with this all the time at low concentrations and am fine, so I doubt it&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you take prescription drugs that cause dry mouth or pretty much</li>
            <li> Biotene has an enzyme-containing formula that gives your old cotton-mouth the boot!</li>
            <li> My husband sleeps with his mouth open at night so it dries out his mouth and gives him a funny smelling breath.  </li>
            <li> Gums hurt, roof of mouth is swollen, tongue is irritated more than usual.  </li>
            <li> That was an unexpected surprise!  </li>
            <li> First I will say that taste is not of a regular alcohol induced mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I will be interested in seeing how I do at my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This does not give that really clean feeling to your mouth that other mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li> insurance changes and my new dentist doesn&#x27;t seem to remove my plaque nearly as well (he uses a water pressure type tool instead of the metal tool to scrape).  </li>
            <li> I started using Biotine PBF almost a year ago and it has helped to virtually STOP the accumulation of new plaque and it seems that it has even got rid of the old plaque.</li>
            <li> Has cut down significantly on plaque buildup and contains no alcohol as a bonus.</li>
            <li> If you have mouth sores from dry mouth or medication, this clears them right up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about a month, so when I give it a little more time , I&#x27;ll post the results.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> as far as a mouthwash goes it does nothing.</li>
            <li> No amount of water or crest complete rinse could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all natural...</li>
            <li> It really does help to loosen the plaque which helps out IMMENSELY!</li>
            <li> Im 35 years old</li>
            <li> Part of the problem was too much use of antihistamines which I also cut back on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a lot of different medications that really dehydrate me</li>
            <li> He may be right, but even if iot works I&#x27;m not sure I will rate it any higher.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;--mutanase and dextranase enzymes, which are dissolving the plaque, would also break down the mouth cells extracellular matrix (which is also made up of polysaccharides by the way), causing more stress to the mucousal tissues (gums etc) of the mouth already inflamed from chronic dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It is the only product I use which contains it because I see no benefit in using cosmetics or dental products containing certain chemicals and any form of paraben on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Arrived a little slow but in good packaging.</li>
            <li> only reason I knock it down a star is because of the feel of it: basically I want peace of mind that when my mouth feels clean it is.  </li>
            <li> to why this might be occuring, I&#x27;m not sure, but here are some possibilities:&lt;br /&gt;--propylene glycol, which is only very mildly toxic, but present in high concentrations&lt;</li>
            <li> That and the new flossing product I found should do the trick, NO deep cleaning treatment for me!</li>
            <li> it really helps and does not taste to bad ether and it good price compare to the store</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth and that condition has really improved.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have required a one hour dental prophylaxis appointment every 4 to 6 months to clean my teeth, but there is no accumulation after 5 months since I started to use these items as directed.</li>
            <li> With seemingly an overload of plaque due to dry mouth, this product appears to perform as described for a clean feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on all the positive reviews on here regarding biotene products, I wonder if there is some placebo effect to their claims regarding relieving dry mouth symptoms (low saliva)?</li>
            <li> In contrast, Biotene PBF Oral Rinse is one of the very few mouth washes that both effectively fights plaque &amp; tarter buildup AND helps you combat dry mouth (the product stimulates your salivary glands to help keep your mouth moist and the lack of alcohol doesn&#x27;t dry your mouth</li>
            <li> I have an general issue with biotene though...</li>
            <li> No burning and is alcohol free and no animal ingredients (at least when I checked).</li>
            <li> definitely improved my gum health!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was having sensitive gums and started flossing every night and using this</li>
            <li> No bitter after taste and does not harm the teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> and I never paid much attention to flossing or anything other than brushing and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, due to a suggestion from my dentist and it really helps.</li>
            <li> Most enzymes are named more transparantly (dextranase--breaks down dextrans, another type of polysacharide).&lt;br /&gt;----I&#x27;m not saying mutanase is all bad.  </li>
            <li> , I got my first ever report that my gums were much improved, there was no more bleeding, no more \\&quot;large gaps\\&quot; between gum and tooth, and she barely needed to scrape at all.</li>
            <li> I do not like the new version of Biotene for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> use the PBF Bioteen Oral Rinse between brushings, for meetings or social activities.  </li>
            <li> Walmart was always out of this product and it was a little bit higher price there.  </li>
            <li> The name mutanase is strange...what this enzyme does is break down certain polysaccharide bonds, and it is not mutagenic.  </li>
            <li> and it caused a LOT of dark stains on my teeth - so much so that I thought for a while that I had cavities.  </li>
            <li> It really helps keep the cavities down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s helping my dry mouth because I have receding gums thanks to years of antidepressant medications.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell I have less plaque after using it.  </li>
            <li> The new ingredient list has been arranged slightly different, so you have to read carefully to spot the changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether this new version is an improvement or whether the changes were mandated by other factors is not known to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also very helpful with dry mouth problems due to taking allergy medications.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle and one only needs to use a small amount several times a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mouthwash, including Listerine, that natural brand Tom&#x27;s, and Crest and none compare to this brand and how it makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, good dental hygiene can be difficult for those of us with bad dry mouth, because many alcohol-based products like Scope, Listerine, etc.</li>
            <li> I went in to have a physical when I was in the Army, I told the Dr. about dry mouth, cold feet, irritability and always feeling really warm.  </li>
            <li> Instant, lasting relief from dry mouth and all</li>
            <li> I like the larger size as hubby needs to compensate for meds that cause dry mouth and uses this rinse several times a day.</li>
            <li> The only minor issue I have is the taste.</li>
            <li> Thus even if you manage to remove exising bacteria, which is normally very difficult, it is extremely easy for new bacteria to come in and take their place.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job but feel product is a little expensive</li>
            <li> so I can actually breath, which leads to dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is a product that I will continue to use since it not only takes care of the dry mouth</li>
            <li> Same with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have not been medically diagnosed with dry mouth</li>
            <li> , I use it daily to alleviate dry mouth.</li>
            <li> The only reason I can see ever going to the dentist again is if one of my crowns comes loose and needs to be reseated or something.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find the large size bottles in the stores, so I started ordering it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thoght this was for dry mouth also,but apparently not.  </li>
            <li> It was suppose to solve dry mouth at night, if anything, my mouth was drier than normal, as well as I woke earlier than usual with dry mouth</li>
            <li> I also see quite a few reviews of \\&quot;I bought this for my uncle and he says its great!\\&quot;, where I wonder if the person with dry mouth doesn&#x27;t want to hurt the other persons feelings, nobody would say \\&quot;thanks for the cake</li>
            <li> problem is that normally it is very difficult to keep cavitated areas free of bacteria because by definition a cavity is an area where bacteria have damaged the enamel leaving it porous and soft, almost like a sponge.  </li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I have had a problem with abnormally rapid plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> I think in the long run</li>
            <li> The mouthwashes are wet and viscous and soothing for maybe ten minutes</li>
            <li> No real difference noted at my last check-up.</li>
            <li> their products are marketed by dentists and on their website as relieving dry mouth, and really, for me at least, they don&#x27;t increase saliva production.  </li>
            <li> Biotene PBF is more expensive and harder to find than other items in the Bioteen product line.  </li>
            <li> unlike any other mouthwash out there, can actually DO what it claims!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear up the inside of my mouth like Listerine and lessens the feel of dry mouth though not for very long.</li>
            <li> It was so bad, I would wake up and not be able to get back to sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you suffer from a dry mouth, you need Biotene.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take away your dry mouth symptoms, but it will protect your gums from aging, shrinking, etc.</li>
            <li> Both seem to help dry mouth symptoms.</li>
            <li> and we both find that it helps to eliminate dry mouth symptoms caused by medication.</li>
            <li> , i used to suffer from dry mouth but after 2 weeks of use i no longer have dry mouth</li>

            <li> it might help prevent dental problems associated with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, also some negatives that I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;--it doesn&#x27;t improve my dry mouth problem at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line--This will help remove the tartar/ plaque buildup problem associated with chronic dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> my throat would be so dry.</li>

            <li> I take medication that causes dry mouth and have gum problems so can no longer use either of these products/</li>
            <li> also use the gel witch I keep in my purse and at my bedside and use to ease my dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Gogo</li>

            <li> I have never had dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would recommend Biotene to anyone...... dry mouth, or not.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 3, not because it doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do, although I&#x27;m not convinced that it solves my dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> My dentist advised me I had dry mouth which can contribute to cabities.  </li>
            <li> and it helped with the dry mouth problem.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend the Biotene Oral Rinse and use it after brushing my teeth at least 2 times a day.  </li>
            <li> this big bottle should last a couple months at least even with using it 1 to 2 times daily</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my dry mouth!</li>
            <li> A change in medication made my mouth very dry.  </li>

            <li> but it never really did anything for me.  </li>
            <li> I was a heavy soda drinker until recently</li>
            <li> BUY FROM YOUR LOCAL MARKET OR DRUG STORE FOR MUCH MUCH LESS!</li>
            <li> This cost $10 at Wal Mart!of advice...BUY FROM YOUR LOCAL MARKET OR DRUG STORE FOR MUCH MUCH LESS!</li>
            <li> Due to medication I take, my mouth gets very dry at night</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not tasty.</li>
            <li> - This is basically a sugar similar to xylitol, and is not easily fermented by oral bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I bought the other and within a few days the difference was obvious.  </li>
            <li> Kaiser hospital suggested using it during my cancer treatment to help with dry mouth and to help keep plaque buildup down as I couldn&#x27;t floss.</li>
            <li> their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using biotene PBF is that the enzymes take time to work, if you use it according to the instructions on the bottle, rinsing for one minute, then you will get very little effect.  </li>

            <li> Those must be manually removed with a dental explorer (the sharp scraper thing dentists use).  </li>

            <li> i am a 45 year old male who currently suffers from stage 3 of periodontal disease (stage of tooth loss) and my dentist told me i needed a deep cleaning done</li>
            <li> About 2/3&#x27;s of this stuff is bacteria, and the other 1/3 is miscellaneous leftover food gunk + a sticky polysaccharide structure that helps the bacteria/biofilm/plaque attach to teeth.</li>
            <li> The other Biotene formulation has changed and it no longer contains enzymes.</li>
            <li> I want to warn you not to swallow any of this due to it containing Poloxamer.  </li>
            <li> also it does not sting like other mouth washes</li>
            <li> Usually I go with the Title that potentially has an incorrect photo, but it this case</li>
            <li> the extracellular matrix helps hold the mucosal cells together and protect the cell from dehydration among other things.  </li>
            <li> I wont use anything other than Biotine PBF due to my issues with plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, there have been a few minor ingredient changes.</li>
            <li> I prefer some of the other oral rinses that come in Cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Their toothpaste helps dry mouth by not making it worse (commercial toothpastes use sodium lareth sulfate and other chemicals that exacerbate dry mouth symptoms).  </li>
            <li> Apparently, dry mouth sufferers produces a different, much trickier type of plaque, that is almost impossible to remove by brushing and flossing alone.  </li>
            <li> The PBF version has a faint banana flavor that&#x27;s ok but not great.  </li>
            <li> They were concerned about infection as my blood count was down due to the chemo infusions.</li>
            <li> A few of my medicines cause dry mouth, so this decrease that problem plus helps keep the gums health!</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> the average person and plaque drives me nuts.  </li>
            <li> No matter how often I brushed or flossed, I still needed to get my teeth cleaned at least 3 times per year.  </li>
            <li> Its not a fun product to use.</li>
            <li> down your wasting of money, prices will drop.</li>
            <li> No more dry mouth.</li>
            <li> so if I wake up at night with a painful dry mouth I have it right there for immediate relief.</li>
            <li> however the new formulation contains a questionable active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> My son has bad breath often and this is the only thing that seems to really do the trick.</li>
            <li> Second, you will need a small cup because the opening is small and made to be poured into a cup.</li>
            <li> after I started sleeping with CPAP I started to expierence the most horribly, indescribable, dry and bitter mouth during the night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different mouth washes from Amazon lately like BreathRX</li>
            <li> I now live in Germany and it&#x27;s difficult to find specialty products like this.  </li>
            <li> I use Biotene Oral Rinse at least twice per day for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little oily</li>
            <li> After using it for about 2 weeks, my dark stains are already gone!  </li>
            <li> I think because this one still stings my mouth a little bit.</li>
            <li> As counterproductive as it is, I used to brush my teeth then drink a little bit of milk.</li>
            <li> A little pricey?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry mouth, so I&#x27;m not sure how the product works that issue, but I do know it removes plaque!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Biotene PFB (green bottle):&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Propylene Glycol,Xylitol,Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Poloxamer 407, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Benzoate, Flavor, Benzoic Acid, Mutanase, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Zinc Gluconate, Lactoferrin, Lysozyme, Lactoperoxidase, Potassium Thiocynate, Aloe Vera Gel, Calcium Lactate, Glucose Oxidase, Dextranase, Milk and egg derivatives</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame since few products contain the enzymes in this.  </li>
            <li> For now it is only game in town.</li>
            <li> so I plan to keep using it everyday plus brushing.</li>
            <li> It is  too heavy to lift each time.  </li>
            <li> I use it before brushing to aide in loosening plaque, wait a few minutes, and then onto the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My grandma was complaining about how mouthwash is too harsh for her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for a few years now</li>
            <li> The reason this happens is because of the way the enzymes work, basically they facilitate a chemical reaction which breaks down the biofilm and in the process releases carbon dioxide and small amounts of hydrogen peroxide.  </li>

            <li> I have a nasty combination of overly acidic saliva and dry mouth which made my teeth very susceptible to cavities even though I brushed them</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I definitely recommend Biotene PBF Oral Rinse for anyone that suffers from Dry Mouth.</li>
            <li> but it certainly feels like it is cleansing the mouth of germs and bad breath.</li>
            <li> I still have very little saliva production.  </li>
            <li> not sure why they would have it in the formulation at all...</li>
            <li> The price on the value size is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Just a swish with a small amount of this restores my mouth to its moisturized goodness after brushing.  </li>
            <li> , I think that it does make you mouth feel cleaner, but you have to get past the taste.  </li>
            <li> Friday morning, I take 2 pieces of gum since they are so small once you chew them.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because this is the only thing I found that seems like it&#x27;s truly helping with dry mouth and bad breath.</li>
            <li> Indirectly, it also promotes heart health and definitely prevents bad breath from dry</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels very refreshed without the nasty taste and sting of regular mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> have somewhat of a serious plaque issue behind my bottom front teeth and behind a few other teeth as well.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to get everyone to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not super-diligent about it so hard to chart my results here</li>
            <li> But at least one company is trying to make products to help, so</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times a day and 5 times a day when I have problems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mean, there is tons of fluoride in our drinking water and toothpaste, but still.</li>
            <li> Because it seems impossible to know if it actually does anything that helps my mouth</li>
            <li> I have oral lichen planus and the proteins and enzymes of this product  have prevented serious exacerbations of the lesions that pop up in my mouth.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m just not a good judge of this product.</li>
            <li> If I use regular mouthwash while on prescription medications I get terrible dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is very uncomfortable and can lead to gum disease.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of medication and this does help with dry mouth, bad breath and my dentist recommends it for my gums and to discourage plaque build up</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product for dry mouth and bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I figure that dry mouth was the source of my bad breath</li>
            <li> I brushed 3 times a day but he never believed me.&lt;br /&gt;Drilling and filling I hate it.</li>
            <li> cavities but A TON of plaque behind my bottom front row of teeth.</li>
            <li> It go much worse with pain.</li>
            <li> Taste isnt bad just not very pleasant</li>
            <li> I had the worst time with bleeding gums, no matter how religiously I brushed and flossed.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive product</li>
            <li> I sleep with my mouth open because I have terrible sinus issues</li>
            <li> And weird, also greasy feel.</li>
            <li> ill keep trying.</li>
            <li> Some stores don&#x27;t carry it because it is relatively expensive.  </li>
            <li> if you wake up with extremely dry mouth and hate it this mouthwash is for you!.</li>
            <li> I have to take medication every day and it gives me terrible dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> advertisement is false and I am extremely disappointed in Glaxo Smith Kline.</li>
            <li> Tastes strongly of artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty but somehow artificial.</li>
            <li> How wrong i was!</li>
            <li> I have had my dentist get so mad at me yelling and screaming.</li>
            <li> It tastes \\&quot;different\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t find it at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very expensive in the stores</li>
            <li> And it is impossible for your teeth to repair in the presence of bacterial biofilm.  </li>
            <li> I used to be on 3 month recall for cleaning/checkup at my dentist because my teeth problems were so bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, to the bad breath sufferers out there, I say give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some really bad dental habits in my life.</li>
            <li> taste is not too bad</li>
            <li> Beneficial agents include lysozyme, lactoperozidase, glucose oxidase, mutanase, and dextranase\\&quot;  Along with this reference: [...]&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also hate flossing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Even though this stuff leaves my mouth tasting like cough syrup for about an hour,it helps me out a lot. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the way my mouth feels and smells compared to other things I&#x27;ve tried. I give this product 4 stars because this is the only thing I found that seems like it&#x27;s truly helping with dry mouth and bad breath.</li>
            <li> You only have to try this product once to love it. Instant, lasting relief from dry mouth and all it&#x27;s problems. Biotene has an enzyme-containing formula that gives your old cotton-mouth the boot!</li>
            <li> I had the worst time with bleeding gums, no matter how religiously I brushed and flossed.  My new dental hygienist suggested this mouthwash because I have allergies.  I tend to sleep with my mouth open so I can actually breath, which leads to dry mouth.  Apparently, dry mouth sufferers produces a different, much trickier type of plaque, that is almost impossible to remove by brushing and flossing alone.  I went back to the dentist for the six month check-up, after using this stuff, the prognosis was MUCH better.</li>
            <li> This is an awe-mazing product.  If you suffer from a dry mouth, you need Biotene.  It works immediately and is very soothing!!  I highly recommend Biotene PBF.  Use it before brushing, to help soften the plaque and after brushing for soothing moisture.</li>
            <li> A change in medication made my mouth very dry.  My Hygenist gave me a sample of Biotene and it made such a difference.  I purchased my first bottle locally and then checked Amazon.com and have found this remarkable product in a larger size at a great price.  It is a product that I will continue to use since it not only takes care of the dry mouth it also fights plaque.  If you are thinking about it, don&#x27;t give it another thought, buy it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Used together with Biotene mouthwash as directed, they have dramatically reduced the amount of plaque that builds up on my teeth. In the past, I have required a one hour dental prophylaxis appointment every 4 to 6 months to clean my teeth, but there is no accumulation after 5 months since I started to use these items as directed.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of toothpaste. Very comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told this is akin to applying hand lotion to your skin.  How would your skin look with no lotion after a couple years?  Same with dry mouth.  It doesn&#x27;t take away your dry mouth symptoms, but it will protect your gums from aging, shrinking, etc.</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff.  The regular Biotene tastes much better.  The PBF version has a faint banana flavor that&#x27;s ok but not great.  Can not tell if I am getting any extra dental benefit from the PBF.  Both seem to help dry mouth symptoms.</li>
            <li> My wife and I started to use this oral rinse several months ago and we both find that it helps to eliminate dry mouth symptoms caused by medication. The greatest benefit is that When I went to my dentist for cleaning a couple of days ago my dentist found that after 6 months I had no plaque or tarter. This product has saved me quite a bit of money by reducing dental cleaning. I have saved enough $ in dentist charges to more than pay for Biotene rinse, gel, and toothpaste. Thanks Amazon and Biotene.</li>
            <li> I used to be on 3 month recall for cleaning/checkup at my dentist because my teeth problems were so bad.  I have a nasty combination of overly acidic saliva and dry mouth which made my teeth very susceptible to cavities even though I brushed them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using biotene PBF toothpaste and mouthwash around 3 years ago, and it works so well that it has now been over 2 years since I have been to the dentist.  The only reason I can see ever going to the dentist again is if one of my crowns comes loose and needs to be reseated or something.  The reason I say that is because the enzymes in PBF do a much better job of cleaning your teeth than the dentist can, they can dissolve the biofilm which exists *within* the cavities that dentists tools cannot reach.  And if you can keep your teeth clean they will heal themselves, areas with cavitated and demineralized enamel will repair if kept clean enough.  [Note that enamel itself cannot be regenerated once it has been completely destoyed; however, in many cases the enamel is not completely destroyed but just damaged/demineralized.  Clearing out the existing bacterial biofilm allows the enamel to become remineralized which restores its functional integrity and inhibits future biofilm formation and continued decay]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that normally it is very difficult to keep cavitated areas free of bacteria because by definition a cavity is an area where bacteria have damaged the enamel leaving it porous and soft, almost like a sponge.  Thus even if you manage to remove exising bacteria, which is normally very difficult, it is extremely easy for new bacteria to come in and take their place.  And it is impossible for your teeth to repair in the presence of bacterial biofilm.  Thats why dentists take the brute force approach of drilling out the entire cavitated area and replacing it with a filling so bacteria cannot easily recolonize within the tooth.  A much better solution, in many cases, is to allow the enzymes in biotene PBF to dissolve the biofilm and then allow your teeth to repair/remineralize on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using biotene PBF is that the enzymes take time to work, if you use it according to the instructions on the bottle, rinsing for one minute, then you will get very little effect.  The best way to use it is to brush with PBF toothpaste, then use PBF mouthwash and hold it in your mouth for 30 minutes or more.  When you hold it in your mouth for this long, you will be able to tell that it is working because your mouth will start to fill up with air on its own, ie eventually your cheeks will start to puff out like a balloon even if you do not blow any air into them.  The reason this happens is because of the way the enzymes work, basically they facilitate a chemical reaction which breaks down the biofilm and in the process releases carbon dioxide and small amounts of hydrogen peroxide.  So when you allow them time to work, eventually your mouth will start filling up with CO2 gas from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, however, that the mutanase and dextranase enzymes will only dissolve plaque biofilm.  In most cases they will not be able to dissolve preexisting calculus or tartar, those form when you allow plaque to sit on your teeth for a long time and minerals become embedded in the biofilm.  Those must be manually removed with a dental explorer (the sharp scraper thing dentists use).  This is best done by a dental hygienist since calculus often forms below the gumline.e enzymes in biotene PBF to dissolve the biofilm and then allow your teeth to repair/remineralize on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using biotene PBF is that the enzymes take time to work, if you use it according to the instructions on the bottle, rinsing for one minute, then you will get very little effect.

            <li> I wish I found this stuff sooner.  It really works to clean the dry mouth film away.  It doesn&#x27;t taste great but it&#x27;s not bad.  I&#x27;ve got the Biotene PBF toothpaste also and am very happy both the toothpaste and the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This product has helped to decrease the plaque problems in my mouth. It is also very helpful with dry mouth problems due to taking allergy medications. It is hard to find the large size bottles in the stores, so I started ordering it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product. Your price was right. Plan to order some more. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Okay first off let me just say that i ordered this product from another store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i am a 45 year old male who currently suffers from stage 3 of periodontal disease (stage of tooth loss) and my dentist told me i needed a deep cleaning done but i heard from people who had it done they always say that \\&quot;it hurts like HELL\\&quot; so i just had to decline and i found alternative cures to gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;Biotene unlike any other mouthwash out there, can actually DO what it claims!!, i used to suffer from dry mouth but after 2 weeks of use i no longer have dry mouth my breath feels a lot fresher and i believe it has actually slowed the progression of my gum disease! wow thats pretty darn impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way daily use of 2-3 times a day of this mouth wash can reduce tartar and remove plaque above the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line? if you wake up with extremely dry mouth and hate it this mouthwash is for you!.</li>
            <li> All of the Biotene products are fantastic.  This really makes a difference when you brush your teeth.  If you have dry mouth try the dry mouth product.</li>
            <li> Dentist says it all - no cavities, no gum problems!  Use it to help keep my mouth from being dry.  Highly recommended.  Use it several times a day - Morning, Night &amp; in-between.</li>
            <li> The taste is ok, not bad and not good.  I am hoping to reverse my receiding gums.  I&#x27;ve only used this product about a month, so when I give it a little more time , I&#x27;ll post the results. Seen in store at a higher price, if it works it is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> This is different from what one would expect.  No jazzy taste like the various mouthwashes, but seems to do the job well.  We are sold on biotene products.</li>
            <li> Whoever thinks this tastes great must also love McDonald&#x27;s McRib.  My reaction to the first swish was \\&quot;spit this out now.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know what is producing this taste (Xylitol, probably), but it&#x27;s counter productive to use this as a mouthwash and then immediately needing some orange juice to rid myself of the aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I am suffering from dry mouth and i decided to go with biotene mouthwash as the solution. How wrong i was! First off it tastes very slimy and as far as a mouthwash goes it does nothing. It did nothing for my dry mouth!</li>
            <li> Hiya folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recently picked this up, and have been using it for about two weeks. Although the taste is a bit funny, it seems to be doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to inform you all about the differences between the Original Biotene Dry Mouth(blue bottle) vs Biotene PFB (green bottle). When comparing the ingredients (as seen below), it does seem that PFB does has more for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate - This is basically a sugar similar to xylitol, and is not easily fermented by oral bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Mutanase - So within our mouth, we have lots of stuff. About 2/3&#x27;s of this stuff is bacteria, and the other 1/3 is miscellaneous leftover food gunk + a sticky polysaccharide structure that helps the bacteria/biofilm/plaque attach to teeth. Mutanase is what targets and attacks the 1/3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Dextranase - Helps kill the remaining 2/3&#x27;s section of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give four stars (and not five) because it tastes kinda&#x27; funny. Also, this mouthwash doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride. I mean, there is tons of fluoride in our drinking water and toothpaste, but still. :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below, if you&#x27;re interested, I&#x27;ve put a list of the ingredients of both Biotene mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene PFB (green bottle):&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Propylene Glycol,Xylitol,Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Poloxamer 407, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Benzoate, Flavor, Benzoic Acid, Mutanase, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Zinc Gluconate, Lactoferrin, Lysozyme, Lactoperoxidase, Potassium Thiocynate, Aloe Vera Gel, Calcium Lactate, Glucose Oxidase, Dextranase, Milk and egg derivatives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene Original (blue):&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Propylene Glycol, Xylitol, Polyglycitol, Poloxamer 407, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, Natural Peppermint, Sodium Phosphate, Zinc Gluconate, Calcium Lactate, Aloe Vera, Potassium Thiocyanate, Natural Enzymes,Lactoferrin, Lysozyme, Lactoperoxidase, Glucose Oxidase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps~se.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps~</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything. I have not been medically diagnosed with dry mouth but, I use it because toothpaste dries out my mouth. It has a minty taste to it and is a bit medicinal in flavor. The medicinal taste does take time to get used to. What I would recommend is that you brush your teeth 2 to 3 times a day and use the mouthwash everytime for 2 days to get used to the taste. You know when your used to it when you don&#x27;t really taste it and its not as potent.</li>
            <li> definitely improved my gum health!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was having sensitive gums and started flossing every night and using this and it helps. also it makes ur teeth feel like you just brushed them even if you didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This mouth rinse is awesome!  I can really tell I have less plaque after using it.  I had to change dentists because of insurance changes and my new dentist doesn&#x27;t seem to remove my plaque nearly as well (he uses a water pressure type tool instead of the metal tool to scrape).  I searched for options online because I notice teeth more than the average person and plaque drives me nuts.  It does have a peculiar taste (not bad, not good), which at first is more noticeable if you&#x27;ve always used minty mouth wash.  You use this product before brushing your teeth (it loosens the plaque), so if the taste bothers you, you can always continue to use mouth wash after brushing. I don&#x27;t have dry mouth, so I&#x27;m not sure how the product works that issue, but I do know it removes plaque!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how good this stuff is for your teeth, but it&#x27;s great if your mouth is dry. Like visine for your mouth. This mixed with a little water is like mouth lotion and it&#x27;s a nice alternative to the typical powerful mint taste and smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this rinse for years.  When you have dry mouth, you need a non-alcohol rinse.  This fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of medication and this does help with dry mouth, bad breath and my dentist recommends it for my gums and to discourage plaque build up</li>
            <li> No artificial sweeteners like most mouthwashes. Good dental check up (unlike Uncle Tom&#x27;s products which leave plaque).</li>
            <li> My daughter has Sjogrens syndrome. Dry mouth is very uncomfortable and can lead to gum disease. This is the recommended mouth wash, and along with the toothpaste [[ASIN:B002KAOB8U Biotene PBF Plaque Dissolving Toothpaste, 4.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]] and the shower breeze [[ASIN:B000CEMWHI ShowerBreeze W/ 3&#x27; Hose Oral Irrigator]] she is now getting a handle on the gum disease. Her dentist has actually noticed an improvement! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product for dry mouth and bad breath.  It really works.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth at night! The other Biotene formulation has changed and it no longer contains enzymes. THIS contains enzymes, and it&#x27;s what works for me. It&#x27;s pretty affordable on Amazon. The generics at the store are competitively priced and work well, too, but I think this has the best flavor.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle and one only needs to use a small amount several times a day.  You still end up spending about $30-$40 per gallon.  The taste is nice.  The only problem is that I cannot tell if it does anything or not. Am I just wasting my time every day?  Because it seems impossible to know if it actually does anything that helps my mouth/teeth, I cannot justify giving it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> This product is great for anybody, especially those of us with busy schedules who have trouble fitting in frequent dental cleanings/checkups/whitenings.  Within just a few days after starting to use this product, my teeth were shinier, whiter, and looked like I just had a cleaning.  My breath is fresher also.  The only downside is the taste, which took a little getting used to.  Make sure you get the PBF mouthwash and not the regular Biotene dry mouth mouthwash - at one point my drustore was out of PBF so I bought the other and within a few days the difference was obvious.  I never want to be without PBF again, and just ordered three more bottles from Amazon to be sure I don&#x27;t run out again.  This is an expensive product but well worth the cost, especially if you have trouble fitting frequent dental cleanings into your schedule.</li>
            <li> Teeth felt cleaner, but made the back of my throat feel like it was swelling shut.  It&#x27;s a shame since few products contain the enzymes in this.  The ingredients of dubious safety or allergenicity are: Propylene Glycol, Poloxamer 407, Sodium Benzoate, and Benzoic Acid.  I want to warn you not to swallow any of this due to it containing Poloxamer.  Ingestion of this compound has been linked to cardiovascular and liver disease (doi: 10.1177/0192623310394212).  Also, I was expectorating foamy saliva for up to an hour after rinsing with this product for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I sleep with my mouth open because I have terrible sinus issues and I think that it was causing me to have dry mouth.  After using this product, I have noticed that my mouth is more moist all the time and my breath is fresher.  I figure that dry mouth was the source of my bad breath issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to the bad breath sufferers out there, I say give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had no problem with the taste.</li>
            <li> I have had my dentist get so mad at me yelling and screaming. I brushed 3 times a day but he never believed me.&lt;br /&gt;Drilling and filling I hate it. Well don&#x27;t you believe it. It is not your fault they know now it is the S mutant staph that makes lactic acid that eats holes in your teeth and gives you dry mouth. Biotene feeds the good bugs and suppresses the bad bugs with enzymes with a good shot of calcium helps protect. Not a cure but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride has never worked and it is toxic it can&#x27;t touch S mutant&#x27;s that live it your teeth. All the state capitals&lt;br /&gt;do not fluoridate after 1998 epa report came out that&#x27;s where are law makers live. Their not dumb.&lt;br /&gt;Some people never get cavities they are immune their antibody s kill the mutants. They have been working on a vaccine for almost 10 years. A spray, pill or shot and never get drilled again. I will bet we never see it.&lt;br /&gt;It will get suppressed. Biotene products are the best for what they can do. I ordered EvoraPlus Probiotics and have not tried it yet but their approach is to replace the S mutant&#x27;s with harmless ones. Not cure either but like any good drug dealer gets you hooked and paying them. I like to pay once. Maybe Europe will come up with a vaccine.  For now it is only game in town. You won&#x27;t regret using Biotene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some really bad dental habits in my life. I&#x27;ve lost a total of 5 teeth to periodontal disease. I use this in combination with flossing and using toothpaste with triclosan.</li>
            <li> Good Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this \\&quot;PBF Otal Rinse\\&quot; about a month ago and use it daily in the morning after getting out of bed. The directions say to use about a tablespoon per rinse. You just swish it around in your mouth for 60 seconds DO NOT SWALLOW. The taste is kind of plesent and good so you should not notice it much. I have a \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; condition and my dentist recommended this product so I plan to keep using it everyday plus brushing. the Biotene seems to he helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002KAOAYA Biotene PBF Oral Rinse 33.8 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002KAOB8U Biotene PBF Plaque Dissolving Toothpaste, 4.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this Biotene (PBF) to me to relieve severe dry mouth from asthma. All Biotene oral rinses are effective relief for dry mouth, but I like the added cleaning power of this specific formulation. And it does indeed give great relief for dry mouth. I found that it was much more cost effective to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Delivered well. Product is awesome.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I had some dry mouth sores and this stuff helps get rid of them also it does not sting like other mouth washes it really helps and does not taste to bad ether and it good price compare to the store this big bottle should last a couple months at least even with using it 1 to 2 times daily</li>
            <li> I take medications that cause &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; especially at night while sleeping.  This product does noticeably relieve some of the problem.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash gives the best results when used with the Biotene PBF toothpaste. It increases the saliva in persons who have dry mouth due to non-medical situations. If you&#x27;re used to mouthwash that is astringent or burns this is not for you.</li>
            <li> This really seems to make my teeth feel cleaner and smoother!  I run my tongue across my front teeth and it feels like I just got back from a dental hygienist cleaning.  I was really impressed with how clean my teeth felt after using it for the first time.  I will definitely be buying more when my bottle is empty....which will probably be pretty quick.  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not taste so great but, that is not a problem for me.  I will be recommending this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> My gums have Improved dramatically since I started using this product.  A few of my medicines cause dry mouth, so this decrease that problem plus helps keep the gums health! Highly recommend for diabetics.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free.  Does not alter taste as any minty wash will do.  Great mouthwash for all.  I do not have a dry mouth issue, just loved this ever since my dentist gave me a sampl</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, I take medication that dries out my mouth, especially over night. I started using this stuff about 6 months ago and haven&#x27;t had a dry mouth event since. I even bought some of the spray for daily use... it works well also.</li>
            <li> This product was originally recommended by my dentist.  It works well at preventing plaque buildup.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like biotene very much! I use a smaller bottle when I use it.It is  too heavy to lift each time.  I did not receive my Biotene recently and I ran out awhile ago.CAn you please look into this matter. Thank you. Rochelle Marmorek</li>
            <li> If I use regular mouthwash while on prescription medications I get terrible dry mouth. With this I do not. I use it after flossing or using steroid inhalers to prevent infection and it works.</li>
            <li> Preferred by many dentists;wife has used for some time. We recommend this product; buy in bulk to save over time.</li>
            <li> I get dry mouth from some of the medication I take and my dentist recommended I use biotene.  It doesn&#x27;t tear up the inside of my mouth like Listerine and lessens the feel of dry mouth though not for very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave 4 stars is because this is NOT Biotene Oral Rinse, it is Biotene Mouthwash. I specifically purchased it because I thought I was getting the oral rinse. Usually I go with the Title that potentially has an incorrect photo, but it this case the photo is correct, but the title is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT BIOTENE ORAL RINSE!</li>
            <li> works for a short period</li>
            <li> Fast and safe delivery.  Although I don&#x27;t like the feel in my mouth, it does it&#x27;s job of helping to keep my mouth moist during sleep.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. My son has bad breath often and this is the only thing that seems to really do the trick. I would give it 5 stars if it tasted better. Makes it hard to get everyone to use it.</li>
            <li> Oral rinse works great when you have to take a lot of medications. Dry mouth can devastate tooth enamel so if you take prescription drugs that cause dry mouth or pretty much any antidepressant definitely order the oral rinse and gum. Arrived a little slow but in good packaging. Biotene is the best for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Been using this at dentist&#x27;s recommendation for years.  Great product.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I have had a problem with abnormally rapid plaque build-up. No matter how often I brushed or flossed, I still needed to get my teeth cleaned at least 3 times per year.  Biotene PBF has put an end to that.  Now I only need to have my teeth cleaned once per year.  Plus, it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry mouth due to medications. I put some of this in a mini spray bottle and put it next to my bed so if I wake up at night with a painful dry mouth I have it right there for immediate relief.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I use it daily to alleviate dry mouth. It is great for that purpose. I use it mainly at night.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste and feel of this product.  I use it before brushing to aide in loosening plaque, wait a few minutes, and then onto the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good product, I do notice a difference in my teeth. They look cleaner and whiter. I do notice it; I&#x27;m a good coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> I order the dry mouth wash and received the Oral Rinse.</li>
            <li> After chemo I needed a gentle mouthwash, this works and does not burn your mouth.  I continue to use it after 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very expensive in the stores so I order it on a monthly basis from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great mouth wash. It doesn&#x27;t burn like listerine.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I miss bit of the burning sensation, because it makes my mouth clean.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing much to say here.</li>
            <li> My husband sleeps with his mouth open at night so it dries out his mouth and gives him a funny smelling breath.  Using this product helped w/ the dryness and better smelling breath!!</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash on the market.  Has cut down significantly on plaque buildup and contains no alcohol as a bonus.</li>
            <li> It refresh enough&lt;br /&gt;For international order it could be better a smaller bottle&lt;br /&gt;Vereything about Biotene is good for dryness mouth</li>
            <li> I like the way it tastes and the clean moisture it provides in a subtle but effective way. It keeps my mouth moisterized even if I occasionally sleep and breathe through it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started taking some medications, I&#x27;ve struggled with dry mouth.  Unfortunately, good dental hygiene can be difficult for those of us with bad dry mouth, because many alcohol-based products like Scope, Listerine, etc. exacerbate dry mouth.  In contrast, Biotene PBF Oral Rinse is one of the very few mouth washes that both effectively fights plaque &amp; tarter buildup AND helps you combat dry mouth (the product stimulates your salivary glands to help keep your mouth moist and the lack of alcohol doesn&#x27;t dry your mouth out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve tried the regular [[ASIN:B002KAOAZ4 Biotene Oral Rinse for Dry Mouth Symptoms-33.8 oz]], but I prefer Biotene PBF (aside from the added dental benefits) because my mouth \\&quot;feels cleaner\\&quot; after using this product and it has a MUCH more pleasant taste (and no gross aftertaste).  Like the [[ASIN:B002KAOB8U Biotene PBF Plaque Dissolving Toothpaste, 4.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]], this mouthwash tastes quite a bit like banana runts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, if you&#x27;re used to an alcohol-based mouth wash like Listerine, this mouthwash might not leave you with the same minty fresh/clean feeling that you&#x27;re used to. Nevertheless, it still does a great job and my dentist recently noted that my mouth looks much healthier since I switched from Listerine to Biotene PBF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely recommend Biotene PBF Oral Rinse for anyone that suffers from Dry Mouth.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash does one thing fairly well, it helps remove the tartar buildup that occurs from chronic dry mouth on teeth, and the white buildup I get on my tongue.  I think in the long run it might help prevent dental problems associated with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, also some negatives that I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;--it doesn&#x27;t improve my dry mouth problem at all.  I still have very little saliva production.  So I am relying on the other treatments that I have found to be effective for this (sports drinks, mouth sprays, and medication).&lt;br /&gt;--it irritates my mouth if used regularly.  Gums hurt, roof of mouth is swollen, tongue is irritated more than usual.  This was noticeable on day 2.  I might try rinsing with water after using, although this is not as per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;As to why this might be occuring, I&#x27;m not sure, but here are some possibilities:&lt;br /&gt;--propylene glycol, which is only very mildly toxic, but present in high concentrations&lt;br /&gt;--mutanase and dextranase enzymes, which are dissolving the plaque, would also break down the mouth cells extracellular matrix (which is also made up of polysaccharides by the way), causing more stress to the mucousal tissues (gums etc) of the mouth already inflamed from chronic dry mouth. the extracellular matrix helps hold the mucosal cells together and protect the cell from dehydration among other things.  The name mutanase is strange...what this enzyme does is break down certain polysaccharide bonds, and it is not mutagenic.  Most enzymes are named more transparantly (dextranase--breaks down dextrans, another type of polysacharide).&lt;br /&gt;----I&#x27;m not saying mutanase is all bad.  From wikipedia article on periodontal disease, \\&quot;Enzymatic agents found in commercial preparations can loosen, dissolve, and prevent biofilm formation. Beneficial agents include lysozyme, lactoperozidase, glucose oxidase, mutanase, and dextranase\\&quot;  Along with this reference: [...]&lt;br /&gt;So it is one of the ingredients makes the Biotene PBF really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I also considered I might have an allergy to one of the ingedients, possibly:&lt;br /&gt;----Sodium Benzoate, listed as the seventh ingredient, more than all of the other active ingredients, although I eat foods with this all the time at low concentrations and am fine, so I doubt it&lt;br /&gt;----or maybe Aloe vera allergy...I&#x27;ve had mild allergic irritation to this before...and this is not all that uncommon...not sure why they would have it in the formulation at all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene PBF might work better for you.  I have an general issue with biotene though...their products are marketed by dentists and on their website as relieving dry mouth, and really, for me at least, they don&#x27;t increase saliva production.  The mouthwashes are wet and viscous and soothing for maybe ten minutes and that&#x27;s it.  There is no scientific evidence that the enzyme system increases saliva flow nor scientific explanation for this, atleast that I know of or could find mentioned.  Glycerin sprays and lozenges are much more effective and convenient.  Their toothpaste helps dry mouth by not making it worse (commercial toothpastes use sodium lareth sulfate and other chemicals that exacerbate dry mouth symptoms).  For teeth cleaning though, this actually works.  Much better than original Biotene mouthwash, and about on par with peroxide mouthwashes, which is what I have been relying on to keep my teeth from falling out the past six years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on all the positive reviews on here regarding biotene products, I wonder if there is some placebo effect to their claims regarding relieving dry mouth symptoms (low saliva)? I also see quite a few reviews of \\&quot;I bought this for my uncle and he says its great!\\&quot;, where I wonder if the person with dry mouth doesn&#x27;t want to hurt the other persons feelings, nobody would say \\&quot;thanks for the cake but it sucked, I threw it away!\\&quot;.  But at least one company is trying to make products to help, so thanks for that GSK/Biotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line--This will help remove the tartar/ plaque buildup problem associated with chronic dry mouth.  It might irritate your mouth especially if used every day.  I doubt it increases saliva production to any significant degree but this might depend on the cause and severity, but for me it was ineffective in this regard.  For oral hygeine, which is especially important with dry mouth problems, it is definitely very effective, and if you are having problems it is worth giving this stuff a try.associated with chronic dry mouth.

            <li> I use this at night with my bipap otherwise my throat would be so dry. It really helps keep mouth moist and tastes good..</li>
            <li> It actually whitens your teeth too!  That was an unexpected surprise!  Great flavor and freshens breath! Will buy more at this price.  better than retail prices!</li>
            <li> My dental tech and dentist encouraged me to start using this product because of the dry mouth I suffer from. Amazing how it has helped and I will continue to use it along with SPRY mints.</li>
            <li> I use it along with biotene toothpaste and it helps stop dry mouth. Taste better than some of the other rinses I&#x27;ve tried also.</li>
            <li> Keeps dry mouth moist and smooth. I no longer need to worry about the health of my teeth from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, natural probiotic for the mouth. If you have any irritations or sores in your mouth, this will be soothing and help it heal. I love this instead of mouthwash that&#x27;s full of alchohol.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing that it was recommended by dentists and my parents have it. First I will say that taste is not of a regular alcohol induced mouthwash. Second, you will need a small cup because the opening is small and made to be poured into a cup. You can use this mouth wash up 5x times a day but I use it 2x a day . I use this mouth wash first then follow up with the Crest 3D tooth whitening toothpaste. As per instructions, one should shake the solution in their mouth for 30 seconds. So far the effects are positive, non dry mouth and fresh breath</li>
            <li> Very good mouthwash, good taste, not burning, seems work well for me.</li>
            <li> I have had bad gums and teeth for many years. I have tried many products, but none helped. Decided to give this mouth rinse a try, well along with the PBF toothpaste and brushing and flossing, I had a good check-up at the dentist yesterday. I still have more improvements to go, but for only using these products for a few months I am very pleased with the results. Will not go back to regular foaming toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> It was suppose to solve dry mouth at night, if anything, my mouth was drier than normal, as well as I woke earlier than usual with dry mouth</li>
            <li> I guess if people pay way too much for something they get the placebo effect.  How &#x27;bout if you buy a &amp;#34;Jump Higher&amp;#34; candy bar for $20 each and then practice jumping.  Probably you will think you are jumping higher.  If there is enough interest in this $20 candy bar, I will explore developing it and offer it for sale.  I could use the money.</li>
            <li> An acquired taste but it certainly feels like it is cleansing the mouth of germs and bad breath. Better than Mostbof thevothers</li>
            <li> Regular Biot&amp;egrave;ne irritates my mouth, but this formulation works great. It really extends that clean mouth, plaque free teeth feel you get after brushing your teeth. The taste is pleasant and won&#x27;t make your mouth burn. Tastes like sweet water.</li>
            <li> I use Biotene Oral Rinse at least twice per day for dry mouth.  It really helps keep the cavities down.</li>
            <li> This has ingredients that I don&#x27;t want in my body.  I found a natural product that doesn&#x27;t taste as good, but won&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Dental Tech for even occasional smokers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No burning, cost more but you use less, so Biotene is cheaper.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for over a year now based on our dentists recommendation, and our oral health has definitely gotten better!! Great product for a great price...and it leaves your mouth fresh &amp; clean!!</li>
            <li> Great Price for a great product&lt;br /&gt;Doctor recommended I always get it on Amazon  where you find it for the best price.</li>
            <li> I do not like the new version of Biotene for dry mouth.  Have been using it for years, but am now tryi g to find another brand.  The new one burns when I use it and seems so watery, that I feel like I have to swallow more of it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it, personally.  I&#x27;m trying to find another brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Biotene and used it according to directions.&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when it did nothing at all.  The cost of the bottle was $7.79 plus tax.&lt;br /&gt;Your advertisement is false and I am extremely disappointed in Glaxo Smith Kline.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it everyday. The problem? This item can be had for $10.57 at Wal-Mart and its website. Don&#x27;t be lulled into paying 2 times the price just to have it shipped to your home.</li>
            <li> after I started sleeping with CPAP I started to expierence the most horribly, indescribable, dry and bitter mouth during the night and in the morning. It was so bad, I would wake up and not be able to get back to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with the biotene PFB toothpaste it is the only thing I could find that could reset and refresh my mouth. No amount of water or crest complete rinse could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy these on amazon going forward.</li>
            <li> My mother told me about this a year ago and I used many times after brushing my teeth and before I go to bed I rinse my mouth with it as well, My gums use to bleed, not heavily but light once in the blue moon once I started to use Biotene the light bleeding gums stopped. I would suggest you buy this if you gums bleeds a little, you won&#x27;t regret it, and the after taste is nice.</li>
            <li> this is just a larger version than what is in the store fantastic price and great product even if you are not going through cancer. very tasty no lingering aftertaste and easy on the mouth</li>
            <li> We have tried all kinds of mouth rinses...Biotene is the first to do the job right.  Our dentist was amazed...tastes good...all natural...no toxic whiteners or sugars...1st time I&#x27;ve never had a build up of tartar!</li>
            <li> I bought the 33.8 ounce bottle in Oct 2013 for 11.99, and now it is $28.64?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you masses of people would hold off a week or two of purchasing these &amp;#34;required&amp;#34; items,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then prices might drop, with an Increasing SUPPLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, you want to buy Hamburgers for $5.00 so that the Clerks can have a $10 minimum wage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to wash off your teeth and your heads with more of this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow down your wasting of money, prices will drop.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this Biotene PBF from Amazon IS THE PRICE! Its $10.00 at Wal - Mart. Same product. Same sized bottle. Nothing is different. Now to the review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not too bad but it is a little oily but I assume that is to help for dry mouth and it does not bother me at all. It does not burn like other rinses which is good. It really does help to loosen the plaque which helps out IMMENSELY! I have tried many mouth washes and now that I have found the plaque in my mouth, I will only use this Biotine PBF because it truly does loosen the plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat of a serious plaque issue behind my bottom front teeth and behind a few other teeth as well. I used to brag about how I never had a cavity in my life! Well, I should have kept my mouth shut because plaque and tartar snuck up and are now reeking havoc on my teeth and gums. Im 35 years old and I never paid much attention to flossing or anything other than brushing and mouthwash. Well, within the last 5 years (mainly last year) PLAQUE has invaded my teeth! And now I notice that a couple teeth are infested with plaque under the gum line and, I think, are causing gum disease or gingivitis. There is a canker that bleeds where the most plaque is. It seems as if this all came out of no where but I know it didnt. I havent seen a dentist for over 10 years :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cavities but A TON of plaque behind my bottom front row of teeth. I started using Biotine PBF almost a year ago and it has helped to virtually STOP the accumulation of new plaque and it seems that it has even got rid of the old plaque. The canker and gum disease seems to have healed (although it does show up once in a great while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with regular brushing, flossing and healthy eating, Biotine PBF has helped my teeth greatly. Before this I used to use Listerine but it never really did anything for me.  I wont use anything other than Biotine PBF due to my issues with plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice...BUY FROM YOUR LOCAL MARKET OR DRUG STORE FOR MUCH MUCH LESS! This cost $10 at Wal Mart!of advice...BUY FROM YOUR LOCAL MARKET OR DRUG STORE FOR MUCH MUCH LESS! This cost $10 at Wal Mart!</li>
            <li> Excellent Rinse for those of us with dry mouths. I especially like the PBF variety and it is hard to find locally. It&lt;br /&gt;makes plaque removal much easier. My gums have improved very much. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It would be perfect if it did not contain propylene (sp?) glycol. It is the only product I use which contains it because I see no benefit in using cosmetics or dental products containing certain chemicals and any form of paraben on a daily basis. If I find a product w/o proplylene glycol that does a great job, I will switch to it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Biotene Oral Rinse and use it after brushing my teeth at least 2 times a day.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for those of us who have dry mouth and don&#x27;t produce much saliva.  The oral rinse helps to protect the teeth from decay and the taste is very mild.</li>
            <li> This works great for dry mouth to help prevent dental decay. Liz Bathgate</li>
            <li> Very good product for helping to alleviate dry mouth symptoms.  Use this mouthwash 2 to 3 times a day and it does provide much needed relief,</li>
            <li> Been using the Biotene PBF for 30days and I love it.  I recently had a less than favorable dental check up and decided to get serious about taking better care of my teeth again. I suffer from dry mouth and that condition has really improved. I will continue to use it once a day.  I try not to drink anything for about 30 minutes after using.  I will be interested in seeing how I do at my next cleaning.  PS. I plan on using the toothpaste and gum as well. That and the new flossing product I found should do the trick, NO deep cleaning treatment for me!</li>
            <li> This I like!  Remember that it is a pre-rinse as in before you brush!  It is NOT mouthwash.  I still do not think that I get everything, but my teeth do seem cleaner than they did with out this stuff.</li>
            <li> great buy for the big bottle</li>
            <li> Quick delivery &amp; good price, especially since no drug or pharmacy stores even carry this product, except in the smaller size &amp; w/o PBF.  It really works well to dissolve pllaque &amp; altho I still floss, its turnedf my mouth health health regimen  around.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this particular mouthwash for me.  I have some periodontal issues and this helps for this.  It also keeps you mouth moist.  Helps between cleanings</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for the mouth than Listerine my dentist said.</li>
            <li> I was advised to use Biotene toothpaste for dry mouth and it helped so I added the mouthwash that helped even more. When they came out with the new PBF products I switched to them. After many years of having dental hygienists scrape tarter from under my gums, hurt them and make them bleed, lecture me, and \\&quot;advise\\&quot; that I use floss (which I had been religiously doing), I got my first ever report that my gums were much improved, there was no more bleeding, no more \\&quot;large gaps\\&quot; between gum and tooth, and she barely needed to scrape at all. I was switched from a 3 to a 6 month schedule and I&#x27;m hoping for even longer intervals in the future. It tastes \\&quot;different\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t find it at all unpleasant. I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t sting my tongue like the astringent mouthwashes do. I use it \\&quot;as directed\\&quot;, am thankful that it&#x27;s saving my gums and teeth, and I&#x27;m glad Amazon saves me some money in the process.</li>
            <li> Please stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;WORST SMELL &amp; FRESHNESS LASTS FOR 5 MINS OR SO.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE WORST MOUTHWASH I HAVE EVER TRIED</li>
            <li> I have used this rinse for some time, and it seems to work fine. It was highly recommended by my hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to point out the the latest version of this PBF product is subtly different from what came before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, it was called \\&quot;PBF mouthwash.\\&quot; It is now called PBF \\&quot;oral rinse.\\&quot; In addition, there have been a few minor ingredient changes. The new ingredient list has been arranged slightly different, so you have to read carefully to spot the changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions with the earlier version said to rinse for 60 seconds. The current version says to rinse for 30 seconds. The early version said to use 2-3 times daily, and that using it in conjunction with the PBF toothpaste (hard to find that stuff in my area, but I did manage to find an outlet) would make it more effective. The newer version says to use it up to 5 times daily, and although the PBF toothpaste is also recommended, no mention is made of the combo being more effective than the rinse alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether this new version is an improvement or whether the changes were mandated by other factors is not known to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howard Ferstler</li>
            <li> I thoght this was for dry mouth also,but apparently not.  It&#x27;s certainly not tasty.</li>
            <li> I used both biotene PBF oral rinse and Dry Mouth and caused oral thrush. Cannot use it any longer. I take medication that causes dry mouth and have gum problems so can no longer use either of these products/</li>
            <li> I have to take medication every day and it gives me terrible dry mouth.  I first came across this line of products years ago at a radiology oncology convention and I was amazed after I tried some samples.  I now live in Germany and it&#x27;s difficult to find specialty products like this.  I was very please at how quickly I was able to receive my order at my military APO and the package was in perfect shape.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have oral lichen planus and the proteins and enzymes of this product  have prevented serious exacerbations of the lesions that pop up in my mouth. I use it at least 3 times a day and 5 times a day when I have problems.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the gel witch I keep in my purse and at my bedside and use to ease my dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Gogo</li>
            <li> Does the job it is suppose to do. Goes along way to moisten the mouth after radiation.  We&#x27;ve already passed it along to others.</li>
            <li> only rinse I can tolerate</li>
            <li> Very good value and price</li>
            <li> My grandma was complaining about how mouthwash is too harsh for her and it burns the back of her throat and she gets a sore throat from it. I got this for her for Christmas because I know its the best.</li>
            <li> Tastes strongly of artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful for mouth sores and for preventing mouth sores</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s and purchased this to go along with the toothpaste and the Oral Balance gel. Never thought I&#x27;d get excited about a mouthwash, but this is fantastic. Your mouth feels very refreshed without the nasty taste and sting of regular mouthwashes. There&#x27;s a tingle, but a gentle, soothing feeling in the mouth after rinsing. Highly recommend, even for those with no mouth issues.</li>
            <li> This is good if you use the Biotene toothpaste with it. The two used together works for me. I had to acquire a taste for it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended  by my dentist and it does help dry mouth situation.  I did try other brands, but this was a better choice.</li>
            <li> This mouth rinse works for me.  After I use it, my mouth isn&#x27;t recovering from injury, but tingling with health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different mouth washes from Amazon lately like BreathRX and Nature&#x27;s Answer Periowash... and while I like those as well, I like this Biotene a lot. It&#x27;s a good value, tastes good, feels/tastes refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not super-diligent about it so hard to chart my results here but I will continue to have Biotene in the arsenal. I just pour it into smaller vessels for travel or multiple bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I have sojgerns syndrome so I use this after every brushing.  It helps preserve my teeth</li>
            <li> Good stuff, keeps mouth clean, kills bacteria</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product!  I bought it after realizing my normal toothpaste was not removing the stains from my teeth.  I was a heavy soda drinker until recently and it caused a LOT of dark stains on my teeth - so much so that I thought for a while that I had cavities.  I used antiseptic mouthwash for a while but I still wasn&#x27;t happy.  Then I remembered Biotene PBF mouthwash and bought a bottle.  After using it for about 2 weeks, my dark stains are already gone!  I&#x27;m very happy about the stain on my porcelain composite filling because it looked terrible.  My teeth look whiter and are in better condition.  I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s helping my dry mouth because I have receding gums thanks to years of antidepressant medications.  Hopefully, this will reverse the effects after I use it for several months.  I also love the soft mint taste.</li>
            <li> Our dental assistant suggested this for plaque build up due to dry mouth. It works okay.  I use it when I brush my teeth, but it seems to be really effective, it has to be used more often than twice a day. No real difference noted at my last check-up.</li>
            <li> Nice flavor; doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to drug store prices. I like the larger size as hubby needs to compensate for meds that cause dry mouth and uses this rinse several times a day.</li>
            <li> The PBF one is better than the straight or regular one! Buy this all of the time very soothing! :)</li>
            <li> I have never had dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I became an accidental Biotene fan because I just don&#x27;t like the taste/stinging of alcohol based mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;The enzyme approach works much better than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I was absolutely amazed the first time I used it. It left my mouth and tongue perfectly clean and healthy looking. I would not think of using anything else every again.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Biotene to anyone...... dry mouth, or not.</li>
            <li> I am a mouth breather so I use this before bed.  It works great.  The price on the value size is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for a few years now and I love it.  Although I will no longer purchase it from Amazon because it is much cheaper just buying it from Walmart, even with the sales tax.  Besides that I am very happy with this mouthwash.  It freshens my breath and keeps my mouth moist.  If you are looking for a great mouthwash, buy this!!!</li>
            <li> I rated it a 3, not because it doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do, although I&#x27;m not convinced that it solves my dry mouth problem. My dentist told me to get it and use it. He said if I use it, over time it will work. He may be right, but even if iot works I&#x27;m not sure I will rate it any higher. Its not a fun product to use.</li>
            <li> My dentist advised me I had dry mouth which can contribute to cabities.  I switched from Listerine to this and it helped with the dry mouth problem.  Part of the problem was too much use of antihistamines which I also cut back on.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive mouth and regular mouthwashes burn, this product will provide welcome relief. The large bottle is the best value.</li>
            <li> My saving grace!  Biotene PBF sees me through with Sjogren&#x27;s System making my DRY mouth tolerable while also inhibiting plaque formation which I have.  It is the BEST.  I cannot say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth, so I bought this hoping it&#x27;d help. I like the blue one better I think because this one still stings my mouth a little bit.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Great product... lubricates and freshens my mouth. I take meds that dry out my mouth so this product is so good!!!</li>
            <li> And weird, also greasy feel. Stick to the original version!! (Even the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula of the original version, which is not an improvement, is better.)</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and peridontial issues.  This product helps to keep my mouth moist and definitely helps with the biofilm.  I use it as a rinse and also add to my water pick water. It was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> GETS STICKYONHANDS  IT LEAKS AND GETS STICKY.  IT LEAKS AND GETS HANDS STICKY  HAVE TO WASH HANDSA AFTER USING AFTERWARDS</li>
            <li> I dislike alcohol based mouthwashes because of the drying effect.  I used to like the Crest night time mouthwash (name since changed to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse) however the new formulation contains a questionable active ingredient.  Plus it is now much more drying due to the presence of hydrogen peroxide.  This biotene is better than the original formulation in part because it contains enzymes to kill some of the bacteria that attack teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I knock it down a star is because of the feel of it: basically I want peace of mind that when my mouth feels clean it is.  This does not give that really clean feeling to your mouth that other mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li> No more dry mouth. And your mouth will tastes better than ever.  No forget the Biotene tooth paste as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Dentist told me to keep doing what I am doing!</li>
            <li> If you have mouth sores from dry mouth or medication, this clears them right up. It does have a weird, slippery feeling and oversweet taste, but it&#x27;s not terrible. It&#x27;s worth it for the benefits.</li>
            <li> It really seems to help keep your mouth clean after you floss and brush your teeth.  I do not use it all the time but I like it.</li>
            <li> i need to buy some more but not sure if it really helped me with my teeth ill keep trying. no burning feeling or anything mouth feels good after use.</li>
            <li> Have used ever since medications caused dry mouth.  Evidently good for teeth too since my dental hygienist congratulated me and asked what I do in caring for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, this helps one of my symptoms &amp;#34;Dry Mouth&amp;#34;.  I use this Biotene PBT Oral Rinse before I go to bed at night, when I wake up in the morning, and whenever my mouth is uncomfortably dry. Packaged well, received in good condition, and received as promised.</li>
            <li> I really like the Biotene line, and my dentist has noticed its effectiveness as far as my receding gums and cavities -- my mouth is getting healthier all the time. The only minor issue I have is the taste. That&#x27;s a personal thing. It&#x27;s minty but somehow artificial. I prefer some of the other oral rinses that come in Cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says. No burning and is alcohol free and no animal ingredients (at least when I checked).</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a lot of different medications that really dehydrate me (I drink 10 large glasses a day) but, I still wake up with my tongue stuck to the ruff of my mouth. I tried Biotene and it helped a bit, but it certainly didn&#x27;t solve my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went in to have a physical when I was in the Army, I told the Dr. about dry mouth, cold feet, irritability and always feeling really warm.  He took some blood samples and went back the next week.  I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking medication now and things are much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that my story may not be relevant to you, however, if you are having symptoms like I had, please get your doctor to check on your blood/sugar levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this review helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this message helps you in any way,&lt;br /&gt;Please click the \\&quot;yes\\&quot; button below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Best,&lt;br /&gt;RL Miles</li>
            <li> See my review on Biotene Gel Mint Toothpaste under a similar Heading. In that review I describe the excellent results I get from using biotene&#x27;s PBF gel toothpaste and PBF mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, due to a suggestion from my dentist and it really helps. Due to medication I take, my mouth gets very dry at night and I have to get up to rinse my mouth with water all through the night. This product helps and I will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Takes care of dry mouth from medications</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist to help with tartar control. It really works. No bitter after taste and does not harm the teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> As counterproductive as it is, I used to brush my teeth then drink a little bit of milk. It was the only way I knew of to quench the dryness that my toothpaste had caused.  Even switching toothpaste brands and ingredients didn&#x27;t work.  Then, I found Biotene at Wal-Mart.  It did the trick!  Just a swish with a small amount of this restores my mouth to its moisturized goodness after brushing.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I find that rinsing with this mouthwash at night helps lessen my episodes of dry mouth when I awake during the night. Otherwise its not a bad product, though I would have preferred it it had a nice minty taste to it. Taste isnt bad just not very pleasant</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very effective at reducing plaque and helping my teeth and gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li> With seemingly an overload of plaque due to dry mouth, this product appears to perform as described for a clean feel.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is a must if you get dry mouth from your medications, plus is makes your breath smell great!</li>
            <li> This is a great mouthwash and it does help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the mild taste of it.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouthwash I use. It is alcohol free and very gentle. It was recommended by dentist and I have been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li> Our Dentist recommended it, and it has done great things, noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> I started using Biotene original a year ago because it is alcohol free and I had read that mouthwashes containing alcohol may be causing oral cancer. I find the taste very refreshing and whenever I feel a canker sore coming on, using Biotene removes all traces of it overnight. This has worked on two different occasions. Maybe it has something to do with the ph in my mouth. It also seems to ward off sore throats and helps with my cold/allergy symptoms.</li>
            <li> I bought this mouthwash because I wanted to get away from an alcohol-based mouthwash (Listerine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a while, I think that it does make you mouth feel cleaner, but you have to get past the taste.  Every time I went you use it, I had to work up my courage.  It just tastes nasty.  Left a bit of an aftertaste too.  Flavor might just be a personal preference thing though.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using Biotene for several years. I think she just recently started to purchase this PBF formula within the last 6 months. She has dry mouth, I don&#x27;t think I do. I started to get this horrible sore on the roof of my mouth about 7 days ago. It go much worse with pain. My mom told me 3 days ago to start using her Biotene PBF mouthwash upstairs. She said it has helped her to heal mouth sores. I used it Wednesday night after brushing with my normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom also has the Biotene chewing gum. I take a piece Thursday morning. The flavor only lasted 30 minutes so I thew it away after that. No big deal, I&#x27;m not a gum chewer anymore since I used to chew gum so much in my 20s. My jaw got tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday night rinse after brushing. Friday morning, I take 2 pieces of gum since they are so small once you chew them. Friday night I rinse after brushing and I notice my sore on the roof of my mouth - no longer hurts! Saturday morning I again, take 2 pieces of gum and chew for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is Saturday night and I just rinsed. My mouth feel so clean. I&#x27;ve used other mouthwash, including Listerine, that natural brand Tom&#x27;s, and Crest and none compare to this brand and how it makes my mouth feel. If you have a mouth sore, try using this for 3 days and see what happens to it. It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and cavity-prone teeth. I also hate flossing. This stuff leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and tasty, not burning or stinging like some alcohol-containing mouthwashes out there. Addresses the dry mouth and makes the dentist happy.</li>
            <li> Biotene PBF is more expensive and harder to find than other items in the Bioteen product line.  Some stores don&#x27;t carry it because it is relatively expensive.  Others don&#x27;t sell it in the 33.8 oz. economy size.  I get it from Amazon.com.  It&#x27;s worth it.  I get this after my dental team told me about its benefits.  Healthy gums are essential to healthy teeth, and this product helps prevent receding gums.  Indirectly, it also promotes heart health and definitely prevents bad breath from dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that the 33.8 oz. large bottle is too large for my sink or gym bag.  So I just pour what I need from the 33.8 oz. bottle into a 16 oz. bottle and the 2 oz bottle. No problem filling bottles when savings or convenience or both are important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the PBF Bioteen Oral Rinse between brushings, for meetings or social activities.  The Bioteen Plaque Biofilm Loosening (PBF) Dry Mouth Fluoride Toothpaste is my morning toothpaste of choice.  It too was recommended by my dental team.</li>
            <li> Biotene is the best! I have not had a cavity since I started using it. It has also greatly reduced the number of cankre sores that I have. When I do get them, it helps sooth some of the pain and helps them go away faster. It has been great for keeping my mouth from getting dry as well. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Kaiser hospital suggested using it during my cancer treatment to help with dry mouth and to help keep plaque buildup down as I couldn&#x27;t floss. They were concerned about infection as my blood count was down due to the chemo infusions. So I wasn&#x27;t able to floss for about six months. This product worked so well I have kept it up ever since. The reason? My dentist&#x27;s hygienist said my teeth never looked better at my next appointment awhile after my last treatment! I don&#x27;t recommend not flossing....I still do.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job but feel product is a little expensive</li>
            <li> I had an issue of always waking up with cotton mouth and google it.  I read reviews that this mouth wash is alcohol free and helps with dry mouth so I tried it.  Sure enough it really helped.</li>
            <li> Meh, I don&#x27;t know.. I&#x27;ve never used a mouthwash before because they all have alcohol and sugar in them, which defeats the purpose of rinsing out your mouth since alcohol/sugar &#x3D; dries out your mouth &#x3D; bacteria loves a dry mouth &#x3D; breathy. People rinse their mouths out with alcohol and dry out their mouths even more...and then they think they need mouthwash more. But I had heard Biotene does not have alcohol in it and it&#x27;s supposed to help clean your teeth and gums between dental cleanings, which I thought was a bonus since I don&#x27;t enjoy flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything. I feel nothing different, see nothing different. Probably won&#x27;t get it again. I&#x27;m not addressing a dry mouth issue like a lot of reviewers here and I don&#x27;t have plaque build up so maybe I&#x27;m just not a good judge of this product.</li>
            <li> Patients in our office seem to prefer the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; version of this product to the PBF formulation...especially the taste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 9 months now. My last two dental cleanings or visits have been outstanding! My dentist had indicated that my tartar and plaque was reduced to almost none.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Like it!  A little pricey?</li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time on Amazon and found the taste to be very delightful. Walmart was always out of this product and it was a little bit higher price there.  We liked it so much that we will continue to buy it again.  Great Taste! Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn when rinsing or gargling.</li>
