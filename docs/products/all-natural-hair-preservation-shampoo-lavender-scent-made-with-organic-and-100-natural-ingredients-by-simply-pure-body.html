            <li>I love lavender scents and this one was very relaxing to smell.</li>
            <li>Anyways... overall it&#x27;s a good product and added benefit</li>
            <li>I love trying new shampoos that are organic, vegan, cruelty-free and sulphate free.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant lavender scent and was gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Like all sulphate free shampoos this doesn&#x27;t really lather, however it&#x27;s not supposed to so don&#x27;t be alarmed when you don&#x27;t have a head full of bubbles, it&#x27;s still doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and does not put harmful chemicals in my hair.</li>
            <li>but I know this one was made with natural ingredients which is probably better for my hair.</li>

            <li>The ingredients are natural which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>downside is the lavendar scent that we don&#x27;t really like much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think about this part when I purchased it because my man doesn&#x27;t really want to smell like Lavendar...</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this shampoo makes shower time an absolute pleasure.  </li>
            <li>my fine thin hair has a lot more body</li>
            <li>Shampoo suds up decent, and it lasts a while too...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair glistening clean, without leaving it dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lather quite as much as my normal shampoo</li>
            <li>i have super long hair and it made my hair managable and shiny.</li>
            <li>When I try a new lavender shampoo I&#x27;m always terrified about the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and organic!</li>
            <li>is it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so clean and the smell of lavender stays in my hair unlike some other shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick again and healthy and soft!</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t strip all the natural oils off my hair.......</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t strip all the natural oils off my hair.......</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>And my hair is so shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>but I have to do that always regardless of what shampoo I use as my hair is thick and tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li>It smells good but this shampoo, and it seems with all the natural shampoos, it feels a bit thin - it is hard to keep in the palm of your hand and wants to run all over.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I have tried organic shampoos and didn&#x27;t like them because I had to use a ton in order to get it to clean my hair(which</li>
            <li>Not overpowering just a subtle lavender sent that will leave a smile on your face all day!</li>

I will continue to purchase this product!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great...my fine thin hair has a lot more body and I only shampoo 3 times a week!</li>
            <li> It´s fantastic. It cleans my scalp and hair. I have oily scalp so I mix it with a bit of magnesia milk for the firs wash and it keeps down my oil for almost 4 days. It´s amazing. The only thing I don´t like much is the price, bottle is bigger than other shampoo´s though.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering. Light and smells amazing. I love that its organic and has ingredients like sage in it. It is Vegan Friendly, Cruelty-Free, and Sulphate and Sulphate Derivative Free. I dye my hair all the time so great to see that it is safe on color treated hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received mine at a discounted price, however that in no way affects my review.</li>
            <li> Im amazed at the purity and smell! Love!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It leaves your hair glistening clean, without leaving it dry and unmanageable.  I also like the fact that it is doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of suds, rinses out easily and has a pleasant fragrance</li>

That being said, it&#x27;s not really fast at extra thickening but maybe over time it does. I do notice the difference if I don&#x27;t use a shampoo that adds thickness though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the lavendar scent that we don&#x27;t really like much but that is just personal preference. I didn&#x27;t think about this part when I purchased it because my man doesn&#x27;t really want to smell like Lavendar... LOL.. he&#x27;s dealing with it for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my review, All opinions are my own and are in no way effected by their offer.</li>

            <li> I liked this shampoo and it cleaned my wavy long hair nicely. It didn&#x27;t lather quite as much as my normal shampoo but I know this one was made with natural ingredients which is probably better for my hair. I did have to use conditioner afterwards but I have to do that always regardless of what shampoo I use as my hair is thick and tends to tangle easily. I love lavender scents and this one was very relaxing to smell. If you like lavender scented shampoos I would definitely recommend. I did receive this product at a huge discount in exchange for my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have long thick natural curly hair and I do not have to use a conditioner with this. This shampoo makes my hair soft and manageable. Love the lavender smell and the gentleness on my sensitive skin.  I would recommend this shampoo for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! When I try a new lavender shampoo I&#x27;m always terrified about the smell. I know what lavender smells like, and this smells like I&#x27;m surrounded by hundreds of lavender plants. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m at home again, and that&#x27;s always a happy feeling! I&#x27;m thrilled with this shampoo and will definitely be ordering again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves hair smooth but not oily. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Pretty good shampoo! Smells like lavender... nice and relaxing scent. Shampoo suds up decent, and it lasts a while too... I wonder what it would be like to use the conditioner with this... Anyways... overall it&#x27;s a good product and added benefit is it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this shampoo makes shower time an absolute pleasure.  And my hair is so shiny and soft.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! My hair is thick again and healthy and soft! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! I am so excited to try the conditioner once it comes available!</li>
