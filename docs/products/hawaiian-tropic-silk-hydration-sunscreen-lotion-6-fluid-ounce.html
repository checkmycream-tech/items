            <li>Gives good protection against the sun.</li>
            <li>An added plus is it smells so darn good.  </li>
            <li>Kept the sunburn off for 2 weeks in Cuba and allowed me to still get a tan (I am fair skinned</li>
            <li>Their products are good and do what they advertise they will do.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not greasy, just like a nice cream.  </li>
            <li>Soaks right in - feels and works great!</li>
            <li>Really nice scent and works well, no need to apply over and over again.</li>
            <li>i always buy hawaiian tropic products because they smell really good, and they protect my skin really well and give a good color.  </li>
            <li>this product is excellent, goes on really well and smells really good and protects the skin really well.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very light but still moisturizes.</li>
            <li>and I just love it</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>i love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li>Love how easily it rubs in and feels like lotion</li>
            <li>Fantastic fragrance, very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t get burnt after a full 8 hrs in the sun!</li>
            <li>and I was fine, but ran out.</li>
            <li>I especially like that it&#x27;s 12, not 15 or 10, but a happy medium.</li>
            <li>not heavy or greasy-use it every day when I don&#x27;t need something with a higher SPF and has that great Hawaiian Tropic fragrance.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m trying to tan a bit, I use the 12 with Maui babe over it, and I get a nice natural looking tan without burn.</li>
            <li>Great lotion to get a little color without the burn.</li>
            <li>Obviously, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so use good judgement in deciding what spf  is right for you!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve ordered products that turned out to be expired.</li>
            <li>i first came in contact with this sunscreen when i was at the MGM for a girl&#x27;s vegas trip.  </li>
            <li>i bought it at the sundries store in the lobby, and it was the best random purchase ever.  </li>
            <li>Really protects your skin.</li>
            <li>Amazon gave a full &amp; prompt refund,  but until there&#x27;s oversight over who can sell what on Amazon, be prepared for this potential outcome.</li>
            <li>hands down my favorite sunscreen, used in Mexico, Florida, California and no sunburn.</li>
            <li>They were both the same Spf, reapplied every 2 hours and right after getting out of the pool.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and hydrated and its is protecting me from all those harmful rays from the sun.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like a body lotion and leaves my skin soft A&#x27;s moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this sunblock because it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy.</li>

            <li> Worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Used Coppertone the day before and I was fine, but ran out. Thought I would try Hawaiian tropic, big mistake, got a burn. They were both the same Spf, reapplied every 2 hours and right after getting out of the pool.</li>

Shudder.) Amazon gave a full &amp; prompt refund,  but until there&#x27;s oversight over who can sell what on Amazon, be prepared for this potential outcome.

            <li> I received a sample of Hawaiin Tropic Silk Hydration from Influenster and I just love it and so does my skin. My skin feels so soft and hydrated and its is protecting me from all those harmful rays from the sun.  An added plus is it smells so darn good.  Its a product everyone should try.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  The lotion is very light but still moisturizes.</li>
            <li> i love this sunscreen.  simple as that.  i first came in contact with this sunscreen when i was at the MGM for a girl&#x27;s vegas trip.  i bought it at the sundries store in the lobby, and it was the best random purchase ever.  i&#x27;ve been using this ever since and am so happy amazon carries it.  i subscribe and save to it -- using it as my daily body lotion!!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes your skin feel. It kept me from burning.</li>
            <li> Really protects your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock because it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy. It goes on like a body lotion and leaves my skin soft A&#x27;s moisturized. It seems to do it&#x27;s job as I don&#x27;t burn when using it. I use both the 12spf and the 30spf  depending on how pale I am, and both perform as expected based on the level of protection. If I&#x27;m trying to tan a bit, I use the 12 with Maui babe over it, and I get a nice natural looking tan without burn.

            <li> The brand &amp;#34;Banana Boat&amp;#34; always speaks for itself. Their products are good and do what they advertise they will do.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; smells awesome!</li>
            <li> This is the only type of sunscreen that my &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; husband will use because it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or feeling slippery.  Soaks right in - feels and works great!</li>
            <li> i received a trial of this product in my summer vox box and i was very impressed. not only does it smell AHmazing but it makes my skin feel awesome!!! oh and i didn&#x27;t get burnt after a full 8 hrs in the sun!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Fantastic fragrance, very smooth and silky. I especially like that it&#x27;s 12, not 15 or 10, but a happy medium.</li>
