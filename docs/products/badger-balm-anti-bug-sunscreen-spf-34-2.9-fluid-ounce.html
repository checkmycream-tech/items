    <ol>
            <li>THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li>We were very happy to find sun screen lotion and anti-bug cream in one.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen worked great on kids.  </li>
            <li>Great for adults though children might find citronella odour over powering</li>
            <li>Everything else is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It works great keeping the bugs away as well as blocking the sun!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>great for bugs, and some protection against the sun</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>It is a very effective sunscreen--they do not get burned at all.</li>
            <li>It is also very effective at keeping mosquitoes away, and I don&#x27;t find the citronella scent to be bothersome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good option if you are at the lake and there are some bugs</li>
            <li>Love that there is NO Toxic Chemicals in this brand!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen that will work as soon as you put it on.  </li>
            <li>It is also nice that it is a cream rather than a stick of balm (as is their bug balm) which is easier to apply than the bug balm stick.</li>
            <li>.which is probably okay if you’re fair skin, but I’m medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li>completely saved me from bug bites AND sunburn and I smelled great!!</li>
            <li>The prices are not terrible, considering you don&#x27;t have to use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is oily so you have to make sure you aren&#x27;t touching a bunch of things until you wash your hands after application.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of getting sunscreen and bug repellant in one application!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love the scents of citronella and of cedar.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the lemongrass is probably what attracts them, but I love the smell of lemongrass too...</li>
            <li>I think the best way ultimately to block the sun is to be covered</li>
            <li>no so many chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve resorted to spraying some lavender spray on top of this to counteract the bee attraction--and that seems to work.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen works well, as do most zinc oxide sunscreen products, though you also get the signature \\&quot;whitish sheen\\&quot; on your skin.  </li>
            <li>We tried regular Badger sun screen and didn&#x27;t love it, but this stuff was great!</li>
            <li>Great non-toxic product very efective to repel bugs.</li>
            <li>Best protection for my strawberry blonde all day on the boat in MI summers.</li>
            <li>(It is a strong scent, but not too strong).</li>
            <li>If you or your children are regularly outside and need both sun screen and bug deterrent, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any bug bites, but since I just doubled my skin cancer risk because of this sunscreen I am steering clear of this product and this company for good from now on.</li>
            <li>Is there a sunscreen out there that is ecologically friendly (to body and Earth) that does NOT contain zinc oxide?</li>
            <li>In the end, I suspect I&#x27;m probably better off using regular sunscreen with zinc, and then spraying bug spray on top.  </li>
            <li>A warning on the packaging would be super helpful...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years on my small, very fair skinned children.</li>
            <li>We are immediately surrounded by bees - the young man with the most on is signaled to run into a hut.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is also fairly water resistant due to the wax content.</li>
            <li>I think the best thing about this product is that it takes so long to rub in your face by the time it absorbs the sun has already gone down</li>
            <li>So we like this pretty well.</li>
            <li>Really keeps the bugs off!</li>
            <li>We bought this because it combines the two and scores a 3 on the safe cosmetic database, out of 10, which is a pretty good score (although not perfect, of course).</li>
            <li>I also think the citronella component of the bug repellant works pretty well because I&#x27;m a mosquito magnet, and I&#x27;ve not had much of a problem with bites using this.  </li>
            <li>This makes me feel safe that it is staying on and that it&#x27;s not absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li>really like their product.</li>
            <li>I just really like the idea of a 2-in-one that works.</li>
            <li>We run together to the borehole and pump water over us to wash it off as fast as we can, immediately applying another bug-spray</li>
            <li>fast service.  </li>
            <li>On the one hand, you know exactly which spots have been covered and which areas need a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>It does work in repeling both bugs and sun protection, however I agree with most other people that it does attract bees.</li>
            <li>People Also noticed once they started using it their previous bites healed better and stopped itching.</li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 is that it could work just a bit better, but it works better than expected for such a natural product</li>
            <li>Applied it to my son&#x27;s face and a minute later a mosquito landed on his forehead and took a quick bite.  </li>
            <li>Of course, one of the down sides to zinc based sun screens are that they are more greasy and look pretty white when applied and seem to stick around even after a few hours (good if you are outside, a hassle for short trips outisde to then have greasy, water proof skin for hours....).</li>
            <li>But we&#x27;re willing to live with this to decrease cancer risk and chemical exposure in regular suncreeens.</li>
            <li>far as the sunscreen part goes, this product does &#x27;show up&#x27; on your skin because of the zinc.</li>
            <li>I bought two before my trip and only used one in the whole month.</li>
            <li>It makes me very nervous, since my younger son&#x27;s never been stung before, and I don&#x27;t know if he may be allergic to bee stings.  </li>
            <li>know there&#x27;s a definite block going on, rather than worry that it has worn off, or that she&#x27;s absorbing a lot of chemicals into her skin.</li>
            <li>My young daughter ended up burned.  </li>
            <li>I really want this to work, and I want the company to do well, but this product gets a big thumbs</li>
            <li>Smells a little strong and feels a little sticky but worth it for the protection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the sunscreen on the Bullfrog is as effective, but that&#x27;s what I usually reach for these days when we just want to go outside to play for a short time.  </li>
            <li>I used this in northern New Hampshire,in the middle of the woods.</li>
            <li>That said, the zinc concerns are much lower than the risks for regular non-mineral based sun screens which often contain vitamin A, retinyl palmitate which the FDA recently noted that, when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight, may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions.</li>
            <li>Because my second son has sensitive skin and eczema, we&#x27;ve gone natural with a lot of products in our home in the last year.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients in this Badger sunscreen plus bug repellent, and I love that it uses zinc</li>
            <li>Sunscreen effective although uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>On a super bug day I was still being attacked, but I also did not later the cream on me because I didn&#x27;t want to waste a ton just for the bugs with no sun.</li>
            <li>Which is nice, except it makes it a little hard to spread around and rub in.</li>
            <li>Their products are much safer than almost any other I can find.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint, though, is that the sweet scent attracts BEES.  </li>

            <li> Their products are much safer than almost any other I can find.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint, though, is that the sweet scent attracts BEES.  </li>
            <li> other Badger sunscreens, this product is thick and difficult to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think it is very effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really thick and hard to rub in, and definitely has a strong scent to it.</li>
            <li> can put up with the white, smeary, and paste-thick viscosity that makes it incredibly hard to rub in, but I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times (the 45SPF version and in large quantities every time) and I&#x27;ve burned every time from minimal exposure.</li>
            <li> The combo SPF/bug repellent is great.</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit of patience to spread</li>
            <li> I figured I hadn&#x27;t applied it thick enough and used it again a few weeks later and same thing.</li>
            <li> The 3 comes from the combination of olive oil, zinc oxide, and castor oil, all of which are relatively low risk, but each having slight indications for irritation and the zinc slight safety concerns if used in excess.</li>
            <li> little tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> repellent is natural, so it has a strong smell that may bother some people.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, every time I apply, I have to wipe my hands with a baby wipe</li>
            <li> I applied it during a somewhat warm day, was only out about half an hour or less and got a horrible sunburn.</li>
            <li> The product is also marketed as an insect repellent and while it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t repel insects.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a plain zinc oxide sunscreen and a separate container of insect repellent that is effective.</li>
            <li> any zinc oxide, the product does go on white and is hard to rub in, but in my opinion, that makes it easier to see if you missed any spots!</li>
            <li> so I would rather have my toddler look a little chalky on her face and</li>
            <li> The mosquitoes killed me...</li>
            <li> My second complaint would be that the stuff is thick and a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or if they are having trouble conforming to the new sunscreen guidelines, but I have never had a sunscreen that just so utterly fails completely.</li>
            <li> It also makes it a little hard to work in the zinc/titanium oxide</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say bad about Badger as a company.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my toddler for the past couple of summers.  </li>
            <li> I was out mostly in the shade and got a horrible sunburn.</li>
            <li> Used this for a week in the carribbean rainforest where the sun and the Mosquitos are hard core.</li>
            <li> Hard to spread, makes you look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I tried using as little as possible to make the ghostly/white look not so bad.</li>
            <li> It does deter insects (at least mosquitoes) without a funky odor.</li>
            <li> too thick.  </li>
            <li> Applied thick, sticky balm to face, arms and hands.  </li>
            <li> We had the same experience with bees - only it could have been very bad.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Anti-bug part failed.  </li>
            <li> We purchased Badger because it uses fewer chemicals, but that&#x27;s irrelevant if it does not protect you from the sun.  </li>
            <li> and this could have been so much worse!!</li>
            <li> Just a bad product.</li>
            <li> Terrible odor, smell is so bad my kids will not let me use it on them.  </li>
            <li> Get something else for bug repellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a sunscreen with repellent and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> too thick.  try livestrong</li>
            <li> Go this to protect my face from the sun but it smelled like sunscreen and took forever to rub in. I think the best thing about this product is that it takes so long to rub in your face by the time it absorbs the sun has already gone down so you dont have to worry about getting harmful rays</li>
            <li> The mosquitoes killed me... The creme does nothing... nothing...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say bad about Badger as a company. Their products are much safer than almost any other I can find. The prices are not terrible, considering you don&#x27;t have to use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the sunscreen part goes, this product does &#x27;show up&#x27; on your skin because of the zinc. This makes me feel safe that it is staying on and that it&#x27;s not absorbing into my skin. It is oily so you have to make sure you aren&#x27;t touching a bunch of things until you wash your hands after application. I left a big smear on my car just from closing the door after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bug repellant part does work in my opinion. On a super bug day I was still being attacked, but I also did not later the cream on me because I didn&#x27;t want to waste a ton just for the bugs with no sun. It&#x27;s a good option if you are at the lake and there are some bugs and you don&#x27;t want to put lots of toxic chemicals on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like their product. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 is that it could work just a bit better, but it works better than expected for such a natural product and I won&#x27;t change brands!</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!! I wish it came in a spray.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of getting sunscreen and bug repellant in one application!&lt;br /&gt;I love the scents of citronella and of cedar.  It makes me feel I am in the woods even when I am only in the car or walking in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it dies not sting me like the regular sunscreens do, because the zinc oxide is a physical barrier.&lt;br /&gt;THis little tube lasts a long time.  I bought two before my trip and only used one in the whole month.</li>
            <li> Because my second son has sensitive skin and eczema, we&#x27;ve gone natural with a lot of products in our home in the last year.  I love the natural ingredients in this Badger sunscreen plus bug repellent, and I love that it uses zinc so it&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen that will work as soon as you put it on.  I also think the citronella component of the bug repellant works pretty well because I&#x27;m a mosquito magnet, and I&#x27;ve not had much of a problem with bites using this.  My biggest complaint, though, is that the sweet scent attracts BEES.  When we&#x27;re in a park with this, it seems like the moment I&#x27;ve finished spreading the stuff on my kids, bees show up, and they want to hover around me and my children like we&#x27;re flowers.  It makes me very nervous, since my younger son&#x27;s never been stung before, and I don&#x27;t know if he may be allergic to bee stings.  My second complaint would be that the stuff is thick and a bit oily.  On the one hand, you know exactly which spots have been covered and which areas need a little bit more.  On the other hand, every time I apply, I have to wipe my hands with a baby wipe or I&#x27;ll grease everything else I touch.  Bull Frog makes a pump-spray that&#x27;s 2-in-one.  I don&#x27;t think the sunscreen on the Bullfrog is as effective, but that&#x27;s what I usually reach for these days when we just want to go outside to play for a short time.  In the end, I suspect I&#x27;m probably better off using regular sunscreen with zinc, and then spraying bug spray on top.  I just really like the idea of a 2-in-one that works.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using this on my toddler for the past couple of summers.  It does work in repeling both bugs and sun protection, however I agree with most other people that it does attract bees. They haven&#x27;t followed her thankfully, but if she is around flowers, they seem to take an interest, but then go back to what they had been doing. The scent of the lemongrass is probably what attracts them, but I love the smell of lemongrass too...&lt;br /&gt;Like any zinc oxide, the product does go on white and is hard to rub in, but in my opinion, that makes it easier to see if you missed any spots! I think the best way ultimately to block the sun is to be covered so I would rather have my toddler look a little chalky on her face and know there&#x27;s a definite block going on, rather than worry that it has worn off, or that she&#x27;s absorbing a lot of chemicals into her skin.</li>
            <li> We had the same experience with bees - only it could have been very bad. We are in the middle of Malawi, Africa - in a village. Several team members and myself apply the sunscreen. We are immediately surrounded by bees - the young man with the most on is signaled to run into a hut. With no windows or doors, the bees simply follow him inside. We run together to the borehole and pump water over us to wash it off as fast as we can, immediately applying another bug-spray someone else happens to have. A warning on the packaging would be super helpful... and this could have been so much worse!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for camping in Yosemite.  Sunscreen worked great on kids.  Anti-bug part failed.  Applied it to my son&#x27;s face and a minute later a mosquito landed on his forehead and took a quick bite.  Get something else for bug repellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a sunscreen with repellent and no so many chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;As other Badger sunscreens, this product is thick and difficult to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think it is very effective. I only need a little bit of patience to spread it.&lt;br /&gt;The repellent is natural, so it has a strong smell that may bother some people.</li>
            <li> I used this in northern New Hampshire,in the middle of the woods. It passed the test.....well worth the money. Will buy again before next season.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or if they are having trouble conforming to the new sunscreen guidelines, but I have never had a sunscreen that just so utterly fails completely. I applied it during a somewhat warm day, was only out about half an hour or less and got a horrible sunburn. I figured I hadn&#x27;t applied it thick enough and used it again a few weeks later and same thing. I was out mostly in the shade and got a horrible sunburn. I didn&#x27;t get any bug bites, but since I just doubled my skin cancer risk because of this sunscreen I am steering clear of this product and this company for good from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years on my small, very fair skinned children. It is a very effective sunscreen--they do not get burned at all. It is thicker and requires being rubbed in, but this is not a big deal to me. It is also very effective at keeping mosquitoes away, and I don&#x27;t find the citronella scent to be bothersome. (It is a strong scent, but not too strong). BUT, I&#x27;m in agreement that bees seem to be attracted to this product. Within minutes of applying it, I have seen bee(s) swarm around my children--and two of them have been stung:/ I&#x27;ve resorted to spraying some lavender spray on top of this to counteract the bee attraction--and that seems to work. In the future I&#x27;ll probably only buy the regular Badger and use a separate anti-bug solution.</li>
            <li> It does deter insects (at least mosquitoes) without a funky odor. It is also fairly water resistant due to the wax content. Which is nice, except it makes it a little hard to spread around and rub in. It also makes it a little hard to work in the zinc/titanium oxide so you don&#x27;t look so chalky white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did hold up to three hours of clamming in the inter-coastal waterway (i.e. marsh), where I walked away with no bug bites or sunburn unlike others in my group.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried this and another Badger sunscreen. They did not protect us from the sun. My young daughter ended up burned.  We purchased Badger because it uses fewer chemicals, but that&#x27;s irrelevant if it does not protect you from the sun.  Just a bad product.</li>
            <li> We were very happy to find sun screen lotion and anti-bug cream in one. We were using both the badger sunscreen and the bug balm separately, which is quite the hassle if you need to apply them to your child regularly. We bought this because it combines the two and scores a 3 on the safe cosmetic database, out of 10, which is a pretty good score (although not perfect, of course). The 3 comes from the combination of olive oil, zinc oxide, and castor oil, all of which are relatively low risk, but each having slight indications for irritation and the zinc slight safety concerns if used in excess. That said, the zinc concerns are much lower than the risks for regular non-mineral based sun screens which often contain vitamin A, retinyl palmitate which the FDA recently noted that, when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight, may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions. Yikes. Not good. So we like this pretty well. Of course, one of the down sides to zinc based sun screens are that they are more greasy and look pretty white when applied and seem to stick around even after a few hours (good if you are outside, a hassle for short trips outisde to then have greasy, water proof skin for hours....). But we&#x27;re willing to live with this to decrease cancer risk and chemical exposure in regular suncreeens. If you or your children are regularly outside and need both sun screen and bug deterrent, this is a great option. It is also nice that it is a cream rather than a stick of balm (as is their bug balm) which is easier to apply than the bug balm stick.</li>
            <li> Used this for a week in the carribbean rainforest where the sun and the Mosquitos are hard core. While everyone else got destroyed we watched potential attackers literally get within 2 ft of me and reroute! One application worked all day even in the constant rain. Smells a little strong and feels a little sticky but worth it for the protection. People Also noticed once they started using it their previous bites healed better and stopped itching. I will take this on every future trip anywhere!!</li>
            <li> I really want this to work, and I want the company to do well, but this product gets a big thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can put up with the white, smeary, and paste-thick viscosity that makes it incredibly hard to rub in, but I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times (the 45SPF version and in large quantities every time) and I&#x27;ve burned every time from minimal exposure. It simply doesn&#x27;t block the sun from your skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our Cancun trip since we were going to Xcaret and they’re supposed to enforce visitors to only use a biodegradable sunscreen. This stuff is really thick and hard to rub in, and definitely has a strong scent to it. Leaves you looking ghostly white….which is probably okay if you’re fair skin, but I’m medium skin tone.  I tried using as little as possible to make the ghostly/white look not so bad.</li>
            <li> Great for adults though children might find citronella odour over powering</li>
            <li> Applied thick, sticky balm to face, arms and hands.  Within minutes of moving riding lawn mower across lawn, was relentlessly attacked and followed by flies.  Sunscreen effective although uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Terrible odor, smell is so bad my kids will not let me use it on them.  Had to throw out entire tube.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works well, as do most zinc oxide sunscreen products, though you also get the signature \\&quot;whitish sheen\\&quot; on your skin.  The product is also marketed as an insect repellent and while it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t repel insects.  Save your money and buy a plain zinc oxide sunscreen and a separate container of insect repellent that is effective.</li>
            <li> Hard to spread, makes you look like a clown. Everything else is great. Is there a sunscreen out there that is ecologically friendly (to body and Earth) that does NOT contain zinc oxide?</li>
            <li> Smells like citronella or something, but it keeps the bugs at bay and also works well as sunscreen.  We tried regular Badger sun screen and didn&#x27;t love it, but this stuff was great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Used in the countryside and didn&#x27;t get 1 bite.  The combo SPF/bug repellent is great.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really keeps the bugs off!</li>
            <li> Love that there is NO Toxic Chemicals in this brand!  It works great keeping the bugs away as well as blocking the sun!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!!&lt;br /&gt;-Amanda J</li>
            <li> Great non-toxic product very efective to repel bugs.</li>
            <li> I got this before a trip to Belize. I spend a week in the wilderness and a weeks on the beach. completely saved me from bug bites AND sunburn and I smelled great!! Will be ordering again for my next vacation and summers at home!</li>
            <li> great for bugs, and some protection against the sun</li>
            <li> Best protection for my strawberry blonde all day on the boat in MI summers.</li>
            <li> fast service.  great product.</li>
