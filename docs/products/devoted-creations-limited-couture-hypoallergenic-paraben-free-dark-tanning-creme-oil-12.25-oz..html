            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>so this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, it works and best off no smell !</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>No complaints, achieved great color without the tingle or itchiness.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Great tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Good deal and value for the money.</li>
            <li>and it smells good too</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells nice before tanning, no after tan funk smell, still not a fan.</li>
            <li>I Like it because it&#x27;s paraben-free, and does leave your skin feeling nice, but the smell is underwhelming.  </li>
            <li>kind of lemony-</li>
            <li>The smell can be described as light, a bit lemony, and pleasant in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive and this product is awesome!!</li>
            <li>She told me the woman at the salon said it was safe to use on your face</li>
            <li>No awful coconut smell with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love my &amp;#34;Designer Skin:</li>
            <li>One of the best and speed tanning lotions for white skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion has improved my ability to gain a darker shade better than any I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I have so many allergies and my skin is so senstive</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>, I am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li>So true!</li>
            <li>After using this lotion for a while, I have not been able to see any significant results while using it.</li>
            <li>At First Sight smells amazing before</li>
            <li>It is the only product we could find that was unscented, so we were really happy to have found it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have any scent to it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell and the consistency.</li>
            <li>This bronzer is fragrance free and after tanning there is no after smell.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for someone looking for a paraben free lotion.</li>
            <li>and after I tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus side: good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product has a clean, light, lime scent,</li>
            <li>I have been going sporadically, so I think if I just went on a consistent basis, I would see better results.</li>
            <li>(Although I know better than to recommend tanning at all, haha.)</li>
            <li>No bad after smell.</li>
            <li>Would buy it again cheap and exactly like the salons</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are simple and more natural instead of chemical-filled like most others.</li>
            <li>Now I have VERY sensitive skin, I&#x27;m allergic to most fabric softeners</li>
            <li>The smell is a little lemony but a great product.</li>
            <li>It smells good when you first put it on, however like any other tanning lotion there is an after smell.</li>
            <li>Smell is good and gets the skin dark too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie</li>
            <li>certainly going to order again when I run out!</li>
            <li>I really like  this  one!</li>
            <li>At First Sight&amp;#34; fragrance-free intensifier</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast too!</li>
            <li>so good if you want lotion that&#x27;s not strongly scented..</li>
            <li>It was a great lotion - smell was lemony and subtle.  </li>
            <li>Works really well to help achieve a darker tan and also doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is NOT horrible just not very perfumey.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do what it is intended to do as a tanning oil, but it fulfills our need of having a product which is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied with the product</li>
            <li>and  I expected better results.</li>
            <li>much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so thick which is good for timely coverage before the auto start on the machine.</li>
            <li>I would say the only drawback is the cost, but for us, it was worth it!</li>
            <li>but I enjoy that it isn&#x27;t super heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>They claim it smells like lemon, but its a very gentle scent that I personally barely notice.</li>
            <li>It did leave a tinge of the dreaded after-tan burned smell, but it was easy to overlook due to how it conditioned the skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets easily irritated with other lotions.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t tan</li>
            <li>Costs a little more than standard lotions, but if you have sensitive skin, its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is not for you if you burn easily, so please take caution even if it means going for less time in the tanning bed until your skin is used to it.</li>
            <li>I  have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to what I put on it</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances, I get headaches and sometimes rashes from &amp;#34;perfumy things&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So after much deliberation and patient tanning salon personnel giving me samples, I finally settled on this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and you can use it on your face - it doesn&#x27;t have any after smell and your skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>i have sensitive hands (eczema)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not bad, just bland-</li>
            <li>Super greasy, feels watered down..</li>
            <li>so I had to be careful, and this is highly recommended.</li>

            <li> The creamy consistency makes it go a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell is really pleasant without being too perfumy or annoying, and it helps moisturize the skin which helps when your skin tends to be dry!</li>
            <li> BTW, very affordable online, mark-up is ridiculous in the salons.</li>
            <li> and  this product doesn&#x27;t  leave your body dry stinky!</li>
            <li> No real tanning benefits after using 3 days in a row.</li>
            <li> I just started going tanning on a regular basis and I was having a hard time finding a tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t smell like bronzer and make you smell after getting out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> For being fragrance free, this lotion isnt bad.  </li>
            <li> Just like my mother, I to came home really dark after one use.</li>
            <li> HATE the smell of most tanning products,</li>
            <li> It smells a little like cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> It was the only one that didn&#x27;t itch and finding a lotion without a bronzer was a difficult task.</li>
            <li> It gets me just as dark as the other expensive bronzers I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find indoor tanning products that match this.</li>
            <li> It is a bit watery, not quite as thick as I would imagine</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so thin that it runs, however, and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This says it is &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but it does have a slight smell to it but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Smell is very subtle after tanning, whereas my DS</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad after smell like some lotions...</li>
            <li> they smell really bad once you&#x27;ve tanned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this lotion from the tanning salon in my gym and haven&#x27;t regretted it since. Initially my mother inspired me when she picked it up and came home freakishly tan after one use. She told me the woman at the salon said it was safe to use on your face and so she figured she might as well knock out two birds with one stone. So true! It smells good when you first put it on, however like any other tanning lotion there is an after smell. It is NOT horrible just not very perfumey. Just like my mother, I to came home really dark after one use. This lotion is not for you if you burn easily, so please take caution even if it means going for less time in the tanning bed until your skin is used to it.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels like water. It&#x27;s horrible. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  Expired lotion is the content in the fancy bottle. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I really like  this  one! I  have very sensitive skin and  this product doesn&#x27;t  leave your body dry stinky! I  think  I &#x27;ll stick w/ this  one!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Not only does it do what it is intended to do as a tanning oil, but it fulfills our need of having a product which is fragrance free.  It is the only product we could find that was unscented, so we were really happy to have found it.  I would say the only drawback is the cost, but for us, it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Works really well to help achieve a darker tan and also doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin! The smell is really pleasant without being too perfumy or annoying, and it helps moisturize the skin which helps when your skin tends to be dry! I am an Esthetician and I definitely recommend it! (Although I know better than to recommend tanning at all, haha.)</li>
            <li> Excellent. Not so thick which is good for timely coverage before the auto start on the machine.</li>
            <li> So after much deliberation and patient tanning salon personnel giving me samples, I finally settled on this product. It was the only one that didn&#x27;t itch and finding a lotion without a bronzer was a difficult task. Now I have VERY sensitive skin, I&#x27;m allergic to most fabric softeners so I had to be careful, and this is highly recommended. They claim it smells like lemon, but its a very gentle scent that I personally barely notice.</li>
            <li> No awful coconut smell with this stuff. Didn&#x27;t want any bronzer so this product is perfect. No complaints, achieved great color without the tingle or itchiness. 5 stars. BTW, very affordable online, mark-up is ridiculous in the salons.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product works well.  It&#x27;s not greasy and you can use it on your face - it doesn&#x27;t have any after smell and your skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> After using this lotion for a while, I have not been able to see any significant results while using it. I am very unsatisfied with the product and  I expected better results.</li>
            <li> I just started going tanning on a regular basis and I was having a hard time finding a tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t smell like bronzer and make you smell after getting out of the tanning bed. This says it is &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but it does have a slight smell to it but not too bad. My skin is very sensitive to what I put on it and I have had no problems with this tanning lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Most certainly going to order again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I am very sensitive and this product is awesome!! I would recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad after smell like some lotions... and it won&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li> This product was double the cost in tanning salons. The smell is a little lemony but a great product. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Super greasy, feels watered down.. No real tanning benefits after using 3 days in a row. Love my &amp;#34;Designer Skin: At First Sight&amp;#34; fragrance-free intensifier much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice before tanning, no after tan funk smell, still not a fan. Smell is very subtle after tanning, whereas my DS At First Sight smells amazing before and after I tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus side: good for sensitive skin. Hasn&#x27;t caused and rashes or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side: hasn&#x27;t gotten me any darker, either.</li>
            <li> One of the best and speed tanning lotions for white skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion without bronzers - which is a lot tougher than it sounds.  This one also has n parabens, and is basically hypoallergenic.  It was a great lotion - smell was lemony and subtle.  It did leave a tinge of the dreaded after-tan burned smell, but it was easy to overlook due to how it conditioned the skin.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hypoallergenic/fragrance-free. I also didn&#x27;t want any bronzing, tingling, or accelerator ingredients added to my lotion. It&#x27;s hard to find indoor tanning products that match this. The price was 1/3rd of what my tanning salon sells it for! It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have any scent to it. Good deal and value for the money.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell and the consistency. The smell can be described as light, a bit lemony, and pleasant in my opinion. It is a bit watery, not quite as thick as I would imagine but I enjoy that it isn&#x27;t super heavy on my skin. It isn&#x27;t so thin that it runs, however, and it absorbs well. I normally don&#x27;t tan, I am pretty fair skinned. This lotion has improved my ability to gain a darker shade better than any I have tried before. I have been going sporadically, so I think if I just went on a consistent basis, I would see better results. I love that the ingredients are simple and more natural instead of chemical-filled like most others. I have gotten about 12-15 sessions out of one bottle and I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> My skin gets easily irritated with other lotions. This stuff works great. Costs a little more than standard lotions, but if you have sensitive skin, its definitely worth it. Smell is good and gets the skin dark too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion. No bad after smell. No grease feeling.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive hands (eczema) so it burns my hands when i apply it. and it doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell. i probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances, I get headaches and sometimes rashes from &amp;#34;perfumy things&amp;#34;.  This bronzer is fragrance free and after tanning there is no after smell. The creamy consistency makes it go a long way. It gets me just as dark as the other expensive bronzers I have used. Shipping was extremely fast too!</li>
            <li> I do not want to leave the tanning salon smelling like I just came off the beach.  This product has a clean, light, lime scent,</li>
            <li> I have so many allergies and my skin is so senstive and I can use this.  I love this and it smells good too</li>
            <li> I Like it because it&#x27;s paraben-free, and does leave your skin feeling nice, but the smell is underwhelming.  Not bad, just bland- kind of lemony- so good if you want lotion that&#x27;s not strongly scented.. Turns out I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; in the description!</li>
            <li> For being fragrance free, this lotion isnt bad.  It smells a little like cinnamon.  I would recommend it for someone looking for a paraben free lotion.</li>
            <li> I got this because I tryed a sample at the gym where I tan.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, it works and best off no smell !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE the smell of most tanning products, too fact and they smell really bad once you&#x27;ve tanned.&lt;br /&gt;Not this.</li>
            <li> Would buy it again cheap and exactly like the salons</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t had any issues with this product.</li>
    </ol>
