            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>I have owned 5 eye pillows over the years, and this is the best of all.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>The weight and fill is perfect for its intended purpose, though I like to carry mine around from room to room just to keep sniffing and feeling it!</li>
            <li>This pillow if very attractive and is generous in size and weight.  </li>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>Wonderful lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fabric is beautiful and feels delicious.  </li>
            <li>Ideally, the cover should have been removable.</li>
            <li>Pillow is beautifully done,  the fabric is so</li>
            <li>Beautiful and practical</li>
            <li>Beautiful print</li>
            <li>Beautiful fabric and workmanship.  </li>
            <li>The design is just beautiful.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure whatever Brocade I would find couldn&#x27;t possibly be as beautiful as this one!</li>
            <li>Because I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love it after yoga class!</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and the fabric is good quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have loved some more</li>
            <li>Honestly, I thought the price was a bit steep and looked up all the ingredients to make my own.</li>
            <li>none this nice.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the size, weight and scent of this pillow.  </li>
            <li>I tried it as well, and I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice</li>

            <li>Smells great and very pretty fabric.  </li>
            <li>This eye pillow smells great, and it&#x27;s very pretty too.</li>
            <li>first, the purple silk with dragonflies is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Not only is it beautiful and the lavender scent delightful, but it is a bit longer than most eye pillows and so is extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell, LOVE the fabric, and LOVE the feel of it!</li>
            <li>If I ever have a need for more than 2 or 3 more, I might consider getting the ingredients and making my own</li>
            <li>Very relaxing for the eyes, and beautiful as well.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that I love it?</li>
            <li>I have sent it as a gift, but it came as scheduled and seems lovely</li>
            <li>Love this eye pillow.  </li>
            <li>you deserve it :)</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love it love it.</li>
            <li>Need one more</li>
            <li>I am a yoga therapist and my students LOVE these flax seed eyebags wtih lavender buds.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered some more for gifts; they never disappoint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a play toy for my daughter now that something that I want to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect weight helps me go back to sleep.</li>
            <li>Love to use this when taking a break.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye pillow.  </li>
            <li>I love it1</li>
            <li>I gave it as a gift for Christmas to my aspiring Yogi sister :-)</li>
            <li>The lavender fragrance is quite strong for the first week out of the bag, but then provides a nice aromatherapy while in use.</li>
            <li>just right, said Goldilocks!</li>
            <li>Quick receipt.</li>
            <li>The fabric quickly cools so</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I ordered another one for my overnite bag, a different one, not that this one was anything less than amazing, cuz it was, but I wanted to try another!!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice larger size means it covers my forehead and temples.</li>
            <li>Best used in a flat lying down position.</li>
            <li>I received my first eye pillow as a gift in July and haven&#x27;t slept on night without it</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m including a few of my own to show what they look like at different angles in the light.</li>
            <li>Really calms and relax the mind</li>
            <li>I especially am enjoying keeping this in my freezer and using it cold.</li>
            <li>I used to sleep with an entire pillow over my head to keep light out and the weight of it.  </li>
            <li>It really takes the edge off of the headache.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>but I think if there were as much as I&#x27;d like, it might be too strong for some to keep on their face for long.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to take relaxation breaks throughout the work day, but with several minutes of recovery time after use, it is just not practical for me.</li>
            <li>I just flip it over in the middle of the night and have soothing cool comfort.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re woven into the fabric and very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it, you will not regret buying this pillow.</li>
            <li>The lavender fragrance is notable but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this pretty, but I have a lot of headaches</li>
            <li>Large, just enough lavender.  </li>
            <li>The material of the eye pillow is soft but slippery.</li>
            <li>but does not feel like soft silk.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I frequently wake up during the night, and find when I use the eye pillow it helps me go back to sleep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and the scent is already barely perceptible.</li>
            <li>third, the amount of filling is exactly right: not too firm, not too soft.</li>
            <li>second, the pillow is quite large, long enough to drape over the sides of my face.</li>
            <li>Relaxing hot or cold and keeps the light out well.</li>
            <li>I was also concerned with the strength of smell; some said too much, some said too little.</li>

            <li> They last a long time; I have had some for three years used daily.  </li>

            <li> Bigger than my previous eye pillow but not as soft/silky.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried when I ordered this that the dragonflies might be stitched on and feel rough against my skin</li>
            <li> but if you only need a few, this can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other eye pillows but</li>
            <li> I use this in my yoga class three times a week and all the other students wanted to know where I got it.  </li>
            <li> I have other (ligher) eye pillows that don&#x27;t cause me this problem.</li>
            <li> had a subtle scent that lasted much longer - at least 8-12 months.</li>
            <li> Whenever I have a headache I just lie down with this over my eyes, it soothes away the pain.</li>
            <li> Now this little guy travels with me everywhere</li>
            <li> And sure, I could buy the fabric (Brocade), flax seed, and lavender buds to make some myself, but that seems like an awful lot of work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit slippery, unlike our older one, but it&#x27;s not that bad.  </li>
            <li> My previous eye pillow (that I bought at a random store while on travel</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!  Quick receipt. As described.  I will order again from this supplier.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have owned 5 eye pillows over the years, and this is the best of all. first, the purple silk with dragonflies is beautiful. second, the pillow is quite large, long enough to drape over the sides of my face. third, the amount of filling is exactly right: not too firm, not too soft. just right, said Goldilocks!</li>
            <li> This is so relaxing to have. It smells lovely and the fabric is good quality</li>
            <li> I think I might be allergic to the contents but I don&#x27;t care! I LOVE the smell, LOVE the fabric, and LOVE the feel of it! I was a bit worried when I ordered this that the dragonflies might be stitched on and feel rough against my skin but they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re woven into the fabric and very soft and shiny! The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice so I&#x27;m including a few of my own to show what they look like at different angles in the light. I was also concerned with the strength of smell; some said too much, some said too little. I think it&#x27;s perfect! I&#x27;d have loved some more but I think if there were as much as I&#x27;d like, it might be too strong for some to keep on their face for long. I can&#x27;t even describe the fabric; it feels kinda stretchy (though I&#x27;m not sure it actually is) and soft. The weight and fill is perfect for its intended purpose, though I like to carry mine around from room to room just to keep sniffing and feeling it! Honestly, I thought the price was a bit steep and looked up all the ingredients to make my own. And sure, I could buy the fabric (Brocade), flax seed, and lavender buds to make some myself, but that seems like an awful lot of work! And I&#x27;m sure whatever Brocade I would find couldn&#x27;t possibly be as beautiful as this one! If I ever have a need for more than 2 or 3 more, I might consider getting the ingredients and making my own but if you only need a few, this can&#x27;t be beat! Did I mention that I love it? Because I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have sent it as a gift, but it came as scheduled and seems lovely</li>
            <li> Very relaxing for the eyes, and beautiful as well.</li>
            <li> Really calms and relax the mind</li>
            <li> Love this eye pillow.  I&#x27;ve had other eye pillows but none this nice.  Not only is it beautiful and the lavender scent delightful, but it is a bit longer than most eye pillows and so is extremely comfortable.  I frequently wake up during the night, and find when I use the eye pillow it helps me go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> Bigger than others I&#x27;ve gotten. Love it after yoga class!</li>
            <li> Relaxing hot or cold and keeps the light out well.</li>
            <li> Pillow is beautifully done,  the fabric is so comforting.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, you will not regret buying this pillow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one of these. I liked it so much that I ordered another one for my overnite bag, a different one, not that this one was anything less than amazing, cuz it was, but I wanted to try another!!!!! GET YOURSELF AN EYE PILLOW!!!!!!! you deserve it :)</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Whenever I have a headache I just lie down with this over my eyes, it soothes away the pain.</li>
            <li> Love it love it. Need one more</li>
            <li> the stitching was not well done. The flax seeds spilled out the second time I used it. I will use The Pillow Company again.</li>
            <li> I use this in my yoga class three times a week and all the other students wanted to know where I got it.  I told them of course!</li>
            <li> The fabric is beautiful and feels delicious.  The lavender fragrance is notable but not overwhelming.  The pillow itself is well-filled, but still pliable.  I especially am enjoying keeping this in my freezer and using it cold.</li>
            <li> I am a yoga therapist and my students LOVE these flax seed eyebags wtih lavender buds.  They last a long time; I have had some for three years used daily.  I just ordered some more for gifts; they never disappoint.</li>
            <li> This pillow if very attractive and is generous in size and weight.  The lavender fragrance is quite strong for the first week out of the bag, but then provides a nice aromatherapy while in use.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and practical</li>
            <li> This item split at the seam after only 6 uses and spread flax seed all over the place. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and the scent is already barely perceptible. My previous eye pillow (that I bought at a random store while on travel so I don&#x27;t know the brand-otherwise I would buy the same one) had a subtle scent that lasted much longer - at least 8-12 months. The material of the eye pillow is soft but slippery. It&#x27;s more of a play toy for my daughter now that something that I want to use.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Smells great! Bigger than my previous eye pillow but not as soft/silky. Perfect weight helps me go back to sleep. Beautiful print but does not feel like soft silk.</li>
            <li> Love to use this when taking a break.  Smells of lavender.</li>
            <li> I received my first eye pillow as a gift in July and haven&#x27;t slept on night without it (it is now October!).  I am thrilled with the size, weight and scent of this pillow.  I used to sleep with an entire pillow over my head to keep light out and the weight of it.  Now this little guy travels with me everywhere and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  The fabric quickly cools so I just flip it over in the middle of the night and have soothing cool comfort.  Well made!  I just bought two for gifts...Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for the wife.  She loves it.  I tried it as well, and I liked it.  It&#x27;s a bit slippery, unlike our older one, but it&#x27;s not that bad.  If you try to use it on your eyes while in an elevated position, it can slip off.  Best used in a flat lying down position.</li>
            <li> Not only is this pretty, but I have a lot of headaches so I keep my eye pillow in the freezer and apply it to my eyes. It really takes the edge off of the headache.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend&#x27;s going away gift. It smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> This eye pillow was much too heavy for me. After just 7 mins of use, when I removed from my eyes my vision would be blurry to the point I couldn&#x27;t read text on a computer screen for several minutes. I originally purchased this to take relaxation breaks throughout the work day, but with several minutes of recovery time after use, it is just not practical for me. I have other (ligher) eye pillows that don&#x27;t cause me this problem. If this eye pillow had a zipper, I could have removed some filling to lighten it up but it&#x27;s sewn shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations for product improvement:&lt;br /&gt;1) Add zipper closure&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a lighter fabric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going with the Barefoot Yoga eye pillow, which is more expensive but has the above two features.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this EXCEPT that there appears to be no way to wash it. Ideally, the cover should have been removable.</li>
            <li> Came on time and as described.  Smells great and very pretty fabric.  Nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice</li>
