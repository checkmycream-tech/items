            <li>A really great product.</li>

            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer, non-greasy, I love it.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I love this moisterizer!</li>
            <li>love this item!</li>
            <li>Just amazing.</li>
            <li>The product is nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li>As far as how it works on your face, IT&#x27;S AWESOME!!!!!</li>
            <li>Purlisse 30 SPF sunscreen and moisturizer is very light to the touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Received this as a sample and LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work any better than my $8 sunscreen.  </li>

            <li>I love that it is SPF 30</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying like so many sun blocks can be.</li>
            <li>Best facial moisturizer with sunblock ever!  </li>
            <li>I know octinoxate and octisalate are OK for me.  </li>
            <li>Nice, light moisturizer</li>
            <li>but I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>And of course as soon as I realized I needed more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best daily moisturizer with SPF that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I now think of it as an awesome daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Feels light on the skin.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light weight</li>
            <li>I mix it with a small amount of foundation for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>I used this all Summer long and loved it.</li>
            <li>So I bought a full size bottle right away.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product in my Ipsy back and loved it.</li>
            <li>The peptides really work to smooth your skin and add antiaging properties.  </li>
            <li>I have no rash of any kind and no tan, though I&#x27;ve been outside a couple of times a day to walk my dog.  </li>
            <li>Smells good - typical sunscreen scent - but lighter than cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, since one tube last for many months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty thick lotion/cream, but it applies smoothly and absorbs into the skin fairly well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty thick lotion/cream, but it applies smoothly and absorbs into the skin fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different SPF moisturizers and keep returning to this one.</li>
            <li>Although it has a lot of citrus extracts as ingredients, the smell to me is more of a generic &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Although it has a lot of citrus extracts as ingredients, the smell to me is more of a generic &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I meant to buy the moisturizer without SPF but found this to be so soft and makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it has SPF in it</li>
            <li>Wash, put this on, and you&#x27;re ready for make up.  </li>
            <li>but it is really gentle and works well.</li>
            <li>I went straight to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise my eyes water so much</li>
            <li>My skin has looked fabulous since I started using this daily.  </li>
            <li>- I got this in my August 2014 Beauty Box 5 Box and after reading many subscription box blogs over the summer, it seems like it appeared in a bunch of other boxes.</li>
            <li>and my skin is protected from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays without my skin feeling greasy like it does with many other products that have SPF in it.</li>
            <li>I love it - just not right now.</li>
            <li>I really like that the formula is light, not heavy, but provides enough moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer absorbs really well and makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>It is never greasy and moisturizes well, and most importantly, it&#x27;s not too perfume-y.</li>
            <li>No break outs, no heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>I did not see any major improvement in my skin that would make me buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but to me, not worth the price for this small tube.</li>
            <li>Knowing that my skin is being protected without a heavy thick cream makes me feel confident and look natural.</li>
            <li>It leaves no white masky yuck behind so that is a huge bonus.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I love how it makes my skin feel.  It is never greasy and moisturizes well, and most importantly, it&#x27;s not too perfume-y.</li>
            <li> I used this all Summer long and loved it. It is not, however, heavy enough for me in Winter. In the heat it stays in place and is just enough to moisturize without getting greasy or gross. Smells good - typical sunscreen scent - but lighter than cheaper brands. It contains white tea and that is probably one of the reasons it is so expensive. Its a great ingredient that fights off wrinkly-ness and it is hard to find in skincare. Just for reference: I have normal/dry skin in the warm months and a desert-face during the cold ones. It leaves no white masky yuck behind so that is a huge bonus. I love it - just not right now. I am gonna find something else to use over the next few months and break this baby out next season.</li>
            <li> Received this as a sample and LOVE this lotion. So I bought a full size bottle right away. (On my second one!) It is one of the only moisturizers I have ever used that immediately absorbs in my skin so that I don&#x27;t have to wait 15 minutes before applying foundation. SO even if this didn&#x27;t have Sun Protection I think I would still buy it! But it IS!!! So that makes it the perfect daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this several times in beauty boxes.  It seems to work great on my body and I never get sunburned with this on.  I&#x27;m in my 40s and I never get breakouts but this sunscreen gives me zits every time I use it on my face.  It didn&#x27;t work any better than my $8 sunscreen.  I would only recommend using this on your face if you have very dry skin.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive for body sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Pur-Lisse Pur-Protect Essential Daily Moisturizer with SPF30 - I got this in my August 2014 Beauty Box 5 Box and after reading many subscription box blogs over the summer, it seems like it appeared in a bunch of other boxes. I really like that the formula is light, not heavy, but provides enough moisture for my skin. I also really like that it has SPF in it but it isn’t a ton of SPF so my face doesn’t look funny (with dark skin, you tend to look more purpley with SFP40+ type items; I have a Cetaphil lotion with SPF 55 and let me tell you, that thing makes me look very weird but I care more about not getting cancer than how my face looks). Always, apparently this stuff is pretty expensive, and despite liking the formula, I can not switch from my regular Cetaphil daily moisturizer to this just based on the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will order again, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in my Ipsy back and loved it. Feels light on the skin. Lightly scented. I was using Oil of Olay before this, I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
            <li> I got this item in my Ipsy bag and after using it for a couple weeks I knew that I needed to find a larger size. This fit the bill wonderfully. The product is nice and lightweight. It absorbs into my skin almost immediately and my skin feels nourished. I love that it is SPF 30 and my skin is protected from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays without my skin feeling greasy like it does with many other products that have SPF in it. It works to moisturize my skin while protecting it. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I did not see any major improvement in my skin that would make me buy it again. It&#x27;s ok but to me, not worth the price for this small tube.</li>
            <li> I love this moisterizer! I mix it with a small amount of foundation for perfect coverage. It isn&#x27;t drying like so many sun blocks can be.</li>
            <li> Best facial moisturizer with sunblock ever!  You don&#x27;t need anything else on your skin in the morning.  Wash, put this on, and you&#x27;re ready for make up.  It&#x27;s light but moisturizing.  No break outs, no heavy feeling.  Just amazing. And seems to even out my skin tone.  I&#x27;ve tried many different SPF moisturizers and keep returning to this one.</li>
            <li> I got this in a subscription box and threw it in a drawer with the rest of my sunscreens.  I was a little afraid to use it because of the number of synthetic chemical SPF ingredients it contained.  Here are the ingredients since they&#x27;re not on the product page (well, the list cuts off in the middle, anyway):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Avobenzone 2.00%, Homosalate 8.00%, Octinoxate 7.50%, Octisalate 5.00%, Oxybenzone 5.00%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein Octenylsuccinate, Alaria Esculenta Extract, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Nymphaea Coerulea Flower Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aminomethyl Propanol, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Geraniol, Limonene, Lemon Peel Oil, Orange Oil, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Lime Oil, Juniperus Mexicana Oil, Tagetes Minuta Flower Oil, Michelia Alba Flower Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten a bad (itchy, red) rash from sunscreens in the past and have tended to stick with mineral (i.e., zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) sunscreens as a result.  But, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with chemical sunscreens again in an attempt to figure out which ingredient was causing the problem.  I know octinoxate and octisalate are OK for me.  I was concerned about the oxybenzone.  I decided to use this and put off reviewing until I was almost done with the tube.  Figured that would take a few weeks (I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily on my arms) and then I&#x27;d know whether I was allergic to any of the ingredients or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions to this product.  I guess whatever caused my rash with the previous product I&#x27;d used was not one of the SPF-related ingredients.  I have no rash of any kind and no tan, though I&#x27;ve been outside a couple of times a day to walk my dog.  So this is definitely working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty thick lotion/cream, but it applies smoothly and absorbs into the skin fairly well.  Although it has a lot of citrus extracts as ingredients, the smell to me is more of a generic &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell than anything citrus-related; the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around for too long, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.

            <li> Nice, light moisturizer</li>
            <li> Slightly oily and smells a little sun screen lotion but it is really gentle and works well.</li>
            <li> Purlisse 30 SPF sunscreen and moisturizer is very light to the touch.Knowing that my skin is being protected without a heavy thick cream makes me feel confident and look natural.It stays on when swimming and you won&#x27;t have to reapply until you wash it off. Not once did I get sunburned when outdoors hiking, swimming or just hanging out under the sun. It&#x27;s worth the price, since one tube last for many months.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer, non-greasy, I love it.</li>
            <li> I actually found out abt this product on accident. It was a sample in a gift bag but I LOVE IT. And of course as soon as I realized I needed more I went straight to Amazon.  I can&#x27;t believe how well this works and it makes my skin feel wonderful.  The only thing I will say, if you have sensitive eyes, be careful not to get it on your eyelids.It burns my eyes so bad I have to wait an hour before applying make-up or inserting my contacts. Otherwise my eyes water so much my make-up has to be re-done. As far as how it works on your face, IT&#x27;S AWESOME!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for more than a year now. It&#x27;s the best daily moisturizer with SPF that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I see people refer to this item as a sunscreen.  In fact that is how I categorized it myself when I received this item in a beauty kit.  I now think of it as an awesome daily moisturizer.  My skin has looked fabulous since I started using this daily.  Do not be fooled that you can only use this for sun protection.  It is so great as a MOISTURIZER and a sunscreen.  Wait and see how great you skin looks after you use it every day.  The peptides really work to smooth your skin and add antiaging properties.  A really great product.</li>
            <li> love this item! definitely protects my skin!</li>
            <li> I meant to buy the moisturizer without SPF but found this to be so soft and makes my skin feel fantastic. It&#x27;s really light weight and I don&#x27;t feel greasy after using it. It also doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer absorbs really well and makes my skin really soft. Plus SPF30, it&#x27;s a great summer must-have.</li>
