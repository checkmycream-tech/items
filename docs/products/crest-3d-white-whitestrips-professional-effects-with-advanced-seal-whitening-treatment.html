            <li>My teeth are bright white and look awesome.  </li>
            <li>Now i see that is true all the tings that everyone says about Crest 3DWhite!!</li>
            <li>I found that I have great success with these but have to use a bit more than instructed.  </li>
            <li>These are just like the ones you buy in the store but with 25% more strips..</li>
            <li>sister and I love it</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>so my teeth gets most of the stain.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure about spending $50 on whitening strips because I&#x27;ve tried dentist trays before and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase......</li>
            <li>So now I will be going to the store and pay more.</li>
            <li>I need to cut the strips to better fit, too.  </li>
            <li>This time I have left them on for an hour each time, and after 7 days the results have been incredible.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The strips are easy to place, wear, and remove.  </li>
            <li>These are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Crest, on the phone, confirmed that their strongest formula does not exceed 11%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this formula because I was leery of the &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; of the strongest Crest whitestrip formula.  </li>
            <li>reading confirmed that peroxide does NOT harm enamel, and the &amp;#34;senstivity&amp;#34; it causes is temporary and harmless.  </li>
            <li>(By the way, these .edu sites confirmed that whitening toothpastes DO harm enamel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best part is everyone has noticed my white teeth and asked what did I use after only 3 sets.</li>
            <li>The new AdvancedSeal works better than ever.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good things about how much they whitened my teeth!</li>
            <li>These strips are definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>and I love the Crest 3D Dental Whitestrips Professional Effects</li>
            <li>They are worth it.....</li>
            <li>have tried it in the past and had great results.</li>
            <li>The strips do NOT extend to the back teeth, but I am nevertheless happy with the overall results.  </li>
            <li>25 Count very much..</li>
            <li>I am an avid tea drinker</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I use whitestrips.</li>
            <li>I used it the night I first got</li>
            <li>I have been blessed with white healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li>and she said basically all whitening products like this will cause it, and that it is a pretty unavoidable side effect.  </li>
            <li>I have not used them so I can&#x27;t report first hand.</li>
            <li>In any case, after a few uses, the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>really..</li>
            <li>The fact that they stay stuck to your teeth allows the whitening power to really take effect.  </li>
            <li>so these strip really does the trick on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They really work..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Crest, thanks.</li>
            <li>I works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different whitening systems and find this one the easiest to use and effective for me.  </li>
            <li>These sites warned that the active ingredient should not be more than 12% by volume.  </li>
            <li>First and second set of strips made my teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love these strips, and they make my teeth nice and white, despite the fact that I drink black coffee and red wine occasionally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been insecure about my teeth but after using these, my teeth and smile look better than ever!</li>
            <li>This is my third time using Crest 3D Whitestrips and it never fails to brightened my teeth.</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t notice the change after the first week but my DENTIST noticed that my teeth were whiter.  </li>
            <li>I stopped after 1 weeks because my teeth were becoming a little sensitive.</li>
            <li>The third set was very tolerable.</li>
            <li>professional cleaned before I began.  </li>
            <li>If you use them too much, they do cause some sensitivity, so if you want to use them more, I suggest you space the days between use out a little, perhaps once every few days till you get to your desired color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth, so I only use this product about once or twice a week, but I&#x27;m noticing results, even so.</li>
            <li>I have far less discomfort, nearly none really.  </li>
            <li>They were barely apparent, and barely affected my speech.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched several .edu sites and learned that the active ingredients in whiteners used by dentists are exactly used by all the Crest whitestrips: peroxide.  </li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the sensitivity issue, I would have a very white smile a few days sooner.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and less messy than trays.</li>
            <li>Apparently the same process that draws the stains out of your teeth to whiten them also pulls out the water molecules, essentially dehydrating your teeth.  </li>

            <li> I find that by staying extremely well hydrated in general</li>
            <li> I tried them about a year ago, as directed on box, with only mediocre success.  </li>
            <li> It is not the result that I expected.</li>

            <li> (Some dentists also use one other alternative ingredient or both together.)  </li>
            <li> This formula, and one other were Crest&#x27;s second-strongest.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other whitening strips, and they have come loose after a few minutes.  </li>

            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a slight change after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;Irritates the gums a little but goes away after some time.</li>

            <li> Effects were visible within a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> they are working on my husband, but I needed another box and now they are not available.</li>
            <li> They also have the least irritation.  </li>
            <li> box usually lasts me almost a year!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different whitening systems and find this one the easiest to use and effective for me.  I didn&#x27;t like the problems with trays and bleach.  My dentist recommended the Crest strips (4) and I&#x27;ve used them ever since.  If I notice a little yellowing I do a 30 minute strip and I&#x27;m good to go.  Easy to use and less messy than trays.</li>
            <li> One of the best whiteners in this price range.  Effects were visible within a few days of use.  There is no residue left on teeth.</li>
            <li> These are just like the ones you buy in the store but with 25% more strips.. self explanitory really.. everything works nice..</li>
            <li> These strips stay stuck to your teeth!!  They are wonderful!  I&#x27;ve used other whitening strips, and they have come loose after a few minutes.  These are fabulous.  The fact that they stay stuck to your teeth allows the whitening power to really take effect.  I love these strips, and they make my teeth nice and white, despite the fact that I drink black coffee and red wine occasionally.</li>
            <li> These work wonderful....cannot say enough good things about how much they whitened my teeth! To think they charge hundreds of dollars for the same result at the dentist&#x27;s office...highway robbery !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been insecure about my teeth but after using these, my teeth and smile look better than ever! These strips are definitely worth the price and I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity at all throughout my 20 day use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink coffee or tea so these strip really does the trick on my teeth.  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Now i see that is true all the tings that everyone says about Crest 3DWhite!! i dont need to see the doctor jajaja</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, so I only use this product about once or twice a week, but I&#x27;m noticing results, even so. And I&#x27;m only halfway through the box!</li>
            <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;And work well&lt;br /&gt;The color is also beautiful&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I love it&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> It is not the result that I expected. I used up all the upper strips to see the difference of my upper and lower teeth. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see any difference. It is not help to white my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  The reason for four rather than five stars is because it causes tooth-sensitivity. It lasts only a day or two, so I have to use this product every three days rather than every day. In any case, after a few uses, the results are amazing.  The new AdvancedSeal works better than ever. I need to cut the strips to better fit, too.  If it weren&#x27;t for the sensitivity issue, I would have a very white smile a few days sooner. All in all, this product does a great job whitening. And I&#x27;m smiling now!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and excellent product at a fair price!</li>
            <li> This is my third time using Crest 3D Whitestrips and it never fails to brightened my teeth. I am an avid tea drinker so my teeth gets most of the stain. And going to the dentist to get it whitened would cost hundreds of dollar. But with C3DWSPE, it gets the job done with great result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Siper whitening strips</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I use whitestrips. Those are very sensational today is my 9th day using it and I can see the result. This product is peefect and you dont waste to much time and money to get white teeth.</li>
            <li> My name is mow Sue Adams and I love the Crest 3D Dental Whitestrips Professional Effects 25 Count very much..They really work..My teeth look great. Thanks</li>
            <li> I used it the night I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a slight change after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;Irritates the gums a little but goes away after some time.</li>
            <li> I love these! These have the best result of anything I&#x27;ve tried,  including prescription strength whitening from the dentist.  They also have the least irritation.  I don&#x27;t have the patience to use anything longer than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it in the past and had great results.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with white healthy teeth.  Still, I drink coffee and tea so stains are inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every couple months I will use these for just one or two nights.  My teeth are bright white and look awesome.  If you use them too much, they do cause some sensitivity, so if you want to use them more, I suggest you space the days between use out a little, perhaps once every few days till you get to your desired color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One box usually lasts me almost a year!  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t notice the change after the first week but my DENTIST noticed that my teeth were whiter.  I stopped after 1 weeks because my teeth were becoming a little sensitive. Overall, I like it!</li>
            <li> I notice the change even though I&#x27;m not using it daily!! It&#x27;s a great product! I give it 4/5 cuz I think the price should be cheaper and affordable to everyone.</li>
            <li> I found that I have great success with these but have to use a bit more than instructed.  I tried them about a year ago, as directed on box, with only mediocre success.  This time I have left them on for an hour each time, and after 7 days the results have been incredible.  I fully expect dazzling results at the end of the 25 day ration in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about sensitivity- I asked my dentist about this and she said basically all whitening products like this will cause it, and that it is a pretty unavoidable side effect.  Apparently the same process that draws the stains out of your teeth to whiten them also pulls out the water molecules, essentially dehydrating your teeth.  This leaves the nerve endings with less insulation, and thus pain and sensitivity.  I find that by staying extremely well hydrated in general I have far less discomfort, nearly none really.  Also, all that hydration is healthy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Even my dentist told me that my teeth look great. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about spending $50 on whitening strips because I&#x27;ve tried dentist trays before and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted but I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase...... First and second set of strips made my teeth super sensitive. The third set was very tolerable. Best part is everyone has noticed my white teeth and asked what did I use after only 3 sets. Definitely recommend it. They are worth it.....</li>
            <li> they are working on my husband, but I needed another box and now they are not available. So now I will be going to the store and pay more. Oh well!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using these. It is alittle scary at first because they really stick but they work well!</li>
            <li> The whitestrips worked beyond my expectations.  My embarrassingly yellow teeth are now: ivory white.  The color of the whites of my eyes.  I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched several .edu sites and learned that the active ingredients in whiteners used by dentists are exactly used by all the Crest whitestrips: peroxide.  (Some dentists also use one other alternative ingredient or both together.)  These sites warned that the active ingredient should not be more than 12% by volume.  Crest, on the phone, confirmed that their strongest formula does not exceed 11%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this formula because I was leery of the &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; of the strongest Crest whitestrip formula.  &amp;#34;Sensitiviity&amp;#34; means pain.  This formula, and one other were Crest&#x27;s second-strongest.  They contain the superior adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reading confirmed that peroxide does NOT harm enamel, and the &amp;#34;senstivity&amp;#34; it causes is temporary and harmless.  (By the way, these .edu sites confirmed that whitening toothpastes DO harm enamel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed suggestions on Amazon and elsewhere.  I had my teeth professional cleaned before I began.  Then waited 2 weeks.  I followed the package directions scrupulously, EXCEPT - I kept the strips on for an hour (rather than 30 minutes).  As the strongest formulas required one hour -- I figured this was safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are easy to place, wear, and remove.  They were barely apparent, and barely affected my speech.  There was minimal &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; for me.  The strips do NOT extend to the back teeth, but I am nevertheless happy with the overall results.  (But Crest, yes, I would prefer to include my back teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say one can repeat the process twice a year.  I will.  My dentist would have charged $500.  Crest, thanks.</li>
            <li> I would recomment this item. I works very well</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them and says they are working great. I have not used them so I can&#x27;t report first hand.</li>
