            <li>While this is an excellent product almost $25 for shipping get real what a rip off.</li>
            <li>A much more honest product.</li>
            <li>They pyramid scheme set up of JP did not thrill me however and the price was still more than I wanted to pay.  </li>
            <li>I missed this fall&#x27;s bronchitis and feel better than EVER!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li>and I have more energy.</li>
            <li>V8 tastes much better and it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>sure it says it in the add.</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Both are used to provide more fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Speaking for myself I have more engery.</li>
            <li>which is problem better than most.</li>
            <li>Now I have more energy, much more alert, not falling asleep at all after evening meals.</li>
            <li>Juice Festive appears to be as good as Juice Plus and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The fruit capsules seem to do fine, but the vegetable capsules don&#x27;t sit well.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product very similar to Juice Plus but 1/3</li>
            <li>I cannot do many fresh veggies.  </li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t always consume a total day&#x27;s value of fruits &amp; veges, these greatly help provide just what my body needs.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product helped save my wife&#x27;s life when she had cancer</li>
            <li>definitely We&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years and have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this product is great, I&#x27;ve been taking it for a week and definitely feel more energetic and less worried about my college student diet habits.</li>
            <li>It is a 3RD of the price for one and it also has more to it including probiotics.</li>
            <li>It relieved my constipation the first day</li>
            <li>These babies keep me healthy and my digestive system regular.</li>
            <li>JuiceFestiv is fantastic as it keeps us healthy; few or no colds.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>This is comparable and the cost is much lower.  </li>
            <li>I have been taken the pills now for about 2 weeks, and most certainly never had any problems with an after-taste.   </li>
            <li>Granted JP has done more research than any other whole foods product</li>
            <li>It may not have the exact same ingredients as Juice Plus, but is definitely worth taking.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s truly a super food since I see NO documentation that shows ORAC value or \\&quot;equal to # servings.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Juice Festive.  </li>
            <li>I take these instead of vitamins and they are much cheaper than JuicePlus but with the same benefits.</li>
            <li>Juice Festive is definitely a winner and so much cheaper that Juice Plus with their pyramid selling.</li>
            <li>The price is much less and the product is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for giving me a chance to rate the Juice Festiv, I take the subject product because I eat a lot at fast food places and with taking the Juice and Veggie, I get my fruit and veggie.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young 65 and run an international charity</li>
            <li>You burp for the first 3 hrs(or less) after consuming.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My family has been taking this for over a year now and its been great. We give it to our kids at half a dose and we havent been as sick as everyone around us, have more mental clarity and energy. Plus its half the cost of juice plus!</li>
            <li> I bought the combo pack (FruitFestiv and VeggieFestiv) at Sam&#x27;s Club, and I&#x27;ve been using them for a week now. I take one tablet of each with breakfast and one of each with lunch, and I&#x27;ve never had an after taste, so I&#x27;d recommend taking with food. I don&#x27;t have any complaints, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s truly a super food since I see NO documentation that shows ORAC value or \\&quot;equal to # servings.\\&quot; Also, I&#x27;m disappointed that it&#x27;s only 70% organic. I will finish the product since it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any side effects, but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I took JP for years and sold it so that I could get a good price on it.  They pyramid scheme set up of JP did not thrill me however and the price was still more than I wanted to pay.  Granted JP has done more research than any other whole foods product but I was will to give this one a try.  It is a 3RD of the price for one and it also has more to it including probiotics. How do I know if it&#x27;s working as well as JP?  Well I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and all my life I would catch a cold in Sept that would turn into bronchitis.  Every Jan. I would catch another and a few times it would be the flu.  When I started taking JP I never was sick again or if I was it was very brief.  I also gained energy.  I have now been taking JFestive for about 7 months.  I missed this fall&#x27;s bronchitis and feel better than EVER!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - if you&#x27;re looking for a Juice Plus alternative like I was - this is for you and 1/3 of the price!!!!!!  WIN</li>
            <li> This is a great product very similar to Juice Plus but 1/3 the price. I had weight loss surgery and not longer have concerns about nitrition since starting this. It relieved my constipation the first day and I have more energy. I highly reccomend it! buying the 120+120 save $ too.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for two days and noticed that I burped often afterward.  I drank a lot of juice to mask the taste.  V8 tastes much better and it is cheaper. I would return it if I had my receipt.  The worse $20 I spent so far!</li>
            <li> JuiceFestiv is fantastic as it keeps us healthy; few or no colds.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing after fresh/frozen fruits and vegetable, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> I have been taken the pills now for about 2 weeks, and most certainly never had any problems with an after-taste.   It is a great product at a phantastic price. I just purchased the 2-months supply at Costco&#x27;s with a 4 dollar coupon. It may not have the exact same ingredients as Juice Plus, but is definitely worth taking.</li>
            <li> While this is an excellent product almost $25 for shipping get real what a rip off.</li>
            <li> I tried using these little guys to increase my consumption of fruits and vegetables.  Perhaps there&#x27;s a secret way to consume these, but the bottle just says \\&quot;Take two capsules, one time daily, with a meal\\&quot;.  The fruit capsules seem to do fine, but the vegetable capsules don&#x27;t sit well.  I&#x27;ve tried taking them before food and after food, but either way I burp some awful taste for hours.  They&#x27;ve concentrated a bushel of vegetables into a dried powder.  When the capsule releases the powder into my gut, the burping after-taste is just as concentrated - yuck.  I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Juice Festiv is loaded with antioxidants and is the same thing as Juice Plus - for much less money.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for giving me a chance to rate the Juice Festiv, I take the subject product because I eat a lot at fast food places and with taking the Juice and Veggie, I get my fruit and veggie.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the chewable ones for my son. He has a hard time swallowing the capsules.&lt;br /&gt;The picture threw me off. It did not show a bottle but what appeared to be a pouch. So if you want the chew ones&lt;br /&gt;make sure it says it in the add. Now I will take these horse sized caps and try to get something else for my son.&lt;br /&gt;There is no aftertaste that I can detect. They are just hard for us to swallow.</li>
            <li> The after taste is the only down fall! You burp for the first 3 hrs(or less) after consuming. Other than that this product is great, I&#x27;ve been taking it for a week and definitely feel more energetic and less worried about my college student diet habits.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery &amp; the product is as described. I have taken Juice Plus in the past &amp; this product is extremely comparable. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have taken actual Juice Plus for years but it is expensive. Juice plus is about $45 a month. Juice Festive appears to be as good as Juice Plus and is much cheaper. Highly recommend Juice Festive.  The cost is about $11.00 for one month. Both are used to provide more fruits and vegetables. Speaking for myself I have more engery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking theses for about a month. They great I haven&#x27;t had any after taste I take in the morning and at night with a meal. I am a full time student and I work 30 hours a week so a good on the go vitamin! It gives me energy n it goods for my digestive system!  I&#x27;ve been a vegerterian for about 4 months now n needed something to make sure I&#x27;m getting everything I need! My only set back is it&#x27;s only 70% organic -_-  which is problem better than most. Im going to look for something 100% organic if can&#x27;t find anything or if it&#x27;s way to expense I&#x27;m going bad to theses bad boys!! I purchased mine at SAMs for $20 and their suppose to last 2 months but with me decreasing the amount by one pill each bottle a day I think I can stretch it out for another month! Defiantly recommended to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have taken Juice Plus for years, but it just got to be too expensive.  This is comparable and the cost is much lower.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from Juice Plus. The price is much less and the product is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> definitely We&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years and have been very satisfied.  We still get a few colds, but they are not as bad as they used to be.</li>
            <li> My system is in dire need of probiotics. I cannot do many fresh veggies.  This way I get my probiotics, and the nutrients I need from the veggies.</li>
            <li> Alternative to Juice Plus for me!  Affordable &amp; keeps my family healthy! Repeat customer. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I take these instead of vitamins and they are much cheaper than JuicePlus but with the same benefits.</li>
            <li> Been taking this five months now. I&#x27;m a young 65 and run an international charity so I travel a lot, especially in very poor parts of the world  with a hit and miss diet. Now I have more energy, much more alert, not falling asleep at all after evening meals. I used to pick up colds and bugs after almost every trip but I&#x27;ve only had one cold since I began taking this - and it only lasted three days. Juice Festive is definitely a winner and so much cheaper that Juice Plus with their pyramid selling. A much more honest product. Well done Natrol.</li>
            <li> I found these after being given a sample by a relative.  As I don&#x27;t always consume a total day&#x27;s value of fruits &amp; veges, these greatly help provide just what my body needs.  I&#x27;ll keep purchasing them.  Steve, in South Florida.</li>
            <li> I have picky taste buds so I don&#x27;t eat enough vegetables.  These babies keep me healthy and my digestive system regular. I definitely notice improvements in energy with these.</li>
            <li> Felt like I was misinformed by the people selling this product - there is only a two month supply, not a four month as stated in the write up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product helped save my wife&#x27;s life when she had cancer</li>
            <li> I have been taking Juice Festiv for 5 or 6 years, so long I can&#x27;t remember. Used to take Juice Plus before that. In all that time I&#x27;ve only had 3 minor colds. Juce Plus was really expensive back then, don&#x27;t know about now. I take 2 of the same, just before or after a meal and the other one, two before or after another meal, no after taste or gas.</li>
            <li> Every body should try these, they are great. My Doc recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should take these. I have been taking vitams for 70 years and these beat them all.</li>
            <li> We received the vitamins and could not be happier with our purchase.</li>
