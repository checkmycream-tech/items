            <li>It&#x27;s awesome. :)</li>
            <li>Good  hair setting spray with a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>oh why did they have to change a good thing?</li>
            <li>Aside from being a superior thermal setting spray, it keeps hair neatly groomed.</li>
            <li>Hope you love it too!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for ultra fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice just like all the Biolage products, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>So I dont know how I would have really liked it.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled to have found a source.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to comb and has body it didn&#x27;t have before !  </li>
            <li>I use this on my straight hair and it holds the curl when using a blow dryer or a curling iron beautifully.</li>
            <li>a good spray holds ok, scent might be less and will be the perfect one, doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair, but can be improve on the scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works even better with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Somehow, magically, this product makes the curls stay in.  </li>
            <li>I used it two times and then it slipped out of my hand and fell on the floor and broke the top.  </li>
            <li>use it more as a hairspray.</li>
            <li>There were many brands on Amazon to choose from and I chose this one purly</li>
            <li>I love to use it when I curl my hair because it locks up the curls</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I asked my hair dressser to recommend a product that would provide good results when using hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product - it smells good and gives my ultra fine hair some hold and texture.  </li>
            <li>Best spray I&#x27;ve found for setting hot rollers or flat irons.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to give me the Big Hair without teasing!  </li>
            <li>It feels almost like a light hair spray.</li>
            <li>They used to be available.  </li>
            <li>also find that this products helps curls stay in much longer if I spritz a strand with it before using a hot roller, so it works for it&#x27;s intended use as well of course, but I love it most for the side-effect of voluminous hair!</li>
            <li>This is the only product I’ve tried for curls, so there might be something better out there, but I’m pretty happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Great before the flat iron to staighted my curly hair and keep it that way.</li>
            <li>I have soft, fine hair that falls flat....unless I use this product!!  </li>
            <li>and it has not disappointed me.  </li>
            <li>cuz I was familiar with the brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find that perfect amount of hold in a setting spray or lotion.</li>
            <li>My fine hair curls easily but the curls fall out as fast as they go in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and some are only good for straightening or blow drying.</li>
            <li>I generally divide my hair into four sections and spray each section thoroughly, then secure each section into a bun on the top of my head before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I use to this pre-spray my hair before hot rollers and it keeps the curls in all day and protects my hair!</li>
            <li>I used this formula for years and it really worked well with my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but they most certainly didn&#x27;t take into consideration that it&#x27;s mainly women who use this product</li>
            <li>B0018MIJES Matrix Biolage Thermal-Active Setting Spray, 8 Ounce]]I hot roll my hair</li>
            <li>I use it daily and and just love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with believing that I received a fraudulent product through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Switched over to this from Redken Hot Sets.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, very fine hair</li>
            <li>Before I got the spray, curls would turn into waves within 30 minutes and be pretty much gone within an hour.  </li>
            <li>I used this before using hot rollers on my hair and it really held it well all day, without hairspray.  </li>
            <li>The problem is, doing all that makes my hair super soft and shiny and it won’t hold a curl for anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like a lot of stuff in my hair.</li>
            <li>This spray really worked well for me to set my hair in curls that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for something that would protect my hair but still allow me to curl it.</li>
            <li>I tried this one, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li>Really helps hold the style too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but it is so straight and without body I needed this product</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon Prime for another FAST delievery.</li>
            <li>The real giveaway was the smell.</li>
            <li>For that task it didn&#x27;t work very well, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I have fine, long hair that doesn&#x27;t stay well when curled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>My normally stick straight, can&#x27;t hold a curl hair stayed curly until I showered that night.  </li>
            <li>This brings pretty amazing results, with curls that have only lost about half of their curliness by the end of the day when I am doing it all over again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much less sticky and holds my curl better.</li>
            <li>If I decide to tease my hair a little, this just makes the tease hold so much better</li>
            <li>I normally love the smell of Biolage shampoo and conditioners, although I had no previous experience with thermal active setting spray.</li>
            <li>It does not make your hair heavy or necessitate washing more often.  </li>
            <li>I have used this with hot rollers and can only say, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have very long thin fine hair that has never in my life been able to hold a curl longer than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have found over the years that the only way to make it look nice is to blow dry it from a wet state with anti-frizz products.  </li>
            <li>Not stiff, not sticky, up to the job-</li>
            <li>, I’m surprised at how well</li>
            <li>that ticks all the boxes as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>I spray it on each strand of hair right before I curl it and the curl will last into the next day!</li>
            <li>would say this product is great if you don&#x27;t like hairspray and just want to hold your straight style, but at least for my hair, it&#x27;s not ideal for the vintage look, which requires so much curling and brushing out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives volume, and control like no other!</li>
            <li>I just washed it off and it was fine, but not a very good start....</li>
            <li>No other product has provided this holding strength.</li>
            <li>Half of my hairs are super thick and the other half are super fine.  </li>
            <li>It could be that its just not the right formula for my hair but hair always curls after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Too much and your curls are crunchy, and you can&#x27;t brush them out without a major mess.</li>
            <li>I tried using it several times with wet hair, dry hair, damp hair, day old hair, new hair...and every time I had the same result - Sticky sticky hair.</li>

            <li> I use this daily with my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product with a flat iron and regular curling iron for curls..</li>
            <li> I know some people have complained about the stickiness of the product, but I find that since I use the anti-frizz products first I don’t’ experience the tackiness others have</li>
            <li> Just be aware that there are dishonest sellers out there.</li>
            <li> but for some reason this leaves my hair very dry and coarse after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> And my hair feels normal - not stiff or sticky or any other negative way I can think of.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel dirty and almost more</li>
            <li> This is \\&quot;not\\&quot; a long process.  </li>
            <li> Holds my curls all day long.  </li>
            <li> With this product and teasing, I go from flat hair, to full-bodied, glamorous hair.  </li>
            <li> I spritz this on my dry hair at the roots.  </li>
            <li> I then use my fingers to rub it around into my roots, and then I blow dry my hair while lifting my hair up at the roots with a brush.  </li>
            <li> After my hair is dry, I have body and texture.  </li>
            <li> and it is very expensive, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I spray my hair wet after combing into place and Matrix Biolage does the trick every time.</li>
            <li> (its the only product that can actually do that because I have such thin</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts probably 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried other Biolage products and always did well</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and if I can get past the smell, it does seem to help my hair hold curl.</li>
            <li> I also used this product with my new Conair Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> have thick, dark long hair and often blow dry, straighten or curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed to do the job so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I felt this weighed it down.</li>
            <li> This product, which I&#x27;ve used for years, seems to have been watered down some.</li>
            <li> , when I received the product, the bottle was sticky with black residue all over it.</li>
            <li> Too little and your hair falls flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hair).&lt;br /&gt;It also works wonders to keep your hair in place and makes it look thicker when blowed dried.</li>
            <li> It’s very thick, and if I don’t’ blow dry it, it just looks like a ratted, frizzy, half-wavy mess.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to keep any style in it as I do not like to use hairspray or any product that makes it stiff.  </li>
            <li> Impossible, especially with wet hands!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in salons</li>
            <li> This product worked very well on keeping the style I wanted, without the stiffness I hate.</li>
            <li> The bottle is ridiculously sized.</li>
            <li> I have a ridiculous hair type.  </li>
            <li> Also , spray does not seem to leave a yucky build up behind</li>

            <li> When I received the product the bottle was dirty and dusty with part of a sticker that had not been fully removed.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY - FAKE!</li>
            <li> It was scary!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why or how Amazon would allow toxic fake products to harm their reputation!</li>
            <li> but sadly it&#x27;s impossible to use.</li>
            <li> and I hate to plaster it up with sticky hairspray.</li>
            <li> The product I received had a very unpleasant odor of vinegar.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> a good spray holds ok, scent might be less and will be the perfect one, doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair, but can be improve on the scent</li>
            <li> Protects hair from heat of electric rollers while improving staying power of the curls.  Matrix is a great brand and this is a great product with excellent results!</li>
            <li> I asked my hair dressser to recommend a product that would provide good results when using hot rollers.  This is a great product to give me the Big Hair without teasing!  A couple of spritz and I am good to go!  A must have.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other Biolage products and always did well but for some reason this leaves my hair very dry and coarse after flat ironing it. It feels almost like a light hair spray. It could be that its just not the right formula for my hair but hair always curls after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have soft, fine hair that falls flat....unless I use this product!!  I spritz this on my dry hair at the roots.  I then use my fingers to rub it around into my roots, and then I blow dry my hair while lifting my hair up at the roots with a brush.  This is \\&quot;not\\&quot; a long process.  After my hair is dry, I have body and texture.  If I decide to tease my hair a little, this just makes the tease hold so much better (I spritz hairspray where I tease as well).  With this product and teasing, I go from flat hair, to full-bodied, glamorous hair.  It&#x27;s awesome. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that this products helps curls stay in much longer if I spritz a strand with it before using a hot roller, so it works for it&#x27;s intended use as well of course, but I love it most for the side-effect of voluminous hair!</li>
            <li> Good  hair setting spray with a very nice fragrance. Increases texture and gives a great hold for any hair style.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product helps me hold the style and curl in my hair without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> It smells nice just like all the Biolage products, but it&#x27;s not for me. I don&#x27;t really like a lot of stuff in my hair. I felt this weighed it down. For someone who is used to using products in their hair, I think it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I use this daily with my flat iron.  I also used this product with my new Conair Curl Secret.  My normally stick straight, can&#x27;t hold a curl hair stayed curly until I showered that night.  Does what it says it will do and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this!!!! I use to this pre-spray my hair before hot rollers and it keeps the curls in all day and protects my hair!</li>
            <li> I buy and use this all the time.  I cannot style my hair without it and have been using it for years.  It gives my hair some body/</li>
            <li> Gives my hair body.  It&#x27;s easy to comb and has body it didn&#x27;t have before !  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wish I could comment on the product itself but sadly it&#x27;s impossible to use. I don&#x27;t know who designed/chose or whatever, the bottle but they most certainly didn&#x27;t take into consideration that it&#x27;s mainly women who use this product and we don&#x27;t have man sized hands. I am a medium sized female and I cannot get my hand around this bottle and simultaneously work the pump with my index finger. Impossible, especially with wet hands! The bottle is ridiculously sized. I&#x27;m so disapointed!!</li>
            <li> I have a ridiculous hair type.  It’s very thick, and if I don’t’ blow dry it, it just looks like a ratted, frizzy, half-wavy mess.  I was told by a stylist once that I have combination hair.  Half of my hairs are super thick and the other half are super fine.  I have found over the years that the only way to make it look nice is to blow dry it from a wet state with anti-frizz products.  The problem is, doing all that makes my hair super soft and shiny and it won’t hold a curl for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter miracle solution- Matrix Biolage Thermal-Activate Setting Spray.  This is the only product I’ve tried for curls, so there might be something better out there, but I’m pretty happy with the results.  I generally divide my hair into four sections and spray each section thoroughly, then secure each section into a bun on the top of my head before I go to bed.  I then blast the buns with the hair dryer once at night and again in the morning 10 minutes before I remove them.  This brings pretty amazing results, with curls that have only lost about half of their curliness by the end of the day when I am doing it all over again.  Before I got the spray, curls would turn into waves within 30 minutes and be pretty much gone within an hour.  This stuff lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works even better with a curling iron.  I sprayed it on my bangs once before using the curling iron.  Not only did my curl last all day while I was at Disneyland, but I brushed my hair and I put it in a ponytail that night and when I pulled the ponytail out the next morning the curl was still noticeably there!  I know some people have complained about the stickiness of the product, but I find that since I use the anti-frizz products first I don’t’ experience the tackiness others have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I’m surprised at how well this is lasting.  With the amount I spray on my hair I was expecting the bottle to be halfway gone by now but this stuff lasts!</li>
            <li> I have used this with hot rollers and can only say, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;.  My fine hair curls easily but the curls fall out as fast as they go in.  Somehow, magically, this product makes the curls stay in.  All day!  And my hair feels normal - not stiff or sticky or any other negative way I can think of.  I hesitated to buy it as I am not a hair product girl and it is very expensive, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It would be a bargain at twice the price.  Very little is needed to do the job so the bottle lasts a long time.  Hope you love it too!</li>
            <li> This spray really worked well for me to set my hair in curls that lasted all day. I have fine, long hair that doesn&#x27;t stay well when curled. I have used this product with a flat iron and regular curling iron for curls.. both worked well.</li>
            <li> This product and my hair do not mix at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, dark long hair and often blow dry, straighten or curl my hair. I purchased this product based on the reviews and was very disappointed. I tried using it several times with wet hair, dry hair, damp hair, day old hair, new hair...and every time I had the same result - Sticky sticky hair. When I tried using a heat product afterward, it would just get suck in the section of hair where I sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and some are only good for straightening or blow drying. I was really looking for something that would protect my hair but still allow me to curl it. I just can&#x27;t use this product anymore. It makes my hair feel dirty and almost more damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I received the product, the bottle was sticky with black residue all over it. I just washed it off and it was fine, but not a very good start....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of products ranging in price and I think the one that works best with my hair is Tresemme. The only downside to that is the spray part which always breaks on me.</li>
            <li> I use this on my straight hair and it holds the curl when using a blow dryer or a curling iron beautifully. It&#x27;s hard to find in salons so I order it whenever I start getting low. I&#x27;ll use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> my hairstylist made me the greatest hairspray ever with beautiful curls that lasted for almost 3 days&lt;br /&gt;setting spray was her secret,&lt;br /&gt;so I tried this one, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li> Best spray I&#x27;ve found for setting hot rollers or flat irons. Protects my hair without making it gummy, leaving any residue or stickiness. Really helps hold the style too.</li>
            <li> I used this formula for years and it really worked well with my fine hair.  They recently changed the formula and I don&#x27;t like it.  Why oh why did they have to change a good thing?</li>
            <li> I used it two times and then it slipped out of my hand and fell on the floor and broke the top.  I can no longer use it So I dont know how I would have really liked it.</li>
            <li> I always have a back-up of this stuff--it is awesome! I spray it on my hair damp. It ads volume and is my best friend when I curl my hair--helps keep a curl from falling!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the tits! I have very short hair and I hate to plaster it up with sticky hairspray. Aside from being a superior thermal setting spray, it keeps hair neatly groomed. Not stiff, not sticky, up to the job- that ticks all the boxes as far as I am concerned. I spray my hair wet after combing into place and Matrix Biolage does the trick every time. Wean yourself off the Vavoom or Sebastian and do your bank account a favor, too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for ultra fine hair.  It gives volume, and control like no other!</li>
            <li> I used this before using hot rollers on my hair and it really held it well all day, without hairspray.  I have long, straight, very fine hair and it is hard to keep any style in it as I do not like to use hairspray or any product that makes it stiff.  This product worked very well on keeping the style I wanted, without the stiffness I hate.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me about 4 years ago, and I have used nothing since.  It does not make your hair heavy or necessitate washing more often.  A little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts probably 6 months.  I would recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find that perfect amount of hold in a setting spray or lotion. Too much and your curls are crunchy, and you can&#x27;t brush them out without a major mess. Too little and your hair falls flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this product is great if you don&#x27;t like hairspray and just want to hold your straight style, but at least for my hair, it&#x27;s not ideal for the vintage look, which requires so much curling and brushing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it more as a hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this type of product even in the mall \\&quot;hair care\\&quot; product stores. They used to be available.  [[ASIN:B0018MIJES Matrix Biolage Thermal-Active Setting Spray, 8 Ounce]]I hot roll my hair daily but it is so straight and without body I needed this product and it has not disappointed me.  I am so thrilled to have found a source.  There were many brands on Amazon to choose from and I chose this one purly cuz I was familiar with the brand.  I use it daily and and just love it.  Thank you Amazon Prime for another FAST delievery.</li>
            <li> When I received the product the bottle was dirty and dusty with part of a sticker that had not been fully removed. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that as I thought it was just overstock that was sold at a discount. The real giveaway was the smell. I normally love the smell of Biolage shampoo and conditioners, although I had no previous experience with thermal active setting spray. The product I received had a very unpleasant odor of vinegar. I have used it several times and if I can get past the smell, it does seem to help my hair hold curl. This is my first experience with believing that I received a fraudulent product through Amazon. Just be aware that there are dishonest sellers out there.</li>
            <li> Great before the flat iron to staighted my curly hair and keep it that way. One bottle lasts forever too!</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it smells good and gives my ultra fine hair some hold and texture.  However, this was sold to me as a curl setting spray to help hold curl with a curling iron.  For that task it didn&#x27;t work very well, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> LOVE this spray!! Switched over to this from Redken Hot Sets. It&#x27;s much less sticky and holds my curl better. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This product, which I&#x27;ve used for years, seems to have been watered down some. It&#x27;s not holding as well as it used to. Are there any alternatives?</li>
            <li> Great product. I love to use it when I curl my hair because it locks up the curls (its the only product that can actually do that because I have such thin hair).&lt;br /&gt;It also works wonders to keep your hair in place and makes it look thicker when blowed dried.</li>
            <li> I have very long thin fine hair that has never in my life been able to hold a curl longer than 10 minutes. Using this product has made my hair curl perfectly!!!! I spray it on each strand of hair right before I curl it and the curl will last into the next day! I love this stuff and I will never curl my hair again without it.</li>
            <li> Great holding spray. Have very difficult to hold hair, chemically straightening with Brazilian blow out and thick. No other product has provided this holding strength. Holds my curls all day long.  Also , spray does not seem to leave a yucky build up behind</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY - FAKE! My hair fell out by handfuls! If I could give this zero stars I would! It was scary! I don&#x27;t understand why or how Amazon would allow toxic fake products to harm their reputation! I no longer trust amazon to buy name brand salon beauty products.</li>
