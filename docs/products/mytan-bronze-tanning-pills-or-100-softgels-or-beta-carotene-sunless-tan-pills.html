            <li>I have light to medium skin</li>
            <li>Thanks MyTan!!!</li>
            <li>I just bought more today for my holiday in two weeks - I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I initially get reddish tan because of my fair skin but the color quickly changes to a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>120 pills come in a bottle &amp; they aren&#x27;t big horse pills, they are a fair size.</li>
            <li>and she tanned super fast &amp; was able to keep the color.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin being of Irish descent with a red headed grandmother</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>As an Irish person living in USA, I have fair skin that tends to burn easily when in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks using MyTan Bronze tanning pills, I&#x27;ve noticed not only has my skin colour darkened, but I haven&#x27;t burned at all when in the sun, where as I would have done before.  </li>
            <li>Yet, I had a very natural light tan.  </li>
            <li>I like these pills very much.</li>
            <li>they can very fast and dhope they do what they say they do..</li>
            <li>The products work exactly like they said they would.</li>
            <li>I have had several people comment on my tan and I am inside most of the time b/c</li>
            <li>The Bronze pills provide a healthy, almost ruddy glow to the skin but leaves no &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; look, so there&#x27;s no obvious store-bought tan.  </li>
            <li>You take 4-5 pills per day for the first 2 weeks or so and switch to 2 per day.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li>It did not produce the characteristic orange color as with many chemical tans and there was no excessive build-up.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks I began to get a slight rosy color that turned more brown.</li>
            <li>start with more pills and take less to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .Need</li>
            <li>I love my tan bronze, and recommend to anyone that wants a tan with out the sun or with very little sun.</li>
            <li>exactly and only spend 20-25 minutes in the sun each time.</li>
            <li>Feeling a little more confident when I break out my now not so pale legs for short season.  </li>
            <li>Requesting full redund or package of other self tanner to replace</li>
            <li>But after trying this product I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>you are need for a prom or wedding start early for maximum results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am also a larger than average person, and although I didn&#x27;t get dark, I did manage to not look fluorescent white anymore, and that was good.</li>

            <li> and it does help little without sun ..</li>
            <li> but if you want to put a little color to your skin, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering for few months the bronze tanning I wish it could make u little darker im olive complexion</li>

            <li> I have read for a long time where you can produce an artificial tan using Carotenoid extracts and had a few friends try it but have never tried it personally.</li>
            <li> but you will obtain enough color so as not to blind people when you wear shorts.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping a tan because of medications.</li>
            <li> I did start using tanning beds in the winter, but because of my tan bronze I use sun beds very little, and my tan has lasted for months!</li>
            <li> change is subtle so as you get bronzer you may not notice as much.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I possibly could have achieved a darker tone by upping the dose, but that&#x27;s usually a bad idea</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t peeled at all like I usually do!!</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and getting a tan and keeping one was very difficult.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I have to admit that I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any side effects that are bad.</li>
            <li> Give this pills 2 weeks and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Take them as directed or be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate the summer heat in AL.</li>

            <li> Item delivered on time. Was as expected. I have a hard time keeping a tan because of medications. These pills help me to stay tanned. Will definitely order again. Excellent rating.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering for few months the bronze tanning I wish it could make u little darker im olive complexion and it does help little without sun ..hope you guys can improve on the product more so we can get darker .</li>
            <li> Great product, really happy with the results, I could see it start working after about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ll definitely continue taking it. Very happy with the shade of brown too.</li>
            <li> After using for a couple of weeks I started noticing a darkening of my skin, just a nice glow. Feeling a little more confident when I break out my now not so pale legs for short season.  I havent noticed any side effects that are bad. I havent been out in sun yet to see what/if any changes occur.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product ... Even more than shoes! Tho with my shoes on and glowing skin the shoes look even better... Can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pasty pale by nature and had a family event to attend where a lot of cameras would be present, and I decided I didn&#x27;t want to look like Casper the Ghost in all the shots, so I bought these.

I possibly could have achieved a darker tone by upping the dose, but that&#x27;s usually a bad idea no matter what kind of pills you&#x27;re taking. Will be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> Makes ur skin beautiful.</li>
            <li> work amazingly.Highly recommend .Need to follow instructions to get the best results.results. Raja S</li>
            <li> These tanning pills are making my 20 year old daughter super happy! The results she has gotten from them are amazing! She has been taking for about 3 weeks and she only went to the beach one time and she tanned super fast &amp; was able to keep the color. She never tans nor keeps any color. She is fair skinned, so she is extremely pleased with this product. 120 pills come in a bottle &amp; they aren&#x27;t big horse pills, they are a fair size. Very easy to swallow with just a glass of water. I received a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Give this pills 2 weeks and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I have had several people comment on my tan and I am inside most of the time b/c I hate the summer heat in AL.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> The Bronze pills provide a healthy, almost ruddy glow to the skin but leaves no &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; look, so there&#x27;s no obvious store-bought tan.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years and have had no adverse side effects whatsoever.  I like it best when I combine the tanning pills with a little sun (even lathering-on sunscreen) because the combination leaves an even healthier look.</li>
            <li> Love the glow the MyTan Bronze gives my fair skin. Have been a repeat customer and will definitely continue ordering!! Also a big fan of the MyTan Boost! I only have to spend a short time in the sun (I prefer sun over tanning beds) and I get a beautiful even golden tan like I&#x27;ve never had before. I initially get reddish tan because of my fair skin but the color quickly changes to a nice golden tan. I follow the directions exactly and only spend 20-25 minutes in the sun each time. I haven&#x27;t peeled at all like I usually do!! I moisturize with organic extra virgin coconut oil after I shower and it&#x27;s been great!! I&#x27;m placing another order of both. Thanks MyTan!!!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I have to admit that I was very skeptical. I have read for a long time where you can produce an artificial tan using Carotenoid extracts and had a few friends try it but have never tried it personally. But after trying this product I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. You take 4-5 pills per day for the first 2 weeks or so and switch to 2 per day. Within a couple of weeks I began to get a slight rosy color that turned more brown. I have light to medium skin so it was fairly obvious to me. It did not produce the characteristic orange color as with many chemical tans and there was no excessive build-up. I have used this now for about 2 months without any noticeable side effects. I wouldn’t expect to look like the guy on the bottle but if you want to put a little color to your skin, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look tan,but I didn&#x27;t look pale anymore.</li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks to start seeing the results and now my tan after one month is totally amazing! People keep asing me if have I already been away.  I just bought more today for my holiday in two weeks - I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I like these pills very much. Several others I have ordered in the past have not worked, but these do.  Lynda</li>
            <li> These tanning pills are a great way to bronze up.&lt;br /&gt;They are safer then laying in the sun and a lot safer then a tanning bed!&lt;br /&gt;They do take awhile to work, 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The change is subtle so as you get bronzer you may not notice as much.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who is already olive in skin tone, I turned rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;You start with more pills and take less to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;If you are need for a prom or wedding start early for maximum results!&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive these at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I got two bottles of  120 pills each and they do not work</li>
            <li> Snake oil!  Did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li> As an Irish person living in USA, I have fair skin that tends to burn easily when in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks using MyTan Bronze tanning pills, I&#x27;ve noticed not only has my skin colour darkened, but I haven&#x27;t burned at all when in the sun, where as I would have done before.  I&#x27;ll be reordering!</li>
            <li> I already have noticed a darkening!</li>
            <li> I love these tanning vitamins. They give me a great glow to my skin that I don&#x27;t get with sun alone. It takes a couole weeks to notice but i definitely notice after 1 month. My hubby likes it too. I am re-ordering today!</li>
            <li> Took these through the summer this year and I&#x27;ve been so happy. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Did mot work at all.  Requesting full redund or package of other self tanner to replace</li>
            <li> So I just got mine and just started taking them yesterday so I don&#x27;t have any news to report..... they can very fast and dhope they do what they say they do..</li>
            <li> I thought these pills will work the way they advertised. The pills didn&#x27;t do anything nor help me. They didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep a fresh looking tan</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  People noticed within a couple weeks.  I have very fair skin being of Irish descent with a red headed grandmother and I do not tan.  I do not sunbathe.  Yet, I had a very natural light tan.  I have reordered.</li>
            <li> Works as promised.  Great new cast to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with my tan bronze tanning pills.when I go in the sun I tan I don&#x27;t get red.i tell people they need to try it . I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> These work. You won&#x27;t be bronze if your are fair skinned to begin with but you will obtain enough color so as not to blind people when you wear shorts. Take them as directed or be disappointed.</li>
