            <li>I would recommend washing your own hair in between salon visits to get the best use of the serum.</li>
            <li>showed up on time and looked great.</li>
            <li>The bottle leaks every time I fly.  </li>
            <li>but I LOVE the smell of it!!</li>
            <li>This is the most money I&#x27;ve ever used on a hair product, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells amazing</li>
            <li>But I honestly saw one at Ulta for about $5-6 dollars if you want to save money.</li>
            <li>I even use this serum before I curl it..and honestly, it reminds me of Kardashian hair.</li>
            <li>works so good love it</li>
            <li>I purchased the add-on to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!!</li>
            <li>I am truly thankful for this wonderful serum and highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>By far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>If you use it for travel, be sure to put it in it&#x27;s own ziploc bag, and maybe two bags.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, LOVE this serum!</li>
            <li>Hair is very smooth &amp; shinny, not greasy....</li>
            <li>Hair dressers highly recommend this and ever since I started using this I&#x27;ve loved it!</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing which is always a huge plus.</li>
            <li>is that I did have to use more than recommend</li>
            <li>and I have been satisfied with it since.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love how shiny it makes my hair look</li>
            <li>Afterwards I like to brush/comb it through just to make sure it distributes evenly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and my hair is more manageable and just looks smoother.  </li>
            <li>so was glad to find it online.</li>
            <li>Im in love.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love the way the serum eliminates frizz and keeps my straightened fly-aways in place.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried it again.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>really smooths split ends and is a great thermo-protector.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But it does make it feel smoother and hair smell better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair responds great to it, but if you aren&#x27;t used to it, you can use too much and your hair may become too oily.  </li>
            <li>It is super effective.</li>
            <li>So I searched the web to find a good product that would keep my hair sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>Works very well, very light bodied an excellent product overall.</li>
            <li>I am very much a hair kind of girl.</li>
            <li>my hair is fine</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, especially if I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>The product came open wasnt happy about that</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>But with this serum, it feels light and controlled.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair sleek and smooth but never greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is like heaven in a bottle for a woman in the South trying to keep their hair looking beautiful all day long.</li>
            <li>I like my hair maintenance-free, so I very rarely use any product besides shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, super light and works amazing on my incredibly thick, frizzy unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>The seller quoted an original price as $20 which they were selling @ a discounted price.</li>
            <li>After using cheaper stuff from the grocery store for a while, I was excited when I saw it on here again.</li>
            <li>I have used the super skinny serum for a few years and it is one of the best products for when I straighten my super curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I thought I had found a good deal for my wife because the larger bottles are 8.5 oz.  </li>
            <li>The last time I got my hair cut, they put this in, and it smelled so good that I impulsively ordered some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the only reason i purchased this product was so that my boyfriend could notice a lovely new fragrance in my hair (which he has, and loved it).</li>
            <li>I have been using Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>My mom introduced me to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny serum.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why so many hair products have such overwhelming fragrances.</li>
            <li>Great quality - hair feels silky smooth, soft, looks shiny and definitely does not look or even feel greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- Will definitely buy more soon!</li>
            <li>this is a great product if you shower everyday because it keeps frizzy hair and flyaways noticably calm and under control.</li>
            <li>It comes out smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Left my hair kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it kind of feels gross.</li>
            <li>Either way it is styled, any sign of water in the air, rain or humidity, it frizzes and ends up in a pony tail pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Perhaps not the right product for me.</li>
            <li>You know how they all have long wavy hair but its super shiny and healthy?</li>
            <li>but if you really really need it and don&#x27;t have time to stop at a store get it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product I have ever used that has worked.</li>
            <li>When I release the braids my hair has soft smooth waves.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy!</li>
            <li>I used after treating my hair with  Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Smooth Shine</li>
            <li>I first got this from a beauty operator as a sample</li>
            <li>I really do love this product, I use it daily!  </li>
            <li>Also makes my hair feel super soft!!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>People I don&#x27;t know will come ask me what I use on it to make it so shiny and pretty (which is obviously very flattering)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good to use it for ironing hair.</li>
            <li>A little will do ya, for sure!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and soft and easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li>Just use 3 pumps on it and it looks brand new!!</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I used this immediately after washing my hair, straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have a whole basketfull of these failures that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your hair shiny and straight just as your stylist did it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Havent used it too much yet, but i do like when my hair stylist use it when she rolls my hair.</li>
            <li>It really does what I need it to do for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty normal.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use too much of it, and you&#x27;re hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help my hair much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>no matter how many other products I use in addition.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t blow-dried yet, as I only do that for special occasions, but can&#x27;t wait to try that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most serums seem like they are just a little much.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of the Super Skinny by Paul Mitchell, sometimes you don&#x27;t always have the money for the big bottle and</li>
            <li>but the pricing is still high, but that&#x27;s Paul Mitchell as I understand.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my hair dry much faster, makes it incredibly soft and smooth, in shines.</li>
            <li>Without my super skinny serum, it&#x27;s still long and wavy, but it lacks the shine and \\&quot;quality\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>However when I apply a dime sized amount of this product right before I use a flat iron, uh...</li>
            <li>Very natural and curly.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I normally style with mousse but</li>
            <li>Usually after I sleep on my hair, it gets frizzy again, but not this time:)</li>
            <li>I bought a small one because I wasn&#x27;t so sure.</li>
            <li>The frizzing is minimal and my hair dries much quickly after putting it on.</li>
            <li>Like, even if it&#x27;s styled and straight, when it cools and sets, it&#x27;s just stringy and gross.</li>
            <li>I just go a sew in after going natural and was nervous about leaving some of my hair out.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is just a TAD on the sensitive side, and I noticed after using it for about a week, that anywhere my hair touched, I broke out.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked or felt better in my entire life, not even after I got that Brazilian Keratin treatment a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my large bottle of super skinny serum for well over a year and still have about half the bottle left.</li>
            <li>I mean, I love it.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful about putting it on my scalp because it&#x27;s pretty concentrated</li>
            <li>I have used other products over the years, but Super Skinny keeps calling back to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Really does make your hair dry faster!</li>
            <li>I have always had thick and unmanageable hair, that is until I began to use Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum.</li>
            <li>I use 2 pumps because I have very thick hair and for the most part it smooths it down enough to comb and straighten but it doesnt completely protect from humidity as my hair still poofs out when I use it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s hard to judge how much to use because the hair is wet and you can&#x27;t really see how evenly distributed the product is.</li>

            <li> this is a great product if you shower everyday because it keeps frizzy hair and flyaways noticably calm and under control.</li>
            <li> It comes out smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Left my hair kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it kind of feels gross.</li>
            <li> Either way it is styled, any sign of water in the air, rain or humidity, it frizzes and ends up in a pony tail pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Perhaps not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> You know how they all have long wavy hair but its super shiny and healthy?</li>
            <li> but if you really really need it and don&#x27;t have time to stop at a store get it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product I have ever used that has worked.</li>
            <li> When I release the braids my hair has soft smooth waves.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy!</li>
            <li> I used after treating my hair with  Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Smooth Shine</li>
            <li> I first got this from a beauty operator as a sample</li>
            <li> I really do love this product, I use it daily!  </li>
            <li> Also makes my hair feel super soft!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> People I don&#x27;t know will come ask me what I use on it to make it so shiny and pretty (which is obviously very flattering)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good to use it for ironing hair.</li>
            <li> A little will do ya, for sure!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and soft and easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Just use 3 pumps on it and it looks brand new!!</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I used this immediately after washing my hair, straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have a whole basketfull of these failures that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.  </li>
            <li> It keeps your hair shiny and straight just as your stylist did it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Havent used it too much yet, but i do like when my hair stylist use it when she rolls my hair.</li>
            <li> It really does what I need it to do for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty normal.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use too much of it, and you&#x27;re hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help my hair much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> no matter how many other products I use in addition.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t blow-dried yet, as I only do that for special occasions, but can&#x27;t wait to try that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most serums seem like they are just a little much.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Super Skinny by Paul Mitchell, sometimes you don&#x27;t always have the money for the big bottle and</li>
            <li> but the pricing is still high, but that&#x27;s Paul Mitchell as I understand.</li>
            <li> Plus it makes my hair dry much faster, makes it incredibly soft and smooth, in shines.</li>
            <li> Without my super skinny serum, it&#x27;s still long and wavy, but it lacks the shine and \\&quot;quality\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> However when I apply a dime sized amount of this product right before I use a flat iron, uh...</li>
            <li> Very natural and curly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I normally style with mousse but</li>
            <li> Usually after I sleep on my hair, it gets frizzy again, but not this time:)</li>
            <li> I bought a small one because I wasn&#x27;t so sure.</li>
            <li> The frizzing is minimal and my hair dries much quickly after putting it on.</li>
            <li> Like, even if it&#x27;s styled and straight, when it cools and sets, it&#x27;s just stringy and gross.</li>
            <li> I just go a sew in after going natural and was nervous about leaving some of my hair out.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin is just a TAD on the sensitive side, and I noticed after using it for about a week, that anywhere my hair touched, I broke out.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt better in my entire life, not even after I got that Brazilian Keratin treatment a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my large bottle of super skinny serum for well over a year and still have about half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> I mean, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful about putting it on my scalp because it&#x27;s pretty concentrated</li>
            <li> I have used other products over the years, but Super Skinny keeps calling back to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Really does make your hair dry faster!</li>
            <li> I have always had thick and unmanageable hair, that is until I began to use Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum.</li>
            <li> I use 2 pumps because I have very thick hair and for the most part it smooths it down enough to comb and straighten but it doesnt completely protect from humidity as my hair still poofs out when I use it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s hard to judge how much to use because the hair is wet and you can&#x27;t really see how evenly distributed the product is.</li>
            <li> I would get a bigger bottle next time; it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would&lt;</li>
            <li> frequently flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I think I ran out of conditioner and just wanted SOMETHING to put on my hair before I ran a flat iron over it</li>
            <li> Say good by to the frizzy crazy hair!</li>
            <li> But once the hair is dry, it&#x27;s just the same.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my wavy hair, making it less frizzy and imparting a soft shiny feel.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed silky and soft, did not frizz, and only got a little bit of wave in it due to having to get out in the rain briefly.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so shiny and soft and does not weigh it down or make it feel greasy at all!</li>
            <li> Have a large bottle at home and have this small bottle in my purse for touch ups!</li>
            <li> if i leave it on overnight, my hair gets really oily the next day which is not a good thing for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> so it never takes long to dry.</li>
            <li> But my total came out to be $8 for the small size, that S+H almost more expensive than the PM itself</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry and straightened it.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll braid my hair and let it dry.</li>
            <li> i like to use the serum while my hair is damp before it is completely dry after showering.     </li>
            <li> I put it on my damp hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> and, boy, did it do the trick for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> cause it felt dry...</li>
            <li> the waves look dry and duller.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference as far as cutting back on blow drying time....</li>
            <li> I was surprised, though, at how small the bottle was when I received it, given the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend and takes me from a coarse mess of clumpy waves to silk glass in 30 minutes(towel dry, apply serum, and drying my hair with a concentrator along the hair shaft from root to ends), which is my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that takes a while to dry, but I don&#x27;t like to blow it dry because of potential heat damage and because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> I also use a little when I&#x27;m finished doing my hair for that extra shine and silkyness.  </li>
            <li> Just a little spritz is needed for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Feels like I left the salon, everyday.</li>
            <li> The only thing is after about a week of course the product still works but it can get really heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> So...I have long, dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This creates a problem in the mornings during Chicago winters; wet hair freezes</li>
            <li> It is insane how much quicker and straighter and healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also with this product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it keep my hair longer than any other product.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount, over-doing</li>
            <li> But other than those two things it doesn&#x27;t do anything else to my hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just blow dry w/o straightening and this stuff helps with the little frizzies/flyaways, cuts drying time too.</li>
            <li> I noticed a few reviews says a little goes a long way, but I have to use at least 3 pumps for it to affect my natural locks.</li>
            <li> A friend staying with me commented that my hair had dried really fast, and I told her my secret.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it is flamable.</li>
            <li> and it keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and believe me you literally need less than a drop.</li>
            <li> AND for much less money than that treatment cost me.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a little under a half a bottle.</li>
            <li> and it leaked a little</li>
            <li> A little bit like candy, but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li> This serum adds shine like none other, plus prevents frizz!!</li>
            <li> It gives hair body and shine and isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews and bought it to help my hair in the humidity.</li>
            <li> And of course, I did as directed on the bottle and used it before I blow dried my hair and was like, eh..whatever.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time a few years ago, but forgot it exists.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super thick.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have to use very little so that it doesn&#x27;t get TOO silky; then I can&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
            <li> I usually put this product in my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> It usually straightens</li>
            <li> After the product&#x27;s arrival I was shocked to see that the so called $20 vial was a tiny less than an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Expect a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> product may seem expensive, but you don&#x27;t need much, so it&#x27;s really not at all.  </li>
            <li> Product works well on thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for us thick hair frizzy girls.</li>
            <li> They feel like I have a weird film on my hair, or it feels like my hair is waxy or something.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re afraid of knockoffs.</li>
            <li> It rained like crazy today.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product is awesome.  I have tried it before &amp; will again. Hair is very smooth &amp; shinny, not greasy....</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described. The frizzing is minimal and my hair dries much quickly after putting it on. This product is like heaven in a bottle for a woman in the South trying to keep their hair looking beautiful all day long.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller. Product works well on thick hair. It gives hair body and shine and isn&#x27;t too heavy. It was reasonably priced and packaged well. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom leaving the country and she loves it. It is Paul Mitchell so if you&#x27;re afraid of knockoffs. But my total came out to be $8 for the small size, that S+H almost more expensive than the PM itself but if you really really need it and don&#x27;t have time to stop at a store get it! But I honestly saw one at Ulta for about $5-6 dollars if you want to save money.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!! I had read a few reviews and bought it to help my hair in the humidity. I have naturally curly hair that I normally style with mousse but frequently flat iron it. Either way it is styled, any sign of water in the air, rain or humidity, it frizzes and ends up in a pony tail pretty quickly. I used this immediately after washing my hair, straight out of the shower. I let my hair air dry and straightened it. It rained like crazy today. My hair stayed silky and soft, did not frizz, and only got a little bit of wave in it due to having to get out in the rain briefly. It&#x27;s the first product I have ever used that has worked. Plus it makes my hair dry much faster, makes it incredibly soft and smooth, in shines. Overall, I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone. The only con I&#x27;ve found at all is that I did have to use more than recommend (it recommends one squirt of product, I probably used closer to 4) Not at all a big issue, just makes me wish I had gotten a larger bottle as I got the .85oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This smoothing serum smells smells wonderful! I like the left over scent of it on my hands. I have wavy hair that gets frizzy with humidity. I usually put this product in my hair after a shower. Then I&#x27;ll braid my hair and let it dry. When I release the braids my hair has soft smooth waves. My only complaint about this product is that it is flamable. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good to use it for ironing hair. I got the product on sale at JCPenny for $14 and I have been satisfied with it since.</li>
            <li> i like to use the serum while my hair is damp before it is completely dry after showering.     the only reason i purchased this product was so that my boyfriend could notice a lovely new fragrance in my hair (which he has, and loved it). however, i think the scent should be stronger (i had to use 3 pumps in order for him to finally notice!).     if i leave it on overnight, my hair gets really oily the next day which is not a good thing for my acne-prone skin. this is a great product if you shower everyday because it keeps frizzy hair and flyaways noticably calm and under control. i have definitely seen a difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my, and I immediately came home and looked it up on line. Amazon, of course, had the best price. This small size was exactly what I wanted for travel, and I got a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Don&#x27;t over apply or your hair will become greasy.  I also use a little when I&#x27;m finished doing my hair for that extra shine and silkyness.  Great product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It makes my hair shiny no matter how many other products I use in addition.</li>
            <li> Just as my hairdresser uses on my hair. Feels like I left the salon, everyday. Follow directions and its a great item for my hair care</li>
            <li> Best product for styling hair, ever! Shortens drying time and gives hair a great shine. Not greasy at all and believe me you literally need less than a drop.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great and my hair dries faster when I use it.</li>
            <li> The seller quoted an original price as $20 which they were selling @ a discounted price. They claimed to have only 2 left.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered and paid for 2. After the product&#x27;s arrival I was shocked to see that the so called $20 vial was a tiny less than an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local supplier and noticed that their $20.00 container for the same product is a big pint bottle. This was DECEPTIVE advertising. I felt taken.</li>
            <li> I have used the super skinny serum for a few years and it is one of the best products for when I straighten my super curly, frizzy hair. Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy! I love how shiny it makes my hair look and it keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my large bottle of super skinny serum for well over a year and still have about half the bottle left. This stuff is great, especially if I straighten my hair. Makes my hair so shiny and soft and does not weigh it down or make it feel greasy at all! After washing I just pump one time on my hand and rub them together, then I just put it through my damp hair. Afterwards I like to brush/comb it through just to make sure it distributes evenly throughout my hair. Sometimes I just blow dry w/o straightening and this stuff helps with the little frizzies/flyaways, cuts drying time too. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Say good by to the frizzy crazy hair! This product is amazing. My hair is so shiny nowadays. My mom started using mine and now she had to go and get her some too! We love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it but don&#x27;t see any difference this product causes.  I applied it on my curly hair after shampoo. But once the hair is dry, it&#x27;s just the same.</li>
            <li> I used after treating my hair with  Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Smooth Shine and it works great. I put it on my damp hair before styling it and it keep my hair longer than any other product.</li>
            <li> I have tried every frizz-fighting serum on the market. I have a whole basketfull of these failures that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.  THIS product was life-changing for me. Truly!  Those that have curly or frizzy hair will understand. My hair has never looked or felt better in my entire life, not even after I got that Brazilian Keratin treatment a few years ago.  AND for much less money than that treatment cost me.  Usually after I sleep on my hair, it gets frizzy again, but not this time:) I am truly thankful for this wonderful serum and highly recommend it to anyone.  I have very thick, long hair and it only took 3 pumps to tranform it into silky shiny curls.  Haven&#x27;t blow-dried yet, as I only do that for special occasions, but can&#x27;t wait to try that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may seem expensive, but you don&#x27;t need much, so it&#x27;s really not at all.  And the fragrance is yummy.</li>
            <li> After a trip to the hair salon, this serum is great for your hair throughout the week. It keeps your hair shiny and straight just as your stylist did it. The only thing is after about a week of course the product still works but it can get really heavy on your hair. I would recommend washing your own hair in between salon visits to get the best use of the serum. It&#x27;s a really good product and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Great quality - hair feels silky smooth, soft, looks shiny and definitely does not look or even feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I put it on my damp hair and blow dry. It comes out smooth and very shiny. My hair is somewhat thick and wavy. I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of it.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my wavy hair, making it less frizzy and imparting a soft shiny feel. I was surprised, though, at how small the bottle was when I received it, given the price.</li>
            <li> Works very well, very light bodied an excellent product overall. Would probably purchase this product again when given the opportunity</li>
            <li> Havent used it too much yet, but i do like when my hair stylist use it when she rolls my hair. The product came open wasnt happy about that and it leaked a little i dont know if it was like that or the post man when he put it in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me. I have curly frizzy hair.  No help from this product.</li>
            <li> Left my hair kind of greasy.  Perhaps not the right product for me. showed up on time and looked great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum for a couple of years now.  I used to have problems with hair at the back of my neck getting tangled by the end of the day.  I started using this product and my hair is more manageable and just looks smoother.  It is a product that I will continue to use.  It really does what I need it to do for my hair.</li>
            <li> I first got this from a beauty operator as a sample and, boy, did it do the trick for my dry hair. In fact, I have to use very little so that it doesn&#x27;t get TOO silky; then I can&#x27;t do anything with it. I use it after shampooing and don&#x27;t rinse it out. Just a little spritz is needed for my short hair. I can&#x27;t find it at the store so was glad to find it online. I like Paul Mitchell hair spray too and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This serum smells so good! I have curly/wavy hair, when i put this on, it softens my curls and helps with the frizz. Have a large bottle at home and have this small bottle in my purse for touch ups!</li>
            <li> I have always had thick and unmanageable hair, that is until I began to use Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum. This stuff is a godsend and takes me from a coarse mess of clumpy waves to silk glass in 30 minutes(towel dry, apply serum, and drying my hair with a concentrator along the hair shaft from root to ends), which is my hair regimen. I have used other products over the years, but Super Skinny keeps calling back to me. As a person fighting the stray greys here and there this stuff tames them too.  Im in love.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found a good deal for my wife because the larger bottles are 8.5 oz.  I had miss-read and did not see the .85 oz on the description.  Good travel size but the pricing is still high, but that&#x27;s Paul Mitchell as I understand.</li>
            <li> Ok...here&#x27;s the thing: FOR ME, using this prior to blow drying my hair (or any serum now that I&#x27;m thinking about it)...it blows. It smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything. Actually, it kind of feels gross. And it&#x27;s hard to judge how much to use because the hair is wet and you can&#x27;t really see how evenly distributed the product is. So...I have long, dark brown hair. It comes to my waist almost. It&#x27;s not super thick. It&#x27;s pretty normal. Occasionally, I dye it a shade or two darker. The texture when I do nothing to it is sorta wavy. It usually straightens okay. However when I apply a dime sized amount of this product right before I use a flat iron, uh... Awesome! It is insane how much quicker and straighter and healthy my hair looks. I mean, I love it. And my boyfriend adores the smell. Most serums seem like they are just a little much. You know? They feel like I have a weird film on my hair, or it feels like my hair is waxy or something. Like, even if it&#x27;s styled and straight, when it cools and sets, it&#x27;s just stringy and gross. But with this serum, it feels light and controlled. I stumbled across it because I received it from my aunt who is a stylist. And of course, I did as directed on the bottle and used it before I blow dried my hair and was like, eh..whatever. Didn&#x27;t really like it. And then one day, I don&#x27;t remember why..I think I ran out of conditioner and just wanted SOMETHING to put on my hair before I ran a flat iron over it cause it felt dry...and it was amazing. I am very much a hair kind of girl. Everyone always compliments my hair. People I don&#x27;t know will come ask me what I use on it to make it so shiny and pretty (which is obviously very flattering)... I even use this serum before I curl it..and honestly, it reminds me of Kardashian hair. haha You know how they all have long wavy hair but its super shiny and healthy? Okay..it&#x27;s like that! Without my super skinny serum, it&#x27;s still long and wavy, but it lacks the shine and \\&quot;quality\\&quot;...the waves look dry and duller. So I definitely recommend this! I love it!</li>
            <li> My mom introduced me to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny serum. As a hairdresser she is always using this product on client&#x27;s straightened hair. I love the way the serum eliminates frizz and keeps my straightened fly-aways in place. It is super effective. It only takes a small amount, over-doing it can cause greasy looking hair. It smells very nice too!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time a few years ago, but forgot it exists. After using cheaper stuff from the grocery store for a while, I was excited when I saw it on here again. So glad I tried it again. Smooths so well and I love the smell. A little bit like candy, but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair sleek and smooth but never greasy. You don&#x27;t have to use too much of it, and you&#x27;re hair immediately looks healthier and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Good quality at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I use 2 pumps because I have very thick hair and for the most part it smooths it down enough to comb and straighten but it doesnt completely protect from humidity as my hair still poofs out when I use it.</li>
            <li> works well, doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy.  really smooths split ends and is a great thermo-protector.  would def buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product. A little goes a long way. Only need a drop for short layered hair. Put a drop in your hand, rub hands together and run through hair.  It makes my hair smooth and soft and easy to blow dry. Very happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> This looks to me like it works for a lot of people, but not me. It doesn&#x27;t really help my hair much. My hair still stays frizzy. But it does make it feel smoother and hair smell better. I love the smell. But other than those two things it doesn&#x27;t do anything else to my hair.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! I have type 4B/C hair. Very natural and curly. I just go a sew in after going natural and was nervous about leaving some of my hair out. So I searched the web to find a good product that would keep my hair sleek and straight. This works perfectly! All you need is 2 pumps for your hair that&#x27;s left out. It looks as if its going to to oily but its not. No oil or residue whatsoever. I even use it on my weave. You know how the ends of the weave will start to look frizzy... Just use 3 pumps on it and it looks brand new!! I bought a small one because I wasn&#x27;t so sure. But I&#x27;m buying the big one when I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> This is the most money I&#x27;ve ever used on a hair product, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Didn&#x27;t control my frizzy fly-aways like I thought it would. Also, my skin is just a TAD on the sensitive side, and I noticed after using it for about a week, that anywhere my hair touched, I broke out.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product, I use it daily!  My hair responds great to it, but if you aren&#x27;t used to it, you can use too much and your hair may become too oily.  A little will do ya, for sure!  I have long hair and I love this!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Super Skinny by Paul Mitchell, sometimes you don&#x27;t always have the money for the big bottle and since you on need a squirt this size was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, LOVE this serum! By far the best I have ever used. It smells incredible, super light and works amazing on my incredibly thick, frizzy unmanageable hair. Also with this product, a little goes a long way. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> works so good love it but when it arrived the bottle was leaking all in all its good product would definityly purchase again</li>
            <li> Feels good on my hair</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. Best price going and the product is awesome. It&#x27;s a must have for us thick hair frizzy girls.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff smells really fruity like either Stawberries, Watermelon, or Green Apples I cant tell which one. but I LOVE the smell of it!! Also makes my hair feel super soft!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the add-on to see how I liked it. It is not greasy and it smells so good. I like how it makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my hair, and bought this size for travel.  If you use it for travel, be sure to put it in it&#x27;s own ziploc bag, and maybe two bags.  The bottle leaks every time I fly.  Expect a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> Hair dressers highly recommend this and ever since I started using this I&#x27;ve loved it! And it smells amazing which is always a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I bought the 4oz bottle just to try it out and boy was I amazed!!! It last quite awhile too!! I brought this back in November and I still have a little under a half a bottle. I noticed a few reviews says a little goes a long way, but I have to use at least 3 pumps for it to affect my natural locks. This serum adds shine like none other, plus prevents frizz!! I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference as far as cutting back on blow drying time....my hair is fine so it never takes long to dry. I will definitely be re-ordering and get a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I like my hair maintenance-free, so I very rarely use any product besides shampoo and conditioner. The last time I got my hair cut, they put this in, and it smelled so good that I impulsively ordered some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this almost every day. I have long hair that takes a while to dry, but I don&#x27;t like to blow it dry because of potential heat damage and because I&#x27;m lazy. This creates a problem in the mornings during Chicago winters; wet hair freezes fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;- Really does make your hair dry faster! A friend staying with me commented that my hair had dried really fast, and I told her my secret. She used some and was astonished at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I would get a bigger bottle next time; it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would&lt;br /&gt;- I have to be careful about putting it on my scalp because it&#x27;s pretty concentrated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- Will definitely buy more soon!</li>
            <li> ...what about the smell?  It smells like watermelon bubble gum.  Why would you want your hair to smell like that??  I don&#x27;t understand why so many hair products have such overwhelming fragrances.</li>
