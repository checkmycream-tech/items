            <li>This wax is awesome.</li>
            <li>perfectly in GiGi wax warmer (​Model: 0225).</li>
            <li>This is the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very pleasant but does not make up for the fact that it isn&#x27;t very good at pulling out hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on face and for nose.</li>
            <li>Not so good for legs or</li>
            <li>Wax with Vitamin E: Good wax.</li>
            <li>This works excellently to remove stubborn hair cleanly.  </li>
            <li>A bit sticky, not my favorite!</li>
            <li>The wax sticks to your skin and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;flick\\&quot; very easily.</li>
            <li>It smells good, goes onto the desired area smoothly, and waxes hair with ease.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has turned out to be my favorite wax.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Okay wax.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice clean smooth look.</li>
            <li>This prodact was amazing, it never broke on me and got all, absoultly all of the hairs on the first time.</li>
            <li>perfect texture - not sticky or brittle, easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;Color is a little too abrasive -</li>
            <li>Satin Smooth waxes that I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;Honey</li>
            <li>It goes faster but its worth it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it! :-)</li>
            <li>It is not painful.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, good for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Smooth Satin usually has great stuff, I bought this for the price.  </li>
            <li>First of all OUCH!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t apply right.</li>
            <li>It removes all of the hair, but is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>BUT last night I finally used my Satin Smooth Citrus Mojito and I am completely in love!</li>
            <li>This is a great hard wax.  </li>
            <li>This wax is very stringy so when you pull it towards you there are sometimes strings left over which are very fine and hair like and adhere to your sink.</li>
            <li>and it seems very temperamental to being the exact temperature.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and hard which make it easy to pull off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waxed before with creme wax and never had a problem, except it pulls skin a little bit more</li>
            <li>Plus it was wasnt too too stringy and it was such a pretty color!</li>
            <li>I like the wild cherry hard wax wayyyyyy better!</li>
            <li>This wax is my new favorite, requires leas to apply than the cherry hard wax and saves me money since I dont have to buy muslin strips as you have to do to  use the honey or zinc wax.</li>
            <li>I love the Citrus Mojito Hard Wax.</li>
            <li>I personally think it takes longer to set/harden than some other hard waxes out there, and for this reason I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but it is a perfectly good product.</li>
            <li>If you are used to creme wax, or want something better than this stuff, go with Cirepil hard blue wax.</li>
            <li>it was too stringy, always broke when ripping, and left too many strays behind....</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy with this wax when removing wax residue from skin and hard surfaces, it is hard to remove from the carpet as any other wax.</li>
            <li>Go with their golden hard wax.</li>

            <li> Go with their golden hard wax.</li>
            <li> I tried this hard wax for the first time a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I will continue to get this wax as long as the price remain the same or close.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and while their is still redness afterwards, and there is still a little pain</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much since I prefer the hard</li>
            <li> , I did my OWN brazilian- bad idea</li>
            <li> It tends to break up into pieces if you let is set too long.  </li>
            <li> First off, this wax hardly smells like citrus or a mojito, just plain wax.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had great luck with some of Conair&#x27;s other waxes but this one ended up brittle no matter what we did, so when pulling off the wax it would often snap off leaving a very difficult - and painful - second pull at the same strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a bit thicker than the other Satin smooths which I like because my hair is on the coarser side.</li>
            <li> Also you can see this wax on your skin unlike Gigi hard wax which is a clear wax when dried on skin.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else \\&quot;down there\\&quot; from now on...</li>
            <li> This wax is not gooey, stringy, and messy like Gigi hard wax (floral, and regular) when applying and removing it from the skin.  </li>
            <li> If it is too hot, you can&#x27;t get it off, too cold</li>
            <li> For the past month Ive been using the regular Gigi Hard Wax bc</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this away because it was just too messy.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, if a little thick.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I believe it may be the Mojito formula because I have used SS in the past and had no problem.</li>
            <li> You only need a thin (not to thin, not to thick) layer of wax so that it can shrink wrap around hair and it will remove the hair with ease.</li>
            <li> This is a hard wax that does not require any strips.</li>
            <li> I was also sore for about a week because I ripped the hair out so hard..</li>
            <li> (hard wax is supposed to take the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; away)..</li>
            <li> Like all hard waxes it takes a while to melt, but not unreasonably so.</li>
            <li> I was fearful of purchasing a product I hadn&#x27;t tested before, but my worries were allayed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Definitely less painful than the other wax that you have to use with a strip.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my horrible GG hard wax that broke my skin out and was a nightmare to remove.  </li>

            <li> When it comes to trying different products. This has turned out to be my favorite wax.</li>
            <li> I tried this hard wax for the first time a couple weeks ago. First of all OUCH! The wax sticks to your skin and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;flick\\&quot; very easily. If it is too hot, you can&#x27;t get it off, too cold and it doesn&#x27;t apply right. I had nightmares after using this wax (mind you, I did my OWN brazilian- bad idea haha) I was also sore for about a week because I ripped the hair out so hard.. :/ I&#x27;ve waxed before with creme wax and never had a problem, except it pulls skin a little bit more (hard wax is supposed to take the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; away).. If you are used to creme wax, or want something better than this stuff, go with Cirepil hard blue wax. It is THE BEST. My esthetician uses it on me and I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else \\&quot;down there\\&quot; from now on...</li>
            <li> Love this product. I will continue to get this wax as long as the price remain the same or close.</li>
            <li> This wax is very stringy so when you pull it towards you there are sometimes strings left over which are very fine and hair like and adhere to your sink. and it seems very temperamental to being the exact temperature. Unless you are a pro I would avoid.</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome. Definitely less painful than the other wax that you have to use with a strip. It leaves a nice clean smooth look.</li>
            <li> perfect texture - not sticky or brittle, easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;Color is a little too abrasive - i can&#x27;t help but to imagine it in some witches&#x27; cauldron.&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly in GiGi wax warmer (​Model: 0225).</li>
            <li> Works great on face and for nose. Not so good for legs or back.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or ingrown hairs after using.</li>
            <li> I love the Citrus Mojito Hard Wax. It smells good, goes onto the desired area smoothly, and waxes hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Satin Smooth waxes that I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;Honey Wax with Vitamin E: Good wax. I haven&#x27;t used this much since I prefer the hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;Deluxe Cream Wax: Okay wax. I ended up throwing this away because it was just too messy.</li>
            <li> This works excellently to remove stubborn hair cleanly.  It dries quickly and hard which make it easy to pull off.  I bought this to replace my horrible GG hard wax that broke my skin out and was a nightmare to remove.  This is the best.</li>
            <li> I use it to wax my armpits and bikini line. Just remember to put oil on your skin before using or else.</li>
            <li> AMAZZZING! For the past month Ive been using the regular Gigi Hard Wax bc my kit came with it and I hadn&#x27;t been the biggest fan bc it was too stringy, always broke when ripping, and left too many strays behind.... BUT last night I finally used my Satin Smooth Citrus Mojito and I am completely in love! This prodact was amazing, it never broke on me and got all, absoultly all of the hairs on the first time. Plus it was wasnt too too stringy and it was such a pretty color! I will def be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Smooth Satin usually has great stuff, I bought this for the price.  It leaves a lot of residue, Im probably gonna through it out.  I believe it may be the Mojito formula because I have used SS in the past and had no problem.</li>
            <li> I got this to save money since waxing at the salon was costing me about $30 every two weeks for brow and lip waxing. This wax is my new favorite, requires leas to apply than the cherry hard wax and saves me money since I dont have to buy muslin strips as you have to do to  use the honey or zinc wax. Highly recommended, good for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> A go to! I&#x27;ve ordered this several times!</li>
            <li> First off, this wax hardly smells like citrus or a mojito, just plain wax. That&#x27;s not a bad thing. Like all hard waxes it takes a while to melt, but not unreasonably so. It goes on nicely, if a little thick. I personally think it takes longer to set/harden than some other hard waxes out there, and for this reason I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but it is a perfectly good product.</li>
            <li> Used a lot of different waxes. We&#x27;ve had great luck with some of Conair&#x27;s other waxes but this one ended up brittle no matter what we did, so when pulling off the wax it would often snap off leaving a very difficult - and painful - second pull at the same strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasant but does not make up for the fact that it isn&#x27;t very good at pulling out hair. Go with their golden hard wax.</li>
            <li> It tends to break up into pieces if you let is set too long.  I like the wild cherry hard wax wayyyyyy better!</li>
            <li> A bit sticky, not my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was fearful of purchasing a product I hadn&#x27;t tested before, but my worries were allayed the first time I used it. I have very sensitive skin, and while their is still redness afterwards, and there is still a little pain (I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anyway to do it without some pain), the redness is always gone by the morning.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not work well for me and I Didn&#x27;t like it.  I would recommend the Sally Hansen Micro Eyebrow-Lip &amp; Face Wax</li>
            <li> This one is a bit thicker than the other Satin smooths which I like because my hair is on the coarser side. It goes faster but its worth it!</li>
