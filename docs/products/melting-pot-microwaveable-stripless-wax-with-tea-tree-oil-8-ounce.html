    <ol>
            <li>incredible !</li>
            <li>perfectly shaved in one step !</li>
            <li>for the wax itself, I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>Really good stripless wax!</li>
            <li>This is good stuff for home waxing very good price for lots of product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for pubic hair and also armpit hairs.</li>
            <li>Used this twice now and it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great wax.</li>
            <li>It is so convenient because I can put it in the microwave and the result is just as good as a salon at probably a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this after using another brand of stripless wax that she absolutely loved.</li>
            <li>super happy with this product!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love and recommend it!</li>
            <li>It was a bit like melted cheese -- kind of stringy.</li>
            <li>It did give me a kind of catfish look, which was amusing.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and it works well.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of getting all the hair out the first time.</li>
            <li>first attempt to shave armpits and will just keep on instructions and everything went perfectly shaved the first try !</li>
            <li>Also, not that it doesn&#x27;t come with a spreading stick (but chopsticks do fine) or any kind of soothing oil.</li>
            <li>It is easy to heat, easy to use and gets the job done easily and fairly painlessly.</li>
            <li>this was available again!</li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>and I love not having to have strips.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty gooey, but it&#x27;s good for my first time using wax on my own.</li>
            <li>so you can flick the end of the wax up and then easily pull it off.  </li>
            <li>Easy to heat and work with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different Brazilian waxing products and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I used to have Poetic Wax, but it was a bit of an ordeal to put it in a pot on the stove to melt it.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to see microwavable wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and easy to use -</li>
            <li>It also gets cool fairly quickly so you need to reheat it every 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>And with subsequent touch-up reheatings, more of the wax melts, and it becomes more homogeneous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, Super Papaya, 180 Count costs around $11 with Amazon Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Definitely purchasing more jars in case this gets discontinued too!</li>
            <li>So far I love it, you just heat it in the microwave, apply it to the area and once it&#x27;s cooled peel it off.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you get used to it and are good at spreading it thick, it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li>But this was worth</li>
            <li>Other than that - definitely one of the best waxing products i have used!</li>
            <li>Melts fast in the microwave &amp; is easy to remove, it really does stick to the hair and not my skin.  </li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>Before my review, first a tip: Buy a box of tongue depressors to use as wax applicators.</li>
            <li>Both are sticky, take more coordination, and simply don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I microwaved as directed, first 30 seconds, stir, 15 seconds, stir, 15 seconds, and stir.</li>
            <li>So, use the part that has melted first.</li>
            <li>It has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li>The only thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stick to put the wax on and doesn&#x27;t come with aftercare lotion/oil as most waxes do.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this product, and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using it</li>
            <li>It was the first time I did this, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it was, but everything seems okay hours later!</li>
            <li>It would warm up enough to spread, but not really pull any hair out as it would cool during application, tuning into a taffy like goo</li>
            <li>This wax by Melting Pot is much easier to get a rhythm for.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite strip less wax.</li>
            <li>Also the first time I heated the pot, the wax was hard on top even though it was melted beneath, so I had to push through in order to get the wax.</li>
            <li>The bad reviews are written by people who are not fully experienced with home waxing so if you have some experience - this is the wax to buy!</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>After the full minute maximum the directions give for heating, a column of the mint green, opaque wax right in the middle is melted to the consistency you need.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this one a try and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I would recommend going for a professional Brazilian if you are a beginner and then use this wax to maintain.  </li>
            <li>DOES THE JOB, ALOT CHEAPER THAN THE PROFESSIONAL WAX</li>
            <li>So I prefer the stripless wax, which after applied, cooled off, comes right off without a mess.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the container got really hot, but the top stayed cold which is where you have to use it from.</li>
            <li>it cause results lasted at least 3-4 weeks before fine hair started growing back.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is good at removing hair but gets a little messy while using.the wax forms strings and it is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Apart</li>

            <li> A little messy if you haven&#x27;t dealt with wax before, however it leaves the surface of your skin feeling extra soft &amp; really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Expensive for the man who has a full back and shoulder and arm hair.</li>
            <li> I find it hurts far less than other stripless wax</li>
            <li> My second application of wax to ensure I got all the hair out has significantly less hair.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit above my lip as well.</li>
            <li> wax works well, it is not as messy as traditional wax</li>
            <li> I had to reapply a few times to get all the upper lip hairs, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> I also did a little test patch on my leg, and there was seriously NO hair left behind.</li>
            <li> It was also much messier than a regular wax product, with eerie little strings hanging out of the sides by the time I finished.</li>
            <li> Wax strips and other methods just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I did it on the shin, and it hurt way less than strip wax at the salon did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I ended up ripping off some skin (not an issue I&#x27;ve ever had with regular wax) and having a constant problem of spreading it too thin (even though I was actively trying to avoid it) and ending up with thin little layers of gunk that I couldn&#x27;t rip off without some sort of scraper.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> The rest is still stiff.</li>
            <li> Those bundles of wood sticks specifically labeled for wax applications come with a silly markup for what are: essentially, tongue depressors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hard wax gets those tough bikini hairs and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess everywhere since it dries hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come by a wax product that works well for bikini and under arm waxing..</li>
            <li> I just ordered topical anesthetic to numb the area and make the job easier on myself.</li>
            <li> it needs to be spread on quite thick</li>
            <li> You want to apply it somewhat thick</li>
            <li> and it was a lot less painful than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> The bikini was was a breeze, but working inward became trickier and, as expected, painful.</li>
            <li> 1st experience was very painful due to the history of shaving and growing thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as painful as ones I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> Tweezing is way too tedious.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying &amp;#34;stripless&amp;#34; wax, I thought it might not peel off.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> incredible ! perfectly shaved in one step ! first attempt to shave armpits and will just keep on instructions and everything went perfectly shaved the first try ! super happy with this product! it really works! I love and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Before my review, first a tip: Buy a box of tongue depressors to use as wax applicators. Those bundles of wood sticks specifically labeled for wax applications come with a silly markup for what are: essentially, tongue depressors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the wax itself, I am impressed. I&#x27;ve used the strip waxes by Moom and Parissa before. Both are sticky, take more coordination, and simply don&#x27;t work as well. This wax by Melting Pot is much easier to get a rhythm for. I microwaved as directed, first 30 seconds, stir, 15 seconds, stir, 15 seconds, and stir. After the full minute maximum the directions give for heating, a column of the mint green, opaque wax right in the middle is melted to the consistency you need. The rest is still stiff. So, use the part that has melted first. I used that column for ~10 minutes before I thought the pot could use a re-heating. And with subsequent touch-up reheatings, more of the wax melts, and it becomes more homogeneous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this wax for a Brazilian. The bikini was was a breeze, but working inward became trickier and, as expected, painful. I&#x27;ve had a Brazilian professionally done before, but it&#x27;s harder to perform on one&#x27;s self. I just ordered topical anesthetic to numb the area and make the job easier on myself. I also did a little test patch on my leg, and there was seriously NO hair left behind. I did it on the shin, and it hurt way less than strip wax at the salon did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, before waxing, I dusted on baby powder as to rip out only hair and not skin. It was the first time I did this, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it was, but everything seems okay hours later!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and it works well.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nair&#x27;s stripless microwaveable wax and when it was discontinued I panicked.  It was so reliable and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except on ebay for $80+.  I decided to give this one a try and was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s not as painful as ones I&#x27;ve used in the past and it does a great job of getting all the hair out the first time. My second application of wax to ensure I got all the hair out has significantly less hair. I do wish the jar was wider and it came with sticks and oiled wax cloths, but at the price I can&#x27;t complain. Definitely purchasing more jars in case this gets discontinued too!</li>
            <li> Wax strips and other methods just don&#x27;t work for me. Tweezing is way too tedious. I used to have Poetic Wax, but it was a bit of an ordeal to put it in a pot on the stove to melt it. So I was excited to see microwavable wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well. I heated it for the max time. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the consistency. It was a bit like melted cheese -- kind of stringy. So when I&#x27;d bring the wax from the pot to my face, it left strings hanging that I had to break. It did give me a kind of catfish look, which was amusing. It did the job. I had to reapply a few times to get all the upper lip hairs, but that was expected. The skin was red afterward, but nothing abnormal. No breakouts or irritation the next day either. I like it! I also bought a set of 100 wooden wax sticks to use with it.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this product and would not go without it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty gooey, but it&#x27;s good for my first time using wax on my own. It has a funny smell to it. Also the first time I heated the pot, the wax was hard on top even though it was melted beneath, so I had to push through in order to get the wax. It takes away about 60-75% of the hair it needs to.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite strip less wax. It is easy to heat, easy to use and gets the job done easily and fairly painlessly. The only thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stick to put the wax on and doesn&#x27;t come with aftercare lotion/oil as most waxes do. It also gets cool fairly quickly so you need to reheat it every 10 minutes or so. Other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different Brazilian waxing products and this is by far the best! I would recommend going for a professional Brazilian if you are a beginner and then use this wax to maintain.  It is very gentle and easy to use - it needs to be spread on quite thick so you can flick the end of the wax up and then easily pull it off.

            <li> DOES THE JOB, ALOT CHEAPER THAN THE PROFESSIONAL WAX</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish this was available again! Works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come by a wax product that works well for bikini and under arm waxing.. Especially when doing It on myself. So I prefer the stripless wax, which after applied, cooled off, comes right off without a mess. This was my first time using this product, and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> American Health Probiotic Enzyme Plus, Super Papaya, 180 Count costs around $11 with Amazon Prime shipping. Does not come with application sticks, so save your popsicle sticks. I really don&#x27;t like this since it is so messy and does not remove hair as well as a salon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying &amp;#34;stripless&amp;#34; wax, I thought it might not peel off. So far I love it, you just heat it in the microwave, apply it to the area and once it&#x27;s cooled peel it off. It works well and removes hair without irritation. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great! A little messy if you haven&#x27;t dealt with wax before, however it leaves the surface of your skin feeling extra soft &amp; really gets the job done! Would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Really good stripless wax! Just microwave it and apply it to the hair. You want to apply it somewhat thick so you can grab the wax since there&#x27;s no strips involved. It&#x27;s great for pubic hair and also armpit hairs. I use a little bit above my lip as well.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use. Maybe if you get used to it and are good at spreading it thick, it&#x27;ll be better. This was my first time using it and I ended up ripping off some skin (not an issue I&#x27;ve ever had with regular wax) and having a constant problem of spreading it too thin (even though I was actively trying to avoid it) and ending up with thin little layers of gunk that I couldn&#x27;t rip off without some sort of scraper.

Also, not that it doesn&#x27;t come with a spreading stick (but chopsticks do fine) or any kind of soothing oil.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. It does not remove any hair. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this wax. I use it to wax my bikini area. It is so convenient because I can put it in the microwave and the result is just as good as a salon at probably a quarter of the price. The hard wax gets those tough bikini hairs and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess everywhere since it dries hard. I can get 2 Brazilian waxes out of one jar.</li>
            <li> It is good at removing hair but gets a little messy while using.the wax forms strings and it is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that,no complains. it serves the purpose well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after using another brand of stripless wax that she absolutely loved. She said this stuff didn&#x27;t heat up in the microwave like it should have. The bottom of the container got really hot, but the top stayed cold which is where you have to use it from. It would warm up enough to spread, but not really pull any hair out as it would cool during application, tuning into a taffy like goo, that didn&#x27;t stick to her. If it doesn&#x27;t stick, it doesn&#x27;t pull any hair out so she&#x27;s returning it and is going to re-order the one that actually worked. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Used this twice now and it&#x27;s a great product.  Melts fast in the microwave &amp; is easy to remove, it really does stick to the hair and not my skin.  Just did my upper lip and it was a lot less painful than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff for home waxing very good price for lots of product</li>
            <li> Great wax. Easy to heat and work with. Will repurchase when I run out. Used for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> wax works well, it is not as messy as traditional wax and I love not having to have strips.  It works well for all areas of the body.</li>
            <li> used this cause my GF suggested waxing over shaving. 1st experience was very painful due to the history of shaving and growing thick hair. But this was worth it cause results lasted at least 3-4 weeks before fine hair started growing back. Expensive for the man who has a full back and shoulder and arm hair. Got this again and works just as well.</li>
