    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Did get one ad for locking in a great value!!!  </li>
            <li>I ordered these products all in good faith!</li>
            <li>Save your money and just get a good moisturizer that works for you from CVS, Duane Reade or Stop and Shop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>I wish I read the reviews before buying as everyone say they suck you in with their free trial and you end up paying a lot more than you bargained for!</li>
            <li>Use your money to get another product from a better more considerate company.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I read all these comments about this company and their deceitful practices.  </li>
            <li>That way if you use the product for 30 days and love it you&#x27;re all set to go.  </li>
            <li>OK....</li>
            <li>I should know better.</li>
            <li>She offered to sell me more product.  </li>
            <li>She offered to sell me more product.</li>
            <li>She kept trying to sell me more of their lotion, which is probably just Jergins repackaged.</li>
            <li>meanwhile they will send you more product and keep charging your card.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>This business is a fraud, and it should be investigated by the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li>By now I should know that anything that promises you miracles does not work, most of this is hype, its an ok over priced product aimed at women who would like improved skin.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Regenerist works better and so does Salma Hayek&#x27;s Nuance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finding the contact info for the company is an interesting exercise as well.</li>
            <li>anyone has tried the anti-aging and hydrating product combo I&#x27;d love to read your results.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I told her I wasn&#x27;t interested because I don&#x27;t have that kind of money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one case in which the overwhelming weight of the reviews on Amazon is true.</li>
            <li>They then charge your credit card, and there is no way you can get the charge off because of the fine print somewhere.  </li>
            <li>Read all the fine print before you get into this &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; trial.  </li>
            <li>so called free trial&#x27;&#x27; cost me about $170 for s***ty creams that wont come out of the container.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth as well.</li>
            <li>I was supposed to get a free trial.  </li>
            <li>DO not try this FREE product.</li>
            <li>The product is fine but hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles and certainly isn&#x27;t worth the huge cost of it.  </li>
            <li>First off the &#x27;trial&#x27; price/offer of, &#x27;we are sure you&#x27;ll love it so much just pay shipping&#x27; is misleading.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that free trial means you must return the product in 14 days ( which will not be easy as you have to call them and they will try everything to talk you out of it),  </li>
            <li>The woman I spoke to offered to \\&quot;lock in\\&quot; a special price of 50% off...i.e. $89.95 every two months.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford a scam right now!</li>
            <li>They will not give you a full refund, so I got stuck paying for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>That price then goes up to the full price at the end of 14 days and is charged for what you received.</li>
            <li>They start charging your bank account the full price of the product without asking you if you even care for the product.  </li>
            <li>So far, pretty good.</li>
            <li>the product doesnt work, and although they say money back guarantee, you will have more luck winning the lottery.</li>
            <li>Try this if you are willing to lose the original billing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen my manager have someone come in screaming because they bought a lemon and walk out with a $500 service contract and a smile.</li>
            <li>When I called them they were over friendly but also very persuasive...</li>
            <li>they start charging you credit card right away and claim you AGREED to a contract with them</li>
            <li>When my credit card company notified me of &amp;#34;suspicious activity&amp;#34; on my account, I cancelled the subscription right away, but they don&#x27;t charge you until the 14 days have passed, so you are stuck paying $170 for nothing.  </li>
            <li>They answered right away and canceled it right away.</li>
            <li>I used it once, then looked at the ingredients cuz my skin felt funny.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews, I decided not to demand money back.</li>
            <li>I was about to buy this product and thought I&#x27;d look up some reviews first-</li>
            <li>I was browsing the net with my morning coffee, I love the internet.  </li>
            <li>The fine print does not show anywhere in their offering of the free sample only on their own website and very hard to find even when you looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Thanks for the warning</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing to improve my skins appearance.</li>
            <li>very misleading!!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free of charge they would only would charge for shipment.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>The ads for Lumanelle Products offer the products free, with shipping charges only.  </li>
            <li>my skin became so dry that when I did apply a good moisturizer my skin soaked it up a dry sponge.  </li>
            <li>sure how the products work as I was looking to possibly purchase them however found that only inpatient people have made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>At this point I need to point out I m an old school Army sergeant and this was just a colorful expression of displeasure, not an actual threat of violence.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to see in the first place because it&#x27;s written in the fine prints and you have to click on the link terms and policy to read it.</li>
            <li>She offered a 50% discount on our past purchase and to sell us more product.</li>
            <li>First of all, they cheat you, and second of all, the product does NOT WORK!  </li>
            <li>He said my call was not being productive, I guess not, because he couldn&#x27;t steal any more of my hard earned money.  </li>
            <li>I would steer clear from this company.</li>
            <li>I clearly read on the Facebook ad that you need to call within the 14 day trial to cancel or that you would receive the $89 charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it very much so far.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why they include them in the offers.</li>
            <li>As I always do, I looked up consumer reviews, I love all those people that share their opinions, saves me time and trouble and especially $$$$$$&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i  think I could use plain coconut or jojoba oil and get the same or better results with out the added  chemicals</li>
            <li>This is not a good product; and the whole free just for the shipping is a lie.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t go near this product especially as it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>and if you do they lie and repeat the same script over and over.&lt;br /&gt;DO not waste you time and money!!!!!!very</li>
            <li>few weeks later they charged my credit card the full price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is hard to cancel, for what it&#x27;s worth</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is hard to cancel, for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> After being on hold for an excessive time I finally got a real person.  </li>
            <li> Oz recently said that you have to be careful with these websites.</li>
            <li> The Utah Attorney General should look into this and either shut it down or make it list the terms and conditions before ordering.  </li>
            <li> They send you a tiny bottle with a hidden &amp;#34;Terms of Service&amp;#34; agreement so that when you believe you&#x27;re getting a $5 sample, you&#x27;re actually signing up for an $89.95 charge per month.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I decided to send back the repair and hydrate I received 2 days ago.  </li>
            <li> They did a very deceptive ad on the internet and suck you in for a bunch of money every month in the very small print.  </li>
            <li> all I got was dreadfully dry skin.  </li>
            <li> After using for 2 days my skin was dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a victim of this deception.</li>
            <li> I assumed there would be an explanation that I would be enrolled in a monthly program for the next few months.  </li>
            <li> But to learn from these reviews that I was gonna be hit with a charge in 14 days was alarming.</li>
            <li> and I looked over the offer quite carefully</li>
            <li> This product does nothing but cost unsuspecting buyers empty promises and a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to go to the point of eventually threatening legal action after they tried to tell me I was 2 days past the deadline.</li>
            <li> When I opened the product I received, I noticed there was no accompanying paperwork other than a page on how to apply.  </li>
            <li> After another excessive time the representative finally accepted my decision.</li>
            <li> Marketing and sales practices are NOT RIGHT.</li>
            <li> The cancellation was lengthy and required that I write down addresses and return numbers.</li>
            <li> , I did not buy this due to baddddddddddd review!</li>
            <li> I used this for a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> The two little tubes arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a free trial at all, but a monthly registration.</li>
            <li> You will be onhold for awhile, but once connected,  be firm and to the point.</li>
            <li> They are a gargantuan rip-off service.</li>
            <li> &gt; Some people may need to slow down and read the terms and</li>
            <li> for the rest of you my advice is slow down and read the terms and conditions.  </li>
            <li> After calling it to get a return authorization, but then getting charged, I then called the bogus customer service several times requesting to speak with a supervisor or a manager only after the agents stated they could not correct my request to return this crap per the trail.  </li>
            <li> hard to get thorough  </li>
            <li> LUMANELLE SUCKS and it</li>
            <li> but again if you want to post it you have to give it a star :( scam for second one</li>
            <li> They are misleading and I learned a very hard lesson about ordering on the internet (it was NOT through Amazon, but it was this company).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> How wrong I was.....</li>
            <li> , I thought, and saw no mention of charging me those exorbitant prices for a one ounce bottle of their cold cream.)  </li>
            <li> you get locked into a monthly subscription and it is almost impossible to get out of  £89.95 being taken every month forever</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to read the T&amp;C and they threaten you.</li>
            <li> These people are sick.</li>
            <li> so I could return this crap because for me IT CONTAINS CRAPPY INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews were bad!</li>
            <li> The customer service is horrible!</li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible customer service.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT! THEY WILL CHARGE Ur credit card even if you return the product. $48.71 for something you will not like. Per the trail agreement, I called to get a return authorization so I could return this crap because for me IT CONTAINS CRAPPY INGREDIENTS. I used it once, then looked at the ingredients cuz my skin felt funny. The Second listed was that Edible antifreeze. Not using that on my face. The customer service is horrible! Do not call the automated service it is a trick to get your money. Yes, I am a victim of this deception. After calling it to get a return authorization, but then getting charged, I then called the bogus customer service several times requesting to speak with a supervisor or a manager only after the agents stated they could not correct my request to return this crap per the trail.  The agents would not let me speak to one supervisor. I was told it was not the supervisors job to speak with the customers. Huh?! I was hung up on by the last agent. He said my call was not being productive, I guess not, because he couldn&#x27;t steal any more of my hard earned money.  What is to be said about a company that has to mishandle their customers, mishandle our credit card info and then mistreat the customers to sell their product? This company can not be trusted. Thier word is dung. So Don&#x27;t do it. SKIP THIS ONE. Use your money to get another product from a better more considerate company.  I have a 1000 percent regret for trying this product and making a purchase for it. I don&#x27;t know bout u but I dont have $48.71 to throw in the trash or give to a rogue company.  LUMANELLE SUCKS and it, overall, is ratchet! I only gave one star because there wasn&#x27;t a lower rating.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews, I decided not to demand money back. (even though I had already been billed for $79 something) and called the number listed on one review.....800-622-3073.  Got a recording to punch in various nu,mbers.  Did get one ad for locking in a great value!!!  but skipping that I got numbers to punch to cancel the automatic billing.  Even got an email reading that it was totally cancelled.  Try this if you are willing to lose the original billing.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I read all these comments about this company and their deceitful practices.  When I opened the product I received, I noticed there was no accompanying paperwork other than a page on how to apply.  I assumed there would be an explanation that I would be enrolled in a monthly program for the next few months.  That way if you use the product for 30 days and love it you&#x27;re all set to go.  But to learn from these reviews that I was gonna be hit with a charge in 14 days was alarming. I promptly called the 800 number and cancelled.  The cancellation was lengthy and required that I write down addresses and return numbers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trap don&#x27;t buy that. It&#x27;s not a free trial at all, but a monthly registration. It&#x27;s hard to see in the first place because it&#x27;s written in the fine prints and you have to click on the link terms and policy to read it. So this &#x27;&#x27;so called free trial&#x27;&#x27; cost me about $170 for s***ty creams that wont come out of the container.</li>
            <li> Same as the repair serum.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it faithfully for six weeks....all I got was dreadfully dry skin.  my skin became so dry that when I did apply a good moisturizer my skin soaked it up a dry sponge.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> So far, pretty good. However, time will tell. I like it very much so far. Goes on smooth as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered these products all in good faith! How wrong I was.....you get locked into a monthly subscription and it is almost impossible to get out of  £89.95 being taken every month forever it would seem.  When I called them they were over friendly but also very persuasive...it took me 3 attempts to cancel...they offered massive discounts etc., and even asked me if I knew anyone to take over the payments!! It&#x27;s almost impossible to read the T&amp;C and they threaten you. I called the bank to cancel in the end.  Please don&#x27;t go near this product especially as it doesn&#x27;t work...go to Aldi and buy Lacura!!</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware!!  Products OK.... Marketing and sales practices are NOT RIGHT. Bought trial offer, got slammed with monthly membership at OUTRAGOUS Prices. Call the 1-800-562-9682 # to cancel. You will be onhold for awhile, but once connected,  be firm and to the point. Did reach agreeable terms and got membership cancelled. I should know better.</li>
            <li> I was about to buy this product and thought I&#x27;d look up some reviews first- oh thank you! I cannot afford a scam right now! And it so DID seem like one!</li>
            <li> I was scammed by Lumanelle as well, but before they could charge me again I did find the number to cancel any further shipments it&#x27;s 1-800-545-9153. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> SCAMMMMMMMMMMMM  Thanks for the warning, I did not buy this due to baddddddddddd review! All of the reviews were bad! ALL OF THEM</li>
            <li> I wish I read the reviews before buying as everyone say they suck you in with their free trial and you end up paying a lot more than you bargained for!</li>
            <li> I fell for it.  It came and I opened it.  It wouldn&#x27;t come out of the container, so I started hunting around for how to get in touch with them.  When I did I found what I had gotten myself in for and decided to cancel.  After being on hold for an excessive time I finally got a real person.  After another excessive time the representative finally accepted my decision.</li>
            <li> This is a scam.  I was supposed to get a free trial.  Just pay shipping.  They neglected to say it was only for 14 day trial. Also did not say it cost $169.90 for Repair and Hydrate.  Not only that, they already sent another set out on the 21 without my authorization.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I decided to send back the repair and hydrate I received 2 days ago.  After using for 2 days my skin was dry and flaky. I called customer service and told them I need to send the product back because I have a rash and the woman actually tried to say &amp;#34;oh yay that happen to me you just have to keep using and that will go away and your skin will be luminous&amp;#34;. Is this woman kidding? I told her no then she said what about a 25% discount? I preceded to tell her I wouldn&#x27;t use your products if you were paying me! She gave me the RMA numbers so I can return them. I told her do not Bill my credit card and if you do it would be fraudulent because you do not have my permission. I wanted that on the recorded line. I would steer clear from this company.</li>
            <li> They offered a trial of the product for about 8 bucks. The two little tubes arrived. A month later we got a call from our bank&#x27;s fraud unit. This company charged over $150 to our account. I called the company. I they told me this was a reoccurring monthly charge. I told her to cancel our account and reimburse us for the 150. She offered to sell me more product.  I told her to cancel our account and reimburse us for the 150. She offered to sell me more product. This went on and on until I told her to stop reading her script and get someone on the phone who has the authority to return my 150. She put me on hold, probably went to get a cup of coffee, then told me her supervisor was in a meeting. I&#x27;ve sold cars. I know these tactics. Keep the person on the phone and keep selling. I&#x27;ve seen my manager have someone come in screaming because they bought a lemon and walk out with a $500 service contract and a smile. I told her to cancel out account and refund the 150. She offered a 50% discount on our past purchase and to sell us more product. I told her to stop trying to sell me something or I would find her and rape her with a burning road flare. At this point I need to point out I m an old school Army sergeant and this was just a colorful expression of displeasure, not an actual threat of violence. She kept trying to sell me more of their lotion, which is probably just Jergins repackaged. My bank&#x27;s fraud unit is now handling the case.</li>
            <li> I ordered a trial of the Luma $3.95. I used it for almost two weeks, but stopped because it left a rash on my face and neck.  It did absolutely nothing to improve my skins appearance. If you order it, you automatically &amp;#34;sign&amp;#34; up for additional shipments. They will not give you a full refund, so I got stuck paying for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> DO not try this FREE product. they start charging you credit card right away and claim you AGREED to a contract with them The fine print does not show anywhere in their offering of the free sample only on their own website and very hard to find even when you looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to get thorough  a person and if you do they lie and repeat the same script over and over.&lt;br /&gt;DO not waste you time and money!!!!!!very very misleading!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;really no star but again if you want to post it you have to give it a star :( scam for second one</li>
            <li> This company is a total ripoff.  They did a very deceptive ad on the internet and suck you in for a bunch of money every month in the very small print.  The product has about 10 drops in the container and when I said I didn&#x27;t want it, it came anyway and I was billed almost $90 and this continues on a monthly basis unless you stop it.  They are misleading and I learned a very hard lesson about ordering on the internet (it was NOT through Amazon, but it was this company).</li>
            <li> I was browsing the net with my morning coffee, I love the internet.  I was toying with trying the product, I read several pages of description of the product.  As I always do, I looked up consumer reviews, I love all those people that share their opinions, saves me time and trouble and especially $$$$$$&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hats off to the consumers.</li>
            <li> Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy any Lumanelle products!  First of all, they cheat you, and second of all, the product does NOT WORK!  They scam you into getting a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; trail, then charge you $79.98 and $89.98 for your &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; product if you do not cancel within 14 days (not working days).  They then charge your credit card, and there is no way you can get the charge off because of the fine print somewhere.  (I&#x27;m a college grad and I looked over the offer quite carefully, I thought, and saw no mention of charging me those exorbitant prices for a one ounce bottle of their cold cream.)  When my credit card company notified me of &amp;#34;suspicious activity&amp;#34; on my account, I cancelled the subscription right away, but they don&#x27;t charge you until the 14 days have passed, so you are stuck paying $170 for nothing.  BEWARE!  THIS IS A SCAM!</li>
            <li> This product was offered as a promotion.Free of charge they would only would charge for shipment.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later they charged my credit card the full price and they also enrolled me without my knowledge or authorization into a program,by which they were going to send me this product on a regular basis,naturally charging me $ 89.95,plus shipping each time.&lt;br /&gt;This is an outrage !</li>
            <li> the product doesnt work, and although they say money back guarantee, you will have more luck winning the lottery. Just be aware that free trial means you must return the product in 14 days ( which will not be easy as you have to call them and they will try everything to talk you out of it),  meanwhile they will send you more product and keep charging your card.  If you give them your credit card information just expect to have at least 2 months worth of charges for $89.95 before they will finally let you cancel.</li>
            <li> Rip Off... Stay away... stay away.</li>
            <li> I called them and told them that I wanted to cancel and that I didn&#x27;t want to discuss anything. They answered right away and canceled it right away. I don&#x27;t think it is hard to cancel, for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. Not as advertised and the pump didn&#x27;t even work correctly. I contacted Lumanelle and they would not replace the product. Horrible customer service. I would never order from this company again</li>
            <li> After reading the above reviews I called to cancel. The woman I spoke to offered to \\&quot;lock in\\&quot; a special price of 50% off...i.e. $89.95 every two months. I told her I wasn&#x27;t interested because I don&#x27;t have that kind of money. She tried once again to talk me into accepting the products.  Once again I told her that I just wanted to cancel. She then asked me, \\&quot;Why did you even bother to order these products at all???\\&quot;  When I said I didn&#x27;t KNOW what I would be signing up for, and that I couldn&#x27;t afford it, she then said, \\&quot;May I suggest that in the future you read a website before you sign up for something.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Oz recently said that you have to be careful with these websites. They use his name but are a scam to get $$$.</li>
            <li> The ads for Lumanelle Products offer the products free, with shipping charges only.  I should have known better.  In the ad it did not mention that if they did not hear from you within 14 days, you would be billed $89.95 and $79.95 for the two products.  If you go online and look up reviews, etc., you can find a page that explains all the terms and conditions, but you have to search for it.  It is not on the order.  The Utah Attorney General should look into this and either shut it down or make it list the terms and conditions before ordering.  I saw no results from the product.</li>
            <li> What a farse!  &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;After&amp;#34; photos have been air-brushed to &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; the lines and wrinkles.  This product does nothing but cost unsuspecting buyers empty promises and a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Avoid Lumanelle at all costs. They are a gargantuan rip-off service. They send you a tiny bottle with a hidden &amp;#34;Terms of Service&amp;#34; agreement so that when you believe you&#x27;re getting a $5 sample, you&#x27;re actually signing up for an $89.95 charge per month. For what? A tiny bottle of lotion. These people are sick. This business is a fraud, and it should be investigated by the Better Business Bureau. Absolutely morally bankrupt. Never fall for those web ads that say they&#x27;ll give you a gift for $5.</li>
            <li> By now I should know that anything that promises you miracles does not work, most of this is hype, its an ok over priced product aimed at women who would like improved skin. i  think I could use plain coconut or jojoba oil and get the same or better results with out the added  chemicals</li>
            <li> I used this for a week and a half.  It&#x27;s nice but I will be calling to cancel and will return what is left.  L&#x27;Oreal Regenerist works better and so does Salma Hayek&#x27;s Nuance.  Save your money and just get a good moisturizer that works for you from CVS, Duane Reade or Stop and Shop.</li>
            <li> Read all the fine print before you get into this &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; trial.  You pay the shipping, then you pay for all the product. When you call to cancel, they try to give you a discount., so  The product is fine but hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles and certainly isn&#x27;t worth the huge cost of it.  Buyer Beware!!!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the product did not perform as advertised. Next, if you are ordering a &#x27;trial&#x27; pay close attention to your credit card statement. First off the &#x27;trial&#x27; price/offer of, &#x27;we are sure you&#x27;ll love it so much just pay shipping&#x27; is misleading. That price then goes up to the full price at the end of 14 days and is charged for what you received. Next, that 14 day period starts the minute you order it NOT when the product is received and you begin to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the contact info for the company is an interesting exercise as well. When you click on the order form on their website it takes you to an entirely different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one plus I will give them is that I stood my ground in order to demand my refund. Unfortunately I had to go to the point of eventually threatening legal action after they tried to tell me I was 2 days past the deadline. Their time period included the week it took to receive the product. Eventually a refund was issued (altho I have not seen it credited as of yet so may be back to update this review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one case in which the overwhelming weight of the reviews on Amazon is true.</li>
            <li> I clearly read on the Facebook ad that you need to call within the 14 day trial to cancel or that you would receive the $89 charge.&lt;br /&gt; Some people may need to slow down and read the terms and conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how the products work as I was looking to possibly purchase them however found that only inpatient people have made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;And have only commented on the scam.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has tried the anti-aging and hydrating product combo I&#x27;d love to read your results.&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of you my advice is slow down and read the terms and conditions.  That&#x27;s why they include them in the offers.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product; and the whole free just for the shipping is a lie.  They start charging your bank account the full price of the product without asking you if you even care for the product.  It is a scam.  RUN, Run, run from this</li>
