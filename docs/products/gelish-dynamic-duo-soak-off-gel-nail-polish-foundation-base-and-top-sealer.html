            <li>Perfect, large size for the gellish system.  </li>
            <li>Works great with LED light.</li>
            <li>They work great in my ORLY LED light.</li>
            <li>That was an amazing feat in itself.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.      </li>
            <li>Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li>so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li>Saves me tons of money, and if it gets messed up I just fix it on my own time.</li>
            <li>the foundation is thicker and has a shorter brush which is nice.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to go to the nail salon to get nice gel nails.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gelish for a great product!</li>
            <li>I knew i liked this brand before I bought it because my bestfriend uses and and I wanted to own it myself.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and at a very good price - works great with LED light.</li>
            <li>It a great price for the full size.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  </li>
            <li>It was such a good price and the service was great !</li>
            <li>The price was great for the product and everything shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This company was great, got it quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the Gelish brand it is excellent quality for a decent price</li>
            <li>I USE IT WITH ALL MY GEL BRANDS AND NICE QUALITY MIRROR FINISH, THE TOP COAT IS A BIT RUNNY</li>
            <li>The top coat leaves a nice glossy layer.</li>
            <li>I do my own manicures with them and the polish lasts for a week or more.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to help your nails grow if they are pealing or just not growing, worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing deal on a product I love</li>
            <li>Lasts for two weeks easy!</li>
            <li>I am so excited that my nails will look good for two weeks</li>
            <li>All you need to get started is this set, a UV light (I love the Salon Edge Curing Light) and a great color</li>
            <li>The gelish system is definitely a good system, make sure to us 91% rubbing alcohol or gelish cleanser lightly after each cure under the light to remove the sticky residue!</li>
            <li>the Top coat once it gets on your cuticles make sure to wipe it completely off (best with nail polish remover) and apply it again.</li>
            <li>The polish worked fine and hardened to a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li>Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li>Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li>TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li>They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li>Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li>Most of my gel polishes are made by Harmony.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for my nails.  </li>
            <li>I love the Gelish Brand.</li>
            <li>Love my Gelish products.</li>
            <li>Love the glossyness of he color.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love</li>
            <li>I just love the product.</li>
            <li>I love doing this at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several gel products and the gelish brand is always the best.</li>
            <li>they look better than in a salon.</li>
            <li>I choose this product because I love gel polish.</li>
            <li>love this brand.</li>
            <li>Gelish foundation and top it off work well with all brands of UV gel polishes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These are the top two items on my manicure must have list.</li>
            <li>After some research I decided to grab this foundation and top it off to try an experiment.</li>
            <li>, I apply a layer of the foundation and cure it then a layer of top it off and cure it (make sure to get the tips of your nails).</li>
            <li>I love doing my nails and love the durability of gel nails.</li>
            <li>Would buy again :)</li>
            <li>Then I put on a layer of \\&quot;top it off\\&quot; and cure it.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes add another \\&quot;top it</li>
            <li>This is a product that I will use over and over again for sure.</li>
            <li>love the Gelish product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 3 years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>safe and safe shipping.  </li>
            <li>The brush for the top coat hardened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now able to do both hands at once before curing under the light!  </li>
            <li>I bought all the products I needed together and am glad I did?  </li>
            <li>and I am extrmely satisfied.</li>
            <li>life been in better shape, no breaking, chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li>ok so will see if the polish I put on top manages to stay put or whether the foundation will end up peeling.</li>
            <li>I do not see the point in spending more money for cnd shellac products.</li>
            <li>Many youtube videos, blog postings and beauty sites</li>
            <li>Gelish foundation and top it off work well with all brands of UV gel polish that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have not had this problem when I purchased the mini Top It Off from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>thank u :)</li>
            <li>so I have to make sure the bottle stays upright</li>
            <li>I love the gelish system.</li>
            <li>This works great and it really is a &amp;#34;Good Deal!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Better shine then Sallys.</li>
            <li>I still use the sensationail colors but with this bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li>I love it so if you think you want, YOU WANT IT</li>
            <li>The brushes are also much better on these bottles.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish products..</li>
            <li>I love Gelish products.</li>
            <li>MY NAILS ARE NOW HEALTHY AND</li>
            <li>But my top coat always chips from the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li>I am giving 2 stars because I love how it looks; just wish it lasted.</li>
            <li>I love Gelish</li>
            <li>Love the gelish products</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You get 2 Foundations and 2 Top coats all under the price of $10.00.</li>
            <li>Nice full size</li>
            <li>I would suggest that you use a very light color to start with until you are comfortable with doing this yourself.  </li>
            <li>Top coat gel was fine.</li>
            <li>The foundation adds strength to my nails and top it off gives a smooth, shiny finish that lasts up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to buy a UV dryer from amazon because the product must have UV light to cure.  </li>
            <li>Also better to do 2 Nails at the time and put them under the UV light. ~Claudia~</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, provides perfect results as expected.</li>
            <li>gelish products are the best, they apply smoothly and dry very quickly with my uv lamp.  </li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.      </li>
            <li>This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li>What is really great about using it this way is you can paint regular nail polish and designs over the top of it and remove it without removing the gel (since it is soak off).</li>
            <li>easily--</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quick..</li>
            <li>Easily peels off.</li>
            <li>I have ALWAYS had issues with nail breakage, nails peelings, and lack of strong growth.</li>
            <li>The bottles themselves are great, they&#x27;re actually rather large (salon size) which is good</li>
            <li>the results are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I love these full size bottles.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for the first time by doing my own no-chip mani at home.</li>
            <li>Okay so I love doing my nails at home instead of paying someone else to do them sooo much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Good price and fast ship on Full size bottles.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Gelish Nail products to anyone wishing to have long, strong, beautiful nails.    </li>
            <li>I love the fast shipping and the value of this product!!</li>
            <li>Great price and only waited for a couple of days to get it.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and buying the entire kit in pieces is WAY cheaper than buying it all together, because lets face</li>

            <li>Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.      </li>
            <li>For Shellac Gelish Nail Gel Polish Curing NailDryer Light Timer    </li>
            <li>[...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li>They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.      </li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>SO YOU HAVE TO USE A LIGHT HAND</li>
            <li>I used the foundation and the light</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bubble.</li>
            <li>I did my nails with this gel and cured under a uv light.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much moneys by doing my own gel nails.</li>
            <li>My nails look great and last even though I wash my hands often while at work.</li>
            <li>You have to of course use a light to seal the nails in between the coats.  </li>
            <li>I then just reapply regular nail polish over the Gelish which still looks great.  </li>
            <li>Overall great starter set</li>
            <li>just stay done and always looked fabulous and asked them about it</li>
            <li>Looks like you got them done at a nail salon even after two weeks look fantastic.</li>
            <li>Stays and stays until your ready to take it off and such a great price!</li>
            <li>Did I mention this was such a good buy?  :-)</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good deal to buy as a set, although the brush on the top coat was short and didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
            <li>First of all-- I don&#x27;t even know why I  didn&#x27;t try this product to begin with!!</li>
            <li>First time to use Gelish products, and I am sold!!  </li>
            <li>Super shine and strong nails.</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love my new nails:)</li>
            <li>the size is the big bottle size which is amazing!</li>
            <li>Products work fine and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>These two products are definitely worth the time and money!</li>
            <li>It seemed okay when I first opened it</li>
            <li>Just proceed with the next coat and after the final top coat, wipe with the alcohol pad and they will be shiny and perfect!</li>
            <li>Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li>Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li>Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li>this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy this set and a light, and my favorite colors.  </li>
            <li>Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.      </li>
            <li>Love the large bottles.</li>
            <li>Beautiful shine on nails if dabbed with pure rubbing alcohol when finished hardening last coat (as per instructions).</li>
            <li>Was super excited to get these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i purchased these and found that gelish works just fine with the new light!</li>
            <li>I am very careful to not get near my cuticles at all (which is easy because it is clear--if it isn&#x27;t perfectly even, it doesn&#x27;t matter).  </li>
            <li>but no, nice full size bottles of the best quality nail gels made.</li>
            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the full size.  </li>
            <li>I get a professional finish doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>Love the size and shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>This was such a good find online.  </li>
            <li>These are full size products and work well for a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>cant beat it for the full sizes</li>
            <li>I opened my package and the bottles were full sized bottles.</li>
            <li>I was more than ready to try this out.</li>
            <li>I really think this stuff works better than the gel polish stuff at walmart.</li>
            <li>The listing is true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast and so far I am loving the results!</li>
            <li>later I decided to take the plunge and go with the gelish brand as that seemed quite popular, layperson friendly and polishes were readily available at Sally&#x27;s, where I have a discount card</li>
            <li>I use a high end led lamp to cure, I cap the free edge, I keep all coats nice and light, and yet 2 to 4 days later the top coat is chipping.</li>
            <li>Super easy at home for salon look;)</li>
            <li>My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li>I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li>The top coat was thinner and had a longer brush, more like the ones I&#x27;m used to with regular polish.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Hard, beautiful nails, unlimited color choices, easy application.    </li>
            <li>First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li>You can even do things that you normally wouldn&#x27;t be able to after a manicure.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product, I do my nails about every 2-3 weeks, yes, it lasts that long on me.  </li>
            <li>My nails are super flimsy, so I can still only get a week tops out of a gel, but its better than a day!  </li>
            <li>Same polish as you get from the store but a much better price!</li>
            <li>Perfect Base and top coat for any Nail Light LED user!</li>
            <li>There is no color dot on the outside of the bottle which would be a nice improvement.</li>
            <li>I know many have done what is called a \\&quot;Gelish sandwich\\&quot;, using regular polish between the \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; and \\&quot;top it off\\&quot;, but to me, this only allows you more colors, it doesn&#x27;t simplify your life like my system does.  </li>
            <li>but so far love them.</li>
            <li>and I think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My time is worth quite a bit to me</li>
            <li>totally worth the price...</li>
            <li>They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Order processing &amp; shipping time were super fast!</li>
            <li>is just right</li>
            <li>YOU ARE RIGHT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is a counterfeit set, if it&#x27;s an old formula, or if it is just that geisha isn&#x27;t as wonderful as I heard.</li>
            <li>The polish was very close to the color pictured and seems to be a good quality (meaning it stays on a long time).  </li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li>I love the long lasting polish and this stuff makes it last and shine great product easy to use will buy again</li>
            <li>You will see that the gel seems gooey, after putting it in the light, but that is normal.</li>
            <li>While it costs substantially more than regular nail polish initially, it&#x27;s super quick and lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li>I received my order a week earlier then expected which was very good.</li>
            <li>The IBD doesn&#x27;t seem to have this problem, just the gelish polishes, so I hope that they soon remedy this and find a new lid to fit the bottle.</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOUR NAILS MORE STIFF AND DURABLE</li>
            <li>I am excited to start experimenting with my new Gelish polish.</li>
            <li>I bought a good UV light and the Harmony Gelish top and bottom coat, along with a few other colors.</li>
            <li>i was previously using CND brand polishes with a UV light, but when my light died and i went to purchase a new one, and i went with an LED light instead and realized my CND polishes weren&#x27;t curing!</li>
            <li>it will last better.  </li>
            <li>Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li>I will use ONLY Harmony Gelish Foundation &amp; Top coat.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this set of 2 along with the 54 watt royal nail professional uv light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the products, but my bottle of Foundation was busted open and leaked all over the inside of the package, I was able to salvage 1/4 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I HAD SOME FIRST MISTAKES</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t last more than 4- 5 days.</li>
            <li>ver py much!</li>
            <li>Works great cures the base one minute with my uv dryer and top two minutes and love my gel nails.</li>
            <li>and they told me they had gel manicures, which last 2 weeks or more and don&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>I got my first gel nail manicure at a nail salon about 5 weeks ago</li>
            <li>The only problem I had is that the Top</li>
            <li>The top it off was spilled out from the top, not sure if it was smashed or was in the heat, I havnt used it yet</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I thought I was doing pretty well with the polish</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>One thing to note: you do not need to wipe with an alcohol pad between coats, only at the end after the top coat.</li>
            <li>Thank you and I will definitely be placing more orders with your company;).</li>
            <li>I love gel manicures since I always chip regular polish within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>and I can finally see them grow!!! :)</li>
            <li>I did my first Gelish nails and used the USpicy.</li>
            <li>I used the Gelish foundation, my regular nail polish, then the Gelish top coat.</li>
            <li>They are shorter and flat and provide for better precision.  </li>
            <li>Well I am now the proud owner of ten strong nails that are long enough</li>
            <li>This was the best buy I found for the base and top coats.</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat and base coat for gel nails.</li>
            <li>For me the Gelish from Harmony base and top coat is the best.  </li>
            <li>Harmony Gelish Top &amp; Base Coat - really is a great deal!</li>
            <li>I bought both of these polishes together as a set, the base and top coat, and they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;regular\\&quot; manicure lasts twice as long as when I didn&#x27;t have the Gelish bast and top coat.  </li>
            <li>The shine lasts for more than a month, even if I take long to change my polish, the shine lasts and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>Love the Gelish polishes and this is a good value for the base and top set.  </li>
            <li>I love all Gelish products for my Shellac, its easy and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li>let that dry pur on the top coat and baked it according to directions</li>
            <li>Using 50% alcohol/ Water mixture instead of pure rubbing alcohol resulted in matt finish without shine.</li>
            <li>They are the large bottles but one of the labels says &#x27;mini&#x27; even though it is not one of the minis....</li>
            <li>I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>When I want to change the color or it chips, I just use non acetone remover to remove the regular polish and the Gelish stays untouched, shiny and fine.  </li>
            <li>how many hours you let it dry!</li>
            <li>I heeded a lot of the cost saving advice by investing in the red carpet LED light (got it at Harmon w/20% BB&amp;B coupon), got pure acetone, 91% alcohol which I already had on hand</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li>Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s really on.</li>
            <li>The product seems smoother and cleaner and I received both in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>The OPI chips and flakes off where this stays until I am ready to remove</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Just be sure to inspect your products carefully before you use it, in case you have to return it or exchange it.</li>
            <li>is so much betther.</li>
            <li>Harmony&#x27; on the side of the bottle (this is how you know its the real stuff.)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>the 2 pack really saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li>it stays on until you are ready to</li>
            <li>I´ve always wore them very short,&lt;br /&gt;now,  after using this product,  I´ve</li>
            <li>and it lasts so much longer then</li>
            <li>If you apply correctly this really does stay on until you take it off.</li>
            <li>The product does not appear to be real.</li>
            <li>The gelish polish works very well and stays on for quite a while.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my clients at my salon very often.</li>
            <li>Perfect for UV Gel nails and only a thin coat needed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li>The brush on the foundation is super short and the top coat brush length is really long.</li>
            <li>not thick and sticky and on the foundation there is a easy control short brush.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than other soak off gel products.  </li>
            <li>YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS EASY TO APPLY AND LASTS A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li>I then just use regular nail polish as usual--two standard polish color layers directly on the Gelish layers and your favorite regular top coat.  </li>
            <li>First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li>Ok, I love the gelish foundation and top coats, but I do hate the lid.</li>
            <li>I might use different brands of color, but I always start with Gelish base &amp; end with Gelish top, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>I still end up with issues of a week or less in between having to redo the nails, but it is better and cheaper than having to make appointments to have my nails done.</li>
            <li>Great top and base coat.</li>
            <li>then I used my favorite Christian Dior red.</li>
            <li>If you get a chip, you can quickly fix that one nail as you would with a regular manicure.    </li>
            <li>The Harmony Gelish product is much thinner in consistency and makes it much easier to achieve a professional look.  </li>
            <li>with a steady hand they came out</li>
            <li>great price for base and top coat. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend it both to beginners and professionals.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li>High quality item, like it a lot</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand</li>
            <li>I highly would recommend</li>
            <li>highly recommend this and all gelish products.</li>
            <li>If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li>so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.    </li>
            <li>with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.      </li>
            <li>Yes, you will have to wait for your polish to dry, but you will only have to remove the Gelish layer every 3-4 weeks and that isSO much better for your nails.  </li>
            <li>They do everything they should be and the only thing worth noting is that if you are doing your own nails at home, make sure you only use very thin layers of each polish, especially the top coat as it tends to be a little runnier and will run all over the sides of your fingers if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Worked extremely well with Gelish 18G LED light.</li>
            <li>I have found that they need to be cured under the uv light (mine is 34w) for longer than other brands though.</li>
            <li>I used a lint free wipe and 90% alcohol to substitute the other junk you don&#x27;t need to buy-</li>
            <li>New    </li>
            <li>Once they grow out it does peel a bit but still such a huge improvement over regular polish.</li>
            <li>Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>I have tried the mini versions of Gelish and they dry out quickly</li>
            <li>The base coat and top coat are both good products.  </li>
            <li>The gel itself is very high quality and the foundation small brush size makes for an easy application.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for home use and professional use.</li>
            <li>The outcome is a very professional look.</li>
            <li>So I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li>Everything from shipping to the actual nail polish product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li>Used them for the first time last night!</li>
            <li>I recently bought a Sensationail nail kit and saw some recommendations about the base &amp; top coat not being so great, so I tried these.  </li>
            <li>Regular polish barely lasted me a whole day, let alone a whole week!</li>
            <li>The bottles are big and they seem to cover better and stay on longer than other brands.</li>
            <li>Very thin and have to put on extra layers to get the full effect of the color, but lasts so long and looks great until the nail growth causes me to take it off and do a new color.</li>
            <li>The foundation is wonderful but for some reason the top it off has chunks in it and the brush is hard as a rock :(</li>
            <li>This Gelish Nail Polish Top and Base coat works fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li>love the short little brush on the foundation.....</li>
            <li>I wipe off the top coat with an alcohol wipe, and now have hard, clear,  shiny nails.  </li>
            <li>Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li>flick off old polish from</li>
            <li>Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.      </li>
            <li>I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li>Maybe they were trying to refill an old bottle?</li>
            <li>Because the Gelish portion of the manicure is perfectly clear, you can&#x27;t see it \\&quot;growing out\\&quot;, so you don&#x27;t have to remove it anywhere near as often as when you use the Gelish color.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use at least 91% alcohol to remove the sticky after you come out of the uv light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Salon results that will save you thousands on going to a professional.  </li>
            <li>, I file and directly soak my nails in acetone instead of wrapping in foil as the instructions say.  </li>
            <li>When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li>works just as good as stuff twice as expensive</li>
            <li>this set is even more that I expect ,I though the size will be the small , but nope!</li>
            <li>Not a tight seal.</li>
            <li>and I use my nails as tools, so I&#x27;m not careful at all with my nails and this stuff lasts, hardens and protects my natural nail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used cheap nail polish in the past that chips off in two days.  </li>
            <li>This polish holds for a long time unless you use hot water on your hands a lot like I do, Should last almost a week or over a week.</li>
            <li>These 2 are my favorite base and top coat.</li>
            <li>Top coat has the long bristles and foundation has the little short brush.</li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li>It stays closed enough where I wouldn&#x27;t bother asking for a refund, but it&#x27;s bothersome in the sense that I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave it unattended on its side, and I have to check periodically to make sure that it&#x27;s closed enough to stay shut.</li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li>Because it is clear, applying it is a piece of cake and if you make a mistake with the regular nail polish, you just remove it with non acetone polish and redo.  </li>
            <li>*Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li>my old bottle label is different from this.</li>
            <li>MUCH CHEAPER THAN ACRYICS AND ALOT LESS DAMAGE TO NATURAL NAILS.</li>
            <li>the key to making it look less bulky and more natural is to use as little of it as possible.</li>
            <li>So, I now only use the Gelish base (foundation)  and top coat (top it off)  with regular nail polish</li>
            <li>Does not dry no matter</li>
            <li>The foundation adds strength to my otherwise thin and weak nails and top it off gives a smooth shiny finish that lasts up to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>my life my nails have been weak,  brittle and broke easily,  so</li>
            <li>I find a hard time finding gelish full size for cheaper).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be proficient the first time, because it takes a few attempts to learn the technique.  </li>
            <li>I have the light and only needed the base and top coat.</li>
            <li>Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li>thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li>One thing I learned on my own was to curve the fingers down when applying, so gravity helps you keep the product thin.  </li>
            <li>So naturally it was my first choice when looking to get a gel base and top coat.</li>
            <li>these two bottles were less than what the whole kit with smaller bottles cost at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>(Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the brush on the foundation is about half the length of the top coat bottle brush.  </li>
            <li>I ran through the little bottles so fast.  </li>

            <li> goes on easy and work great with any gel product</li>
            <li> Perfect, large size for the gellish system.  </li>
            <li> Works great with LED light.</li>
            <li> They work great in my ORLY LED light.</li>
            <li> That was an amazing feat in itself.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.      </li>
            <li> Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li> so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li> Saves me tons of money, and if it gets messed up I just fix it on my own time.</li>
            <li> the foundation is thicker and has a shorter brush which is nice.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to go to the nail salon to get nice gel nails.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gelish for a great product!</li>
            <li> I knew i liked this brand before I bought it because my bestfriend uses and and I wanted to own it myself.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and at a very good price - works great with LED light.</li>
            <li> It a great price for the full size.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  </li>
            <li> It was such a good price and the service was great !</li>
            <li> The price was great for the product and everything shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This company was great, got it quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish brand it is excellent quality for a decent price</li>
            <li> I USE IT WITH ALL MY GEL BRANDS AND NICE QUALITY MIRROR FINISH, THE TOP COAT IS A BIT RUNNY</li>
            <li> The top coat leaves a nice glossy layer.</li>
            <li> I do my own manicures with them and the polish lasts for a week or more.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to help your nails grow if they are pealing or just not growing, worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal on a product I love</li>
            <li> Lasts for two weeks easy!</li>
            <li> I am so excited that my nails will look good for two weeks</li>
            <li> All you need to get started is this set, a UV light (I love the Salon Edge Curing Light) and a great color</li>
            <li> The gelish system is definitely a good system, make sure to us 91% rubbing alcohol or gelish cleanser lightly after each cure under the light to remove the sticky residue!</li>
            <li> the Top coat once it gets on your cuticles make sure to wipe it completely off (best with nail polish remover) and apply it again.</li>
            <li> The polish worked fine and hardened to a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li> Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li> Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li> TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li> They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li> Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li> Most of my gel polishes are made by Harmony.  </li>
            <li> Love this product for my nails.  </li>
            <li> I love the Gelish Brand.</li>
            <li> Love my Gelish products.</li>
            <li> Love the glossyness of he color.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love</li>
            <li> I just love the product.</li>
            <li> I love doing this at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several gel products and the gelish brand is always the best.</li>
            <li> they look better than in a salon.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because I love gel polish.</li>
            <li> love this brand.</li>
            <li> Gelish foundation and top it off work well with all brands of UV gel polishes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These are the top two items on my manicure must have list.</li>
            <li> After some research I decided to grab this foundation and top it off to try an experiment.</li>
            <li> , I apply a layer of the foundation and cure it then a layer of top it off and cure it (make sure to get the tips of your nails).</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and love the durability of gel nails.</li>
            <li> Would buy again :)</li>
            <li> Then I put on a layer of \\&quot;top it off\\&quot; and cure it.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes add another \\&quot;top it</li>
            <li> This is a product that I will use over and over again for sure.</li>
            <li> love the Gelish product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> safe and safe shipping.  </li>
            <li> The brush for the top coat hardened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now able to do both hands at once before curing under the light!  </li>
            <li> I bought all the products I needed together and am glad I did?  </li>
            <li> and I am extrmely satisfied.</li>
            <li> life been in better shape, no breaking, chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> ok so will see if the polish I put on top manages to stay put or whether the foundation will end up peeling.</li>
            <li> I do not see the point in spending more money for cnd shellac products.</li>
            <li> Many youtube videos, blog postings and beauty sites</li>
            <li> Gelish foundation and top it off work well with all brands of UV gel polish that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have not had this problem when I purchased the mini Top It Off from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> thank u :)</li>
            <li> so I have to make sure the bottle stays upright</li>
            <li> I love the gelish system.</li>
            <li> This works great and it really is a &amp;#34;Good Deal!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Better shine then Sallys.</li>
            <li> I still use the sensationail colors but with this bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li> I love it so if you think you want, YOU WANT IT</li>
            <li> The brushes are also much better on these bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish products..</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS ARE NOW HEALTHY AND</li>
            <li> But my top coat always chips from the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li> I am giving 2 stars because I love how it looks; just wish it lasted.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish</li>

            <li> I would suggest that you use a very light color to start with until you are comfortable with doing this yourself.  </li>
            <li> Top coat gel was fine.</li>
            <li> The foundation adds strength to my nails and top it off gives a smooth, shiny finish that lasts up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to buy a UV dryer from amazon because the product must have UV light to cure.  </li>
            <li> Also better to do 2 Nails at the time and put them under the UV light. ~Claudia~</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, provides perfect results as expected.</li>
            <li> gelish products are the best, they apply smoothly and dry very quickly with my uv lamp.  </li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.      </li>
            <li> This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li> What is really great about using it this way is you can paint regular nail polish and designs over the top of it and remove it without removing the gel (since it is soak off).</li>
            <li> easily--</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> It was shipped very quick..</li>
            <li> Easily peels off.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had issues with nail breakage, nails peelings, and lack of strong growth.</li>
            <li> The bottles themselves are great, they&#x27;re actually rather large (salon size) which is good</li>
            <li> the results are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I love these full size bottles.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for the first time by doing my own no-chip mani at home.</li>
            <li> Okay so I love doing my nails at home instead of paying someone else to do them sooo much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Good price and fast ship on Full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Gelish Nail products to anyone wishing to have long, strong, beautiful nails.    </li>
            <li> I love the fast shipping and the value of this product!!</li>
            <li> Great price and only waited for a couple of days to get it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and buying the entire kit in pieces is WAY cheaper than buying it all together, because lets face</li>
            <li> Great deal to get both at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li> Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.      </li>
            <li> For Shellac Gelish Nail Gel Polish Curing NailDryer Light Timer    </li>
            <li> [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li> They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.      </li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> SO YOU HAVE TO USE A LIGHT HAND</li>
            <li> I used the foundation and the light</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bubble.</li>
            <li> I did my nails with this gel and cured under a uv light.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much moneys by doing my own gel nails.</li>
            <li> My nails look great and last even though I wash my hands often while at work.</li>
            <li> You have to of course use a light to seal the nails in between the coats.  </li>
            <li> I then just reapply regular nail polish over the Gelish which still looks great.  </li>
            <li> Overall great starter set</li>
            <li> just stay done and always looked fabulous and asked them about it</li>
            <li> Looks like you got them done at a nail salon even after two weeks look fantastic.</li>
            <li> Stays and stays until your ready to take it off and such a great price!</li>
            <li> Did I mention this was such a good buy?  :-)</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good deal to buy as a set, although the brush on the top coat was short and didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
            <li> First of all-- I don&#x27;t even know why I  didn&#x27;t try this product to begin with!!</li>
            <li> First time to use Gelish products, and I am sold!!  </li>
            <li> Super shine and strong nails.</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love my new nails:)</li>
            <li> the size is the big bottle size which is amazing!</li>
            <li> Products work fine and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> These two products are definitely worth the time and money!</li>
            <li> It seemed okay when I first opened it</li>
            <li> Just proceed with the next coat and after the final top coat, wipe with the alcohol pad and they will be shiny and perfect!</li>
            <li> Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li> Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li> Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy this set and a light, and my favorite colors.  </li>
            <li> Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.      </li>
            <li> Love the large bottles.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shine on nails if dabbed with pure rubbing alcohol when finished hardening last coat (as per instructions).</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i purchased these and found that gelish works just fine with the new light!</li>
            <li> I am very careful to not get near my cuticles at all (which is easy because it is clear--if it isn&#x27;t perfectly even, it doesn&#x27;t matter).  </li>
            <li> but no, nice full size bottles of the best quality nail gels made.</li>
            <li> This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the full size.  </li>
            <li> I get a professional finish doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> Love the size and shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> This was such a good find online.  </li>
            <li> These are full size products and work well for a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> cant beat it for the full sizes</li>
            <li> I opened my package and the bottles were full sized bottles.</li>
            <li> I was more than ready to try this out.</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff works better than the gel polish stuff at walmart.</li>
            <li> The listing is true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast and so far I am loving the results!</li>
            <li> later I decided to take the plunge and go with the gelish brand as that seemed quite popular, layperson friendly and polishes were readily available at Sally&#x27;s, where I have a discount card</li>
            <li> I use a high end led lamp to cure, I cap the free edge, I keep all coats nice and light, and yet 2 to 4 days later the top coat is chipping.</li>
            <li> Super easy at home for salon look;)</li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li> I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li> The top coat was thinner and had a longer brush, more like the ones I&#x27;m used to with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Hard, beautiful nails, unlimited color choices, easy application.    </li>
            <li> First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li> You can even do things that you normally wouldn&#x27;t be able to after a manicure.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, I do my nails about every 2-3 weeks, yes, it lasts that long on me.  </li>
            <li> My nails are super flimsy, so I can still only get a week tops out of a gel, but its better than a day!  </li>
            <li> Same polish as you get from the store but a much better price!</li>
            <li> Perfect Base and top coat for any Nail Light LED user!</li>
            <li> There is no color dot on the outside of the bottle which would be a nice improvement.</li>
            <li> I know many have done what is called a \\&quot;Gelish sandwich\\&quot;, using regular polish between the \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; and \\&quot;top it off\\&quot;, but to me, this only allows you more colors, it doesn&#x27;t simplify your life like my system does.  </li>
            <li> but so far love them.</li>
            <li> and I think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My time is worth quite a bit to me</li>
            <li> totally worth the price...</li>
            <li> They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Order processing &amp; shipping time were super fast!</li>
            <li> is just right</li>
            <li> YOU ARE RIGHT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a counterfeit set, if it&#x27;s an old formula, or if it is just that geisha isn&#x27;t as wonderful as I heard.</li>
            <li> The polish was very close to the color pictured and seems to be a good quality (meaning it stays on a long time).  </li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li> I love the long lasting polish and this stuff makes it last and shine great product easy to use will buy again</li>
            <li> You will see that the gel seems gooey, after putting it in the light, but that is normal.</li>
            <li> While it costs substantially more than regular nail polish initially, it&#x27;s super quick and lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li> I received my order a week earlier then expected which was very good.</li>
            <li> The IBD doesn&#x27;t seem to have this problem, just the gelish polishes, so I hope that they soon remedy this and find a new lid to fit the bottle.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOUR NAILS MORE STIFF AND DURABLE</li>
            <li> I am excited to start experimenting with my new Gelish polish.</li>
            <li> I bought a good UV light and the Harmony Gelish top and bottom coat, along with a few other colors.</li>
            <li> i was previously using CND brand polishes with a UV light, but when my light died and i went to purchase a new one, and i went with an LED light instead and realized my CND polishes weren&#x27;t curing!</li>
            <li> it will last better.  </li>
            <li> Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li> I will use ONLY Harmony Gelish Foundation &amp; Top coat.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this set of 2 along with the 54 watt royal nail professional uv light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the products, but my bottle of Foundation was busted open and leaked all over the inside of the package, I was able to salvage 1/4 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I HAD SOME FIRST MISTAKES</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last more than 4- 5 days.</li>
            <li> ver py much!</li>
            <li> Works great cures the base one minute with my uv dryer and top two minutes and love my gel nails.</li>
            <li> and they told me they had gel manicures, which last 2 weeks or more and don&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> I got my first gel nail manicure at a nail salon about 5 weeks ago</li>
            <li> The only problem I had is that the Top</li>
            <li> The top it off was spilled out from the top, not sure if it was smashed or was in the heat, I havnt used it yet</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I thought I was doing pretty well with the polish</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> One thing to note: you do not need to wipe with an alcohol pad between coats, only at the end after the top coat.</li>
            <li> Thank you and I will definitely be placing more orders with your company;).</li>
            <li> I love gel manicures since I always chip regular polish within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> and I can finally see them grow!!! :)</li>
            <li> I did my first Gelish nails and used the USpicy.</li>
            <li> I used the Gelish foundation, my regular nail polish, then the Gelish top coat.</li>
            <li> They are shorter and flat and provide for better precision.  </li>
            <li> Well I am now the proud owner of ten strong nails that are long enough</li>
            <li> This was the best buy I found for the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat and base coat for gel nails.</li>
            <li> For me the Gelish from Harmony base and top coat is the best.  </li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish Top &amp; Base Coat - really is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I bought both of these polishes together as a set, the base and top coat, and they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;regular\\&quot; manicure lasts twice as long as when I didn&#x27;t have the Gelish bast and top coat.  </li>
            <li> The shine lasts for more than a month, even if I take long to change my polish, the shine lasts and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish polishes and this is a good value for the base and top set.  </li>
            <li> I love all Gelish products for my Shellac, its easy and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li> let that dry pur on the top coat and baked it according to directions</li>
            <li> Using 50% alcohol/ Water mixture instead of pure rubbing alcohol resulted in matt finish without shine.</li>
            <li> They are the large bottles but one of the labels says &#x27;mini&#x27; even though it is not one of the minis....</li>
            <li> I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> When I want to change the color or it chips, I just use non acetone remover to remove the regular polish and the Gelish stays untouched, shiny and fine.  </li>
            <li> how many hours you let it dry!</li>
            <li> I heeded a lot of the cost saving advice by investing in the red carpet LED light (got it at Harmon w/20% BB&amp;B coupon), got pure acetone, 91% alcohol which I already had on hand</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li> Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s really on.</li>
            <li> The product seems smoother and cleaner and I received both in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> The OPI chips and flakes off where this stays until I am ready to remove</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Just be sure to inspect your products carefully before you use it, in case you have to return it or exchange it.</li>
            <li> is so much betther.</li>
            <li> Harmony&#x27; on the side of the bottle (this is how you know its the real stuff.)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> the 2 pack really saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li> it stays on until you are ready to</li>
            <li> I´ve always wore them very short,&lt;br /&gt;now,  after using this product,  I´ve</li>
            <li> and it lasts so much longer then</li>
            <li> If you apply correctly this really does stay on until you take it off.</li>
            <li> The product does not appear to be real.</li>
            <li> The gelish polish works very well and stays on for quite a while.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my clients at my salon very often.</li>
            <li> Perfect for UV Gel nails and only a thin coat needed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li> The brush on the foundation is super short and the top coat brush length is really long.</li>
            <li> not thick and sticky and on the foundation there is a easy control short brush.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than other soak off gel products.  </li>
            <li> YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS EASY TO APPLY AND LASTS A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li> I then just use regular nail polish as usual--two standard polish color layers directly on the Gelish layers and your favorite regular top coat.  </li>
            <li> First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li> Ok, I love the gelish foundation and top coats, but I do hate the lid.</li>
            <li> I might use different brands of color, but I always start with Gelish base &amp; end with Gelish top, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I still end up with issues of a week or less in between having to redo the nails, but it is better and cheaper than having to make appointments to have my nails done.</li>
            <li> Great top and base coat.</li>
            <li> then I used my favorite Christian Dior red.</li>
            <li> If you get a chip, you can quickly fix that one nail as you would with a regular manicure.    </li>
            <li> The Harmony Gelish product is much thinner in consistency and makes it much easier to achieve a professional look.  </li>
            <li> with a steady hand they came out</li>
            <li> great price for base and top coat. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend it both to beginners and professionals.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li> High quality item, like it a lot</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand</li>
            <li> I highly would recommend</li>
            <li> highly recommend this and all gelish products.</li>
            <li> If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li> so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.    </li>
            <li> with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.      </li>
            <li> Yes, you will have to wait for your polish to dry, but you will only have to remove the Gelish layer every 3-4 weeks and that isSO much better for your nails.  </li>
            <li> They do everything they should be and the only thing worth noting is that if you are doing your own nails at home, make sure you only use very thin layers of each polish, especially the top coat as it tends to be a little runnier and will run all over the sides of your fingers if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well with Gelish 18G LED light.</li>
            <li> I have found that they need to be cured under the uv light (mine is 34w) for longer than other brands though.</li>
            <li> I used a lint free wipe and 90% alcohol to substitute the other junk you don&#x27;t need to buy-</li>
            <li> New    </li>
            <li> Once they grow out it does peel a bit but still such a huge improvement over regular polish.</li>
            <li> Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> I have tried the mini versions of Gelish and they dry out quickly</li>
            <li> The base coat and top coat are both good products.  </li>
            <li> The gel itself is very high quality and the foundation small brush size makes for an easy application.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for home use and professional use.</li>
            <li> The outcome is a very professional look.</li>
            <li> So I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li> Everything from shipping to the actual nail polish product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li> Used them for the first time last night!</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Sensationail nail kit and saw some recommendations about the base &amp; top coat not being so great, so I tried these.  </li>
            <li> Regular polish barely lasted me a whole day, let alone a whole week!</li>
            <li> The bottles are big and they seem to cover better and stay on longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> Very thin and have to put on extra layers to get the full effect of the color, but lasts so long and looks great until the nail growth causes me to take it off and do a new color.</li>
            <li> The foundation is wonderful but for some reason the top it off has chunks in it and the brush is hard as a rock :(</li>
            <li> This Gelish Nail Polish Top and Base coat works fantastic!!  </li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li> love the short little brush on the foundation.....</li>
            <li> I wipe off the top coat with an alcohol wipe, and now have hard, clear,  shiny nails.  </li>
            <li> Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li> flick off old polish from</li>
            <li> Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.      </li>
            <li> I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Maybe they were trying to refill an old bottle?</li>
            <li> Because the Gelish portion of the manicure is perfectly clear, you can&#x27;t see it \\&quot;growing out\\&quot;, so you don&#x27;t have to remove it anywhere near as often as when you use the Gelish color.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use at least 91% alcohol to remove the sticky after you come out of the uv light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Salon results that will save you thousands on going to a professional.  </li>
            <li> , I file and directly soak my nails in acetone instead of wrapping in foil as the instructions say.  </li>
            <li> When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li> works just as good as stuff twice as expensive</li>
            <li> this set is even more that I expect ,I though the size will be the small , but nope!</li>
            <li> Not a tight seal.</li>
            <li> and I use my nails as tools, so I&#x27;m not careful at all with my nails and this stuff lasts, hardens and protects my natural nail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used cheap nail polish in the past that chips off in two days.  </li>
            <li> This polish holds for a long time unless you use hot water on your hands a lot like I do, Should last almost a week or over a week.</li>
            <li> These 2 are my favorite base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Top coat has the long bristles and foundation has the little short brush.</li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li> It stays closed enough where I wouldn&#x27;t bother asking for a refund, but it&#x27;s bothersome in the sense that I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave it unattended on its side, and I have to check periodically to make sure that it&#x27;s closed enough to stay shut.</li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li> Because it is clear, applying it is a piece of cake and if you make a mistake with the regular nail polish, you just remove it with non acetone polish and redo.  </li>
            <li> *Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> my old bottle label is different from this.</li>
            <li> MUCH CHEAPER THAN ACRYICS AND ALOT LESS DAMAGE TO NATURAL NAILS.</li>
            <li> the key to making it look less bulky and more natural is to use as little of it as possible.</li>
            <li> So, I now only use the Gelish base (foundation)  and top coat (top it off)  with regular nail polish</li>
            <li> Does not dry no matter</li>
            <li> The foundation adds strength to my otherwise thin and weak nails and top it off gives a smooth shiny finish that lasts up to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> my life my nails have been weak,  brittle and broke easily,  so</li>
            <li> I find a hard time finding gelish full size for cheaper).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to be proficient the first time, because it takes a few attempts to learn the technique.  </li>
            <li> I have the light and only needed the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li> thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li> One thing I learned on my own was to curve the fingers down when applying, so gravity helps you keep the product thin.  </li>
            <li> So naturally it was my first choice when looking to get a gel base and top coat.</li>
            <li> these two bottles were less than what the whole kit with smaller bottles cost at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush on the foundation is about half the length of the top coat bottle brush.  </li>
            <li> I ran through the little bottles so fast.  </li>
            <li> It took some practice getting the layers as thin as your supposed to to do the mani/pedi properly, but its worth it!  </li>
            <li> the base and top coat are all you need!!</li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.</li>
            <li> I think the slight stickiness was mostly due to the fact that it was my first time using gel.</li>
            <li> It is not a huge deal, but kind of annoying that there is a little sticky ring of polish at the top the bottle.</li>
            <li> It seemed a bit tacky and dull at first, but this stopped after washing my hands.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and durable for my nails.  </li>
            <li> I have used the gelish for a long time, always getting it from my local beauty supply.  </li>
            <li> if it has a thick coat it will look funny when the nail starts to grow.</li>
            <li> Besides, what&#x27;s more irritating than spending two hours waiting for your polish to dry only to knock a nail and mess it up, or have it peel off after a day or so?</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, packaging was good but the foundation base gel was very thick and gloopy/stringy as though it was old or had been opened some time back.</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.</li>
            <li> Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula</li>
            <li> They are a thick coat, so if your nails are thin, it is nice to get that support because it makes your nails stronger and longer time in between manicures.  </li>
            <li> I wish all the polishes had it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to last a long time!!</li>
            <li> The bottles are bigger than expected and last a long time!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more expensive and smaller bottle so less product.</li>
            <li> it really makes my nails hard</li>
            <li> when I heard how long gel nails lasted ..</li>
            <li> I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color</li>
            <li> See, my nails don&#x27;t stay long and are always breaking.</li>
            <li> I thought one day \\&quot;why not just make my nails harder and then use regular polish\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m on the computer all day long.      </li>
            <li> It costs about $150 to get started but you will save time and money in the long run by doing your manicures at home.</li>
            <li> This base and top coat helps any polish last far longer.....</li>
            <li> I do not like how the nail polish is runny, I like to do white tips on my nails, and I cannot get the white to not run down the sides of the nail.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Gelish starter kit originally and used it for a long time until the top and base coat became too thick</li>
            <li> these are the only two products I use other the gelish color.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> this is a DRY cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Gelish applications will be sticky after drying but after the alcohol wipe they will be dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, both more and less expensive and none of the others come close to working as well.</li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.</li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.</li>
            <li> Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  </li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!    </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to deal with any dry time!</li>
            <li> Eight minutes to dry my nails (four fingers, four fingers, thumb separate)!  </li>
            <li> Just the foundation was $25 at the local beauty supply shop, I got both here for less than that.  </li>
            <li> the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)   </li>
            <li> (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.     </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need for a normal length brush because you only need a really thin layer of it.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars &amp; not five, is one of the bottles had leaked a small amount... Not a big deal...</li>

            <li> I was very surprised to receive the Gelish Top and Base Coat so quickly and was shocked at the larger size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a main problem with the larger bottles&#x27; formulation or if the particular one I received was from a bad batch.</li>
            <li> The only issue that I have with both of these is that the bottles don&#x27;t stay closed tightly.</li>
            <li> Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  </li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand, flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go.</li>
            <li> A little over four weeks ago my friend starting using this product on my nails.</li>
            <li> Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Rough up nails</li>
            <li> I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet ..</li>
            <li> just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li> I immediately started using the product and the results were everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> Where as the &#x27;Harmony Gelish top and base&#x27; last for the 14 days.</li>
            <li> The only base and top gel polish to go with.</li>
            <li> Same top coat and base coat for Gelish polish that you see in the Salons.</li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to achieve a nice thin coat.  </li>
            <li> Now we only use Gelish top and base.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have time to wait for nail polish to dry, so my nails have looked pretty sad for years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do need to put this on in very thin coats for sure, I&#x27;ve burned myself by accident using a thick coat of this.</li>
            <li> Other than that everything was as I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried the CND products the first time and found them to be too thick and hard to work with</li>
            <li> then going over with rubbing alcohol to dry them out before base coat, and ending with more rubbing alcohol to cleanse when finished.</li>
            <li> With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  </li>
            <li> [...]    TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any of the other Gelish bottles.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and you cannot beat this price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands</li>
            <li> Used them once, now th tops dont stay closed!</li>
            <li> had I not received a bottle that had (what looked like) a small spill on the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brand</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the tiny bottles these usually come in</li>
            <li> so I decided to try some other brands.  </li>
            <li> I had remembered about hearing about gel manis in the past but had also heard about potential health hazards associated with the process.</li>
            <li> with the pad slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails</li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even bother to get manicures as by day 2 or 3 they are already chipping and the sight of chipped nails looks far worse to me than naked unpolished nails.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other top and base coat</li>
            <li> I have used other brand names of the Gel/Shellac polish Top and Base coat and they didnt stick to my nails</li>
            <li> but it is hard to know what the color of the polish is when you are choosing it from among several.</li>
            <li> like, it&#x27;s hard to tighten it enough to close fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did usually run it a little longer than the product recommended, but only because I was paranoid about it curing correctly.</li>
            <li> For some reason, when I try to twist it closed, it slightly turns so that it isn&#x27;t as tight as it should be.</li>
            <li> I like the top and base coat by Gelish.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want big thick coats cause</li>
            <li> Top and Base liquid works well though.</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand of base and top coats carried by a beauty supply store and the Harmony Gelish brand</li>
            <li> So far not happy.</li>
            <li> I received &#x27; Gelish top and base coat&#x27; Which I already have</li>
            <li> You can buy color gel products at Walmart &amp; Walgreens and they work well with Harmony Gelish base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this top and base coat.</li>
            <li> :B006FRS9O6 Harmony Gelish Top and Base \\&quot;Set of 2\\</li>
            <li> EVERY TWO WEEKS, WHICH I BELIEVE TAKES A THIN LAYER OF NATURAL NAIL REMAINING ....</li>
            <li> SINCE I ALWAYS MAKE THE POLISH VERY THIN WHEN IT IS APPLIED, YOU DO NOT HAVE MUCH OF A RIDGE TO FILE AND SMOOTHE OFF BEFORE ADDITION A THIN ADDITION OF GEL OVER THE COMPLETE NAIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  </li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Not really a hood deal!!</li>
            <li> Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thinner and less clumpy than some other brands and lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on any other brand.</li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  </li>
            <li> Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    </li>
            <li> (less harmful to cuticles and surrounding skin than UV lamps)  </li>
            <li> I bought the black nail color with it.</li>
            <li> My husband got me a Deb Lipman  nail color collection in a black lacquer music box for Christmas.</li>
            <li> None of my previous bottles are like that.</li>
            <li> I take mine to the nail salon and then can pay less.</li>
            <li> Each nail polish typically runs 16-20 a piece in the store.</li>
            <li> I typically use these with CND shellac or gelish.</li>
            <li> AND THEN SLIGHTLY SMOOTHE THE RIDGE OFF</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    </li>
            <li> If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  </li>
            <li> it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bothersome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week 3 of my Gelish base and it&#x27;s fine.    </li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.    </li>
            <li> The foundation was thick and had a short brush, making it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> but they came off i a few days.</li>
            <li> So I ran another few seconds.</li>
            <li> Just a few minuets at home.</li>
            <li> The bottles started leaking from the lids a few weeks after purchase.  </li>
            <li> I had my nails done with gel polish a few weeks ago and not one chip.</li>
            <li> I took it off a few days ago with cotton balls dipped in acetone and wrapped with foil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them a few months and still haven&#x27;t run out (and that&#x27;s with quite a few customers).</li>
            <li> I dried each application 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> All applications were as thin as possible.</li>
            <li> I really like the short brush of the base coat bottle.</li>
            <li> You mean 2 bottles; one top coat and one base coat.....</li>
            <li> I am guessing this May be a common issue simply due to pressure &amp; temperature changes...</li>
            <li> Very odd.</li>
            <li> The brushes inside the bottle are very short, so will be difficult to reach all product in bottle once liquid level goes down.</li>
            <li> I am super bummed, I heard nothing but rave reviews, not sure why mine don&#x27;t work as described :(</li>
            <li> Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll stick to my tried and true CND for base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> My gelish manicure lasts 2 and a half weeks at least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to tell the bottles apart or unscrew the caps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the thick side</li>
            <li> small toenails</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> considering they are cheaper than the small bottles you can buy at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Maybe these bottles just don&#x27;t ship well as I see other people has reported broken bottles.</li>
            <li> After only two uses, the bristles on the brush bent, making for a very sloppy application.  </li>
            <li> make sure to apply the Base coat very thin</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product, but it stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> This will thin it down.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything on the market to make my nails hard without damage (or use of a salon).</li>
            <li> I like the outcome but the brand itself gets thick after time and is hard to apply.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. Great price and only waited for a couple of days to get it.</li>
            <li> Okay so I love doing my nails at home instead of paying someone else to do them sooo much cheaper! This stuff works great and buying the entire kit in pieces is WAY cheaper than buying it all together, because lets face it rubbing alcohol is rubbing alcohol and acetone is cheaper in bulk! Just always remember THIN coats people!</li>
            <li> Everything from shipping to the actual nail polish product was exactly what I ordered. Very happy! I am excited to start experimenting with my new Gelish polish. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great deal to get both at the same time.  Nice full size bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the short little brush on the foundation..... I wish all the polishes had it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to last a long time!!</li>
            <li> Just the foundation was $25 at the local beauty supply shop, I got both here for less than that.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great top and base coat.</li>
            <li> Works great for home manicures with gelish polish, UV lamp, and isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> Not minis!  Shipped fast.  Good price for brand and size (I bought this for 24$- I find a hard time finding gelish full size for cheaper).</li>
            <li> Perfect and flawless as described! Easy to apply, provides perfect results as expected. I will highly recommend it both to beginners and professionals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten my friends and family hooked on gelish. This was the best buy I found for the base and top coats. I will buy again when I start running low.</li>
            <li> Perfect for UV Gel nails and only a thin coat needed. Gel Clenser is needed to remove the final sticky finish and leave the shine.</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)     The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application    AUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.    1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand, flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)   2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.      3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.      5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.      6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.   7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.      8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. \\&quot;STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 &amp; 13 for 2nd color coat.    14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.      15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.      16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.      b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!    c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.    d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen \\&quot;#350 Heart to Heart\\&quot; Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish \\&quot;Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!    e.

NOT $115.99!!  12W TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control New    **I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure. I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.  I found that the replacement bulbs for the UV lamp were almost $30, and the LED lamp is supposed to last 35,000 hours - so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.    TECH TIPS: [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  For best performance follow recommended cure times.    **I think the soaking the Gel polish off in Acetone every time they come in weakens the nail bed as well. I make my client only wear it ever third time they get a manicure. I don&#x27;t care what they say...it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping. [...]     **clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it&#x27;s designed to do.     **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.     **there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.      **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.  ** [...]    TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  *****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips. Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions: Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application. When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail. Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail. You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles. Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute. This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape. Cure as directed between each application. See requirements for the cure time needed  Requirements: Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system. LED cure time 30 seconds. 36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes  Note: For me this is a must have product. I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application. This helps to equal out the level differences between the two. On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip. Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step .  **.  **Apply with a nail art brush.  **I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel. I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed. The end result is fantastic.  **The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  **Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  **Notice this is called a clean up brush. That is what it does. It will even up your French manicure very easily. Don&#x27;t know how anyone can do a French manicure without one. I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose. This brush made even this amateur try look professional. This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand. No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out. Would recommend highly recommend.    BEAUTY~NAILS~GEL-JULY 2012  **VIDEO:  [...]</li>
            <li> Perfect Base and top coat for any Nail Light LED user! Stays and stays until your ready to take it off and such a great price!</li>
            <li> Most of my gel polishes are made by Harmony.  I will use ONLY Harmony Gelish Foundation &amp; Top coat.  It&#x27;s the best. don&#x27;t waste your money on any other brand.</li>
            <li> I USE IT WITH ALL MY GEL BRANDS AND NICE QUALITY MIRROR FINISH, THE TOP COAT IS A BIT RUNNY SO YOU HAVE TO USE A LIGHT HAND SO IT DOES NOT POOL IN YOUR CUTICLES, WISH IT WAS A BIT CHEAPER, BUT IT&#x27;S ALL GOOD</li>
            <li> Love this product for my nails.  Plus it was faster shipping than quoted.</li>
            <li> The only gel polish I&#x27;ve ever found to last and at the same time be the color described.</li>
            <li> Great price for the combo of these!  Works great!  Arrived pretty quickly as well. No complaints here!  I love the Gelish Brand.</li>
            <li> perfect product love love love! I have bought it 3 times already!</li>
            <li> I like the top and base coat by Gelish. I really like the short brush of the base coat bottle. There&#x27;s no need for a normal length brush because you only need a really thin layer of it. The top coat leaves a nice glossy layer. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it peeling or chipping. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s really on. The only issue that I have with both of these is that the bottles don&#x27;t stay closed tightly. For some reason, when I try to twist it closed, it slightly turns so that it isn&#x27;t as tight as it should be. It stays closed enough where I wouldn&#x27;t bother asking for a refund, but it&#x27;s bothersome in the sense that I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave it unattended on its side, and I have to check periodically to make sure that it&#x27;s closed enough to stay shut. it&#x27;s a little bothersome and I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any of the other Gelish bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the polish! It works great! I bought the black nail color with it. And my nails have lasted longer than the 2 weeks. I love it! Buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect full size bottles!</li>
            <li> Love my Gelish products. I actually use these with CND products and my nails stay on way longer than 2 weeks. My toes will stay on for months.</li>
            <li> Use these bottles to do &amp;#34;Gelly Sandwiches&amp;#34; with regular nail polish.  Work great, happy with the price. Feel like I got a good deal and will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> SET OF 2.... You mean 2 bottles; one top coat and one base coat..... Not 2 sets! !!! Deceiving advertising!! Not really a hood deal!!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of gel polish! Works great with LED light. Stays on no chipping. I will never use reguar polish agian.</li>
            <li> It was such a good price and the service was great !</li>
            <li> It a great price for the full size. The gel stays on for weeks. Love the glossyness of he color. Gelish is the best gel Polish.</li>
            <li> I have tried the mini versions of Gelish and they dry out quickly so I decided to try the full size.  The product seems smoother and cleaner and I received both in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> My husband got me a Deb Lipman  nail color collection in a black lacquer music box for Christmas. I love all the colors but they came off i a few days. I purchase this set of 2 along with the 54 watt royal nail professional uv light. I used the foundation and the light then I used my favorite Christian Dior red. let that dry pur on the top coat and baked it according to directions but it was tacky. So I ran another few seconds. still tacky. I gave up and decided to try another tactic. Got out the acetone polish remover and started cleaning off my nails and to my surprise this was the step I needed to take. It took all the sticky tacky off the top and my nails looked great! Remember, I used regular nail polish not gel color. I&#x27;m very happy my system works. My nails are shiny and beautiful. Just a few minuets at home. Love that!</li>
            <li> My daughter does my gel nails and I buy her product. This is one of the brands she recommends. The polish was very close to the color pictured and seems to be a good quality (meaning it stays on a long time).  I would have given it five stars but it is hard to know what the color of the polish is when you are choosing it from among several. There is no color dot on the outside of the bottle which would be a nice improvement.</li>
            <li> Best Gel duo out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lasts for two weeks easy! A little goes a long way and you cannot beat this price!</li>
            <li> good product,nice price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color is just right&lt;br /&gt;i love gelish&lt;br /&gt;happy buyer</li>
            <li> All you need to get started is this set, a UV light (I love the Salon Edge Curing Light) and a great color and you are SET.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the products, but my bottle of Foundation was busted open and leaked all over the inside of the package, I was able to salvage 1/4 of the bottle.  Maybe these bottles just don&#x27;t ship well as I see other people has reported broken bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a UV-light and a Gelish polish.  Everything works as advertised! I don&#x27;t know how it would go if you mixed and mathed products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on as good as the CND, peeled off within a couple days. Doesn&#x27;t stay on as good as the CND, peeled off within a couple days.</li>
            <li> High quality item, like it a lot</li>
            <li> I just love the product. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but i always go back to Gelish and Opi, they are just awesome and works great, just as described. Looking forward to doing business with you again</li>
            <li> Products work fine and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I love doing this at home. Saves me tons of money, and if it gets messed up I just fix it on my own time. This is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several gel products and the gelish brand is always the best. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bubble. Even the colored polishes are great. Very thin and have to put on extra layers to get the full effect of the color, but lasts so long and looks great until the nail growth causes me to take it off and do a new color. 2-3 weeks great to the end! Highly recommend this brand</li>
            <li> These are superb. My nails are still excellent after 2 weeks of wearing these under and over a color.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Worked great with my Royal Nails UV Gel Nail Dryer!</li>
            <li> I like the outcome but the brand itself gets thick after time and is hard to apply. All of their paints seem to do this.</li>
            <li> I did my nails with this gel and cured under a uv light. the results are pretty amazing. they look better than in a salon. it gives a shine that I can&#x27;t get at home from just regularly painting my nails. the key to making it look less bulky and more natural is to use as little of it as possible. you don&#x27;t want big thick coats cause then it will look fake an acrylic like. if it has a thick coat it will look funny when the nail starts to grow.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because I love gel polish. I have no complaints and I would recommended to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I love this brand.</li>
            <li> A little over four weeks ago my friend starting using this product on my nails. I have ALWAYS had issues with nail breakage, nails peelings, and lack of strong growth. Well I am now the proud owner of ten strong nails that are long enough so I can tap them on a desk. They no longer get pieces that start to peel off, get stuck on something or I bite, and end up wit nubs. I now am proud to show my nails off!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat and base coat for gel nails. It makes my gel nails last for over 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t need to go to the nail salon anymore to get it done. It gives and sets my nails the best and it&#x27;s a great deal. I highly would recommend</li>
            <li> I use this rather than the OPI that came with my nail dryer from Sephora. The OPI chips and flakes off where this stays until I am ready to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to put this on in very thin coats for sure, I&#x27;ve burned myself by accident using a thick coat of this. Now if something goes on thick, I wipe it off and put it on again.</li>
            <li> I like this better than other soak off gel products.  It&#x27;s a little hard to tell the bottles apart or unscrew the caps.  a sharpie fixes that.  the foundation is thicker and has a shorter brush which is nice.</li>
            <li> Gelish foundation and top it off work well with all brands of UV gel polishes that I&#x27;ve tried. The foundation adds strength to my otherwise thin and weak nails and top it off gives a smooth shiny finish that lasts up to 3 weeks. These are the top two items on my manicure must have list.</li>
            <li> The brushes inside the bottle are very short, so will be difficult to reach all product in bottle once liquid level goes down. Top and Base liquid works well though.</li>
            <li> The bottles started leaking from the lids a few weeks after purchase.  Very odd.</li>
            <li> The best gelish ever.</li>
            <li> gelish products are the best, they apply smoothly and dry very quickly with my uv lamp.  highly recommend this and all gelish products.</li>
            <li> YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WAS A GREAT DEAL. I REALLY LIKE IT. I HAD SOME FIRST MISTAKES BUT I KEEP PRACTICING AND IT TURN OUT GREAT. THANKS</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get these. Used them once, now th tops dont stay closed! I&#x27;ve cleaned the threading and all. Not a tight seal. Bummer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for 2-3 years now but I&#x27;ve never seen the brush like these are. The brush on the foundation is super short and the top coat brush length is really long. None of my previous bottles are like that. It will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price you&#x27;ll find gelish products and these come in an even larger size!! The gel itself is very high quality and the foundation small brush size makes for an easy application. I would highly recommend this product for home use and professional use.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to take my 250 polish collection to the next level. See, my nails don&#x27;t stay long and are always breaking. After some research I decided to grab this foundation and top it off to try an experiment. I have tried almost everything on the market to make my nails hard without damage (or use of a salon). I use rubbing alcohol to remove oils from my nails (no grit needed to sand nails), I apply a layer of the foundation and cure it then a layer of top it off and cure it (make sure to get the tips of your nails). My nails have been growing for almost 3 weeks now without breakage or bending. It is a miracle!!! What is really great about using it this way is you can paint regular nail polish and designs over the top of it and remove it without removing the gel (since it is soak off). I cannot be happier with my purchase and will definitely be buying from this seller again (cheaper than Sallys and they will only sell minis to customers anyways at same price -RIPOFF!!). Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I have saved so much moneys by doing my own gel nails. I have never used any other top and base coat so I can&#x27;t compare these to anything.  I do my own manicures with them and the polish lasts for a week or more.  This is perfect for me. I no longer have to go to the nail salon to get nice gel nails.  I do admit my nails don&#x27;t always come out as good as if I went to the salon but I don&#x27;t mind. My nails look great and last even though I wash my hands often while at work. Oh and this is the brand they use at my salon.</li>
            <li> I received this package in a timely manner. I felt like I would have given this product 5 stars, had I not received a bottle that had (what looked like) a small spill on the outside of the bottle. Maybe they were trying to refill an old bottle? It makes me a bit wary, but the product itself seemed okay to use. One of the bottles also opens a bit too easily-- like, it&#x27;s hard to tighten it enough to close fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would probably buy from this source again if I couldn&#x27;t find a cheaper seller. Just be sure to inspect your products carefully before you use it, in case you have to return it or exchange it.</li>
            <li> The base coat and top coat are both good products.  They are a thick coat, so if your nails are thin, it is nice to get that support because it makes your nails stronger and longer time in between manicures.  You have to of course use a light to seal the nails in between the coats.  I still end up with issues of a week or less in between having to redo the nails, but it is better and cheaper than having to make appointments to have my nails done.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and love the durability of gel nails. The gelish system is definitely a good system, make sure to us 91% rubbing alcohol or gelish cleanser lightly after each cure under the light to remove the sticky residue!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to help your nails grow if they are pealing or just not growing, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand of base and top coats carried by a beauty supply store and the Harmony Gelish brand is so much betther. My gel manicures last a lot longer</li>
            <li> Writing off my boyfriend&#x27;s account, the base gel was very chunky.</li>
            <li> So, I now only use the Gelish base (foundation)  and top coat (top it off)  with regular nail polish and it&#x27;s a great solution.  I thought one day \\&quot;why not just make my nails harder and then use regular polish\\&quot;  So, I put on the foundation coat, cure it. Then I put on a layer of \\&quot;top it off\\&quot; and cure it.  I wipe off the top coat with an alcohol wipe, and now have hard, clear,  shiny nails.  I am very careful to not get near my cuticles at all (which is easy because it is clear--if it isn&#x27;t perfectly even, it doesn&#x27;t matter).  I then just use regular nail polish as usual--two standard polish color layers directly on the Gelish layers and your favorite regular top coat.  My \\&quot;regular\\&quot; manicure lasts twice as long as when I didn&#x27;t have the Gelish bast and top coat.  I think it is because my nails do not bend.  And I&#x27;m on the computer all day long.      When I want to change the color or it chips, I just use non acetone remover to remove the regular polish and the Gelish stays untouched, shiny and fine.  I then just reapply regular nail polish over the Gelish which still looks great.  Because the Gelish portion of the manicure is perfectly clear, you can&#x27;t see it \\&quot;growing out\\&quot;, so you don&#x27;t have to remove it anywhere near as often as when you use the Gelish color.  I sometimes add another \\&quot;top it off\\&quot; layer when it starts to grow out and cure it and then apply polish.  Because it is clear, applying it is a piece of cake and if you make a mistake with the regular nail polish, you just remove it with non acetone polish and redo.  If you get a chip, you can quickly fix that one nail as you would with a regular manicure.    I know many have done what is called a \\&quot;Gelish sandwich\\&quot;, using regular polish between the \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; and \\&quot;top it off\\&quot;, but to me, this only allows you more colors, it doesn&#x27;t simplify your life like my system does.  Try it.  Yes, you will have to wait for your polish to dry, but you will only have to remove the Gelish layer every 3-4 weeks and that isSO much better for your nails.  I&#x27;m on week 3 of my Gelish base and it&#x27;s fine.    Hard, beautiful nails, unlimited color choices, easy application.    I&#x27;m in nail heaven.</li>
            <li> Perfect, large size for the gellish system.  I ran through the little bottles so fast.  My only complaint is that the brush on the foundation is about half the length of the top coat bottle brush.  Not sure why</li>
            <li> Long lasting and durable for my nails.  This is a product that I will use over and over again for sure.</li>
            <li> I am a nailtechnician for 25 years already and this is the best product they invented. For me the Gelish from Harmony base and top coat is the best.  Itried like 6 brands of gelpolish. I can say that cnd shellac is also very good but it&#x27;s more expensive and smaller bottle so less product. I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat a two-for-one purchase, and this was a great deal. I am extremely happy with this purchase. Works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent, I like this even better then the CNDs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the thick side but that&#x27;s what I like! If that&#x27;s how you like it, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. Best brand out there.</li>
            <li> not thick and sticky and on the foundation there is a easy control short brush.  Very good deal. Buy it</li>
            <li> I take mine to the nail salon and then can pay less.</li>
            <li> Order processing &amp; shipping time were super fast! A+ The only reason for 4 stars &amp; not five, is one of the bottles had leaked a small amount... Not a big deal...I am guessing this May be a common issue simply due to pressure &amp; temperature changes... I definitely would buy from this Seller again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> love the Gelish product.  Lasts for weeks if applied properly and if taken  care of can last 2 weeks or longer</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for gel application.  I have tried other brand but this brand is excellent when used with the Harmony Gelish nail colors.  Goes on beautifullly.</li>
            <li> So far not happy. In the picture that was advertised it has &amp;#34; Harmony&#x27; on the side of the bottle (this is how you know its the real stuff.) I received &#x27; Gelish top and base coat&#x27; Which I already have and it doesn&#x27;t last more than 4- 5 days. Where as the &#x27;Harmony Gelish top and base&#x27; last for the 14 days. Sent a message to the owner waiting to see if I can get a replacement. Will do follow up.....</li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish Top &amp; Base Coat - really is a great deal! The only difference buying here instead of the store is I saved a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Order arrived promptly. I get a professional finish doing my own nails. Saves me $$.</li>
            <li> this is the best products for Gel nails and talk about the very best price I found anywhere, thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 years now and love it.  will not use anything else.  loved how this came in a dual package and was excellent price.  safe and safe shipping.  would recommend to anyone that does not have time for constant mani&#x27;s</li>
            <li> RUN don&#x27;t stop- get this deal while you still can, The best quality gel polish in large sizes for this price?! Get outta here! I thought I was getting the tiny bottles these usually come in but no, nice full size bottles of the best quality nail gels made. Get it. Get it. I mean it.</li>
            <li> I love these full size bottles.  My nails turned out perfect!</li>
            <li> Awesome deal for these two! Shipped quickly, worked great, and for the bundle great pricing. Each nail polish typically runs 16-20 a piece in the store.</li>
            <li> Used them for the first time last night! Work perfect! Make sure you use at least 91% alcohol to remove the sticky after you come out of the uv light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just purchased this duo AGAIN to make sure I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Awesome deal! Love the large bottles. Keeps my polish on but I don&#x27;t need a chisel to take it off.</li>
            <li> The brush for the top coat hardened. Don&#x27;t know how but product is still good. The shine lasts for more than a month, even if I take long to change my polish, the shine lasts and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST brand for foundation and top coat! I have tried other brands, both more and less expensive and none of the others come close to working as well.</li>
            <li> I have become a fan of shellac/gel manicures because they hold up so well.  I spend a lot of time in the pool and wanted a product that wouldn&#x27;t peel, chip of lift.  The gel or shellac manicures look good for about two weeks before you need to redo.  But paying $30.00 every two weeks adds up so I decided to try it myself. Don&#x27;t expect to be proficient the first time, because it takes a few attempts to learn the technique.  I tried the CND products the first time and found them to be too thick and hard to work with so I decided to try some other brands.  The Harmony Gelish product is much thinner in consistency and makes it much easier to achieve a professional look.  I will definitely order this product again. You can buy color gel products at Walmart &amp; Walgreens and they work well with Harmony Gelish base and top coat. I would suggest that you use a very light color to start with until you are comfortable with doing this yourself.  One thing I learned on my own was to curve the fingers down when applying, so gravity helps you keep the product thin.  And try not to touch the cuticle so you don&#x27;t have an edge when the nail starts to grow out.  I&#x27;m now able to do both hands at once before curing under the light!  It costs about $150 to get started but you will save time and money in the long run by doing your manicures at home.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I bought all the products I needed together and am glad I did?  Thank you so ver py much!</li>
            <li> Great value.  I plan to buy again in a month or so.  I&#x27;ve had mine 5 months and I re-mani every 10 days so they are enduring well.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Sensationail nail kit and saw some recommendations about the base &amp; top coat not being so great, so I tried these.  They are very good and easy to use..  I am still learning how to do the gel nails but so far love them.</li>
            <li> Very good product I have been using it for 4 year and I am extrmely satisfied. It lasts for a very long time. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> These have helped me have a lasting manicure. Regular polish barely lasted me a whole day, let alone a whole week! These two products are definitely worth the time and money!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the first time by doing my own no-chip mani at home. The outcome is a very professional look. I would recommend this top and base coat.</li>
            <li> The only base and top gel polish to go with. All others I&#x27;ve tried peel.</li>
            <li> Ok, I love the gelish foundation and top coats, but I do hate the lid. For some reason the polish gets under the lid and there is a ring of polish around the base of the lid that is hard to get off. It is not a huge deal, but kind of annoying that there is a little sticky ring of polish at the top the bottle. The IBD doesn&#x27;t seem to have this problem, just the gelish polishes, so I hope that they soon remedy this and find a new lid to fit the bottle. Overall great starter set and I think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> excellent deal! the 2 pack really saves a lot of money. I will definitely be buying them again. The store is way more expensive</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST....I have been using Gelish for a couple of years now....it stays on until you are ready to&lt;br /&gt;take it off. (I actually peel mine off after two weeks, it&#x27;s faster and easier than soaking)  My nails have never in&lt;br /&gt;my life been in better shape, no breaking, chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, packaging was good but the foundation base gel was very thick and gloopy/stringy as though it was old or had been opened some time back. It went on rather thick as was difficult to do a thin layer but it did cure ok so will see if the polish I put on top manages to stay put or whether the foundation will end up peeling. Top coat gel was fine.</li>
            <li> I had my nails done with gel polish a few weeks ago and not one chip. I took it off a few days ago with cotton balls dipped in acetone and wrapped with foil. I decided to polish my nails with regular polish while I waited for my polish to ship. My polish chipped by the next day. As soon as I got this and my color polish I did my nails. I am so excited that my nails will look good for two weeks and I don&#x27;t have to deal with any dry time! Thanks Gelish for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have used other brand names of the Gel/Shellac polish Top and Base coat and they didnt stick to my nails well but Harmony gelish has worked miracles! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Gelish is the best things ever. works perfect everytime.</li>
            <li> Does not dry no matter how many hours you let it dry! Do not recommend! Waste of money and you can not return greeeeeaaaaatttt!!</li>
            <li> I´ve been using this product for more than a year,  and I´m very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;All my life my nails have been weak,  brittle and broke easily,  so I´ve always wore them very short,&lt;br /&gt;now,  after using this product,  I´ve longer and beautiful nails,  and can even wear the colors in style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006FRS9O6 Harmony Gelish Top and Base \\&quot;Set of 2\\&quot; Good Deal!!!]]</li>
            <li> Love the size and shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> The polish worked fine and hardened to a nice shine. It seemed a bit tacky and dull at first, but this stopped after washing my hands. I think the slight stickiness was mostly due to the fact that it was my first time using gel. The foundation was thick and had a short brush, making it hard to apply. The top coat was thinner and had a longer brush, more like the ones I&#x27;m used to with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish brand it is excellent quality for a decent price I do not see the point in spending more money for cnd shellac products. Works great cures the base one minute with my uv dryer and top two minutes and love my gel nails. these are the only two products I use other the gelish color.  I have not purchased the ph bond or cleanser I can do without by buffing nails real good then going over with rubbing alcohol to dry them out before base coat, and ending with more rubbing alcohol to cleanse when finished.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even bother to get manicures as by day 2 or 3 they are already chipping and the sight of chipped nails looks far worse to me than naked unpolished nails. I saw a couple of co-workers who nails just stay done and always looked fabulous and asked them about it and they told me they had gel manicures, which last 2 weeks or more and don&#x27;t chip. I had remembered about hearing about gel manis in the past but had also heard about potential health hazards associated with the process. I did some research and decided to give it a try as a treat to me. I got my first gel nail manicure at a nail salon about 5 weeks ago and I am now a convert. Being the cheapskate that I am, I of course immediately started looking into ways of saving $$ and doing this myself. Many youtube videos, blog postings and beauty sites later I decided to take the plunge and go with the gelish brand as that seemed quite popular, layperson friendly and polishes were readily available at Sally&#x27;s, where I have a discount card and they issue coupons every now and again. I heeded a lot of the cost saving advice by investing in the red carpet LED light (got it at Harmon w/20% BB&amp;B coupon), got pure acetone, 91% alcohol which I already had on hand and I did my first mani myself just this past Sunday. I was a bit nervous but with a steady hand they came out fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make it a point to smear sunscreen on my hands in order to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast and I absolutely love it.  Great price too!  Gelish nail polish is all I will use!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Gelish foundation and top it off work well with all brands of UV gel polish that I&#x27;ve tried. I typically use these with CND shellac or gelish. The foundation adds strength to my nails and top it off gives a smooth, shiny finish that lasts up to 2 weeks. The bottles are bigger than expected and last a long time! I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The price was great for the product and everything shipped quickly. The only problem I had is that the Top It Off burns my skin under the lamp if I accidentally get some on the sides of my nails. I have not had this problem when I purchased the mini Top It Off from Sally&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t know if this is a main problem with the larger bottles&#x27; formulation or if the particular one I received was from a bad batch. Other than that everything was as I expected.</li>
            <li> These work great.  The foundation is a bit gloopy so be careful to make sure you go thin.  Top coat has the long bristles and foundation has the little short brush.</li>
            <li> Gelish is a wonderful product!  Be sure to try out all of their colors!  It is such a simple process.  Just make sure to buy a UV dryer from amazon because the product must have UV light to cure.  Salon results that will save you thousands on going to a professional.  My gelish manicure lasts 2 and a half weeks at least.</li>
            <li> These 2 are my favorite base and top coat. I&#x27;ve had them a few months and still haven&#x27;t run out (and that&#x27;s with quite a few customers).</li>
            <li> I lovvvvv!!!!! this set is even more that I expect ,I though the size will be the small , but nope! the size is the big bottle size which is amazing! thank u :)</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish polishes and this is a good value for the base and top set.  Like the larger size than what the store carries.</li>
            <li> I have used the gelish for a long time, always getting it from my local beauty supply.  This was such a good find online.  It was bigger and cheaper!!!  Two pluses!  This is a really good product, I do my nails about every 2-3 weeks, yes, it lasts that long on me.  I do not wear gloves and I use my nails as tools, so I&#x27;m not careful at all with my nails and this stuff lasts, hardens and protects my natural nail.  I found a trick to removing it, I file and directly soak my nails in acetone instead of wrapping in foil as the instructions say.  Soaking them 5-10 mins does the trick for me.  Did I mention this was such a good buy?  :-)</li>
            <li> I love the long lasting polish and this stuff makes it last and shine great product easy to use will buy again</li>
            <li> Works very well except the base coat leaks so I have to make sure the bottle stays upright</li>
            <li> The top it off was spilled out from the top, not sure if it was smashed or was in the heat, I havnt used it yet so im hoping it will still work the same</li>
            <li> The bottles themselves are great, they&#x27;re actually rather large (salon size) which is good considering they are cheaper than the small bottles you can buy at Sally&#x27;s. The only issue i had was with the shipping. I was supposed to receive them around the 8th but they ended up showing around the 12th. It may have been the fault of USPS though because I received a notification that they shipped the next day. Either way they were a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Great value and shipping, wife loved it, nuff said!</li>
            <li> awesome deal and great combo getting both the foundation and the top coat together. Great deal and offer to get.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish system. I have the light and only needed the base and top coat. these two bottles were less than what the whole kit with smaller bottles cost at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Same top coat and base coat for Gelish polish that you see in the Salons. This polish holds for a long time unless you use hot water on your hands a lot like I do, Should last almost a week or over a week.</li>
            <li> After paying $50 for each gel pedicure, I had to learn how to do it myself to cut costs.  This works great and it really is a &amp;#34;Good Deal!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Worked extremely well with Gelish 18G LED light. Beautiful shine on nails if dabbed with pure rubbing alcohol when finished hardening last coat (as per instructions). Using 50% alcohol/ Water mixture instead of pure rubbing alcohol resulted in matt finish without shine. (good lesson in reading instructions)</li>
            <li> After only two uses, the bristles on the brush bent, making for a very sloppy application.  At this price, please improve the brush!  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality and wear of this gel polish.</li>
            <li> Great polish love the brand</li>
            <li> Same polish as you get from the store but a much better price! They work great in my ORLY LED light.</li>
            <li> First of all-- I don&#x27;t even know why I  didn&#x27;t try this product to begin with!! I was practicing with the art of gel nails and I purchased the Sally hanson gel kit at CVS. Worst buy for gel nails. I thought I was doing pretty well with the polish but then when I heard about this product and tried it I will say that this is way better !! The number one thing I noticed in difference is the shine it creates after curing. Better shine then Sallys.</li>
            <li> These are full size products and work well for a gel manicure. I have found that they need to be cured under the uv light (mine is 34w) for longer than other brands though. Great deal for both products!</li>
            <li> Good price and fast ship on Full size bottles. I like the shorter brush size on the, makes easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I knew i liked this brand before I bought it because my bestfriend uses and and I wanted to own it myself. The shine quality is GREAT! and it lasts so much longer then my sensantionail brand. I still use the sensationail colors but with this bottom and top coat. I love it so if you think you want, YOU WANT IT lol. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the price too. cant beat it for the full sizes</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Gelish products. My nails have never looked this good. I was very surprised to receive the Gelish Top and Base Coat so quickly and was shocked at the larger size. I saved a lot of money purchasing from Amazon and will shop for all my Christmas gifts through them this year. Great Experience! I recommend the Gelish Nail products to anyone wishing to have long, strong, beautiful nails.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</li>
            <li> It seemed okay when I first opened it but before I finished my nails it was globby and stringy.  It was like it was old.&lt;br /&gt;Both bottles did this.  I have lots of Gelish polish.  In fact, that&#x27;s all I use.  So I was very surprised.  I guess I&#x27;ll stick to my tried and true CND for base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> This base and top coat helps any polish last far longer.....up to three weeks.  It strengthens and protects the nail so that even fragile nails will grow longer.</li>
            <li> Have been using gelish polish since christmas 2011. I was buying my polish from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and they only supply the mini bottles. They were costing me $13 a bottle and I get this and the bottles are two times bigger! The brushes are also much better on these bottles. They are shorter and flat and provide for better precision.  Great buy. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;-Just make sure to apply the Base coat very thin&lt;br /&gt;-and the Top coat once it gets on your cuticles make sure to wipe it completely off (best with nail polish remover) and apply it again. Also better to do 2 Nails at the time and put them under the UV light. ~Claudia~</li>
            <li> Very good deal on this set</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and at a very good price - works great with LED light. Love my new nails:)</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish products.. this is the best foundation and topper i have found!</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products. The bottles are big and they seem to cover better and stay on longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> The gelish system is wonderful. I threw out all my Essie, OPI, etc. nail polishes that chip NO MATTER WHAT. If you apply correctly this really does stay on until you take it off. Thin coats is a must and don&#x27;t forget to wipe with 90% rubbing alcohol to get the sticky off when you&#x27;re done. UV lamp required for this product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I used with gelish polish</li>
            <li> good. great price for base and top coat. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOUR NAILS MORE STIFF AND DURABLE THAT THE POLISH WOULD STAY ON ....THIS BEATS THEM ALL .....AFTER TRYING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS TO THINK OF A WAY TO KEEP FROM PEELING OFF THE GEL EVERY TWO WEEKS, WHICH I BELIEVE TAKES A THIN LAYER OF NATURAL NAIL REMAINING ....I FINALLY DECIDED THAT I WOULD FILE THE TIPS WHENEVER THEY GREW OUT AND INSTEAD OF TAKING IT ALL OFF BY PEELING IT OFF BY HAND, I STARTED TO PUSH UP MY CUTICLES AND THEN SLIGHTLY SMOOTHE THE RIDGE OFF AND THEN ADD THE FOUNDATION GEL AND THEN THE SOAK OFF ..&lt;br /&gt;AND SINCE I ALWAYS MAKE THE POLISH VERY THIN WHEN IT IS APPLIED, YOU DO NOT HAVE MUCH OF A RIDGE TO FILE AND SMOOTHE OFF BEFORE ADDITION A THIN ADDITION OF GEL OVER THE COMPLETE NAIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE PRAISING THIS POLISH.  IF YOU WISH YOU CAN POLISH OVER THE GEL AND THE POLISH STICKS TO IT PERFECTLY ....MY NAILS ARE NOW HEALTHY AND THIS WORKS FOR ME PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good deal to buy as a set, although the brush on the top coat was short and didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape.  Makes it difficult to achieve a nice thin coat.  But for the money...good deal.  Some colors that I bought from this company have bottles that leak.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Worked as instructed. Check out youtube videos on how to make a &amp;#34;gelly sandwich&amp;#34; using the polishes you already have at home.  I tried it twice and they work wonderfully. They last a week on my nails. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Just like the nail salon polish! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal on a product I love I was getting sick of paying $30 twice a month to get my nails done at the salon, this seller has made it possible for me to do this myself and saved me a ton of money for years to come. They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have heard nothing but awesome things about gelish. So naturally it was my first choice when looking to get a gel base and top coat. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a counterfeit set, if it&#x27;s an old formula, or if it is just that geisha isn&#x27;t as wonderful as I heard. But my top coat always chips from the tips of my nails. I use a high end led lamp to cure, I cap the free edge, I keep all coats nice and light, and yet 2 to 4 days later the top coat is chipping. I am super bummed, I heard nothing but rave reviews, not sure why mine don&#x27;t work as described :( I am giving 2 stars because I love how it looks; just wish it lasted.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have time to wait for nail polish to dry, so my nails have looked pretty sad for years. I did acrylic nails for a while, but it got pricey so I wanted another option. I bought a good UV light and the Harmony Gelish top and bottom coat, along with a few other colors. It was a great investment. While it costs substantially more than regular nail polish initially, it&#x27;s super quick and lasts so much longer. My time is worth quite a bit to me so I feel it saves me a ton of money, especially compared to visiting the nail salon every two weeks.  Besides, what&#x27;s more irritating than spending two hours waiting for your polish to dry only to knock a nail and mess it up, or have it peel off after a day or so? Gel polish lasts me for at least a couple of weeks and I don&#x27;t take great care to protect it. I wash dishes without gloves and garden, (with gloves but still a dirty prospect) and it stays put. I really like it! One thing to note: you do not need to wipe with an alcohol pad between coats, only at the end after the top coat. You will see that the gel seems gooey, after putting it in the light, but that is normal. Just proceed with the next coat and after the final top coat, wipe with the alcohol pad and they will be shiny and perfect!</li>
            <li> The products are the best. In the salon we used another brands, but Gelish gjve us the best finish. Now we only use Gelish top and base.</li>
            <li> Works great I love Gelish</li>
            <li> Love the gelish products</li>
            <li> Love this polish! Lasts for 2-3 weeks on my nails with no chips and 2 months on my toes. Once they grow out it does peel a bit but still such a huge improvement over regular polish. Will never go back!</li>
            <li> This is the polish my local nail salon uses. It goes on a little thinner and less clumpy than some other brands and lasts FOREVER. Love it.</li>
            <li> This company was great, got it quickly. I might use different brands of color, but I always start with Gelish base &amp; end with Gelish top, it&#x27;s the best! Great price, too!!</li>
            <li> The gels are too thick, I couldn&#x27;t use when received.  I have to go find gel polish thinner to make it useable.  These were too costly for the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought the Gelish starter kit originally and used it for a long time until the top and base coat became too thick and I had to replace...but I love this product! Super easy at home for salon look;)</li>
            <li> It took some practice getting the layers as thin as your supposed to to do the mani/pedi properly, but its worth it!  My nails are super flimsy, so I can still only get a week tops out of a gel, but its better than a day!  I did usually run it a little longer than the product recommended, but only because I was paranoid about it curing correctly.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product, but it stays on for a long time. You can even do things that you normally wouldn&#x27;t be able to after a manicure.</li>
            <li> I received my order a week earlier then expected which was very good. I opened my package and the bottles were full sized bottles. I immediately started using the product and the results were everything that I expected. Thank you and I will definitely be placing more orders with your company;).</li>
            <li> After watching the tutorials by Gelish and DIY people on youtube I was more than ready to try this out. I used a lint free wipe and 90% alcohol to substitute the other junk you don&#x27;t need to buy- these two- the base and top coat are all you need!! It arrived super fast and so far I am loving the results!</li>
            <li> NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THESE NAIL GEL PRODUCTS WERE NAMED HARMONY. WHEN USED TOGETHER THEY WORK WITH SUCH HARMONY. THIS NAIL PRODUCT WORKS PERFECTLY WHEN APPLIED AS DIRRECTED. GO TO GELISH.COM TO LEARN HOW IT WORKS AND DO NOT DIVIATE FROM INSTRUCTIONS. YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS EASY TO APPLY AND LASTS A VERY LONG TIME. MUCH CHEAPER THAN ACRYICS AND ALOT LESS DAMAGE TO NATURAL NAILS.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and I didn&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else. I really think this stuff works better than the gel polish stuff at walmart.</li>
            <li> The foundation is wonderful but for some reason the top it off has chunks in it and the brush is hard as a rock :( big bummer!!!</li>
            <li> This Gelish Nail Polish Top and Base coat works fantastic!!  Lasts for a year with doing your nails every two weeks.  The Gelish Polish works the best for me.  Stays on for a good two weeks without any chips.  Looks like you got them done at a nail salon even after two weeks look fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love the fast shipping and the value of this product!! I love all Gelish products for my Shellac, its easy and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The product does not appear to be real. They are the large bottles but one of the labels says &#x27;mini&#x27; even though it is not one of the minis....my old bottle label is different from this. The base coat does not work like the Gelish base coat I purchased at the store .....this only lasts 2- 3 days and then peels off. I wouldn&#x27;t buy from here again.</li>
            <li> works just as good as stuff twice as expensive</li>
            <li> I do not like how the nail polish is runny, I like to do white tips on my nails, and I cannot get the white to not run down the sides of the nail.  Two coats are needed as well, and I dont like the look of two coats because then its too thick.</li>
            <li> First time to use Gelish products, and I am sold!!  Eight minutes to dry my nails (four fingers, four fingers, thumb separate)!  Eight minutes!  I&#x27;ve always used cheap nail polish in the past that chips off in two days.  I can&#x27;t wait to get some different colors and see if they really do last two to three weeks!</li>
            <li> I love gel manicures since I always chip regular polish within a day or two.  I can get 2 weeks out of a gel manicure but I still cant afford to have them done at a salon for $30 all the time.  Much cheaper to buy this set and a light, and my favorite colors.  Even if I only buy 2 colors a month its cheaper than 1 manicure at the salon.</li>
            <li> love gelish polish!! ... totally worth the price... It was shipped very quick..it really makes my nails hard and I can finally see them grow!!! :)</li>
            <li> It came in three days. That was an amazing feat in itself. The gelish polish works very well and stays on for quite a while. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and I use it on my clients at my salon very often. I bought myself a set to use at home for convenience as well.</li>
            <li> Easily peels off. Not the best brand.</li>
            <li> i was previously using CND brand polishes with a UV light, but when my light died and i went to purchase a new one, and i went with an LED light instead and realized my CND polishes weren&#x27;t curing! eek!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i purchased these and found that gelish works just fine with the new light! whew!</li>
            <li> The listing is true to it&#x27;s word. Very good deal. You get 2 Foundations and 2 Top coats all under the price of $10.00. This is a very good deal. They will last a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purcahse.</li>
            <li> I bought both of these polishes together as a set, the base and top coat, and they work perfectly.  They do everything they should be and the only thing worth noting is that if you are doing your own nails at home, make sure you only use very thin layers of each polish, especially the top coat as it tends to be a little runnier and will run all over the sides of your fingers if you use too much.</li>
            <li> NO WORRIES...This is PERFECT and works great! Thats coming from an American that is licensed for 5 years now</li>
            <li> I did my first Gelish nails and used the USpicy. It worked great. I dried each application 2 minutes. I also applied the alcohol wipe after each application. I used the Gelish foundation, my regular nail polish, then the Gelish top coat. The Gelish polish is rather thick. I placed all polish in a very warm water bath before use. This will thin it down. All applications were as thin as possible. One coat of foundation, two of polish, and two of topcoat. Super shine and strong nails. Gelish applications will be sticky after drying but after the alcohol wipe they will be dry.</li>
            <li> Work great, just wish they offered gallon size bottle for refilling...goes on easy and work great with any gel product</li>
