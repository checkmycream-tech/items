            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I have heard great things about this product, but my experience was a dud.</li>
            <li>and this is great for in between visits to my aesthetician.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for the face and neck.</li>
            <li>it works great</li>

            <li>Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Felt</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great for my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an intelligent woman, I believe, and I can&#x27;t be fooled by a website where the products are over 1000$, for a cream or $2000, and none of the products I bought are on this site.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, this product works great.</li>
            <li>Great price and product.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and this price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>but the stuff is great and they have it cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced that too.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>But, if you follow it up with the Day Moisturizer or the Renewal Night Cream, they cover up the not so great smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>This a great product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>That is, until I had the bright idea to try this product.</li>
            <li>good product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product arrived timely and in good shape.</li>
            <li>I used the product three times, in an attempt to be fair, and then placed it in the trash.</li>
            <li>didnt like the feeling, but the results are good</li>
            <li>This product works good .</li>
            <li>Salesmen are good.</li>
            <li>I fell into the trap of good salesmenship at a kiosk in the mall over this gel.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I believe havent taken a good look at the peel.</li>
            <li>This was a good deal on amazon compared to buying it at the mall.</li>
            <li>But it works good as a Peeling cream.</li>
            <li>a friend and I loved it..</li>
            <li>This is a good peel for the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>When I said something to her about how good she looked she told me she had been using these products.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all</li>
            <li>Acne wise-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay 75.00 for it.  </li>
            <li>i received this as a gift and loved the product.  </li>
            <li>product wasn&#x27;t good, I would not buy it again and never recommend it to anybody out there.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>All and all its a good product.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a good peeling product, please stay away from this one.</li>
            <li>And the price is good</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even SMELL GOOD.</li>
            <li>but I loved the product just not the cost.  </li>
            <li>LA County Fair for $40 a jar.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my mom to try and she loved it too.  </li>

            <li>This stuff was so good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even good for feet let alone your face.</li>
            <li>I dont underatand why it has good reviews.</li>
            <li>For aging skin it is good because it is not an abrasive exfollient that can microscopically tear the skin, speeding up the aging process.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s good stuff too) for my daughter for $60.00.  </li>

            <li>but I saw it with my own eyes.</li>
            <li>GLAD TO HAVE FOUND A GOOD DEAL ON THIS AND WILL BUY AGAIN, IN FACT</li>
            <li>This product is a wonderful exfoliant for you hands and face and is so effective, but gentle.</li>
            <li>and I am excited about being happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The set was originally $150.00!?!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good exfolliant peel at a great price.</li>
            <li>These products are excellent for all types of skin, leaves it very soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>But beware, it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;5 STARS for sure! :-)</li>
            <li>Got to love those Israelis! :)</li>
            <li>Great company bought other things from them and their service is excellent.  </li>
            <li>product absolutely works and provides incredible results.  </li>
            <li>So if you need a good peel for cheap, this is now it, in fact I will purchase this myself.</li>
            <li>but my old scars (pits and discoloration) are greatly diminished!  </li>
            <li>I was THRILLED when I found it on amazon for so cheap!</li>
            <li>Any way I was very impressed on how soft my skin felt.</li>

            <li>This products is good, it exfoliate your skin and leaves it smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>but when I bought it in Hawaii a year ago, it seemed to work more effectively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad to keep this stuff handy.  </li>
            <li>Amazon process are great and WELL WORTH IT..</li>
            <li>There are much more effective face masks out there than this &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; which shouldn&#x27;t even be called a peel.</li>
            <li>recommend this product if you want to try it on these type of troublesome areas, and for a good, fresh face peel!</li>
            <li>I think this is a lovely item perfect for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Lei Facial Peeling is a great on the face and great price.</li>
            <li>Pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to know I could buy this product so much cheaper on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I figured it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good for me, but I love the way it feels so clean when finished.</li>
            <li>well let me tell you something very important about that.</li>
            <li>But as long as they work to some degree of the purposed intended I am happy - I might not be as happy</li>
            <li>My skin felt very nice after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Great product,  I have amazing results my skin look very healthy, I love it definitely</li>
            <li>, it comes in a wonderful hard case with padding inside, great for a gift</li>
            <li>Love this peel.</li>
            <li>Better than what I had though.</li>
            <li>Best place to buy is on Amazon not in the malls where they double or triple the cost.</li>
            <li>This is great and really gets in and</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and boy was I ever glad.</li>
            <li>could not have made a better choice when buying this.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and it glows!  </li>
            <li>For those that have purchased it online much cheaper and had great reviews, please share the site that you went to.</li>
            <li>My skin looked noticeably better- more youthful and radiant- after just two days.</li>
            <li>Now my skin seems to be more tolerant,</li>
            <li>I love the Butter cream, and the Sea Salt Polisher for my arms and sun damaged body areas like the area just below the neck.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cowgirl and frankly their smooth talk is a line of bull........!</li>
            <li>He tried to sell more, but I told him no.</li>
            <li>I love this peel, you can see the results immediately</li>
            <li>However, I am so glad to see Amazon carries it for a fraction of the price of what I paid.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy into her</li>
            <li>I prefer the Olay Pro-X and Olay Regenerist lines much better, so I&#x27;d recommend those over this one.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love it and am so glad to be able to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad the guy lowered the price a lot because it&#x27;s way cheaper on here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t realise how much better my skin could be.</li>
            <li>Best facial care line I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better  :)  </li>
            <li>ONLY buy this on Amazon for the price is great!</li>
            <li>am rating this a 5 as I have purchased and used it many times.</li>
            <li>but I found good reviews on use of the product are worth the length.</li>
            <li>I Love this mark.</li>
            <li>If you write to the websites selling these products for 90% off they will all claim the product to be authentic, un-damaged &amp; not expired.</li>
            <li>Most of them I like albeit nothing particularly overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a scrub.</li>
            <li>The product is more of a gel.</li>
            <li>Most exfoliators that I&#x27;ve tried have aggravated the skin more than helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time though, I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this face peel.  </li>
            <li>Something is going on here, but I&#x27;m just entirely sure what.</li>
            <li>She used many VPL products on me and sent a bunch home with me to keep using.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of a couple products and just stopped using them, instead of asking her for more.  </li>
            <li>and my face never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I let her rub it on my wrists, and the results pleased me, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I tried the product and I can sincerely say that it works.   </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be any more happier with it.</li>
            <li>love it and its just as i remembered it from a while ago. ..</li>
            <li>I used once and it was ok.  </li>
            <li>The product itself seems okay</li>
            <li>Love this and have purchased as gifts for friends.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product from 3 different sellers,, best bet Beauty, touchdown, and On Sale.  </li>
            <li>I read so many reviews on the Vivo Per Lei products sold here on Amazon that i decided to ignore them and find out for myself.  </li>
            <li>There are much better peels out there.</li>
            <li>Forever flawless facial peeling gel is way better but costs a lot more.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this on amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Love this skincare line.</li>
            <li>Again, your price is much better.</li>
            <li>it is all better.  </li>
            <li>My complexion looks better than it has in a decade!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week and follow by washing my face with my cleanser again to make sure all the gel residue is gone.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great alternative to glycolic or salicylic peels and scratchy exfoliators!</li>
            <li>I had even gone into work that day and a coworker commented on how my face looked smooth!  </li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>and this has made my complexion better.</li>
            <li>i love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>But this one is most affordable</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say anything better.</li>
            <li>It is the best facial peel I&#x27;ve ever used and was my biggest bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>my skin feels wonderful the next day.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t play with cream for more than 15-20 min.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I got two more fore</li>
            <li>and they love it.</li>
            <li>There are home remedies better than this one.  </li>
            <li>My family members have been telling me that my skin looks a lot better and they can see a difference too.</li>
            <li>So cheap!</li>
            <li>There are too many discrepancies.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get all areas of your face.</li>
            <li>But she was able to get her set for $75.00 because the boxes were damaged.  </li>
            <li>Once I tried the peel (more of a scrub) and the cream I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would check Amazon to see if I could snag a better deal and voila, I did.  </li>
            <li>A much better deal than the mall.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST facial  &#x27;scrub&#x27; EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>So these sales people charge you more than 10 times the price of these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  will purchase it again and really love  the product.</li>
            <li>Love the&lt;br /&gt; product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It seems there is great debate about whether or not what peels away is really skin or the product but</li>
            <li>set....was an ok deal but not compared to amazon!!!wont do that</li>
            <li>:) )  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this peeling, I ruined out if it and my skin can feel it, also when I don&#x27;t use it, the make up and lotions feel like a screen on my face</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at a mall kiosk even though I know better.</li>
            <li>Most give so-so results.</li>
            <li>Since it works in this manner, you shouldn&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>I hope the day/night cream works better.</li>
            <li>Ok so as I read some reviews I was suckered into this product paying 39.99</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>Now I would be PISSED to have paid this much and not be happy with the product...</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job removing dead cells and your skin feels good afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I love this peel</li>
            <li>He was cute, but I still couldn&#x27;t fall for it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Will for sure continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Well after seeing this product at the mall many times.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any results that would make this any better than what you would find elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>If You buy this product for scars as many</li>
            <li>I am confident that most people would be okay using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am telling you, this stuff is just stunning.</li>
            <li>Ok so I didn&#x27;t get this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>he uses it more then Me....</li>
            <li>I am going to order more from this product line.</li>
            <li>He was cute and I had nothing better to do.</li>
            <li>I love this facial peeling wash the best.</li>
            <li>Because it is peeling your skin off, don&#x27;t use more than once a week.</li>
            <li>Vivo peel is ok.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it online.</li>
            <li>I then use the Vivo moisturising day cream, which I also love.</li>
            <li>It was priced a lot better than what I saw in the mall.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure what it does.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I have told my friends about this product.:)</li>
            <li>I love and you should try it to.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s this peel, it makes my skin look youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li>shipped fast great product would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li>Ok i purchased the product before from the mall and was amazed on the results my mother tried it also and and love it</li>
            <li>Looked and smelled like the authentic product</li>
            <li>The follow up with the toner and moisture cream makes the whole product line a great value .</li>
            <li>and as you&#x27;re applying more water thinking it&#x27;ll just go away</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week for, an my skin never felt better.</li>
            <li>It works sort of like magic.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I do love the product.</li>
            <li>I also have a farm and spend many hours outdoors; even with spf 30 sunblock the sun does it&#x27;s damage.</li>
            <li>In fact I have just purchased 3 more jars through Amazon &amp; plan on giving one to my daughter so she can discover the wonderfulness without inital overpayment to kiosk personnel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>and i love it and had to find more</li>
            <li>, it takes the top layer of skin off and you can see it happening the skin</li>
            <li>I top those off with the Vivo Day Cream &amp; Roc Multi correction anti-gravity eye cream.</li>
            <li>bottom line, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it more than twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>so I leave it on a couple minutes longer and use it more often than they advise...</li>
            <li>It has a gel feeling to it, I was expecting it to be more of a scrub.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to know for sure</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok for what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>I used many peeling and exfoliating products and they all did the job, after using my face felt smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>but she had more...</li>

            <li>Well I love the product it works.  </li>
            <li>This works great and is gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my thirties now) and this peeling helps keep my skin clear, it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li>I too was hooked in at a mall kiosk by a pushy saleswoman, but I love this stuff..</li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>

            <li>I have started giving this as birthday presents and they say it is the best present they have ever gotten.  </li>
            <li>The product is okay.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial product!  </li>
            <li>like I said, I&#x27;m allergic to so many products I didn&#x27;t want to commit to buying anything without seeing if my skin was irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I just needed to buy more.  </li>
            <li>so glad i found this stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased it, but when I used it all up, was determined to find a more affordable alternative.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I then bought more items from this line.  </li>
            <li>It did leave my skin smoother and with a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was using Oil of Lay (which I had used for many years.)  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used anything else since and will attest to the fact that is one of the greatest products for facial exfoliation ever!!!!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a better result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will ordor more.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet very effective.  </li>
            <li>so when I found this I was very excited given the amount that its selling for on amazon.</li>
            <li>but afterwards your face feels so clean and nice.</li>
            <li>Great product and would that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>my skin is in great condition normally</li>
            <li>However, she was a insanely gorgeous young woman with the most amazing Romanian accent.</li>
            <li>I read the good and not so good reviews about Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling, nonetheless, I leaned towards the 179 reviewers who 5 stared this product.  </li>
            <li>I was really dissappointed because I love the product and thought I found it for a good price.  </li>
            <li>This product came perfectly packaged, brand new, and it does exactly what was demonstrated at the kiosk (for$150)</li>
            <li>I am very, very particular about my skin and believe me it pays off using good products and a regimented program for your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has gotten more smooth and clearer since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work great so far.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin more patchy than smooth</li>
            <li>It is brighter, smooth and more even already</li>
            <li>For a first time peel user, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>so do many sscrubs that are cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I absolutely love &amp; now that I found it cheaper</li>
            <li>Find it does a great job exfoliating and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>and I can say it is good and works really well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real worth.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and am super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have to say I loved how it made my skin feel, but wow the price was a slap in the face!!!</li>
            <li>It may sound like my skin would be super irritated, but honestly my skin has never been clearer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>face is so smooth and feels very clean.</li>
            <li>After rinsing with cool water, I&#x27;ve had to literally scrub it from my skin!  </li>
            <li>How sweet!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad Amazon carries it  because this product is definitely worth using and I will be ordering it again and again!</li>
            <li>When I got home, I read the instructions that said to do a \\&quot;test area\\&quot; first, and I&#x27;m certainly glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product you see and feel it working the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see how my face looks after using it more.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product in a mall and paid quite a bit more than what I did on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only have problems after the product was exposed to humid air after awhile as water neutralizes this product which is great truthfully.</li>
            <li>but you can get it off easily by using any exfoliating/facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>extremely easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this product it does clean your skin.</li>
            <li>I stood strong.</li>
            <li>It is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at the mall and liked the way it worked.  </li>
            <li>Hands down best product ever.</li>
            <li>Because it will roll in balls and sticks to the fine hairs you have on your face...</li>
            <li>if you have even baby fine hairs it will stick like balled up glue.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and leaves my face feel smooth .</li>
            <li>I quickly tried rubbing this peel between my two fingers and behold!</li>
            <li>If you are lucky enough to get your acne under control makeup doesn&#x27;t glide on or look very good because your skin in no way looks moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am glad that it is on Amazon.com, much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>Best exfoliater of all time, hands down!</li>
            <li>I could tell a huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li>It left my face silky smooth and looking great.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>so I buy 3-4 at a time esp because it is free shipping over $25.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and silky, and I can&#x27;t wait for day four to come around</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this weekly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>We are in our 50&#x27;s and my face has never been so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my face that night and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth in years.</li>
            <li>This peeling gel is certainly worth much more than it is being sold for on amazon - I bought for my sister, my mother, and two friends (</li>
            <li>Best product for removing dead skin and also polishes as well.</li>
            <li>Happy facial peeling!</li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>and I immediately put on a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth after I do and application.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin smooth, but not what I thought based on the description o &amp;#34;facial peeling&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>but my face is smooth.</li>
            <li>Bought this way more than it was worth, and I would return it if I could.</li>
            <li>I was in Las Vegas a few years ago, and loved it!!</li>
            <li>skin feels incredibly smooth, shiny and downy after.</li>
            <li>I think there must be some light acids in the product that do this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone who thinks exfoliating is important as we age.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for some years now and found amazon to be the most economical</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, but not irritating.</li>
            <li>My skin is fresh looking and more supple.  </li>
            <li>my skin was sooo smooth after one application.</li>
            <li>When I found this product so cheap</li>
            <li>My skin felt fantastic after using this peel.  </li>
            <li>Much more worth it for the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>I like the smell of the day cream and my face does feel smooth after using.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting a \\&quot;deal\\&quot;) and was a bit upset to see it SO CHEAP on amazon...</li>
            <li>so hopefully soon people will ONLY buy it on amazon lol</li>
            <li>I got accosted at the mall today by a smooth talker.  </li>
            <li>I only bought this product because of the great reviews, but I should of listen to the people who give it a 1 star.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product is sooooo cheap online.</li>
            <li>This truly takes off dead skin cells and skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>I rub lightly until it beads up  </li>
            <li>My face felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Anyway I guess I am actually happy for once to have been approached by a salesperson, otherwise I would not have discovered the facial peel.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL SMOOTH AFTER ONE USE</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on as smooth as can be without flakes showing up.</li>
            <li>Got on Amazon and for $12.99 and free shipping I ordered my day moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>I alway make sure my wife has this stuff, it makes her skin have a glow, and she rarely gets breakout using this and taking vitamins (E and C).</li>
            <li>The ingredients are not even available on the product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and moisturized after each use.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and works well with the day and night creams.</li>
            <li>My skin fells so smooth.  </li>
            <li>My family noticed how smooth my face is and the blemishes are fading..</li>
            <li>using once a week works great, hope it last longer that I expect.</li>
            <li>I also bought this product from a smooth talking salesman in Las Vegas for $49.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also light</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the dead skin that came off my wrist, but</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, my blackheads are disappearing, and there has been no redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>It is scent free.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I thought \\&quot;what a great deal!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>FEELS so smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a great facial peeling gel.</li>
            <li>This feels more like an exfoliator than a skin peel which I love because it is so gentle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I have fair, slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh and smells good.</li>
            <li>online really ticks me off!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly like the one I saw at the mall but cheaper from Amazon!!</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and fresh!  </li>
            <li>Makes the skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Afterward though, my face feels so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and see and feel immediate results.</li>
            <li>It feels very gentle on my face; no abrasives like most scrubs.  </li>
            <li>But, the price seemed kind of high to me.</li>
            <li>This facial peel is amazing!</li>
            <li>this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.</li>
            <li>Get rid of all the old skin &amp; dirt very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Originally I got it from my cousin who paid $60 at the mall kiosk like others did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s peeling my skin still.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a bit of a skeptic, but this line of products are really awesome!  </li>
            <li>I use this twice a week, and it has made a significant difference in the smoothness and delicacy of my skin.</li>
            <li>He told me that the product is originally $80</li>
            <li>I bought this product at the mall n paid a lot of money thinking that it was going to work ,so I was excited to get it</li>
            <li>I think my experience with this product is unique.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since my Dad gifted me my first jar in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>for this price please, its worth trying!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to start using it again.</li>
            <li>This is a friendly way to do it.  </li>
            <li>My sister claimed since using the set her rosacea has diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Shame, I was SO excited about this peel.  </li>
            <li>Also, I thank Amazon retailers for offering a much more reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the investment!  </li>
            <li>This item arrived unsealed, which lead me to believe it was not the original, but rather a used item that was refilled with something else.</li>
            <li>At first I felt duped into wasting a lot of money but after thinking about it I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>So I searched Amazon for it and it was way cheaper and so worth it!</li>
            <li>but these products were so worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product from the first time I have used it.</li>
            <li>I became aware of this product after receiving an e-mail from amazon regarding their \\&quot;top selling\\&quot; moisturizers (in which the day cream was featured.</li>
            <li>Wish I had reviewed the product first, but like most of you I had never heard of it.  </li>
            <li>The product is pretty okay</li>
            <li>A good facial brush scrubber like the Olay Pro worked great the next time I used the product.  </li>
            <li>I received mine but wasn&#x27;t yet done with my original.</li>
            <li>Originally, I discovered this product in the mall.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in Vegas the first time and paid a lot more for it than I did on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am a self proclamined beauty buff and bought this stuff because the reivews were pretty high, and I am always looking for a good peel.</li>
            <li>To test this out, I rubbed some product on some clean plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial scrubs over the years, but I&#x27;ve never used one that was this effective.</li>
            <li>Helps my face stay clean of acne</li>
            <li>If you think you have clean armpits, try it and think again.</li>
            <li>I clean my armpits with this peel twice a week</li>
            <li>my skin has just become more and more sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I have amazing smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li>When you think your face is clean....</li>
            <li>I bet if I would come home with some, put that on a piece of CLEAN, just bleached plastic</li>
            <li>It does, however, make me wonder if my skin is now more sensitive to sunburning since the top layer has been removed.</li>
            <li>clean it gets stuck in the peach fuz on my face.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals or smells and this is such a great price!</li>
            <li>Great combination and my skin looked radiant, pink and felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin visibly clean.</li>
            <li>leaving a clean &amp; radiant glow to your face.  </li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use that is the main reason for using it.  </li>
            <li>And at first I thought it was great, but I&#x27;m a licensed Aesthetician and I kept wondering if that much skin could really come off after every use.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this even for sensitive skin but don&#x27;t use it more than once a week!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special for my skin.</li>
            <li>Same exact product and worked great.</li>
            <li>But, once I try this, for myself...I will give my true reviews.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t drying on my face and it&#x27;s not irritating either.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to buy it, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>had I paid full price however!&lt;br /&gt;However, as for this product - I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>If it were really peeling your skin, they&#x27;d having SPF warnings and it would have more of a drying effect.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I found out about Vivo Per Lei from a very persistent kiosk salesman in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true-</li>
            <li>also posts that say its not ur skin, its the product...not true.</li>
            <li>and I still love it as much as I did then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product and I&#x27;ve bought it several times since (for under $10 on Amazon!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup and take good care of my skin, so I don&#x27;t understand why its still peeping the same way</li>
            <li>the product is as good as the 24K option, yet not a pricey and works the same.</li>
            <li>Bought some in vegas and paid way too much, here the price was reasonable, works awesome, look so much younger when I use it</li>
            <li>This is a really cool product.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it doesnt have that good of a smell to it.</li>
            <li>I am an esthetician, looking for a good product for peeling, this peeling product not only burning my face and also burning my finger.</li>
            <li>At night, again cleanse with the Olay total effects wipes (really awesome for getting off eye make-up &amp; it makes your face feel like you have applied a light serum), follow with Roc Night Deep Wrinkle Repair (Retinol)&amp; Roc retinol eye cream.</li>
            <li>For all who think it is the gel balling up it isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>That is true to an extent.</li>
            <li>This product cost me the same it would have in store after shipping however it was a good buy</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most impotant thing is that contains SD alcohol which is very damaging to skin, therefore I trought it to garbage</li>
            <li>So it is not such a good deal after all.</li>
            <li>The sales lady was sweet and knowledgable, and gave my son a double-sided mirror to play with.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff, and will continue using it, but they should really get rid of those people in the malls selling products for all kinds of prices,</li>
            <li>The real stuff is light in color, has no smell, leaves skin smooth and the consistency is light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it so much</li>
            <li>3rd time refill purchased, enjoy very much &amp; love it -- easy to use and the texture is smooth - recommendated</li>
            <li>I did love this at first, but its really just nothing more then lifting the very top layer of dry skin, you have to wash to get the pores cleaned out.</li>
            <li>my skin feels very clean; ready for my cream.  </li>
            <li>and I believe that&#x27;s due in a great part to this product.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old, very fair skinned (white blond, as a child).</li>
            <li>I really, really like this product, but I doubt I would have bought it again if I couldn&#x27;t get it for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it shipped andarrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This facial item was bought for my wife and in my observation she is enjoying the product and seems to be well satisfied.</li>
            <li>and my skin has been clearing up tremendously.</li>
            <li>If there was some way to speak to an authority who chooses in Las Vegas in particular hotels who to put into a kiosk here and there, I would love to speak to them and let them know what this company is doing to its&#x27; clients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed nice but was much too pricey, then they just kept dropping the price which really made me doubt the product.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it was $6 when I decided to buy it, never buy from mall kiosks.</li>
            <li>This facial peel is the only thing that I have ever been impressed by.</li>
            <li>Love it; better than a salon facial!</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea on my face and the redness decreases immediately after using it, and smooths out the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff too makes skin feel like its soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for such a great place to shop for my favorites.</li>
            <li>Like many of the below complaints, I too was suckered into paying a high price for this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried endless products and this by far is one of the best!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing - great price too - this is my second purchase - my skin looks terrific - great wrinkle treatment, as it clears away tons of dead skin!</li>
            <li>It works well and is gentle on my skin, which seems to get more and more sensitive</li>
            <li>They sweet talked me and spouted a bunch of BS, and they tried to pawn this on me for $99 claiming it was worth $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also a bargain, so I will keep using it as long as my skin is looking and feeling this good.</li>
            <li>It removes all the dead skin, leaving my skin beautiful and glowing.  </li>
            <li>It literally removes all the dead skin and gunk in my pores revealing the beautiful, refreshed and glowing skin hiding underneath.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for the \\&quot;new, best thing\\&quot; in skincare, since I started noticing my first fine lines a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different facial scrubs, but this is by far the best exfoliating product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I thought I had found a good deal with this purchase from Amazon, but the scrub is diluted and takes 3-4 times as much to do the same as my original (from the mall).</li>
            <li>I think most of these products are more effective when used on dry skin not wet skin.  </li>
            <li>I first experimented with hers and was pleased with the results -- we were in Florida and my skin was absolutely misbehaving.  </li>
            <li>I have reordered this almost in BULK because as is usual with a good regiment, the manufacturers either change the formula not for the better or discontinue because of lack of sales.</li>
            <li>Product works pretty good, but I&#x27;ve used a another that was a little better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, I can&#x27;t tell you how many moisturizers, foundations, and body lotions I have given away b/c they caused breakouts or rashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s works really well for my skin !!</li>
            <li>Especially when I know better than to buy into a mall kiosk gimmick!</li>
            <li>This product worked exactly as it says!  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this product if u want to feel extra clean, and smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative for an exfoliate scrub and isn&#x27;t as abrasive as those little beads can be.</li>
            <li>The original has many more of the dark scrubbing  particles in it than this one.</li>
            <li>I was solicited at the Flamingo Las Vegas by hackers in the isle offering a free (haha) sample of this product using Dr. Oz&#x27; name as an endorser of this product.  </li>
            <li>This really leaves my skin so smooth and clears out the pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product, that&#x27;s versatile to be used on troublesome areas such as elbows, knuckles and ankles</li>
            <li>Came in real fast.  </li>
            <li>I used it and at the time, thought it was actually worth the money.</li>
            <li>My experience is that most skin care products do not deliver on what they promise, so I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty cool how it works..</li>
            <li>Maybe this product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it&#x27;s certinately worth the $21 risk to find out.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not skin, then it&#x27;s not dangerous to use it repeatedly.</li>
            <li>My skin is definately smoother and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>I see a difference in my skin tone and dryness from using and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>He was nice enough,</li>
            <li>Great facial peeling even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite day cream by far.</li>
            <li>This cream is worth the cost on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money on amazon tho.</li>
            <li>bottom line is this product doe its job and is a fun way to keep you on your face regimen just because its so fun to see the gunk come off.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at the mall nearly two years ago and LOVED how smooth it left my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>well that is a complete lie because i tried rubbing it on my counter top</li>
            <li>With this my skin is so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54yrs old, so I&#x27;ve tried MANY products...looking to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the lower prices.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the price</li>
            <li>To be fair, I used not JUST the facial peel but a whole vivo per lei system.</li>
            <li>Once a week is plenty to keep your face fresh.</li>
            <li>It reveal fresh layer of the skin.</li>
            <li>is I rub about a dimes worth on my forehead, a dimes worth on each cheek, and a dimes worth my chin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Honestly, after using this several times I don&#x27;t know that this was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s prices are far better than the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; at the mall.</li>
            <li>I would rare this a 25 if I could..</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning my facial skin and leaves my face very soft and clean feeling and lookiong.</li>
            <li>The entire day my face takes on a beautiful glow and is less oily and more porcelain like.</li>
            <li>This product lasts for over a year (even with my husband using it), but I sent the link to my mom and aunt because of the other awesome products by the same company.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying other better products from better brands.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I purchased in the mall (but not for significantly more than on this site.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products.  </li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly and is doing exactly what my granddaughter needed.  </li>
            <li>The peel DOES however, remove the dead layer of skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I am impressed and will continue to use the facial peel as long as I can buy it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It took us a while to find the right price for the product,but we found it here.</li>
            <li>Right now I have used Arbonne sunscreen for about 6 months and like it.  </li>
            <li>The reviews about the salesman are right on.  </li>
            <li>I always use right before I shower.  </li>
            <li>so I wonder if it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type.</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>This stuff gets those right off</li>
            <li>She noticed right away that I have acne, sun spots and acne marks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it right away at the mall kiosk</li>
            <li>I literally had dreams about it and every time I looked at my face and thought about exfoliating this stuff popped right to my mind.  </li>
            <li>You literally rub the gel into your skin on your face in circular motions and all the skin just comes right off.</li>
            <li>The price was right before i run out of it</li>
            <li>I had tried their amazing nail kit a couple of years ago and thought it was pretty low quality too.</li>
            <li>Great and works better than the super Expensive items</li>
            <li>Really helps clean my face.  </li>
            <li>Baby smooth fine pored skin on the top of mind hand would NOT produce that much dead skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway they offered me a special deal (again, haha)</li>
            <li>I usually put on Cephalin lotion afterwards because it is a great non-comedogenic lotion I read about online</li>
            <li>When I used it to wash my face ,it does rarely work at the first time I cover it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for way too much at a shopping center kiosk, but was still glad I did because I love the product.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so great about this products is that it doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin to get the dead skin off!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, true to description.</li>
            <li>I figured it was a knock off, but my first positive experience was how quick</li>
            <li>I repeat the next day and am really happy with the results following this routine.</li>
            <li>(you can get this anywhere) and am happy with how it feels and am able to be diligent using acne medications without fear of lousy counterproductive results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works as described, and it&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap the prices are on here, and the only thing I can imagine is if they are that cheap on amazon, there must be something fishy all together with the company and products being sold.  </li>
            <li>This product was super gentle (which you may not expect from a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am prone to cystic acne and this helps to remove the dead skin on top of the cyst so that it resolves itself much more</li>
            <li>Used it on dry face then washed off with warm water.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to completely wash off.</li>
            <li>New product added to my skin care regimen!!!</li>
            <li>They all make these great promises that consistently fall short and leave you with low expectations for anything else.</li>
            <li>Fast, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My facial skin is fine but my finger tips are injured!</li>
            <li>Very, very.</li>
            <li>I was also a accosted at the mall kiosk by a very very pushy salesman.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very intense exfoliant...</li>
            <li>I got this at the mall last year and still have some of it, have sensitive dry skin with allergies and this product has no smell and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Do not use with too much water other wise</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product at a kiosk in a Mall in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels light, clear, and airy after using this product, which hs rare, considering I have large pores, oily/combination skin, and--at 27--the beginnings of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of what its actually doing, i know the end results is that i have a clean, poreless face and it feels nice and just on the verge of being a tad dry (the squeaky clean feeling if you will)</li>
            <li>I was hit up pretty hard in Vegas at the Rio, like a lot of you were lol.</li>
            <li>After using you feel and look like you have new CLEAN refreshed skin</li>
            <li>deep cleans and sheds all that top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I was introduced to this product was at the mall.</li>
            <li>What I love about the night cream is that you don&#x27;t have to use it daily.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it some of my skin lifted to come off</li>
            <li>I did much better the 2nd time around!</li>
            <li>She first tried it out on a Vegas trip and ever since she&#x27;s been using it.</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if the evening of my skin tone will be more prominent or permanent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pissed!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product once before in the local mall and paid more for it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for the first time while on vacation in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>The product works and does make the skin really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After my first night of using this, I am amazed.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much for an area you are cleansing!</li>
            <li>I just rub off what is willing to come off in one application not forcing it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have tried SOOOO many different products and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li>My mom even asked what I had done to my face after the first couple of times I used the product.  </li>
            <li>The product is pretty and expensive-looking.</li>
            <li>If anyone has feedback on what they think it might be, I&#x27;m interested to hear what you have to say.</li>
            <li>Will use regularly, see if my skin starts looking better and revisit this review.</li>
            <li>(persistent pretty salesgirl...)</li>
            <li>I think most people see results because they WANT to see results, not because it actually works.  </li>
            <li>its pretty packaging</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the most out of this I would recommend the following procedure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Just after using this for the first time, my face felt smoother and healthier.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still surprised at how smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li>than i use noxema to gently wash my face and it feels like silk when i lather after using this scrub!</li>
            <li>anyway, as the sales man was demonstrating on my hand how it worked, my boyfriend was looking on his phone, i didn&#x27;t know what he was doing at first until the sales man said &amp;#34;he must be looking on ebay or</li>
            <li>it did the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans and my face feels fresh</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in many years and deep set clogged pores and acne are finally starting to improve without creating psoriasis break outs or aggravation.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll use it and from now on be sure to by it on amazon only!!!!</li>
            <li>Too many of the posts are very similar in wording, and saying kiosks are a scam</li>
            <li>This is a real review!  </li>
            <li>Skin was more toned, younger looking, clearer, softer, with a more even complexion and smaller pores.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of how it works, what matters is that it really does work!</li>
            <li>Many products make me breakout or get red and itchy.</li>
            <li>I will continue buying my product here ;)</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I was amazed the first time I used this product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely going to keep getting more when I run out, but I expect that won&#x27;t happen for about a year.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product when the salespeople at the mall stopped me.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend first bought this product from a stand in the mall.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this facial peel.</li>
            <li>She made a $120.00 profit off me and I am sure I am not the only one.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have seen this one first.  </li>
            <li>I used this about 4 years ago and it worked better back then&lt;</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a knock off version</li>
            <li>Thanks again amazon!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad to find this online at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>When I ran out I planned on returning but checked out Amazon first.</li>
            <li>I love this facial peel.  </li>
            <li>Pretty package though.</li>
            <li>I even tested this peel when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>I look more than 15 years younger using it.  </li>
            <li>I really do!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I was happy to find it in Amazon for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li>The balled up mixture was more of an off white and not gray.</li>
            <li>glad I finally got to try this product.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more soon for my friends and family</li>
            <li>Im sure the dead skin is really not skin but chemical reaction from the gel, but I dont care, my skin still feels great.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to look 10yrs younger but smoother healthy skin</li>
            <li>I love the facial peel, toner, moisture day cream &amp; night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love these products enough that I would spend the money</li>
            <li>Exactly like the over priced stuff at the mall.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I paid $70 for the scrub &amp; moisturizer - double the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li>I am getting married in a month and my fiance and I were walking around the mall when we were grabbed by a pushy sales girl selling Vivo products.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t complain too much, I&#x27;ll just laugh because I got suckered.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>The first jar I purchased was at the mall for $30.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as consistently as I should, but I can always tell the difference in my skin afterward.  </li>
            <li>First thing I did when i got home</li>
            <li>I could not get it off with rubbing alcohol, vaseline or hot washcloths.</li>
            <li>My first purchase of this product was from a kiosk at the mall.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I am able to purchase 5 of their products for approx $70.00 in total.  </li>
            <li>Worked the first time, never worked afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was scammed the first time I purchased this in a mall at a kiosk for about $100.</li>
            <li>Every now and again, there is a product you buy that the second you are out, you have to immediately get more.</li>
            <li>Then he added the facial cream for $29 more plus tax.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product while vacationing in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li>first time I bought some it was at the mall.</li>
            <li>Love this facial peeling.</li>
            <li>I first found out about these when in las VEgas at a casino who had a store but was offering the 2 products for about $349.  </li>
            <li>So, I googled this product and saw that Amazon sold it for a MUCH CHEAPER PRICE!  </li>
            <li>keeps the skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It works best when applied to dry skin and you will notice the amount of dead skin removed will vary depending on the length of time between each use.  </li>
            <li>Just like most people I got way overcharged for this in the kiosk at the mall but never the less this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This leaves residue on my face that will not be removed unless I intensely scrub it off which never happened to me with the previous one I owned and loved.</li>
            <li>The little sample was good for 4 mornings, don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>:) I felt my face had been dull for a lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li>This product has help keep my face clean and clear of acne as well.  </li>
            <li>I loved it the first few times but after that I noticed It was sticking to my fine facial hair</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>And it only does good work after i have covered it and washed my face the third time.</li>
            <li>It has made my pores smaller and leaves my face smooth, glowing, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I cant really say if it works or not yet but for me it was very easy to get off and didnt leave my skin dry at all.</li>
            <li>, they know how to smooth talk and flatter you like no other man can</li>
            <li>Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li>I kept thinking about trying it on a smooth surface with latex gloves on to make sure its not a well disguised scam (I&#x27;m very skeptic, usually if its too good its not true).</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start on the positive side.</li>
            <li>I also have a unique skin situation that leaves my elbows dry and gray, which has been lovingly called \\&quot;zombie elbow\\&quot; by some friends with similar issues.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the best way to exfoliate your skin is to use a clean wash cloth and plain water, and just scrub in small circular motions with your fingers.  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought this it was because I was pressured into it by a very pushy salesperson at a kiosk.</li>
            <li>Price was much cheaper on Amazon than when I first bought in Vegas.  </li>
            <li>I have really good skin, very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fun, but I can live with it.  </li>
            <li>I thought there would be lot more dry skin coming off.</li>
            <li>I do think the product is interesting and it does seem to peel some dry skin off my face when used, but how do others feel about the products being sold on Amazon from this company?</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so smooth and does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have hyperkeratosis just my hands and feet, so when the fall/winter comes or just by being in the a/c or doing chores I get calloused but with the fall/winter my knuckles and top of my fingers get severely dry and ashy and it gets so dry</li>
            <li>When I used it dry that did not occur and I had much better results.</li>
            <li>This is a miracle facial and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>And... I have super sensitive skin and get reactions off of anything and this stuff gives me no reaction whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Well it leaves my skin feeling super super soft afterwards, with no harsh burning at all.  </li>
            <li>Will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is so nice because you simple smooth on the gel, wait a few minutes, and gently rub it off!</li>
            <li>As soon as got the bright idea to use it in shower, I fell victim to ,the teeny tiny balled up product stuck on the peach fuzz on my face, thing some people have been talking about.</li>
            <li>But at myself mainly because I should have know not trust those people!  </li>
            <li>It is amazing the amount of people believing that those little polymer balls is their skin rubbing off -_-  </li>
            <li>I use this in the shower once a week and it rinses off nicely with just a little hand scrub.</li>
            <li>feel little Burning sensation kind&#x27;a feeling if use it for longer period.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and takes in the Day Cream very well!!</li>
            <li>It gently scrubs off the dead cells, leaves your skin really fine and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I got back home, I used it on my son and husband with the same amazing results.</li>
            <li>I use several of the products together for the total effect, but for me this one has been an amazing cure.</li>
            <li>all dead cell and dirt is amazing</li>
            <li>Not sure what exactly it does, but it feels amazing and makes your skill feel new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle yet makes&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivered fast</li>
            <li>It gently takes away the dead skin cells from my face and neck to give me a more fresh look and feel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I owned a Tanning Salon and some of my customers would purchase their tanning lotions much cheaper online.  </li>
            <li>I really hope this works as well as it did in the mall.</li>
            <li>I am 49 and this has really helped improve tone and texture.</li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week, and I feel that it really helps my complexion...making my face look and feel brighter.  </li>
            <li>I have used too much and over-exfoliated parts of my face.  </li>
            <li>(I have very oily skin).</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see or feel that it is doing anything.  </li>
            <li>I got home and absolutely luv this product.  </li>
            <li>It takes a complete layer of dead skin off your face leaving it smooth without the sensitivity that most peels provider.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t believe how much yuck is built up on our outer skin.</li>
            <li>The guy was really persistent, but I was determined not to buy a thing.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a facial peel that is natural, safe, and really works.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I tried to see if the dirt was just how the product was made or if it was really my skin...</li>
            <li>Either way, I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a lot from this after reading the reviews, but this really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It makes the whole &#x27;peeling&#x27; experience on anything-</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>The lady at the mall kiosk was very persuasive and got me to try the Vivo Per Lei on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I give it one star because she has no choice , but not really deserve any star, better water makes your skin defect in the cream , the money should reenbolsar all person who have .</li>
            <li>but omg just gel that doesnt really go on or peel off anything</li>
            <li>Leave it on for about 2-5 minutes as you get ready for your shower.  </li>
            <li>skin.&lt;br /&gt;I found a reasonable price on Amazon, so I continue to use it</li>
            <li>All of the peeling skin was immediately gone- smooth, and not irritated like it would be with a regular exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li>Wanted to see results but didn&#x27;t really notice any change.</li>
            <li>Go to the mall and pay $55 for this product if u really need it.</li>
            <li>They will try to squeeze as much from you and try to make</li>
            <li>Then I go home on amazon and see that they are all here for much much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Found at a mall, resisted the sales lady and found it here for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>However, I had a very severe allergic reaction to the peel.</li>
            <li>So much so I ended up on Prednisone.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and it was so gentle and non erritating</li>
            <li>difinetley recommend this product, it really works.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used it that much as yet.  </li>
            <li>I hope I can continue to get this product because I really like it.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed but $90 was crazy.</li>
            <li>but when i used it on my face, SOOO much came off.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I did not notice much of a fragrance</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it is really exfoliating, or if it&#x60;s just the product &amp;#34;balling&amp;#34; up as you rub it on.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it!,,,</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle and doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>But that really doesn&#x27;t reflect on the product- it does reflect on the outlet in the Vegas mall (and myself!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try rubbing it on any smooth surface, even glass, and you will get the same resuts.  </li>
            <li>The item is working very well</li>
            <li>In about 3-4 days I received it, that night I did what the directions instructed and was amazed of how much peeling I was experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really really like it.</li>
            <li>a if I use too much.  </li>
            <li>I am taking the time to do this because I really do like this product</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think the product would really work.  </li>
            <li>So, thank you pesky sales guy for believing in a product so much that you will annoy me at the mall</li>
            <li>I got it fast and used it</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li>Either way, I don&#x27;t give a flying fart if its really my skin peeling or not...</li>
            <li>It really does get the dry/dead skin off your face.</li>
            <li>Not irritating on my skin, at all.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thinking if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll really see the skin coming</li>
            <li>She was very persistent, I kept trying to walk away until she put some of the scrub on my arm.  </li>
            <li>, oh she gave me an extra stone &amp; mud bar for free..</li>
            <li>Amazon sells the real deal.</li>
            <li>and ( FAST SHIPPING )</li>
            <li>It is gentle.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>product really works.</li>
            <li>I put the product on my inner wrist because I know this area is normally free from wrinkles, oil, blackheads, whiteheads, sun damage, etc</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin after using this product it was so much softer</li>
            <li>But what this seller shipped me was not the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really want to try and buy again</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s done its thing and is ready to be rinsed off.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to genetics</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really takes year&#x27;s off your skin....</li>
            <li>this ones the real deal..</li>
            <li>And You Could Really Notice A Change In Your Face Color</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in my face &amp; the wrinkly lines around my eyes &amp; mouth.  </li>
            <li>i bought this item at a mall from a very pushy israeli woman.</li>
            <li>this company is very misleading and practices unethical business.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see my skin really take any benefits from this.</li>
            <li>and thanks Olesea</li>
            <li>: Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of the face peel and moisturizer</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for exfoliating your face!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  </li>
            <li>It removes the top layer of dead skin better than any facial peel or skin care product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works and cleans the pores of the skin really well.</li>
            <li>and now she wants me to by some for all the girls in the family.</li>
            <li>Husband loves that he gets a very close shave after using.</li>
            <li>i got this at the mall and paid way to much , i compared the boxes when i recieved this in the mail</li>
            <li>However, the stuff I got from amazon, seller touchdown, was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I know that you can get the real product online as my mom got her real product from amazon.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is really a scrub.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it because afterwards your skin is soft and moisturized (but not to an oily degree).</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Really exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>After two uses my skin feels so much smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li>I stated using this as it stated two times a week, I have increased it to three times a week, and I&#x27;m careful to make sure to thoroughly wash my face completely to make sure that there is no trace of it left over on my face and my skin looks and</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the good and negative reviews before buying the peel.</li>
            <li>I have always had dry skin and genetically have more lines than friends my age or older.  </li>
            <li>It works, but it&#x27;s not amazing or anything, just does what it says, its a really light peel, more of an exfolient.  </li>
            <li>and it removes all of the dead skin cells from my face, leaving it feeling very fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li>i was getting the the real deal not a very expensive gule substance.</li>
            <li>Then she put the peel under my eye and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Well, I was very pleasantly surprised that I actually did see significant, immediate results!  </li>
            <li>Used other brands, and I found this one is just much better.</li>
            <li>As many other people on here, I was scammed by the sales rep.</li>
            <li>As for my skin now in my subjective opinion, it has a more even quality, my pores seem smaller, and there is a general glowy quality that all girls adore!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I bought a second jar from here and it is exactly the same and outstanding quality that I remember experiencing.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I too, was approached by kiosk salesperson.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 2 years now and haven&#x27;t found any other product that works better or faster than this one.</li>
            <li>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, I originally purchased this product from the stands in the middle of the mall, which in turn cost me a ton of money!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good facial peel for a long time, but have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I know there&#x27;s this huge issue on it being a &amp;#34;scam&amp;#34; especially the ingredients, but I know that my face hasn&#x27;t been this soft EVER!!</li>
            <li>It does leave the skin real soft and smooth though and I will definitely use it sparingly (once a week)</li>
            <li>Then you splash your face with water, rinse it off, and you are left with a squeaky clean, glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I checked the prices on Amazon while in the store and negotiated him down to a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have to keep wiping in downward as the tiny particles tend to want to stick to any fine facial hair but the improved appearance in my skin afterward is worth it.</li>
            <li>this works great to remove all of that dry &amp; dead skin.</li>
            <li>Much like face peels, more stuff comes off around the mouth and chin and less on the forehead.</li>
            <li>However I do believe that the product is working and is not solely the formula clumping up due to some type of thermal reaction or friction (insert other possibilities lol) because as i rub more of the product on, the less it clumps up and remains in its gel consistency and mind</li>
            <li>It was quite amazing how it removed dead skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing the results you can get with a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how it works, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Buying it online makes it affordable, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>When using this product you have to be aware that it may take a bit of time and effort to completely take it off your face.</li>
            <li>a recent family vacation my aunt, a true product junkie</li>
            <li>It is a bit on the watery side compaired to higher end products like Nava Natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get how it works, but it definitely does &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the top layer of skin off your face without any burning, redness, irritation, scrubbing or abrasion- instantly.</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin was soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li>After washing the product off your face; which by the way is a bit of a pain as the little balls are all over, your face does feel clean but nothing special by any stretch.&lt;br /&gt;There are many lines out there similar to Vivo Per Lei such as Donna Bella &amp; D&#x27;or</li>
            <li>All these little pills stuck to my skin and the fine peach fuzz on my face, and no matter what I tried to get it off, it would not come off!</li>
            <li>So when the scrub was about half gone, I started searching the internet for a better price.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I hit puberty, I have almost no black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to remove some wrinkles that come with age and sun damage, but even then the facial peel and day time moisturizer does not irritate my skin and I will definitely be buying it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The product does ball up but it is also picking up dead skin in the process (gross i know, yet fascinating).</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no inherent justice in this world though, and so I spent most of my twenties battling acne and my early thirties trying to undo all the acne damage.</li>
            <li>I will not use it again, and would like to suggest that if you are an older person with thinner skin, you should avoid this product.</li>
            <li>face will look and feel youthful and vibrant when you are done.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older (I&#x27;m almost 30)</li>
            <li>How I found out about this product is when I went to visit my older sister.  </li>
            <li>My skin was left soft and smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li>He mainly uses it for ingrown hairs around his neck.</li>
            <li>reasonable priced and works better than any I have ever tried and I have tried quite a few in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>I use it on forehead, cheeks and the bridge of the nose mainly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People that have chemistry knowledges should know better, if not a simple search on wikipedia about the ingredients should be enough.</li>
            <li>the older I get.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am also very sensitive, and this absolutely hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very soft and moisture absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and allergic to almost everything I put on my face, but this is gentle and works for me.</li>
            <li>After applying in the same area right after... Not that much skin rolled off.</li>
            <li>even the day after i bought it, my left hand that she showed me on was so much softer than my right.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to every women out there who is into their beauty.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work by grinding off the surface cells like scrubs do, but works by dehydrating the surface cells with the high salt/mineral content.</li>
            <li>However, I still think the price was a bit high for the amount of product in the container.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I also use and highly recommend vivo day cream</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other facial peels and I have always felt very fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li>I am 26 years old with moderate adult acne and scarring, so I needed something different and a little more effective than my normal routine.</li>
            <li>NOT dead skin!!</li>
            <li>From the first time you use it, you can actually see the results, which I can&#x27;t say for many other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i saw this item at the mall and got it for less than half the price, i used it once a weeek- works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried waxing, electrolysis treatments, countless acne products like proactive, neutrogena, mary kay, clean and clear, etc</li>
            <li>BUT my skin is so soft and clean after only two days</li>
            <li>Skin feels very smooth directly after but the next day I&#x27;m back to flakes in areas.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nearly impossible to get off of your face if you have any kind of fine hair at all!  </li>
            <li>I have had ultra sensitive skin my whole life</li>
            <li>I put it on clean dry skin and wait 3 min and rub off with my fingers.</li>
            <li>for the one who said rub it on a balloon is wrong because she probably wasn&#x27;t wearing gloves lol.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect the product to work well, so I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see a huge amount of difference, but my skin looks renewed, so I will purchase at least one more jar in the future.</li>
            <li>produce works very well.does what its supposed to.face feels soft and looks good.i have never had a product like this before</li>
            <li>I got this on a whim at the mall (big mistake, buy it on here) but in my opinion, it was still completely worth</li>
            <li>vivo is normally 78 bucks in the store</li>
            <li>I purchase many dead sea products and a Vivo brochure came along with my order.  </li>
            <li>You put this on and start rubbing lightly on your face and pretty soon all the dead skin starts to come off.</li>
            <li>My older sister uses it less often because she has much more sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t believe what people say about being able to scrub off visible dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>Even my Clarisonic wasn&#x27;t able to rid my face of these dead skin cell balls.  </li>
            <li>I used it a few more times and have not used it for a while.</li>
            <li>I use the facial peel to remove the top layer of old skin at night band the next morning</li>
            <li>It makes my face glow by taking off the top layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from a mall kiosk a few years ago for MUCH MUCH more money.</li>
            <li>I rarely give a product 1 star, but if I could of give this facial peel</li>
            <li>IT PEELS THE TOP LAYER OF DEAD SKIN OFF WHEN YOU USE IT ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li>how many DEAD SKIN CELLS came off the bathroom counter...</li>
            <li>When you put products on the dead skin they sit on top.</li>
            <li>I understand many people believe it is the product itself that rolls into a ball and creates an illusion of being dead skin.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much the same review as everyone else.</li>
            <li>After using this product my skin feels pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>even when I use a buffing agent, when I use the vivo, I still get more dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I saw a definite reduction of crows feet and smile lines from using it every two days for 6 days...</li>
            <li>She does spit a good game.  </li>
            <li>Most facial cleansers and peelers leave my face dry, this product did not.</li>
            <li>i dry off my face each time before rubbing more on to the same area.</li>
            <li>I love all the products, I have never experienced quick results like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake one, I used this on my face (as it says use on a dry face and then clean off by using warm water) and as you&#x27;re rubbing your face it seems like it&#x27;s tiny pieces of paper that forms from the actual product</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m 4 hours out right now and am still picking off the white rolled bundles.  </li>
            <li>For those folks that left positive reviews, i can&#x27;t help thinking they are all connected to this rip off scheme!  </li>
            <li>Your dead skin lightly falls off within a minute to reveal soft smooth that your products can actually work with.</li>
            <li>I guess I was looking for more of a deep cleaning or exfoliating feeling - which may be my mistake with the purchase of this product if this is not what they are aiming for - but it is certainly not what I was expecting or particularly looking for.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth and it doesnt look as rough!</li>
            <li>Been using this product for two weeks no negative reaction so far!</li>
            <li>He showed me all these Vivo products when I said no he added three other products for free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a brand new product.  </li>
            <li>The lid did not seem brand new, therefore I&amp;#34;m</li>
            <li>When I purchased this through Amazon, it stated that it is new.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any new problem areas pop up.  </li>
            <li>My item seem used the seal was torn already and the box had some stains and indentations not at all brand new...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing stuff for gently &#x27;sloughing&#x27; off dead dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used Skin VIVO products before and liked them, so I decided to give this Dead Sea Minerals Facial Peeling a try.</li>
            <li>I used only a tiny bit of this product on the peeling areas, rubbed lightly in a circular motion, and rinsed off using Cetaphil soap.</li>
            <li>Excellent product to remove dead skin and revitalize a tired face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face super dry.</li>
            <li>you will get all these mini-balls of product attach to even the most minimal facial hair.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, the tone is more even, and I break out far less often!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li>Skin is very soft after use.  </li>
            <li>that while I&#x27;m not sure if I can give all the credit to the peeling product yet, I am highly satisfied,  but here are the facts- you decide (please disregard the fox news reference, its rhetoric is practically an invasive species where I live): This product immediately went to work on my face.</li>
            <li>Next time I will spring a little bit more for the real thing.</li>
            <li>as I went through it pretty quickly using it everyday.</li>
            <li>thats how it gently takes of ur layer of dry dead cells.and after rubbing it on ur DRY face, it rinses right off with warm water.</li>
            <li>They commented on how clear my skin is!  </li>
            <li>tried selling me the exact same product for 49.00.</li>
            <li>I still get pimples from time to time due to stress, but I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion has been significantly clearer.  </li>
            <li>first being $129.00 just for the facial peel!</li>
            <li>Nothing pisses me off more than a sham!</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft i lovet his stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be watching my credit card and make sure no more than what was charged is taken off of my card.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t get much in each jar, and I generally dislike products that are so wasteful with packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, aggressive sales</li>
            <li>: I first bought this product due to an extremely aggressive salesman in Las Vegas- like many others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually the type to fall for hard-sells, but it happened- lack of sleep, alcohol, friends....</li>
            <li>My skin looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I first tried this facial scrub when my sister came over for a visit.  </li>
            <li>I received the package, I compared to the bottle from vegas and was exactly the same.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft after using!</li>
            <li>and I paid a fraction of what I paid at the mall for the exact same product.</li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>I have exfoliated my whole body and barely made a dent in the container.</li>
            <li>Well, I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious to see that it is</li>
            <li>I am buying this for my wife, who currently lives overseas, and with some claims of residue I had to test it first before I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kiosk reps lead you to believe that the 24 months stated on the box will entitle you to a $10 refilled jar of products (Still higher than online product) if returned to the kiosk in 24 months when actually that is an expiration date.  </li>
            <li>It is not dead skin!  </li>
            <li>but I just received the SAME product here through amazon for obviously a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li>but your skin is amazingly soft after!</li>
            <li>It is the exact same stuff and is literally 1/5 the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed less and less skin coming off each week but does a good job but keep expectations in check.</li>
            <li>I like how this easily takes off the dead skin on face and makes skin feel so very soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a very gentle but effective exfoliator for my skin - a surprisingly difficult thing to find.  </li>
            <li>I have tried SO many different things and for me,Vivo &amp; Roc, far out perform any of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and suffer from psoriasis, live in an arid climate, have a tendency toward combination skin (along my face and neck) and am in my mid-30s.  </li>
            <li>The excess product and the dead skin wash away easily with lukewarm water.   </li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and just got married for the 2nd time, and our honeymoon was in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>More skin came off around my mouth and nose, as with normal face masks, and only a little came off my cheeks</li>
            <li>It leaves little \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot; and it seems that it attaches to the fine hairs on ones face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers have made a big deal about the fact that the white stuff that comes off as you scrub is not dead skin, which I think is pretty obvious the first time you use it because this gel is SO gentle.  </li>
            <li>Not happy, but should have known better than to cave in to sales pitch at a mall kiosk!</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin free of dead skin and looking completely new.</li>
            <li>It was only half filled!</li>
            <li>That only made me more exited about the product because now i know its not just spmething hidden within the ingerients.</li>
            <li>You can see the skin become more smooth and so much less dull.</li>
            <li>In high school, I would occasionally go to the tanning bed &amp; lay out in the sun (particularly before any type of formal dance/special event.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what in the ingredients would cause my skin to come off like that, particularly without any apparent drying agents in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t do any peeling, the only thing you peel off your face is this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested it on different parts of my body and some of that dead skin is much darker or much lighter than the rest and skin peels more or less depending on where I apply it or how much I&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li>The product is clear, and you can see that it takes off dirt, which isn&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li>That much skin removal would be the equivalent of a professional facial peel!</li>
            <li>Helps clear up acne too</li>
            <li>This product helped minimize my blackheads and clear up my acne</li>
            <li>and this product helps remove the dead skin and leaves my face smooth and does not damage my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I initially bought the product for $50 in Hawaii, and then I found it for much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to completely remove once applying.  </li>
            <li>I am 21 years old</li>
            <li>so you young ones can use this product also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as the mall, but much much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have been so busy with Christmas shopping , I have yet to take the time before showering to try it out.</li>
            <li>If you guys really want to see if the stuff rolling off is the product, you should get a pair of gloves and roll it around in the glove to see if the same thing happens.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Leaves skin baby soft</li>
            <li>I think it does leave my skin soft and makes it easier to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>far as this product goes: I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Are all these really the same manufacturer?  </li>
            <li>even the kitchen sink, so what is coming out may not be old skin after all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I actually saw &amp; felt results, and fast.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or know you are sensitive to methylisothiazolinone, I would recommend avoiding this product.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Prescription creams that actually work don&#x27;t even cost that much.</li>
            <li>Not at all like the 1st one I bought directly from the mall.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to see that the flakes are NOT dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>So many of those gritty, &#x27;peeling&#x27; exfoliators (even the ones with round &#x27;gentle&#x27; beads designed for daily use) just irritate my skin and trigger the oil glands to pump out oil.</li>
            <li>, i have sensitive skin that gets redness</li>
            <li>Soft, radiant skin in minutes....</li>
            <li>Not harsh and</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week in conjunction with daily use of Vivo Per Lei Gentle Milk cleanser and Vivo Per Lei day lotion and night cream.  </li>
            <li>again!!!!and of course it&#x27;s not refundable...same old story</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my deep-seated white heads have been fewer and fewer, and I try to use this 3 times a week with much success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought the Premier Facial Peel yesterday, and yes I too was lured in by the mall kiosk guy and paid too much.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin looking refreshed and feeling soft..</li>
            <li>That was NOT dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I later found out on Amazon and E-Bay that I paid too much, so please don&#x27;t get suckered into these mall Vivo pushers.  </li>
            <li>I think the product was old</li>
            <li>when i do use it, it makes my skin feel so baby soft.</li>
            <li>and so far my face is soft.</li>
            <li>The whole time the salesperson tried to convince us that this product on amazon was not the same thing!</li>
            <li>but nothing fixed my problem.</li>
            <li>and I assure you, what I received is real deal, in the same packaging as the Vegas store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After a day at work, you can come home and use the vivo facial peel, off comes the whole day of makeup and the air around you.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Proactiv Renewing Cleanser or Olay Professional Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old product...</li>
            <li>This product seems gentle enough and has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on the skin at all.  </li>
            <li>The material that you&#x27;ll see rubbing off is the balls melting from the heat/friction action.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of it before but was amazed by the amount of dead skin it took off my hand, and how smooth it felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>After much harrassing, he finally purchased.</li>
            <li>returned 5 days later, ready to buy the peel.</li>
            <li>For one it was browner in color, smells like glue, is thicker in consistency and DOES NOT leave your skin soft.</li>
            <li>It cleans away dead skin, and leaves a smooth finish on your face.  </li>
            <li>my face and neck have not been this soft or clear since i as a teenager.</li>
            <li>I love it, it actually feels like you are taking off all of the dead skin.</li>
            <li>(more often than recommended).&lt;br /&gt;The white globs of gel that form as you scrub are sticky - they are carrying away the dead skin cells that you are scrubbing off.  </li>
            <li>Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using a facial peel (like Vivo Per Lei&#x27;s) helps slough off the dead skin and even out the skin tone a lot more than just washing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It works instantly, you just put some all over your face and its like magic, the dead skin just seems to lift off your face.</li>
            <li>I bought this on sale and was skeptical, but my sister immediately commented on how good I looked.  </li>
            <li>This is a similar product to the cult favorite &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; from japan and several other korean brands like missha and etude house has them too.</li>
            <li>Used it later in the night and WOW, I am so serious when I say this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The first time I put the peel serum on my face and leaved it for about 15 minutes and it never fully dry, it was sticky on my face.</li>
            <li>What a nicely packaged, and presented jar of garbage, this does nothing, other than to create some sort of barrier on your face, and pretend its taking away dead skin, IT&#x27;S NOT.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;They&amp;#34; say, as we get older we do not exfoliate naturally as we did when we were younger.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I talked the man down to $20 from $85.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very lazy with taking my makeup off sometimes and this makes it more enticing to do so, plus it works.</li>
            <li>Simply dampen you face, apply a small amount and rub in a soft circular upward motion adding more as required.  </li>
            <li>She could have easily lied to me about her acne just to get my money, but for someone who has been very impatient with her skin, I was sold.</li>
            <li>Takes off the dead skin to reveal clean and glowing skin underneath.</li>
            <li>I have had much better facial peelings in the past.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this facial peel in Vegas last year.  </li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, the following day a coworker had asked me what was different about me.</li>
            <li>I also tested the peel on a regular piece of paper and it has EXACTLY THE SAME effect as when you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>so I just grab my Proactiv facial scrub or Olay Exfoliating Scrub (any scrub will work though) and use a little bit and that easily takes off what the water did not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool to watch your skin \\&quot;roll off\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t finish the job, when I go to rinse it off the little balls of rolled up skin stay on my cheeks</li>
            <li>I KNOW its dead skin because I am native american, my husband is white, and my best friend is black and we ALL have a different color (matching our individual coloring) of skin traces left on the cotton pad after using the peel!</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old female from New Orleans.  </li>
            <li>I have actually experimented with this a bit by using it on a patch of very dry cracked skin vs. a patch of freshly scrubbed skin - there are more white globs, and bigger white globs, when you use it on very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This even got to my house in barely two days!!  </li>
            <li>Rub it into a balloon or Xbox controller or ANYTHING, they apparently have skin &#x27;peel&#x27; as well!!</li>
            <li>I open this in the pic on line looks more white like little</li>
            <li>But it really gets rid of all the old dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it will definitely remove the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>Very soft but your epidermal layer of dirt and daily grime is removed and your skin is amazingly soft and supple.</li>
            <li>And it is way less than a facial, and you can use it countless times, for $13 it was totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the one I usually use (Neutrogena  advanced solutions peel)</li>
            <li>I wash my face as normal in the shower usually with a cream cleanser (feels more moisturizing) and leave it WET.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just not seeing much for long term results.</li>
            <li>Very watery and has to rub for a long time to get the peeling effect.</li>
            <li>this product gave me the normal skin I&#x27;ve been dreaming of and the only product i use which saves me tons of $$!!</li>
            <li>As with any facial peel product, it takes quite a bit of rinsing to get all of the residue off your face, but that is normal.</li>
            <li>When first approached, the sales girl wanted to charge him $125, she finally dropped to $40 so at least it wasn&#x27;t the full price.</li>
            <li>Well, this isn&#x27;t true, it is indeed the dead skin that is flaking up on my face.  </li>
            <li>I would not buy until he came down to what I have paid for other products , in this case the magic number was $29.00.</li>
            <li>The only con would be the scent, it&#x27;s not very pleasant but not horrible either.</li>
            <li>One word of caution, if you have down on your face, you may have pieces of skin (like sweater woolies) that were exfoliated that will stick to the hairs, and need to work a bit to get them off, but that hassle is worth the exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>And you can hardly wash it off easily.</li>
            <li>the product works really well and price is quite reasonable, will continue to order regularly and recommned to other friends</li>
            <li>makes your face look new &amp; younger.</li>
            <li>I have really flakey dry skin</li>
            <li>I also used it on my heels and it worked very well on my dry heels.</li>
            <li>This product really takes the dead skin off gently.  </li>
            <li>This product literally rolled all of the dead skin off of my face and left it feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>When you use it, Its fun to watch as it gathers up all the old dead skin on your face.</li>
            <li>For the past 10 years, I have pretty much stayed out of the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty small amount and goes fast</li>
            <li>There are no active ingredients in this product that would be peeling your skin.  </li>
            <li>not harsh on the skin, thus does not dry out your face after using.</li>
            <li>My skin is still very soft even after 3 days of the last application.</li>
            <li>Then I use my usual Clean and Clear Deep Action Exfoliating scrub at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li>(This stuff left my skin all soft and shiny!)</li>
            <li>Despite my reservations, (and due to the fact that a combination of fluorescent mall lighting and youth culture worship exhaust my self esteem and logical faculties to the point of momentary insanity) I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>I found it in my local mall at one of the kiosks and they wanted nearly $100 for it!</li>
            <li>They mark the price up majorly in retail locations.</li>
            <li>, as some reviewers have stated, the sticky white globs can stick to your facial hair a bit where it gets long along your hairline or jawline, but it comes right out if you rise the gel off with a washcloth and use a circular motion on the hairy spots.  </li>
            <li>This really works well to exfoliate the dry skin of my face!  </li>
            <li>I will say though, be sure to use it on a dry face as it is harder to rinse off when put on a wet face.  </li>
            <li>it was hanging off, I scrubbed my face with an exfoliator and it helped most of that loose dead skin come off the rest of the way!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the small piece of soap, nor the &amp;#34;paper towel&amp;#34; to wrap it in, but after a few minutes of an amazing hand massage with the &amp;#34;dead sea salt,&amp;#34; I was sold...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to work the same as a chemical peel or clear your acne.</li>
            <li>AND AFTER MULTIPLE USE YOU CAN ACTUALLY CLEAR UP ANY SKIN PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and have rosacea and back heads and thickening skin cells, and everything I use irritates my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I have only used this once, but so far I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling works for me because of my sensitive</li>
            <li>One friend asked if I had had a professional facial!</li>
            <li>I use the product while I&#x27;m in the shower so that my skin stays wet during the whole process and I moisturize while my skin is still damp to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 17 year old male teen with a soft face that matches a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>This gel does tend to run and become very liquid like so be careful when its around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft and different than before.</li>
            <li>but it did take alot of skin off, and now for the face it left it so soft like baby skin c:</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than having a professional do a facial peeling!!!</li>
            <li>there is white stuff coming out after rubbing this product into my skin, but that is not dead skin like they like to make you believe, it is some of the ingredients this product that react this</li>
            <li>agree with another poster that it&#x27;s not dead skin, it is simply the product balling up.  </li>
            <li>I was totally thrilled (but remained skeptical)</li>
            <li>Some people say it gets worse before it gets better when treating acne.</li>
            <li>I then follow with a cleansing toner to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave any product behind.</li>
            <li>annoyed i over paid $40 at a kiosk but still glad i was shown it cause i will from now on buy from amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird</li>
            <li>It takes off all the dead cells and leaves my skin fresh and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is like brand new skin after usage, only use about once a week to ten days.</li>
            <li>I tried my mom&#x27;s a few years ago when she was raving about her new, gentle exfoliator that she bought for $90 in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Good people shouldn&#x27;t have to waste their hard earned money on a crook&#x27;s crock pot recipe!</li>
            <li>came off 5) when I washed my face with water and patted it with a clean towel, and then looked at the towel it was covered with what I assume is the skin (a little gross actually)</li>
            <li>I want to also point out that I am Asian, so I recommend this for those of you who are Asian because we have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so much dead skin just wipe right off.</li>
            <li>how, the gritty pieces in there aren&#x27;t that harsh on your skin, i don&#x27;t even think my face turned red when i wiped it clean</li>
            <li>This is okay, but if left on the skin too long, it dries and becomes hard to remove.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other day and it exfoliates so gently and leaves my face feeling like velvet.</li>
            <li>I do believe it really works and definitely will last a long time</li>
            <li>Like other posters, I was approached by a very aggressive salesman at the mall.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in texture, but I did notice a difference in tone and shading compared to my other arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it in the shower because the little granules of dead skin/product will get all over.</li>
            <li>When I went home, I did some research and found that most consumers loved the product but hate getting tricked by the slick salespeople.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your face before because the little balls will be black and it looks gross.</li>
            <li>This works very well and your skin feels so soft afterwards however use this product over this because you will shed dead skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far after getting this as a gift from my dear friend (who I can only imagine also got accosted by a persistent salesperson in Vegas).</li>
            <li>only has my disfiguring acne nearly disappeared (only a boil or two in the summer)</li>
            <li>Maybe its not dead skin cells that&#x27;s peeling off, maybe when the gel and tiny granules are mixed together</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found so far to remove makeup by my nose and on my chin, reduce zits, and keep my face looking younger without damaging the skin.</li>
            <li>Using this peeling product once a day for several days has left my elbows soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Always looking for a chance to show social interaction to my son, I agreed.</li>
            <li>Are they are really only worth those heavily discounted prices.</li>
            <li>no irritation, but when you put it on your face, these little balls forms (and they&#x27;re not from &amp;#34;excess skin&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>She actually did half my face first</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say much but it cleared up my dark spot...</li>
            <li>I have experimented by using this stuff on areas that are recently well exfoliated by my buff puff - barely</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, i had some dead skin hanging off my face and even after I washed my face</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly what i saw come off my face, brown dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I was in an upscale Nashville mall with my autistic son when a kiosk sales lady asked if I was interested in a demonstration of the Vivo per Lei and Gratiae skin care lines.</li>
            <li>This facial peel is the first one I have used that did not leave my skin feeling so tight</li>
            <li>but after I refused to buy it, he dropped the price down to $40 (still paid too much).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not your dead skin peeling off, it&#x27;s the little balls becoming mush.</li>
            <li>it gets super hard to rub.</li>
            <li>I usually hide from the Vivo Kiosk people because they come right over to you and are very aggressive with their sales pitch, but the other week the girl caught me!  </li>
            <li>but I look so much prettier and I am needing less makeup.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li>Hi, I was in LVegas in November, 2013 and was lured into buying 200$ worth of products after being flirted with and convinced there are no better products out there, especially this product here.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has this knows that eventually there is no more dead skin balling up even after adding more product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the dead skin starting peeling instantly.</li>
            <li>Exact same product works the same to slough dead cells.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I know a lot of people wonder if it&#x27;s actually removing dead skin, I had the same thought at first.</li>
            <li>This has a very strange texture and doesn&#x27;t seem to be mixed completely.</li>
            <li>- If you have congestive heart failure... be warned that the sea salt is absorbed into your skin and can cause major heart  and health problems.... my ankles and feet looked like elephantiasis after using this product for only 3 days!</li>
            <li>Vivo  was expensive when I bought it at a mall in Tx, but its a good thing that Amazon has it for Less..</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a very hot/cute brunette in tight leather pants that made my head do a 180 degree turn, and her coworker signaled me there.</li>
            <li>It certainly rolled the dead skin in that area</li>
            <li>READ the negative reviews first!</li>
            <li>A deal just for me because I live here and will bring other customers.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of original and opened a bottle to my disappointment  it smelled, was half filled,</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hoping it ends up working great despite the \\&quot;hassle\\&quot; of taking it off.</li>
            <li> happy.</li>
            <li> It makes you skin feel great.  </li>
            <li> Tried it at the mall and happy to have found it online.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look great</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this product, but my experience was a dud.</li>
            <li> and this is great for in between visits to my aesthetician.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the face and neck.</li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> After a year of use of just one unit I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> And is a great value at this price.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Felt</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great for my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an intelligent woman, I believe, and I can&#x27;t be fooled by a website where the products are over 1000$, for a cream or $2000, and none of the products I bought are on this site.  </li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, this product works great.</li>
            <li> Great price and product.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and this price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> but the stuff is great and they have it cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced that too.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> But, if you follow it up with the Day Moisturizer or the Renewal Night Cream, they cover up the not so great smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Great</li>

            <li> This product works good .</li>
            <li> Salesmen are good.</li>
            <li> I fell into the trap of good salesmenship at a kiosk in the mall over this gel.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I believe havent taken a good look at the peel.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal on amazon compared to buying it at the mall.</li>
            <li> But it works good as a Peeling cream.</li>
            <li> a friend and I loved it..</li>
            <li> This is a good peel for the price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> When I said something to her about how good she looked she told me she had been using these products.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all</li>
            <li> Acne wise-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay 75.00 for it.  </li>
            <li> i received this as a gift and loved the product.  </li>
            <li> product wasn&#x27;t good, I would not buy it again and never recommend it to anybody out there.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> All and all its a good product.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a good peeling product, please stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> And the price is good</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even SMELL GOOD.</li>
            <li> but I loved the product just not the cost.  </li>
            <li> LA County Fair for $40 a jar.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom to try and she loved it too.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this product works..</li>
            <li> I got this one based on good reviews</li>
            <li> When I got home I tried the sample and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said she used the product on my arm and it was good.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it though for him</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mall of the Palazzo in Las Vegas and absolutely loved this brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried time and time again to find a really good exfoliant...</li>
            <li> This stuff was so good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even good for feet let alone your face.</li>
            <li> I dont underatand why it has good reviews.</li>
            <li> For aging skin it is good because it is not an abrasive exfollient that can microscopically tear the skin, speeding up the aging process.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s good stuff too) for my daughter for $60.00.  </li>

            <li> Amazing stuff</li>

            <li> your skin doesn&#x27;t feel nice n</li>
            <li> I honestly did not notice any difference in my face using it.</li>
            <li> The consistency actually kind of irks me out.</li>
            <li> As a nice treatment that adds a bit of moisture to your skin at $18 here</li>
            <li> Amazon really has the best prices around!</li>
            <li> Nice product for your face.</li>
            <li> Nice surprise for me.  </li>
            <li> and I did notice that it opens up the pores but to be honest</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is effective all day.</li>
            <li> I then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product ever.</li>
            <li> Nice product, seems to do what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It feels good afterwards and my face looks better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about them catching and hurting, or cracking or bleeding.</li>
            <li> I really liked it..</li>
            <li> but I saw it with my own eyes.</li>
            <li> GLAD TO HAVE FOUND A GOOD DEAL ON THIS AND WILL BUY AGAIN, IN FACT</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful exfoliant for you hands and face and is so effective, but gentle.</li>
            <li> and I am excited about being happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The set was originally $150.00!?!  </li>
            <li> Pretty good exfolliant peel at a great price.</li>
            <li> These products are excellent for all types of skin, leaves it very soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> But beware, it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;5 STARS for sure! :-)</li>
            <li> Got to love those Israelis! :)</li>
            <li> Great company bought other things from them and their service is excellent.  </li>
            <li> product absolutely works and provides incredible results.  </li>
            <li> So if you need a good peel for cheap, this is now it, in fact I will purchase this myself.</li>
            <li> but my old scars (pits and discoloration) are greatly diminished!  </li>
            <li> I was THRILLED when I found it on amazon for so cheap!</li>
            <li> Any way I was very impressed on how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This products is good, it exfoliate your skin and leaves it smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> but when I bought it in Hawaii a year ago, it seemed to work more effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad to keep this stuff handy.  </li>
            <li> Amazon process are great and WELL WORTH IT..</li>
            <li> There are much more effective face masks out there than this &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; which shouldn&#x27;t even be called a peel.</li>
            <li> recommend this product if you want to try it on these type of troublesome areas, and for a good, fresh face peel!</li>
            <li> I think this is a lovely item perfect for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Lei Facial Peeling is a great on the face and great price.</li>
            <li> Pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to know I could buy this product so much cheaper on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I figured it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good for me, but I love the way it feels so clean when finished.</li>
            <li> well let me tell you something very important about that.</li>
            <li> But as long as they work to some degree of the purposed intended I am happy - I might not be as happy</li>
            <li> My skin felt very nice after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Great product,  I have amazing results my skin look very healthy, I love it definitely</li>
            <li> , it comes in a wonderful hard case with padding inside, great for a gift</li>
            <li> Love this peel.</li>
            <li> Better than what I had though.</li>
            <li> Best place to buy is on Amazon not in the malls where they double or triple the cost.</li>
            <li> This is great and really gets in and</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and boy was I ever glad.</li>
            <li> could not have made a better choice when buying this.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and it glows!  </li>
            <li> For those that have purchased it online much cheaper and had great reviews, please share the site that you went to.</li>
            <li> My skin looked noticeably better- more youthful and radiant- after just two days.</li>
            <li> Now my skin seems to be more tolerant,</li>
            <li> I love the Butter cream, and the Sea Salt Polisher for my arms and sun damaged body areas like the area just below the neck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cowgirl and frankly their smooth talk is a line of bull........!</li>
            <li> He tried to sell more, but I told him no.</li>
            <li> I love this peel, you can see the results immediately</li>
            <li> However, I am so glad to see Amazon carries it for a fraction of the price of what I paid.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy into her</li>
            <li> I prefer the Olay Pro-X and Olay Regenerist lines much better, so I&#x27;d recommend those over this one.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love it and am so glad to be able to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad the guy lowered the price a lot because it&#x27;s way cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t realise how much better my skin could be.</li>
            <li> Best facial care line I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better  :)  </li>
            <li> ONLY buy this on Amazon for the price is great!</li>
            <li> am rating this a 5 as I have purchased and used it many times.</li>
            <li> but I found good reviews on use of the product are worth the length.</li>
            <li> I Love this mark.</li>
            <li> If you write to the websites selling these products for 90% off they will all claim the product to be authentic, un-damaged &amp; not expired.</li>
            <li> Most of them I like albeit nothing particularly overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This is more of a scrub.</li>
            <li> The product is more of a gel.</li>
            <li> Most exfoliators that I&#x27;ve tried have aggravated the skin more than helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time though, I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this face peel.  </li>
            <li> Something is going on here, but I&#x27;m just entirely sure what.</li>
            <li> She used many VPL products on me and sent a bunch home with me to keep using.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of a couple products and just stopped using them, instead of asking her for more.  </li>
            <li> and my face never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I let her rub it on my wrists, and the results pleased me, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I tried the product and I can sincerely say that it works.   </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be any more happier with it.</li>
            <li> love it and its just as i remembered it from a while ago. ..</li>
            <li> I used once and it was ok.  </li>
            <li> The product itself seems okay</li>
            <li> Love this and have purchased as gifts for friends.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product from 3 different sellers,, best bet Beauty, touchdown, and On Sale.  </li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on the Vivo Per Lei products sold here on Amazon that i decided to ignore them and find out for myself.  </li>
            <li> There are much better peels out there.</li>
            <li> Forever flawless facial peeling gel is way better but costs a lot more.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this on amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Love this skincare line.</li>
            <li> Again, your price is much better.</li>
            <li> it is all better.  </li>
            <li> My complexion looks better than it has in a decade!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week and follow by washing my face with my cleanser again to make sure all the gel residue is gone.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great alternative to glycolic or salicylic peels and scratchy exfoliators!</li>
            <li> I had even gone into work that day and a coworker commented on how my face looked smooth!  </li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> and this has made my complexion better.</li>
            <li> i love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> But this one is most affordable</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say anything better.</li>
            <li> It is the best facial peel I&#x27;ve ever used and was my biggest bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> my skin feels wonderful the next day.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t play with cream for more than 15-20 min.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I got two more fore</li>
            <li> and they love it.</li>
            <li> There are home remedies better than this one.  </li>
            <li> My family members have been telling me that my skin looks a lot better and they can see a difference too.</li>
            <li> So cheap!</li>
            <li> There are too many discrepancies.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get all areas of your face.</li>
            <li> But she was able to get her set for $75.00 because the boxes were damaged.  </li>
            <li> Once I tried the peel (more of a scrub) and the cream I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would check Amazon to see if I could snag a better deal and voila, I did.  </li>
            <li> A much better deal than the mall.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST facial  &#x27;scrub&#x27; EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> So these sales people charge you more than 10 times the price of these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  will purchase it again and really love  the product.</li>
            <li> Love the&lt;br /&gt; product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It seems there is great debate about whether or not what peels away is really skin or the product but</li>
            <li> set....was an ok deal but not compared to amazon!!!wont do that</li>
            <li> :) )  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this peeling, I ruined out if it and my skin can feel it, also when I don&#x27;t use it, the make up and lotions feel like a screen on my face</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a mall kiosk even though I know better.</li>
            <li> Most give so-so results.</li>
            <li> Since it works in this manner, you shouldn&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> I hope the day/night cream works better.</li>
            <li> Ok so as I read some reviews I was suckered into this product paying 39.99</li>
            <li> i love it...</li>
            <li> Now I would be PISSED to have paid this much and not be happy with the product...</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job removing dead cells and your skin feels good afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I love this peel</li>
            <li> He was cute, but I still couldn&#x27;t fall for it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Will for sure continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Well after seeing this product at the mall many times.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results that would make this any better than what you would find elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> If You buy this product for scars as many</li>
            <li> I am confident that most people would be okay using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am telling you, this stuff is just stunning.</li>
            <li> Ok so I didn&#x27;t get this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> he uses it more then Me....</li>
            <li> I am going to order more from this product line.</li>
            <li> He was cute and I had nothing better to do.</li>
            <li> I love this facial peeling wash the best.</li>
            <li> Because it is peeling your skin off, don&#x27;t use more than once a week.</li>
            <li> Vivo peel is ok.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it online.</li>
            <li> I then use the Vivo moisturising day cream, which I also love.</li>
            <li> It was priced a lot better than what I saw in the mall.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even sure what it does.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I have told my friends about this product.:)</li>
            <li> I love and you should try it to.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s this peel, it makes my skin look youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li> shipped fast great product would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Ok i purchased the product before from the mall and was amazed on the results my mother tried it also and and love it</li>
            <li> Looked and smelled like the authentic product</li>
            <li> The follow up with the toner and moisture cream makes the whole product line a great value .</li>
            <li> and as you&#x27;re applying more water thinking it&#x27;ll just go away</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week for, an my skin never felt better.</li>
            <li> It works sort of like magic.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I do love the product.</li>
            <li> I also have a farm and spend many hours outdoors; even with spf 30 sunblock the sun does it&#x27;s damage.</li>
            <li> In fact I have just purchased 3 more jars through Amazon &amp; plan on giving one to my daughter so she can discover the wonderfulness without inital overpayment to kiosk personnel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> and i love it and had to find more</li>
            <li> , it takes the top layer of skin off and you can see it happening the skin</li>
            <li> I top those off with the Vivo Day Cream &amp; Roc Multi correction anti-gravity eye cream.</li>
            <li> bottom line, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it more than twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> so I leave it on a couple minutes longer and use it more often than they advise...</li>
            <li> It has a gel feeling to it, I was expecting it to be more of a scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to know for sure</li>
            <li> It makes skin absolutely smooth!</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my face feel after I use it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ok for what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I used many peeling and exfoliating products and they all did the job, after using my face felt smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> but she had more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more.  </li>
            <li> and I already love it.</li>
            <li> sure.</li>
            <li> I think, they have to add more descriptions on this product.</li>
            <li> Before using this peoduct, I had so many blemishes.</li>
            <li> I really love using this under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Would like to have had more instructions and content of product with this</li>
            <li> Well I love the product it works.  </li>
            <li> This works great and is gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my thirties now) and this peeling helps keep my skin clear, it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> I too was hooked in at a mall kiosk by a pushy saleswoman, but I love this stuff..</li>
            <li> but I love this product.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my skin and my sister loves it too.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.  </li>
            <li> this may be the best facial product I ever used.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I PLAN TO BUY MORE FOR MY DAUGHTERS.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever tried, my skin has never looked this smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have started giving this as birthday presents and they say it is the best present they have ever gotten.  </li>
            <li> The product is okay.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial product!  </li>
            <li> like I said, I&#x27;m allergic to so many products I didn&#x27;t want to commit to buying anything without seeing if my skin was irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I just needed to buy more.  </li>
            <li> so glad i found this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased it, but when I used it all up, was determined to find a more affordable alternative.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I then bought more items from this line.  </li>
            <li> It did leave my skin smoother and with a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was using Oil of Lay (which I had used for many years.)  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used anything else since and will attest to the fact that is one of the greatest products for facial exfoliation ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will ordor more.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet very effective.  </li>
            <li> so when I found this I was very excited given the amount that its selling for on amazon.</li>
            <li> but afterwards your face feels so clean and nice.</li>
            <li> Great product and would that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my skin is in great condition normally</li>
            <li> However, she was a insanely gorgeous young woman with the most amazing Romanian accent.</li>
            <li> I read the good and not so good reviews about Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling, nonetheless, I leaned towards the 179 reviewers who 5 stared this product.  </li>
            <li> I was really dissappointed because I love the product and thought I found it for a good price.  </li>
            <li> This product came perfectly packaged, brand new, and it does exactly what was demonstrated at the kiosk (for$150)</li>
            <li> I am very, very particular about my skin and believe me it pays off using good products and a regimented program for your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten more smooth and clearer since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work great so far.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin more patchy than smooth</li>
            <li> It is brighter, smooth and more even already</li>
            <li> For a first time peel user, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> so do many sscrubs that are cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I absolutely love &amp; now that I found it cheaper</li>
            <li> Find it does a great job exfoliating and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> and I can say it is good and works really well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real worth.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and am super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have to say I loved how it made my skin feel, but wow the price was a slap in the face!!!</li>
            <li> It may sound like my skin would be super irritated, but honestly my skin has never been clearer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> face is so smooth and feels very clean.</li>
            <li> After rinsing with cool water, I&#x27;ve had to literally scrub it from my skin!  </li>
            <li> How sweet!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon carries it  because this product is definitely worth using and I will be ordering it again and again!</li>
            <li> When I got home, I read the instructions that said to do a \\&quot;test area\\&quot; first, and I&#x27;m certainly glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product you see and feel it working the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see how my face looks after using it more.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product in a mall and paid quite a bit more than what I did on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only have problems after the product was exposed to humid air after awhile as water neutralizes this product which is great truthfully.</li>
            <li> but you can get it off easily by using any exfoliating/facial scrub.  </li>
            <li> extremely easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product it does clean your skin.</li>
            <li> I stood strong.</li>
            <li> It is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at the mall and liked the way it worked.  </li>
            <li> Hands down best product ever.</li>
            <li> Because it will roll in balls and sticks to the fine hairs you have on your face...</li>
            <li> if you have even baby fine hairs it will stick like balled up glue.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and leaves my face feel smooth .</li>
            <li> I quickly tried rubbing this peel between my two fingers and behold!</li>
            <li> If you are lucky enough to get your acne under control makeup doesn&#x27;t glide on or look very good because your skin in no way looks moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am glad that it is on Amazon.com, much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Best exfoliater of all time, hands down!</li>
            <li> I could tell a huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li> It left my face silky smooth and looking great.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> so I buy 3-4 at a time esp because it is free shipping over $25.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and silky, and I can&#x27;t wait for day four to come around</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this weekly.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> We are in our 50&#x27;s and my face has never been so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face that night and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth in years.</li>
            <li> This peeling gel is certainly worth much more than it is being sold for on amazon - I bought for my sister, my mother, and two friends (</li>
            <li> Best product for removing dead skin and also polishes as well.</li>
            <li> Happy facial peeling!</li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> and I immediately put on a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth after I do and application.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin smooth, but not what I thought based on the description o &amp;#34;facial peeling&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> but my face is smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought this way more than it was worth, and I would return it if I could.</li>
            <li> I was in Las Vegas a few years ago, and loved it!!</li>
            <li> skin feels incredibly smooth, shiny and downy after.</li>
            <li> I think there must be some light acids in the product that do this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who thinks exfoliating is important as we age.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for some years now and found amazon to be the most economical</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, but not irritating.</li>
            <li> My skin is fresh looking and more supple.  </li>
            <li> my skin was sooo smooth after one application.</li>
            <li> When I found this product so cheap</li>
            <li> My skin felt fantastic after using this peel.  </li>
            <li> Much more worth it for the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> I like the smell of the day cream and my face does feel smooth after using.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting a \\&quot;deal\\&quot;) and was a bit upset to see it SO CHEAP on amazon...</li>
            <li> so hopefully soon people will ONLY buy it on amazon lol</li>
            <li> I got accosted at the mall today by a smooth talker.  </li>
            <li> I only bought this product because of the great reviews, but I should of listen to the people who give it a 1 star.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product is sooooo cheap online.</li>
            <li> This truly takes off dead skin cells and skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I rub lightly until it beads up  </li>
            <li> My face felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Anyway I guess I am actually happy for once to have been approached by a salesperson, otherwise I would not have discovered the facial peel.</li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL SMOOTH AFTER ONE USE</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on as smooth as can be without flakes showing up.</li>
            <li> Got on Amazon and for $12.99 and free shipping I ordered my day moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> I alway make sure my wife has this stuff, it makes her skin have a glow, and she rarely gets breakout using this and taking vitamins (E and C).</li>
            <li> The ingredients are not even available on the product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and moisturized after each use.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and works well with the day and night creams.</li>
            <li> My skin fells so smooth.  </li>
            <li> My family noticed how smooth my face is and the blemishes are fading..</li>
            <li> using once a week works great, hope it last longer that I expect.</li>
            <li> I also bought this product from a smooth talking salesman in Las Vegas for $49.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also light</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the dead skin that came off my wrist, but</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, my blackheads are disappearing, and there has been no redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> It is scent free.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I thought \\&quot;what a great deal!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li> FEELS so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a great facial peeling gel.</li>
            <li> This feels more like an exfoliator than a skin peel which I love because it is so gentle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have fair, slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh and smells good.</li>
            <li> online really ticks me off!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I saw at the mall but cheaper from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and fresh!  </li>
            <li> Makes the skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Afterward though, my face feels so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and see and feel immediate results.</li>
            <li> It feels very gentle on my face; no abrasives like most scrubs.  </li>
            <li> But, the price seemed kind of high to me.</li>
            <li> This facial peel is amazing!</li>
            <li> this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.</li>
            <li> Get rid of all the old skin &amp; dirt very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Originally I got it from my cousin who paid $60 at the mall kiosk like others did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s peeling my skin still.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a bit of a skeptic, but this line of products are really awesome!  </li>
            <li> I use this twice a week, and it has made a significant difference in the smoothness and delicacy of my skin.</li>
            <li> He told me that the product is originally $80</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the mall n paid a lot of money thinking that it was going to work ,so I was excited to get it</li>
            <li> I think my experience with this product is unique.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since my Dad gifted me my first jar in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for this price please, its worth trying!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to start using it again.</li>
            <li> This is a friendly way to do it.  </li>
            <li> My sister claimed since using the set her rosacea has diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Shame, I was SO excited about this peel.  </li>
            <li> Also, I thank Amazon retailers for offering a much more reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the investment!  </li>
            <li> This item arrived unsealed, which lead me to believe it was not the original, but rather a used item that was refilled with something else.</li>
            <li> At first I felt duped into wasting a lot of money but after thinking about it I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> So I searched Amazon for it and it was way cheaper and so worth it!</li>
            <li> but these products were so worth it!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!  </li>
            <li> I love this product from the first time I have used it.</li>
            <li> I became aware of this product after receiving an e-mail from amazon regarding their \\&quot;top selling\\&quot; moisturizers (in which the day cream was featured.</li>
            <li> Wish I had reviewed the product first, but like most of you I had never heard of it.  </li>
            <li> The product is pretty okay</li>
            <li> A good facial brush scrubber like the Olay Pro worked great the next time I used the product.  </li>
            <li> I received mine but wasn&#x27;t yet done with my original.</li>
            <li> Originally, I discovered this product in the mall.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Vegas the first time and paid a lot more for it than I did on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a self proclamined beauty buff and bought this stuff because the reivews were pretty high, and I am always looking for a good peel.</li>
            <li> To test this out, I rubbed some product on some clean plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial scrubs over the years, but I&#x27;ve never used one that was this effective.</li>
            <li> Helps my face stay clean of acne</li>
            <li> If you think you have clean armpits, try it and think again.</li>
            <li> I clean my armpits with this peel twice a week</li>
            <li> my skin has just become more and more sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I have amazing smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li> When you think your face is clean....</li>
            <li> I bet if I would come home with some, put that on a piece of CLEAN, just bleached plastic</li>
            <li> It does, however, make me wonder if my skin is now more sensitive to sunburning since the top layer has been removed.</li>
            <li> clean it gets stuck in the peach fuz on my face.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals or smells and this is such a great price!</li>
            <li> Great combination and my skin looked radiant, pink and felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin visibly clean.</li>
            <li> leaving a clean &amp; radiant glow to your face.  </li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use that is the main reason for using it.  </li>
            <li> And at first I thought it was great, but I&#x27;m a licensed Aesthetician and I kept wondering if that much skin could really come off after every use.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this even for sensitive skin but don&#x27;t use it more than once a week!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special for my skin.</li>
            <li> Same exact product and worked great.</li>
            <li> But, once I try this, for myself...I will give my true reviews.</li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t drying on my face and it&#x27;s not irritating either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to buy it, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> had I paid full price however!&lt;br /&gt;However, as for this product - I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> If it were really peeling your skin, they&#x27;d having SPF warnings and it would have more of a drying effect.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I found out about Vivo Per Lei from a very persistent kiosk salesman in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true-</li>
            <li> also posts that say its not ur skin, its the product...not true.</li>
            <li> and I still love it as much as I did then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product and I&#x27;ve bought it several times since (for under $10 on Amazon!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and take good care of my skin, so I don&#x27;t understand why its still peeping the same way</li>
            <li> the product is as good as the 24K option, yet not a pricey and works the same.</li>
            <li> Bought some in vegas and paid way too much, here the price was reasonable, works awesome, look so much younger when I use it</li>
            <li> This is a really cool product.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesnt have that good of a smell to it.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician, looking for a good product for peeling, this peeling product not only burning my face and also burning my finger.</li>
            <li> At night, again cleanse with the Olay total effects wipes (really awesome for getting off eye make-up &amp; it makes your face feel like you have applied a light serum), follow with Roc Night Deep Wrinkle Repair (Retinol)&amp; Roc retinol eye cream.</li>
            <li> For all who think it is the gel balling up it isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> That is true to an extent.</li>
            <li> This product cost me the same it would have in store after shipping however it was a good buy</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most impotant thing is that contains SD alcohol which is very damaging to skin, therefore I trought it to garbage</li>
            <li> So it is not such a good deal after all.</li>
            <li> The sales lady was sweet and knowledgable, and gave my son a double-sided mirror to play with.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff, and will continue using it, but they should really get rid of those people in the malls selling products for all kinds of prices,</li>
            <li> The real stuff is light in color, has no smell, leaves skin smooth and the consistency is light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it so much</li>
            <li> 3rd time refill purchased, enjoy very much &amp; love it -- easy to use and the texture is smooth - recommendated</li>
            <li> I did love this at first, but its really just nothing more then lifting the very top layer of dry skin, you have to wash to get the pores cleaned out.</li>
            <li> my skin feels very clean; ready for my cream.  </li>
            <li> and I believe that&#x27;s due in a great part to this product.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old, very fair skinned (white blond, as a child).</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product, but I doubt I would have bought it again if I couldn&#x27;t get it for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it shipped andarrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This facial item was bought for my wife and in my observation she is enjoying the product and seems to be well satisfied.</li>
            <li> and my skin has been clearing up tremendously.</li>
            <li> If there was some way to speak to an authority who chooses in Las Vegas in particular hotels who to put into a kiosk here and there, I would love to speak to them and let them know what this company is doing to its&#x27; clients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed nice but was much too pricey, then they just kept dropping the price which really made me doubt the product.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it was $6 when I decided to buy it, never buy from mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> This facial peel is the only thing that I have ever been impressed by.</li>
            <li> Love it; better than a salon facial!</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea on my face and the redness decreases immediately after using it, and smooths out the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff too makes skin feel like its soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon for such a great place to shop for my favorites.</li>
            <li> Like many of the below complaints, I too was suckered into paying a high price for this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried endless products and this by far is one of the best!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - great price too - this is my second purchase - my skin looks terrific - great wrinkle treatment, as it clears away tons of dead skin!</li>
            <li> It works well and is gentle on my skin, which seems to get more and more sensitive</li>
            <li> They sweet talked me and spouted a bunch of BS, and they tried to pawn this on me for $99 claiming it was worth $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also a bargain, so I will keep using it as long as my skin is looking and feeling this good.</li>
            <li> It removes all the dead skin, leaving my skin beautiful and glowing.  </li>
            <li> It literally removes all the dead skin and gunk in my pores revealing the beautiful, refreshed and glowing skin hiding underneath.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the \\&quot;new, best thing\\&quot; in skincare, since I started noticing my first fine lines a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different facial scrubs, but this is by far the best exfoliating product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found a good deal with this purchase from Amazon, but the scrub is diluted and takes 3-4 times as much to do the same as my original (from the mall).</li>
            <li> I think most of these products are more effective when used on dry skin not wet skin.  </li>
            <li> I first experimented with hers and was pleased with the results -- we were in Florida and my skin was absolutely misbehaving.  </li>
            <li> I have reordered this almost in BULK because as is usual with a good regiment, the manufacturers either change the formula not for the better or discontinue because of lack of sales.</li>
            <li> Product works pretty good, but I&#x27;ve used a another that was a little better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, I can&#x27;t tell you how many moisturizers, foundations, and body lotions I have given away b/c they caused breakouts or rashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s works really well for my skin !!</li>
            <li> Especially when I know better than to buy into a mall kiosk gimmick!</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as it says!  </li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this product if u want to feel extra clean, and smell good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative for an exfoliate scrub and isn&#x27;t as abrasive as those little beads can be.</li>
            <li> The original has many more of the dark scrubbing  particles in it than this one.</li>
            <li> I was solicited at the Flamingo Las Vegas by hackers in the isle offering a free (haha) sample of this product using Dr. Oz&#x27; name as an endorser of this product.  </li>
            <li> This really leaves my skin so smooth and clears out the pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, that&#x27;s versatile to be used on troublesome areas such as elbows, knuckles and ankles</li>
            <li> Came in real fast.  </li>
            <li> I used it and at the time, thought it was actually worth the money.</li>
            <li> My experience is that most skin care products do not deliver on what they promise, so I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty cool how it works..</li>
            <li> Maybe this product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it&#x27;s certinately worth the $21 risk to find out.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not skin, then it&#x27;s not dangerous to use it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> My skin is definately smoother and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> I see a difference in my skin tone and dryness from using and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> He was nice enough,</li>
            <li> Great facial peeling even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite day cream by far.</li>
            <li> This cream is worth the cost on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money on amazon tho.</li>
            <li> bottom line is this product doe its job and is a fun way to keep you on your face regimen just because its so fun to see the gunk come off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the mall nearly two years ago and LOVED how smooth it left my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well that is a complete lie because i tried rubbing it on my counter top</li>
            <li> With this my skin is so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54yrs old, so I&#x27;ve tried MANY products...looking to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the lower prices.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the price</li>
            <li> To be fair, I used not JUST the facial peel but a whole vivo per lei system.</li>
            <li> Once a week is plenty to keep your face fresh.</li>
            <li> It reveal fresh layer of the skin.</li>
            <li> is I rub about a dimes worth on my forehead, a dimes worth on each cheek, and a dimes worth my chin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after using this several times I don&#x27;t know that this was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s prices are far better than the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; at the mall.</li>
            <li> I would rare this a 25 if I could..</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning my facial skin and leaves my face very soft and clean feeling and lookiong.</li>
            <li> The entire day my face takes on a beautiful glow and is less oily and more porcelain like.</li>
            <li> This product lasts for over a year (even with my husband using it), but I sent the link to my mom and aunt because of the other awesome products by the same company.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying other better products from better brands.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I purchased in the mall (but not for significantly more than on this site.  </li>
            <li> absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products.  </li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly and is doing exactly what my granddaughter needed.  </li>
            <li> The peel DOES however, remove the dead layer of skin very effectively.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I am impressed and will continue to use the facial peel as long as I can buy it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It took us a while to find the right price for the product,but we found it here.</li>
            <li> Right now I have used Arbonne sunscreen for about 6 months and like it.  </li>
            <li> The reviews about the salesman are right on.  </li>
            <li> I always use right before I shower.  </li>
            <li> so I wonder if it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type.</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gets those right off</li>
            <li> She noticed right away that I have acne, sun spots and acne marks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it right away at the mall kiosk</li>
            <li> I literally had dreams about it and every time I looked at my face and thought about exfoliating this stuff popped right to my mind.  </li>
            <li> You literally rub the gel into your skin on your face in circular motions and all the skin just comes right off.</li>
            <li> The price was right before i run out of it</li>
            <li> I had tried their amazing nail kit a couple of years ago and thought it was pretty low quality too.</li>
            <li> Great and works better than the super Expensive items</li>
            <li> Really helps clean my face.  </li>
            <li> Baby smooth fine pored skin on the top of mind hand would NOT produce that much dead skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway they offered me a special deal (again, haha)</li>
            <li> I usually put on Cephalin lotion afterwards because it is a great non-comedogenic lotion I read about online</li>
            <li> When I used it to wash my face ,it does rarely work at the first time I cover it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for way too much at a shopping center kiosk, but was still glad I did because I love the product.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s so great about this products is that it doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin to get the dead skin off!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, true to description.</li>
            <li> I figured it was a knock off, but my first positive experience was how quick</li>
            <li> I repeat the next day and am really happy with the results following this routine.</li>
            <li> (you can get this anywhere) and am happy with how it feels and am able to be diligent using acne medications without fear of lousy counterproductive results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works as described, and it&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap the prices are on here, and the only thing I can imagine is if they are that cheap on amazon, there must be something fishy all together with the company and products being sold.  </li>
            <li> This product was super gentle (which you may not expect from a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am prone to cystic acne and this helps to remove the dead skin on top of the cyst so that it resolves itself much more</li>
            <li> Used it on dry face then washed off with warm water.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to completely wash off.</li>
            <li> New product added to my skin care regimen!!!</li>
            <li> They all make these great promises that consistently fall short and leave you with low expectations for anything else.</li>
            <li> Fast, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My facial skin is fine but my finger tips are injured!</li>
            <li> Very, very.</li>
            <li> I was also a accosted at the mall kiosk by a very very pushy salesman.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very intense exfoliant...</li>
            <li> I got this at the mall last year and still have some of it, have sensitive dry skin with allergies and this product has no smell and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Do not use with too much water other wise</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product at a kiosk in a Mall in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels light, clear, and airy after using this product, which hs rare, considering I have large pores, oily/combination skin, and--at 27--the beginnings of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of what its actually doing, i know the end results is that i have a clean, poreless face and it feels nice and just on the verge of being a tad dry (the squeaky clean feeling if you will)</li>
            <li> I was hit up pretty hard in Vegas at the Rio, like a lot of you were lol.</li>
            <li> After using you feel and look like you have new CLEAN refreshed skin</li>
            <li> deep cleans and sheds all that top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> The first time I was introduced to this product was at the mall.</li>
            <li> What I love about the night cream is that you don&#x27;t have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it some of my skin lifted to come off</li>
            <li> I did much better the 2nd time around!</li>
            <li> She first tried it out on a Vegas trip and ever since she&#x27;s been using it.</li>
            <li> ;D</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the evening of my skin tone will be more prominent or permanent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pissed!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product once before in the local mall and paid more for it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time while on vacation in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> The product works and does make the skin really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After my first night of using this, I am amazed.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much for an area you are cleansing!</li>
            <li> I just rub off what is willing to come off in one application not forcing it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have tried SOOOO many different products and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> My mom even asked what I had done to my face after the first couple of times I used the product.  </li>
            <li> The product is pretty and expensive-looking.</li>
            <li> If anyone has feedback on what they think it might be, I&#x27;m interested to hear what you have to say.</li>
            <li> Will use regularly, see if my skin starts looking better and revisit this review.</li>
            <li> (persistent pretty salesgirl...)</li>
            <li> I think most people see results because they WANT to see results, not because it actually works.  </li>
            <li> its pretty packaging</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get the most out of this I would recommend the following procedure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Just after using this for the first time, my face felt smoother and healthier.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still surprised at how smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li> than i use noxema to gently wash my face and it feels like silk when i lather after using this scrub!</li>
            <li> anyway, as the sales man was demonstrating on my hand how it worked, my boyfriend was looking on his phone, i didn&#x27;t know what he was doing at first until the sales man said &amp;#34;he must be looking on ebay or</li>
            <li> it did the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans and my face feels fresh</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in many years and deep set clogged pores and acne are finally starting to improve without creating psoriasis break outs or aggravation.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll use it and from now on be sure to by it on amazon only!!!!</li>
            <li> Too many of the posts are very similar in wording, and saying kiosks are a scam</li>
            <li> This is a real review!  </li>
            <li> Skin was more toned, younger looking, clearer, softer, with a more even complexion and smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of how it works, what matters is that it really does work!</li>
            <li> Many products make me breakout or get red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I will continue buying my product here ;)</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I was amazed the first time I used this product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to keep getting more when I run out, but I expect that won&#x27;t happen for about a year.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when the salespeople at the mall stopped me.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend first bought this product from a stand in the mall.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this facial peel.</li>
            <li> She made a $120.00 profit off me and I am sure I am not the only one.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have seen this one first.  </li>
            <li> I used this about 4 years ago and it worked better back then&lt;</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a knock off version</li>
            <li> Thanks again amazon!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m glad to find this online at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> When I ran out I planned on returning but checked out Amazon first.</li>
            <li> I love this facial peel.  </li>
            <li> Pretty package though.</li>
            <li> I even tested this peel when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> I look more than 15 years younger using it.  </li>
            <li> I really do!  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was happy to find it in Amazon for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li> The balled up mixture was more of an off white and not gray.</li>
            <li> glad I finally got to try this product.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more soon for my friends and family</li>
            <li> Im sure the dead skin is really not skin but chemical reaction from the gel, but I dont care, my skin still feels great.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to look 10yrs younger but smoother healthy skin</li>
            <li> I love the facial peel, toner, moisture day cream &amp; night cream.  </li>
            <li> I love these products enough that I would spend the money</li>
            <li> Exactly like the over priced stuff at the mall.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I paid $70 for the scrub &amp; moisturizer - double the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li> I am getting married in a month and my fiance and I were walking around the mall when we were grabbed by a pushy sales girl selling Vivo products.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t complain too much, I&#x27;ll just laugh because I got suckered.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The first jar I purchased was at the mall for $30.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as consistently as I should, but I can always tell the difference in my skin afterward.  </li>
            <li> First thing I did when i got home</li>
            <li> I could not get it off with rubbing alcohol, vaseline or hot washcloths.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this product was from a kiosk at the mall.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I am able to purchase 5 of their products for approx $70.00 in total.  </li>
            <li> Worked the first time, never worked afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was scammed the first time I purchased this in a mall at a kiosk for about $100.</li>
            <li> Every now and again, there is a product you buy that the second you are out, you have to immediately get more.</li>
            <li> Then he added the facial cream for $29 more plus tax.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this product while vacationing in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li> first time I bought some it was at the mall.</li>
            <li> Love this facial peeling.</li>
            <li> I first found out about these when in las VEgas at a casino who had a store but was offering the 2 products for about $349.  </li>
            <li> So, I googled this product and saw that Amazon sold it for a MUCH CHEAPER PRICE!  </li>
            <li> keeps the skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It works best when applied to dry skin and you will notice the amount of dead skin removed will vary depending on the length of time between each use.  </li>
            <li> Just like most people I got way overcharged for this in the kiosk at the mall but never the less this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This leaves residue on my face that will not be removed unless I intensely scrub it off which never happened to me with the previous one I owned and loved.</li>
            <li> The little sample was good for 4 mornings, don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> :) I felt my face had been dull for a lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li> This product has help keep my face clean and clear of acne as well.  </li>
            <li> I loved it the first few times but after that I noticed It was sticking to my fine facial hair</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> And it only does good work after i have covered it and washed my face the third time.</li>
            <li> It has made my pores smaller and leaves my face smooth, glowing, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I cant really say if it works or not yet but for me it was very easy to get off and didnt leave my skin dry at all.</li>
            <li> , they know how to smooth talk and flatter you like no other man can</li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li> I kept thinking about trying it on a smooth surface with latex gloves on to make sure its not a well disguised scam (I&#x27;m very skeptic, usually if its too good its not true).</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start on the positive side.</li>
            <li> I also have a unique skin situation that leaves my elbows dry and gray, which has been lovingly called \\&quot;zombie elbow\\&quot; by some friends with similar issues.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the best way to exfoliate your skin is to use a clean wash cloth and plain water, and just scrub in small circular motions with your fingers.  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought this it was because I was pressured into it by a very pushy salesperson at a kiosk.</li>
            <li> Price was much cheaper on Amazon than when I first bought in Vegas.  </li>
            <li> I have really good skin, very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t fun, but I can live with it.  </li>
            <li> I thought there would be lot more dry skin coming off.</li>
            <li> I do think the product is interesting and it does seem to peel some dry skin off my face when used, but how do others feel about the products being sold on Amazon from this company?</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so smooth and does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have hyperkeratosis just my hands and feet, so when the fall/winter comes or just by being in the a/c or doing chores I get calloused but with the fall/winter my knuckles and top of my fingers get severely dry and ashy and it gets so dry</li>
            <li> When I used it dry that did not occur and I had much better results.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle facial and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> And... I have super sensitive skin and get reactions off of anything and this stuff gives me no reaction whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Well it leaves my skin feeling super super soft afterwards, with no harsh burning at all.  </li>
            <li> Will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is so nice because you simple smooth on the gel, wait a few minutes, and gently rub it off!</li>
            <li> As soon as got the bright idea to use it in shower, I fell victim to ,the teeny tiny balled up product stuck on the peach fuzz on my face, thing some people have been talking about.</li>
            <li> But at myself mainly because I should have know not trust those people!  </li>
            <li> It is amazing the amount of people believing that those little polymer balls is their skin rubbing off -_-  </li>
            <li> I use this in the shower once a week and it rinses off nicely with just a little hand scrub.</li>
            <li> feel little Burning sensation kind&#x27;a feeling if use it for longer period.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and takes in the Day Cream very well!!</li>
            <li> It gently scrubs off the dead cells, leaves your skin really fine and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I got back home, I used it on my son and husband with the same amazing results.</li>
            <li> I use several of the products together for the total effect, but for me this one has been an amazing cure.</li>
            <li> all dead cell and dirt is amazing</li>
            <li> Not sure what exactly it does, but it feels amazing and makes your skill feel new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle yet makes&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivered fast</li>
            <li> It gently takes away the dead skin cells from my face and neck to give me a more fresh look and feel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I owned a Tanning Salon and some of my customers would purchase their tanning lotions much cheaper online.  </li>
            <li> I really hope this works as well as it did in the mall.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and this has really helped improve tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week, and I feel that it really helps my complexion...making my face look and feel brighter.  </li>
            <li> I have used too much and over-exfoliated parts of my face.  </li>
            <li> (I have very oily skin).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see or feel that it is doing anything.  </li>
            <li> I got home and absolutely luv this product.  </li>
            <li> It takes a complete layer of dead skin off your face leaving it smooth without the sensitivity that most peels provider.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t believe how much yuck is built up on our outer skin.</li>
            <li> The guy was really persistent, but I was determined not to buy a thing.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a facial peel that is natural, safe, and really works.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I tried to see if the dirt was just how the product was made or if it was really my skin...</li>
            <li> Either way, I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> It really does the job.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a lot from this after reading the reviews, but this really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It makes the whole &#x27;peeling&#x27; experience on anything-</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> The lady at the mall kiosk was very persuasive and got me to try the Vivo Per Lei on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I give it one star because she has no choice , but not really deserve any star, better water makes your skin defect in the cream , the money should reenbolsar all person who have .</li>
            <li> but omg just gel that doesnt really go on or peel off anything</li>
            <li> Leave it on for about 2-5 minutes as you get ready for your shower.  </li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;I found a reasonable price on Amazon, so I continue to use it</li>
            <li> All of the peeling skin was immediately gone- smooth, and not irritated like it would be with a regular exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> Wanted to see results but didn&#x27;t really notice any change.</li>
            <li> Go to the mall and pay $55 for this product if u really need it.</li>
            <li> They will try to squeeze as much from you and try to make</li>
            <li> Then I go home on amazon and see that they are all here for much much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Found at a mall, resisted the sales lady and found it here for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> However, I had a very severe allergic reaction to the peel.</li>
            <li> So much so I ended up on Prednisone.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and it was so gentle and non erritating</li>
            <li> difinetley recommend this product, it really works.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it that much as yet.  </li>
            <li> I hope I can continue to get this product because I really like it.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed but $90 was crazy.</li>
            <li> but when i used it on my face, SOOO much came off.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a fragrance</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it is really exfoliating, or if it&#x60;s just the product &amp;#34;balling&amp;#34; up as you rub it on.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it!,,,</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle and doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> But that really doesn&#x27;t reflect on the product- it does reflect on the outlet in the Vegas mall (and myself!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try rubbing it on any smooth surface, even glass, and you will get the same resuts.  </li>
            <li> The item is working very well</li>
            <li> In about 3-4 days I received it, that night I did what the directions instructed and was amazed of how much peeling I was experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really really like it.</li>
            <li> a if I use too much.  </li>
            <li> I am taking the time to do this because I really do like this product</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think the product would really work.  </li>
            <li> So, thank you pesky sales guy for believing in a product so much that you will annoy me at the mall</li>
            <li> I got it fast and used it</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> Either way, I don&#x27;t give a flying fart if its really my skin peeling or not...</li>
            <li> It really does get the dry/dead skin off your face.</li>
            <li> Not irritating on my skin, at all.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thinking if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll really see the skin coming</li>
            <li> She was very persistent, I kept trying to walk away until she put some of the scrub on my arm.  </li>
            <li> , oh she gave me an extra stone &amp; mud bar for free..</li>
            <li> Amazon sells the real deal.</li>
            <li> and ( FAST SHIPPING )</li>
            <li> It is gentle.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> product really works.</li>
            <li> I put the product on my inner wrist because I know this area is normally free from wrinkles, oil, blackheads, whiteheads, sun damage, etc</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after using this product it was so much softer</li>
            <li> But what this seller shipped me was not the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really want to try and buy again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s done its thing and is ready to be rinsed off.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to genetics</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really takes year&#x27;s off your skin....</li>
            <li> this ones the real deal..</li>
            <li> And You Could Really Notice A Change In Your Face Color</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in my face &amp; the wrinkly lines around my eyes &amp; mouth.  </li>
            <li> i bought this item at a mall from a very pushy israeli woman.</li>
            <li> this company is very misleading and practices unethical business.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see my skin really take any benefits from this.</li>
            <li> and thanks Olesea</li>
            <li> : Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of the face peel and moisturizer</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for exfoliating your face!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  </li>
            <li> It removes the top layer of dead skin better than any facial peel or skin care product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works and cleans the pores of the skin really well.</li>
            <li> and now she wants me to by some for all the girls in the family.</li>
            <li> Husband loves that he gets a very close shave after using.</li>
            <li> i got this at the mall and paid way to much , i compared the boxes when i recieved this in the mail</li>
            <li> However, the stuff I got from amazon, seller touchdown, was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I know that you can get the real product online as my mom got her real product from amazon.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is really a scrub.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it because afterwards your skin is soft and moisturized (but not to an oily degree).</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Really exfoliates.  </li>
            <li> After two uses my skin feels so much smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> I stated using this as it stated two times a week, I have increased it to three times a week, and I&#x27;m careful to make sure to thoroughly wash my face completely to make sure that there is no trace of it left over on my face and my skin looks and</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the good and negative reviews before buying the peel.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and genetically have more lines than friends my age or older.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s not amazing or anything, just does what it says, its a really light peel, more of an exfolient.  </li>
            <li> and it removes all of the dead skin cells from my face, leaving it feeling very fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li> i was getting the the real deal not a very expensive gule substance.</li>
            <li> Then she put the peel under my eye and WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Well, I was very pleasantly surprised that I actually did see significant, immediate results!  </li>
            <li> Used other brands, and I found this one is just much better.</li>
            <li> As many other people on here, I was scammed by the sales rep.</li>
            <li> As for my skin now in my subjective opinion, it has a more even quality, my pores seem smaller, and there is a general glowy quality that all girls adore!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I bought a second jar from here and it is exactly the same and outstanding quality that I remember experiencing.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I too, was approached by kiosk salesperson.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years now and haven&#x27;t found any other product that works better or faster than this one.</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, I originally purchased this product from the stands in the middle of the mall, which in turn cost me a ton of money!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good facial peel for a long time, but have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s this huge issue on it being a &amp;#34;scam&amp;#34; especially the ingredients, but I know that my face hasn&#x27;t been this soft EVER!!</li>
            <li> It does leave the skin real soft and smooth though and I will definitely use it sparingly (once a week)</li>
            <li> Then you splash your face with water, rinse it off, and you are left with a squeaky clean, glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I checked the prices on Amazon while in the store and negotiated him down to a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have to keep wiping in downward as the tiny particles tend to want to stick to any fine facial hair but the improved appearance in my skin afterward is worth it.</li>
            <li> this works great to remove all of that dry &amp; dead skin.</li>
            <li> Much like face peels, more stuff comes off around the mouth and chin and less on the forehead.</li>
            <li> However I do believe that the product is working and is not solely the formula clumping up due to some type of thermal reaction or friction (insert other possibilities lol) because as i rub more of the product on, the less it clumps up and remains in its gel consistency and mind</li>
            <li> It was quite amazing how it removed dead skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing the results you can get with a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it works, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Buying it online makes it affordable, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> When using this product you have to be aware that it may take a bit of time and effort to completely take it off your face.</li>
            <li> a recent family vacation my aunt, a true product junkie</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the watery side compaired to higher end products like Nava Natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get how it works, but it definitely does &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the top layer of skin off your face without any burning, redness, irritation, scrubbing or abrasion- instantly.</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin was soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li> After washing the product off your face; which by the way is a bit of a pain as the little balls are all over, your face does feel clean but nothing special by any stretch.&lt;br /&gt;There are many lines out there similar to Vivo Per Lei such as Donna Bella &amp; D&#x27;or</li>
            <li> All these little pills stuck to my skin and the fine peach fuzz on my face, and no matter what I tried to get it off, it would not come off!</li>
            <li> So when the scrub was about half gone, I started searching the internet for a better price.</li>
            <li> For the first time since I hit puberty, I have almost no black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I hope to be able to remove some wrinkles that come with age and sun damage, but even then the facial peel and day time moisturizer does not irritate my skin and I will definitely be buying it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The product does ball up but it is also picking up dead skin in the process (gross i know, yet fascinating).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no inherent justice in this world though, and so I spent most of my twenties battling acne and my early thirties trying to undo all the acne damage.</li>
            <li> I will not use it again, and would like to suggest that if you are an older person with thinner skin, you should avoid this product.</li>
            <li> face will look and feel youthful and vibrant when you are done.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (I&#x27;m almost 30)</li>
            <li> How I found out about this product is when I went to visit my older sister.  </li>
            <li> My skin was left soft and smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li> He mainly uses it for ingrown hairs around his neck.</li>
            <li> reasonable priced and works better than any I have ever tried and I have tried quite a few in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I use it on forehead, cheeks and the bridge of the nose mainly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People that have chemistry knowledges should know better, if not a simple search on wikipedia about the ingredients should be enough.</li>
            <li> the older I get.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also very sensitive, and this absolutely hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face very soft and moisture absorbing.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and allergic to almost everything I put on my face, but this is gentle and works for me.</li>
            <li> After applying in the same area right after... Not that much skin rolled off.</li>
            <li> even the day after i bought it, my left hand that she showed me on was so much softer than my right.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to every women out there who is into their beauty.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work by grinding off the surface cells like scrubs do, but works by dehydrating the surface cells with the high salt/mineral content.</li>
            <li> However, I still think the price was a bit high for the amount of product in the container.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I also use and highly recommend vivo day cream</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other facial peels and I have always felt very fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old with moderate adult acne and scarring, so I needed something different and a little more effective than my normal routine.</li>
            <li> NOT dead skin!!</li>
            <li> From the first time you use it, you can actually see the results, which I can&#x27;t say for many other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i saw this item at the mall and got it for less than half the price, i used it once a weeek- works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing, electrolysis treatments, countless acne products like proactive, neutrogena, mary kay, clean and clear, etc</li>
            <li> BUT my skin is so soft and clean after only two days</li>
            <li> Skin feels very smooth directly after but the next day I&#x27;m back to flakes in areas.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nearly impossible to get off of your face if you have any kind of fine hair at all!  </li>
            <li> I have had ultra sensitive skin my whole life</li>
            <li> I put it on clean dry skin and wait 3 min and rub off with my fingers.</li>
            <li> for the one who said rub it on a balloon is wrong because she probably wasn&#x27;t wearing gloves lol.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect the product to work well, so I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see a huge amount of difference, but my skin looks renewed, so I will purchase at least one more jar in the future.</li>
            <li> produce works very well.does what its supposed to.face feels soft and looks good.i have never had a product like this before</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim at the mall (big mistake, buy it on here) but in my opinion, it was still completely worth</li>
            <li> vivo is normally 78 bucks in the store</li>
            <li> I purchase many dead sea products and a Vivo brochure came along with my order.  </li>
            <li> You put this on and start rubbing lightly on your face and pretty soon all the dead skin starts to come off.</li>
            <li> My older sister uses it less often because she has much more sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t believe what people say about being able to scrub off visible dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Even my Clarisonic wasn&#x27;t able to rid my face of these dead skin cell balls.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few more times and have not used it for a while.</li>
            <li> I use the facial peel to remove the top layer of old skin at night band the next morning</li>
            <li> It makes my face glow by taking off the top layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from a mall kiosk a few years ago for MUCH MUCH more money.</li>
            <li> I rarely give a product 1 star, but if I could of give this facial peel</li>
            <li> IT PEELS THE TOP LAYER OF DEAD SKIN OFF WHEN YOU USE IT ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> how many DEAD SKIN CELLS came off the bathroom counter...</li>
            <li> When you put products on the dead skin they sit on top.</li>
            <li> I understand many people believe it is the product itself that rolls into a ball and creates an illusion of being dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much the same review as everyone else.</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin feels pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> even when I use a buffing agent, when I use the vivo, I still get more dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I saw a definite reduction of crows feet and smile lines from using it every two days for 6 days...</li>
            <li> She does spit a good game.  </li>
            <li> Most facial cleansers and peelers leave my face dry, this product did not.</li>
            <li> i dry off my face each time before rubbing more on to the same area.</li>
            <li> I love all the products, I have never experienced quick results like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake one, I used this on my face (as it says use on a dry face and then clean off by using warm water) and as you&#x27;re rubbing your face it seems like it&#x27;s tiny pieces of paper that forms from the actual product</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m 4 hours out right now and am still picking off the white rolled bundles.  </li>
            <li> For those folks that left positive reviews, i can&#x27;t help thinking they are all connected to this rip off scheme!  </li>
            <li> Your dead skin lightly falls off within a minute to reveal soft smooth that your products can actually work with.</li>
            <li> I guess I was looking for more of a deep cleaning or exfoliating feeling - which may be my mistake with the purchase of this product if this is not what they are aiming for - but it is certainly not what I was expecting or particularly looking for.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and it doesnt look as rough!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two weeks no negative reaction so far!</li>
            <li> He showed me all these Vivo products when I said no he added three other products for free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a brand new product.  </li>
            <li> The lid did not seem brand new, therefore I&amp;#34;m</li>
            <li> When I purchased this through Amazon, it stated that it is new.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any new problem areas pop up.  </li>
            <li> My item seem used the seal was torn already and the box had some stains and indentations not at all brand new...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing stuff for gently &#x27;sloughing&#x27; off dead dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used Skin VIVO products before and liked them, so I decided to give this Dead Sea Minerals Facial Peeling a try.</li>
            <li> I used only a tiny bit of this product on the peeling areas, rubbed lightly in a circular motion, and rinsed off using Cetaphil soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to remove dead skin and revitalize a tired face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face super dry.</li>
            <li> you will get all these mini-balls of product attach to even the most minimal facial hair.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, the tone is more even, and I break out far less often!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li> Skin is very soft after use.  </li>
            <li> that while I&#x27;m not sure if I can give all the credit to the peeling product yet, I am highly satisfied,  but here are the facts- you decide (please disregard the fox news reference, its rhetoric is practically an invasive species where I live): This product immediately went to work on my face.</li>
            <li> Next time I will spring a little bit more for the real thing.</li>
            <li> as I went through it pretty quickly using it everyday.</li>
            <li> thats how it gently takes of ur layer of dry dead cells.and after rubbing it on ur DRY face, it rinses right off with warm water.</li>
            <li> They commented on how clear my skin is!  </li>
            <li> tried selling me the exact same product for 49.00.</li>
            <li> I still get pimples from time to time due to stress, but I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion has been significantly clearer.  </li>
            <li> first being $129.00 just for the facial peel!</li>
            <li> Nothing pisses me off more than a sham!</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft i lovet his stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be watching my credit card and make sure no more than what was charged is taken off of my card.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t get much in each jar, and I generally dislike products that are so wasteful with packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, aggressive sales</li>
            <li> : I first bought this product due to an extremely aggressive salesman in Las Vegas- like many others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually the type to fall for hard-sells, but it happened- lack of sleep, alcohol, friends....</li>
            <li> My skin looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I first tried this facial scrub when my sister came over for a visit.  </li>
            <li> I received the package, I compared to the bottle from vegas and was exactly the same.</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft after using!</li>
            <li> and I paid a fraction of what I paid at the mall for the exact same product.</li>
            <li> I like it so far!</li>
            <li> I have exfoliated my whole body and barely made a dent in the container.</li>
            <li> Well, I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious to see that it is</li>
            <li> I am buying this for my wife, who currently lives overseas, and with some claims of residue I had to test it first before I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kiosk reps lead you to believe that the 24 months stated on the box will entitle you to a $10 refilled jar of products (Still higher than online product) if returned to the kiosk in 24 months when actually that is an expiration date.  </li>
            <li> It is not dead skin!  </li>
            <li> but I just received the SAME product here through amazon for obviously a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li> but your skin is amazingly soft after!</li>
            <li> It is the exact same stuff and is literally 1/5 the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed less and less skin coming off each week but does a good job but keep expectations in check.</li>
            <li> I like how this easily takes off the dead skin on face and makes skin feel so very soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a very gentle but effective exfoliator for my skin - a surprisingly difficult thing to find.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SO many different things and for me,Vivo &amp; Roc, far out perform any of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and suffer from psoriasis, live in an arid climate, have a tendency toward combination skin (along my face and neck) and am in my mid-30s.  </li>
            <li> The excess product and the dead skin wash away easily with lukewarm water.   </li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and just got married for the 2nd time, and our honeymoon was in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> More skin came off around my mouth and nose, as with normal face masks, and only a little came off my cheeks</li>
            <li> It leaves little \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot; and it seems that it attaches to the fine hairs on ones face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers have made a big deal about the fact that the white stuff that comes off as you scrub is not dead skin, which I think is pretty obvious the first time you use it because this gel is SO gentle.  </li>
            <li> Not happy, but should have known better than to cave in to sales pitch at a mall kiosk!</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin free of dead skin and looking completely new.</li>
            <li> It was only half filled!</li>
            <li> That only made me more exited about the product because now i know its not just spmething hidden within the ingerients.</li>
            <li> You can see the skin become more smooth and so much less dull.</li>
            <li> In high school, I would occasionally go to the tanning bed &amp; lay out in the sun (particularly before any type of formal dance/special event.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what in the ingredients would cause my skin to come off like that, particularly without any apparent drying agents in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t do any peeling, the only thing you peel off your face is this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested it on different parts of my body and some of that dead skin is much darker or much lighter than the rest and skin peels more or less depending on where I apply it or how much I&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li> The product is clear, and you can see that it takes off dirt, which isn&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li> That much skin removal would be the equivalent of a professional facial peel!</li>
            <li> Helps clear up acne too</li>
            <li> This product helped minimize my blackheads and clear up my acne</li>
            <li> and this product helps remove the dead skin and leaves my face smooth and does not damage my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the product for $50 in Hawaii, and then I found it for much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to completely remove once applying.  </li>
            <li> I am 21 years old</li>
            <li> so you young ones can use this product also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the mall, but much much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been so busy with Christmas shopping , I have yet to take the time before showering to try it out.</li>
            <li> If you guys really want to see if the stuff rolling off is the product, you should get a pair of gloves and roll it around in the glove to see if the same thing happens.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Leaves skin baby soft</li>
            <li> I think it does leave my skin soft and makes it easier to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> far as this product goes: I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Are all these really the same manufacturer?  </li>
            <li> even the kitchen sink, so what is coming out may not be old skin after all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I actually saw &amp; felt results, and fast.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or know you are sensitive to methylisothiazolinone, I would recommend avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Prescription creams that actually work don&#x27;t even cost that much.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the 1st one I bought directly from the mall.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to see that the flakes are NOT dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> So many of those gritty, &#x27;peeling&#x27; exfoliators (even the ones with round &#x27;gentle&#x27; beads designed for daily use) just irritate my skin and trigger the oil glands to pump out oil.</li>
            <li> , i have sensitive skin that gets redness</li>
            <li> Soft, radiant skin in minutes....</li>
            <li> Not harsh and</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week in conjunction with daily use of Vivo Per Lei Gentle Milk cleanser and Vivo Per Lei day lotion and night cream.  </li>
            <li> again!!!!and of course it&#x27;s not refundable...same old story</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my deep-seated white heads have been fewer and fewer, and I try to use this 3 times a week with much success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought the Premier Facial Peel yesterday, and yes I too was lured in by the mall kiosk guy and paid too much.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin looking refreshed and feeling soft..</li>
            <li> That was NOT dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I later found out on Amazon and E-Bay that I paid too much, so please don&#x27;t get suckered into these mall Vivo pushers.  </li>
            <li> I think the product was old</li>
            <li> when i do use it, it makes my skin feel so baby soft.</li>
            <li> and so far my face is soft.</li>
            <li> The whole time the salesperson tried to convince us that this product on amazon was not the same thing!</li>
            <li> but nothing fixed my problem.</li>
            <li> and I assure you, what I received is real deal, in the same packaging as the Vegas store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After a day at work, you can come home and use the vivo facial peel, off comes the whole day of makeup and the air around you.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Proactiv Renewing Cleanser or Olay Professional Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s old product...</li>
            <li> This product seems gentle enough and has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on the skin at all.  </li>
            <li> The material that you&#x27;ll see rubbing off is the balls melting from the heat/friction action.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of it before but was amazed by the amount of dead skin it took off my hand, and how smooth it felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> After much harrassing, he finally purchased.</li>
            <li> returned 5 days later, ready to buy the peel.</li>
            <li> For one it was browner in color, smells like glue, is thicker in consistency and DOES NOT leave your skin soft.</li>
            <li> It cleans away dead skin, and leaves a smooth finish on your face.  </li>
            <li> my face and neck have not been this soft or clear since i as a teenager.</li>
            <li> I love it, it actually feels like you are taking off all of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> (more often than recommended).&lt;br /&gt;The white globs of gel that form as you scrub are sticky - they are carrying away the dead skin cells that you are scrubbing off.  </li>
            <li> Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using a facial peel (like Vivo Per Lei&#x27;s) helps slough off the dead skin and even out the skin tone a lot more than just washing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It works instantly, you just put some all over your face and its like magic, the dead skin just seems to lift off your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale and was skeptical, but my sister immediately commented on how good I looked.  </li>
            <li> This is a similar product to the cult favorite &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; from japan and several other korean brands like missha and etude house has them too.</li>
            <li> Used it later in the night and WOW, I am so serious when I say this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> The first time I put the peel serum on my face and leaved it for about 15 minutes and it never fully dry, it was sticky on my face.</li>
            <li> What a nicely packaged, and presented jar of garbage, this does nothing, other than to create some sort of barrier on your face, and pretend its taking away dead skin, IT&#x27;S NOT.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; say, as we get older we do not exfoliate naturally as we did when we were younger.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I talked the man down to $20 from $85.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very lazy with taking my makeup off sometimes and this makes it more enticing to do so, plus it works.</li>
            <li> Simply dampen you face, apply a small amount and rub in a soft circular upward motion adding more as required.  </li>
            <li> She could have easily lied to me about her acne just to get my money, but for someone who has been very impatient with her skin, I was sold.</li>
            <li> Takes off the dead skin to reveal clean and glowing skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I have had much better facial peelings in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this facial peel in Vegas last year.  </li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, the following day a coworker had asked me what was different about me.</li>
            <li> I also tested the peel on a regular piece of paper and it has EXACTLY THE SAME effect as when you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> so I just grab my Proactiv facial scrub or Olay Exfoliating Scrub (any scrub will work though) and use a little bit and that easily takes off what the water did not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool to watch your skin \\&quot;roll off\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t finish the job, when I go to rinse it off the little balls of rolled up skin stay on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I KNOW its dead skin because I am native american, my husband is white, and my best friend is black and we ALL have a different color (matching our individual coloring) of skin traces left on the cotton pad after using the peel!</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old female from New Orleans.  </li>
            <li> I have actually experimented with this a bit by using it on a patch of very dry cracked skin vs. a patch of freshly scrubbed skin - there are more white globs, and bigger white globs, when you use it on very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This even got to my house in barely two days!!  </li>
            <li> Rub it into a balloon or Xbox controller or ANYTHING, they apparently have skin &#x27;peel&#x27; as well!!</li>
            <li> I open this in the pic on line looks more white like little</li>
            <li> But it really gets rid of all the old dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it will definitely remove the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Very soft but your epidermal layer of dirt and daily grime is removed and your skin is amazingly soft and supple.</li>
            <li> And it is way less than a facial, and you can use it countless times, for $13 it was totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the one I usually use (Neutrogena  advanced solutions peel)</li>
            <li> I wash my face as normal in the shower usually with a cream cleanser (feels more moisturizing) and leave it WET.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just not seeing much for long term results.</li>
            <li> Very watery and has to rub for a long time to get the peeling effect.</li>
            <li> this product gave me the normal skin I&#x27;ve been dreaming of and the only product i use which saves me tons of $$!!</li>
            <li> As with any facial peel product, it takes quite a bit of rinsing to get all of the residue off your face, but that is normal.</li>
            <li> When first approached, the sales girl wanted to charge him $125, she finally dropped to $40 so at least it wasn&#x27;t the full price.</li>
            <li> Well, this isn&#x27;t true, it is indeed the dead skin that is flaking up on my face.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy until he came down to what I have paid for other products , in this case the magic number was $29.00.</li>
            <li> The only con would be the scent, it&#x27;s not very pleasant but not horrible either.</li>
            <li> One word of caution, if you have down on your face, you may have pieces of skin (like sweater woolies) that were exfoliated that will stick to the hairs, and need to work a bit to get them off, but that hassle is worth the exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> And you can hardly wash it off easily.</li>
            <li> the product works really well and price is quite reasonable, will continue to order regularly and recommned to other friends</li>
            <li> makes your face look new &amp; younger.</li>
            <li> I have really flakey dry skin</li>
            <li> I also used it on my heels and it worked very well on my dry heels.</li>
            <li> This product really takes the dead skin off gently.  </li>
            <li> This product literally rolled all of the dead skin off of my face and left it feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> When you use it, Its fun to watch as it gathers up all the old dead skin on your face.</li>
            <li> For the past 10 years, I have pretty much stayed out of the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty small amount and goes fast</li>
            <li> There are no active ingredients in this product that would be peeling your skin.  </li>
            <li> not harsh on the skin, thus does not dry out your face after using.</li>
            <li> My skin is still very soft even after 3 days of the last application.</li>
            <li> Then I use my usual Clean and Clear Deep Action Exfoliating scrub at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li> (This stuff left my skin all soft and shiny!)</li>
            <li> Despite my reservations, (and due to the fact that a combination of fluorescent mall lighting and youth culture worship exhaust my self esteem and logical faculties to the point of momentary insanity) I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> I found it in my local mall at one of the kiosks and they wanted nearly $100 for it!</li>
            <li> They mark the price up majorly in retail locations.</li>
            <li> , as some reviewers have stated, the sticky white globs can stick to your facial hair a bit where it gets long along your hairline or jawline, but it comes right out if you rise the gel off with a washcloth and use a circular motion on the hairy spots.  </li>
            <li> This really works well to exfoliate the dry skin of my face!  </li>
            <li> I will say though, be sure to use it on a dry face as it is harder to rinse off when put on a wet face.  </li>
            <li> it was hanging off, I scrubbed my face with an exfoliator and it helped most of that loose dead skin come off the rest of the way!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the small piece of soap, nor the &amp;#34;paper towel&amp;#34; to wrap it in, but after a few minutes of an amazing hand massage with the &amp;#34;dead sea salt,&amp;#34; I was sold...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to work the same as a chemical peel or clear your acne.</li>
            <li> AND AFTER MULTIPLE USE YOU CAN ACTUALLY CLEAR UP ANY SKIN PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and have rosacea and back heads and thickening skin cells, and everything I use irritates my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I have only used this once, but so far I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling works for me because of my sensitive</li>
            <li> One friend asked if I had had a professional facial!</li>
            <li> I use the product while I&#x27;m in the shower so that my skin stays wet during the whole process and I moisturize while my skin is still damp to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year old male teen with a soft face that matches a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> This gel does tend to run and become very liquid like so be careful when its around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft and different than before.</li>
            <li> but it did take alot of skin off, and now for the face it left it so soft like baby skin c:</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than having a professional do a facial peeling!!!</li>
            <li> there is white stuff coming out after rubbing this product into my skin, but that is not dead skin like they like to make you believe, it is some of the ingredients this product that react this</li>
            <li> agree with another poster that it&#x27;s not dead skin, it is simply the product balling up.  </li>
            <li> I was totally thrilled (but remained skeptical)</li>
            <li> Some people say it gets worse before it gets better when treating acne.</li>
            <li> I then follow with a cleansing toner to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave any product behind.</li>
            <li> annoyed i over paid $40 at a kiosk but still glad i was shown it cause i will from now on buy from amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird</li>
            <li> It takes off all the dead cells and leaves my skin fresh and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is like brand new skin after usage, only use about once a week to ten days.</li>
            <li> I tried my mom&#x27;s a few years ago when she was raving about her new, gentle exfoliator that she bought for $90 in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Good people shouldn&#x27;t have to waste their hard earned money on a crook&#x27;s crock pot recipe!</li>
            <li> came off 5) when I washed my face with water and patted it with a clean towel, and then looked at the towel it was covered with what I assume is the skin (a little gross actually)</li>
            <li> I want to also point out that I am Asian, so I recommend this for those of you who are Asian because we have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so much dead skin just wipe right off.</li>
            <li> how, the gritty pieces in there aren&#x27;t that harsh on your skin, i don&#x27;t even think my face turned red when i wiped it clean</li>
            <li> This is okay, but if left on the skin too long, it dries and becomes hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day and it exfoliates so gently and leaves my face feeling like velvet.</li>
            <li> I do believe it really works and definitely will last a long time</li>
            <li> Like other posters, I was approached by a very aggressive salesman at the mall.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in texture, but I did notice a difference in tone and shading compared to my other arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it in the shower because the little granules of dead skin/product will get all over.</li>
            <li> When I went home, I did some research and found that most consumers loved the product but hate getting tricked by the slick salespeople.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to wash your face before because the little balls will be black and it looks gross.</li>
            <li> This works very well and your skin feels so soft afterwards however use this product over this because you will shed dead skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far after getting this as a gift from my dear friend (who I can only imagine also got accosted by a persistent salesperson in Vegas).</li>
            <li> only has my disfiguring acne nearly disappeared (only a boil or two in the summer)</li>
            <li> Maybe its not dead skin cells that&#x27;s peeling off, maybe when the gel and tiny granules are mixed together</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found so far to remove makeup by my nose and on my chin, reduce zits, and keep my face looking younger without damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> Using this peeling product once a day for several days has left my elbows soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Always looking for a chance to show social interaction to my son, I agreed.</li>
            <li> Are they are really only worth those heavily discounted prices.</li>
            <li> no irritation, but when you put it on your face, these little balls forms (and they&#x27;re not from &amp;#34;excess skin&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> She actually did half my face first</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say much but it cleared up my dark spot...</li>
            <li> I have experimented by using this stuff on areas that are recently well exfoliated by my buff puff - barely</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, i had some dead skin hanging off my face and even after I washed my face</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s exactly what i saw come off my face, brown dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I was in an upscale Nashville mall with my autistic son when a kiosk sales lady asked if I was interested in a demonstration of the Vivo per Lei and Gratiae skin care lines.</li>
            <li> This facial peel is the first one I have used that did not leave my skin feeling so tight</li>
            <li> but after I refused to buy it, he dropped the price down to $40 (still paid too much).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not your dead skin peeling off, it&#x27;s the little balls becoming mush.</li>
            <li> it gets super hard to rub.</li>
            <li> I usually hide from the Vivo Kiosk people because they come right over to you and are very aggressive with their sales pitch, but the other week the girl caught me!  </li>
            <li> but I look so much prettier and I am needing less makeup.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li> Hi, I was in LVegas in November, 2013 and was lured into buying 200$ worth of products after being flirted with and convinced there are no better products out there, especially this product here.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has this knows that eventually there is no more dead skin balling up even after adding more product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the dead skin starting peeling instantly.</li>
            <li> Exact same product works the same to slough dead cells.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I know a lot of people wonder if it&#x27;s actually removing dead skin, I had the same thought at first.</li>
            <li> This has a very strange texture and doesn&#x27;t seem to be mixed completely.</li>
            <li> - If you have congestive heart failure... be warned that the sea salt is absorbed into your skin and can cause major heart  and health problems.... my ankles and feet looked like elephantiasis after using this product for only 3 days!</li>
            <li> Vivo  was expensive when I bought it at a mall in Tx, but its a good thing that Amazon has it for Less..</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a very hot/cute brunette in tight leather pants that made my head do a 180 degree turn, and her coworker signaled me there.</li>
            <li> It certainly rolled the dead skin in that area</li>
            <li> READ the negative reviews first!</li>
            <li> A deal just for me because I live here and will bring other customers.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of original and opened a bottle to my disappointment  it smelled, was half filled,</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad.</li>
            <li> I would much rather be pale than have leather looking skin.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have acne issues, this helps to remove dead skin cells and makes your skin fresh without feeling taut or abused, like other exfoliates tend to do.</li>
            <li> I got home and started doing some research about the company and the products only to find a lot of the same products being sold on Amazon for considerably less, considerably!  </li>
            <li> Other brands don&#x27;t exfoliate nearly as well as Vivo.  </li>
            <li> When I realized how much I&#x27;d been had the next day, I was pretty angry.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have it that sometimes the little peeling pills can get caught in the fine facial hair on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> But very very sticky and hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> less reddening, less oily and behold black heads are coming out easily.  </li>
            <li> This beads up after use much like every other exfoliator I have used with one major exception: no red raw face and zero irritation.  </li>
            <li> Only takes the size of a pea to cover the whole face, and so the small container should really last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wash the product off (sometimes with a mild cleaner--like Cetaphil) and use an exfoliating wash cloth to dry the skin after in an upward motion (I have one from Ahava that is decent--but am not sure if they sell it in the US or other countries outside Israel).  </li>
            <li> Humidity, stress, bad water, too much sun, gritty drying cleaners, glycerine filled moisturizers, vibrating skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for over one month, however I&#x27;m becoming skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It really peels off the yucky layers of skin without feeling harsh!</li>
            <li> This stuff cost a small fortune in the malls, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> The fact that I&#x27;ve spent hours picking at my face (which is a big no-no to begin with) in order to remove the remaining product means that this peel will be going on the shelf, only to be repacked on our next Walt Disney World excursion in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy these things, but seeing the amount of dead skin rolling off my face both amazed and horrified me.</li>
            <li> its old and its was empty  !!</li>
            <li> but I need to know the sellers who the people who received the true product, like who they actually bought from, I truly believe if I received a real one I wouldn&#x27;t have had such a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I was really tempted to purchase this at the mall for $40 (this is with what they told me was half off!!)</li>
            <li> The woman charged some major bucks for the other products that I bought - eye serum, moisture, body salts, body moisturizer and hand cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this item quite a few times before and this time used a new vendor on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and was glad to see it didn&#x27;t cause a bad reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li> My face typically feels really soft after I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> I have battled combination skin my entire life; during the winter months it&#x27;s so dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big sucker for stuff that exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t let it dry on your skin</li>
            <li> I was so angry that I felt like I was taken advantage of and cheated, and if this were a real company in a real store and not a kiosk in Hawaii, or Las Vegas, they would have been investigated or called out, and people would stay away.</li>
            <li> when I get that dry, cracked, flaky jazz going on around my nose and upper cheeks, I use the product and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> It has changed the look and feel of my face in just a few short weeks and has completely cleared my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> what I could understand(he had a heavy accent), and when he sampled the facial peel on my wrist, I will admit I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I spent over $100 on similar facial products.  </li>
            <li> I have notice a considerable difference in my skin in a few short weeks.  </li>
            <li> It removes dead skin cells, leaving skin feeling soft &amp; looking brighter!</li>
            <li> After I use the peel my skin feels tight, shinny (not oily), and so soft.</li>
            <li> the other (who uses some facial scrub/peel daily) had nothing come off.</li>
            <li> I could hardly avoid the cocky saleswoman at Century City who was plugging this and other Vivo products, as she sauntered up to me and offered a free facial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear goo with little \\&quot;exfoliation</li>
            <li> 24.99 each, well at any rate, the peel is weird, but works, I thought they put \\&quot;Glue\\&quot; in the peel, as it seemed to roll like dry glue, still not sure, but it did make my face appear to be more youthful!?</li>
            <li> I was nervous to use it because I was afraid it would cause me to breakout, of which it never did:)  </li>
            <li> It removes dead skin cells, excess oil, leaving a refreshed and clear skin.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is totally not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers are claiming that this product is only appearing to remove dead skin - that the stuff that appears to peel off is actually just the product balling up - this is definitely not the case.</li>
            <li> As far as application goes, I just put it on for 5 seconds and then roll away the dead skin with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Long Island and he tried to sell it to my for $150, with the day cream for $130.</li>
            <li> a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Although I think it should come with some instructions and all the when to use, how to use, when not to use, for how long you should apply it and all.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money, it will &amp;#34;exfoliate any surface you rub it on.</li>
            <li> I am african american and if a product claims to remove my dead skin cells, those skin cells would obviously be brown.</li>
            <li> It is a bit rougher than a regular terry cloth, but not so rough to damage your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liquifies instantly, dead skin cell come off easily on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> package was opened, and partially used, there were deep finger indentations in the product where someone had scooped out the product</li>
            <li> I am not a sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel soft and removes all my peeling dead skin.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m not sensitive to the product</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend getting a facial scrubber too though, because I cleansed my face thoroughly first and used a small amount and tons of dead skin</li>
            <li> and at first the facial peel seemed to be irritating my skin, reddening it, but I used the moisturizer to heal and nourish and I kept using it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this facial peeling cream because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritating the new skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I guess the old skin was pulling down on my brow and possibly shrinking my lips down?  </li>
            <li> Since I shave my legs everyday, or at least every other day, I wouldn&#x27;t expect there to be as many dead surface cells present.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others that worked better that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> 1)I could see that my skin was getting red (which doesn&#x27;t usually happen unless I&#x27;m seriously going to town or near the equator with 0 spf, my skin is typically very insensitive)</li>
            <li> not sure if this is a new product that was sent out to me.  </li>
            <li> I have used several at home facial peels and either they didn&#x27;t work or they left my face raw.</li>
            <li> High quality product for less than half the price at retail stores.</li>
            <li> Thinking I had let it dry too long, I tried it again.</li>
            <li> I use it at night because my skin does get a little red but it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I use the facial peel every other day</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin sloughed off with just a little gentle rubbing.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use other facial peeling masks again!</li>
            <li> finally i bought other brand again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work at getting the dry skin off which is what I need this time of year.</li>
            <li> Put on dry and scrub.</li>
            <li> dry skin will start to come off.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t clog my pores and my skin IS NO LONGER dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> The dry skin starts to slooth off immediately.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry patches on my skin that no peel, moisturizer, or visit to dermatologist could fix.</li>
            <li> it feels sticky n dry</li>
            <li> It reminded me of putting glue all over my hands as a kid, waiting for it to dry, and then peeling it off.  </li>
            <li> it says on the box use on DRY skin.</li>
            <li> I could not beleave all the dry skin it took off.</li>
            <li> Did not work, it isn&#x27;t dry skin that you&#x27;re rubbing off, it&#x27;s the product.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and have NO problems with it sticking it hairs.  </li>
            <li> Use it in dry skin.</li>
            <li> On dry skin, I had no issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, you apply it to dry skin and basically rub it on.</li>
            <li> and I think alot of my problem was dry patches &amp; blackheads and thid stuff</li>
            <li> (as that makes a huge difference to me when I&#x27;m reading a review - some products are fabulous for some skin types/ages and can be horrific for others).</li>
            <li> Nothing else I have found has taken care of those dry patches the way this does.</li>
            <li> I get acne sometimes and my face is really dry</li>
            <li> that helps to take off the caked on cracked dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had to use a dry rag to rub off what I couldn&#x27;t get off, after repeated rinsings.  </li>
            <li> She had patches of dry skin on her face and it has eliminated them.</li>
            <li> If your face has flakes of dry skin or patches of dry skin</li>
            <li> But it does get rid of some dry skin.</li>
            <li> When I picked it up later, there was the dried \\&quot;skin\\&quot; like material all over the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin actually looks smoother and younger because it gets all the dead skin cells off so my skin can breathe and rejuvenate.  </li>
            <li> but I went back a few months later because it was Christmas time when they showed it to me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who these &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; actually are but this product is only for people who want to waste their money.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the product to know what it&#x27;s like, because I&#x27;m planning on returning this if indeed this is not a new product.  </li>
            <li> I googled every single ingredient on the list</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dark armpits and tried various products without any results.</li>
            <li> I will send the fake product back and keep trying different sellers till I get the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical about over the counter skin products as most of them don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;The finest Dead Sea cosmetics and beauty products based on natural ingredients found only in the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re trying to convince you that they&#x27;re the victim of some sales pitch in order to convince you that this product works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i noticed my face was looking pretty unhealthy and grimey.  </li>
            <li> I have black heads and dry skin that is constantly peeling around my forehead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, down to the nitty gritty.</li>
            <li> This jar will last a while as a little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and they claim the container will last 2 years (a little goes a long way although when they applied it to my arm that wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;a little\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> This one seems to burn my sensitive skin a little, but it helps with minor blemishes and evens skin tone a little.</li>
            <li> So a few days later I pull it out of the bag and open it only to find that he sold me the tester jar and half of it is gone!</li>
            <li> Was not the same product that I had previously purchased from the mall.</li>
            <li> oily t-zone, dry and rough cheeks.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to gently, it left a slight rash on my skin.</li>
            <li> I find that product \\&quot;pilling\\&quot; is much less likely to happen this</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product at a local swap meet for $20.</li>
            <li> My face felt very dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a pretty big skeptic about things, however, I am absolutely desperate to get my acne and pores under control before the last signs of youth drain from my face.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount for each use so each container will last roughly 6 months.</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times a week because my new birth control has made me break out like crazy, this stuff has helped SO much.</li>
            <li> Rub it on dry skin and watch the dead layers of your skin ball up and then simply rinse with water.</li>
            <li> I have tried Retin-A and done face peels, but that stuff actually causes my lines to get worse because my skin is so dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> My skin tone was perfected better than it had ever been with other products I&#x27;ve tried - including very expensive cosmeceuticals obtained through aestheticians.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful, but the dry dead skin that collects under there from daily foundation use is wiped away in a flash!</li>
            <li> and my skin is behaving a little differently than it was in Florida</li>
            <li> It appears as if my skin is rolling off in little white balls.</li>
            <li> Problem is, I used it a little too often and had to back off for a while.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a little red afterwards.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s being rubbed off my face - whether it&#x27;s dead skin or the product itself but the texture of my face doesn&#x27;t seem any smoother and I don&#x27;t really notice any difference in other aspects either.  </li>
            <li> You rub it on your face and little tiny balls form.</li>
            <li> the peel starts to feel a little rubbery and that makes me think it has somewhat of a short shelf-life</li>
            <li> I use it every other day (as opposed to twice a week like in the directions) before I get in the shower, then after it sits a minute I rub away the dry skin and rinse.</li>
            <li> I also had some trouble getting the product off after using it but a little cleanser fixed me up.  </li>
            <li> I get these dry patches on my skin and even after I&#x27;d use other well known products and put on my makeup I would still have flaky patches.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase these products as long as Amazon sells them!!!</li>
            <li> People are always putting me at least 5 years younger than I actually am</li>
            <li> I got the real deal and not have to hassle with possibly being sold a fake product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything other than create a big mess.  </li>
            <li> It (the product minus the beads) did NOT produce this gunk on the plastic.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Dead skin comes off instantly and you look refreshed and have a glow.  </li>
            <li> Be careful for those dated sites.</li>
            <li> Now I just read a review that someone did not think the Vivo facial peel was removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste the product on a glove test, because I can see that it definitely works for me and people</li>
            <li> This came in a box, however it was taped closed like it had already been opened.  </li>
            <li> that it is actually removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> I think the only way to remove dead skin is to go have microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here about how the product doesn&#x27;t actually peel your dead skin off.</li>
            <li> The product did not serve its alleged purpose, at all.</li>
            <li> think those who believe there will be the same effect anywhere in the body, and not \\&quot;dead face skin\\&quot; are incorrect.</li>
            <li> I do this daily, the dead skin that comes off my face lessens.</li>
            <li> This product definitely gets rid of your dead skin.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful how often you use it though -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people think that this is sloughing off dead skin, it is the material of the gel that starts to clump together not your actual skin doing that.</li>
            <li> , you apply it on your face then as you wipe it off it like peels in clumps, not really peeling your skin but</li>
            <li> Definitely sloughs off dead skin.</li>
            <li> However I have found that leaving my face wet and drying my hands when putting on the gel helps with that.</li>
            <li> i do agree with the vast majority that this product is somewhat gimmicky implying at all you&#x27;ve sloughed off your face</li>
            <li> I could not really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the face peeling that I spent almost $100 on, is on Amazon for under $10.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about whether the product actually peeled dead skin.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am SOOOOOO tired of buying things that don&#x27;t work and am ready for a product that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh at all on skin  -  quite the opposite.</li>
            <li> and I said NO, thanks,</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put it on wet skin, no matter how keen the idea seems at the time.</li>
            <li> This is so watery &amp; not a lot of pink beads in</li>
            <li> &quot;.... I spent hundreds on LanCome and didn&#x27;t do anything for me...</li>
            <li> I spent $120</li>
            <li> Careful</li>
            <li> I also have never really been a tanning freak.</li>
            <li> I then washed it off, dried my wrist, and did it a second time.</li>
            <li> I use this product roughly one a week</li>
            <li> Deserves minus 1 star for this reason.</li>
            <li> So when I finally opened it i realized it was all dried out.  </li>
            <li> This is literally water, dead sea salt, and some granules of nut shell powder along with various chemicals/synthetics.  </li>
            <li> It may look gross because it&#x27;s dead skin</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything except plain yellow Dial soap and St. Ives apricot scrub.)</li>
            <li> The other day I accidentally transferred some of the product onto the outside of the container with my fingers and it dried.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sting or rub harshly like other facial peelers, yet this is what I observed</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different peels, a ton of night creams, cleansers and other products.</li>
            <li> I was curious about other people&#x27;s reviews online, so I searched it and food it for 8$ on amazon.</li>
            <li> You just put a little on your finger and rub it on a small part of your face until the old skin sloughs off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no positive results.</li>
            <li> My skin peels off and it&#x27;s red and raw.  </li>
            <li> Peels the old layer of skin off with very little product you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to use much, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is similar to a little miracle in that this can sometimes be a painful ailment with the elbows cracking and catching on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is exactly the same it takes off all the bad skin off and leaves my face stretched as though I had a face lift.</li>
            <li> If this starts to clear up in the next month and this is just a necessary awkward phase, I will change my rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was at first skeptical.</li>
            <li> all the money I spent!</li>
            <li> I have yet to use the product other than what the rep performed on me in the mall.</li>
            <li> Other sunscreens seem like they burn my skin.  </li>
            <li> Use a small dab, it will last!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m with the other reviewers who think this.</li>
            <li> Other buyers speak of experiences finding this product at a kiosk in the mall for upwards of $200.</li>
            <li> I take a small amount with my fingertips and rub in a circular motion around my T zone, with a big emphasis on my nose.</li>
            <li> just turn the other way.</li>
            <li> I have never had any irritation after using this product, and I use it every other day</li>
            <li> I used to avoid exfoliators like the plague but with this I can finally get off that dead skin!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this after only two uses, but....</li>
            <li> He swindled me into buying some other product along with this with $150.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is skeptical about the product, I can assure you, the first time you use it you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing this and they were not overstating the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Requires only a small dab of product.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin after about 2 weeks of use that I have ever seen with an other product.  </li>
            <li> After reading the day cream reviews, I moved on to researching the other products in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But vivo per lei peeling does not have any effect, in other words does not do anything, my skin still has flakes after using this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff at mall kiosks tends to be pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> Nothing ever works on this issue - lotions, gels, other products, nothing.</li>
            <li> But I didnt want to pay the $45 price that it was being listed for on other sites and/or stores.</li>
            <li> The bigger problem is that once my skin heals up, it looks a lot thicker and ruddier than usual.  </li>
            <li> The gel is clear and it has little beads in it-- hard to imagine where the &amp;#34;dead sea&amp;#34; part is.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;If&amp;#34; these little balls were actually dead skin, my face would be red &amp; irritated due to the amount of skin removed.</li>
            <li> It is very rare when cosmetics smell seems unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> The sales person that I ran into in West Pavilion persuaded me to purchase a box of Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling (they threw in some unnecessary \\&quot;gifts\\&quot;) for a total of $198.52.</li>
            <li> I know this product is actually removing dead skin because I could SEE the dead skin stuck to my face</li>
            <li> Then I realized that my dead skin was not actually coming off, it was the gel itself that makes it look like your dead skin is coming off.  </li>
            <li> a little watery hence the shelf life might be a little long.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother and I have less blackheads on my nose (again, something I couldn&#x27;t get rid of with any other product).   </li>
            <li> Actually, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; anything off hard surfaces like marble or stone or glass-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not one of those people that doesn&#x27;t shower for a couple of days, but my skin looks so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Stay away from this item, not worth the money, not worth the time.</li>
            <li> I remember my &#x27;dark spots&#x27; going away</li>
            <li> At least try the facial peeling and maybe the spot treatment, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> is dead skin when in reality only a small fraction of that is</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I bought it for $30 which is startling now considering how much it costs on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it has helped me get rid of some dark spots over time.</li>
            <li> , I could rub it on there, wait a few seconds and get the same results; \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; looking material from the PRODUCT itself!  </li>
            <li> i removed my dark marks and my mother sunspots.</li>
            <li> As you keep exfoliating and adding product in the same session, no more dead skin comes off.</li>
            <li> you decide to buy this, just be careful where you store it because it will get watery and messy.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not exfoliation, why are my finger pads raw and covered in little white spots of dead skin?</li>
            <li> Product arrived half empty and dried up.</li>
            <li> I too was chased down in the mall...</li>
            <li> This company should be shut down.</li>
            <li> I looked up the website that was written down for me by the Kiosk manager, and it seems like a hoaks.</li>
            <li> but then she brought it down to 50.00 (just for me, mind you.</li>
            <li> What a let down.</li>
            <li> but the guy said he&#x27;d knock it down to $50 \\&quot;for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;2nd - Hands down...</li>
            <li> It was less dark than if I hadn&#x27;t scrubbed my skin.  </li>
            <li> Others dry out your face then your skin flakes off, but this just allows your dead skin cells, makeup and dirt to just rub off!  </li>
            <li> All I do is add my cream after use and whalla, no more dry skin and no thickness to skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with a few other items from the mall 2 days ago for $200.00.</li>
            <li> and I flat had to get rude just to get away from them.</li>
            <li> I also have slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> It also evened out my skin tone temporarily, in that my cheeks are slightly ruddy.</li>
            <li> So obviously it&#x27;s really peeling my skin off and not just making a chemical reaction to where it&#x27;s making fake dead skin.</li>
            <li> I should have known from the price point that this was not a real Vivo Per Lei product, but the proof was definitely in the poor performance.  </li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon for half of the price they quoted.  </li>
            <li> typically a thickening agent) .....</li>
            <li> When I expressed my concern on their pricing, they simply threw in \\&quot;more gifts\\&quot; to justify their outrageous over-priced products.</li>
            <li> After using this stuff I never really realized how dirty my face really was.  </li>
            <li> I got the bar of eucalyptus soap (black bar) night cream, peeling treatment and a body lotion, also eye cream, all for an unreasonable amount of money.</li>
            <li> and once she used this once a week she started seeing less pimples.</li>
            <li> for all those who say it isn&#x27;t skin that is exfoliating I tried it on half my face and on one of my hands..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a common enough problem for people, but it makes me look like I have the measles for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid 100.00 for products that give much less.  </li>
            <li> But you can get these products together for less than $40 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shallow and soft.</li>
            <li> 4)the gel-liquid contains little beads but as I rubbed in a circular motion a ton of other stuff-what I assume is dead skin-</li>
            <li> Wish I had paid less, but when you consider that I recently almost bought a different daily peel for $80/month, the $99/year is not so bad.  </li>
            <li> The product is also a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> It does make a mess</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t torture my skin or rub for a long time because that would leave it raw and pointless.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the torturing you do to keep your ACNE PRONE skin clear feels counterproductive because you are left with dry and flaky skin. :(</li>
            <li> my husband has very dark skin, and when he used it, the balls were black.  </li>
            <li> Finding the right products that don&#x27;t irritate is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I do agree with some of the previous reviews that the stuff coming off your face is probably not just dead skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not clean</li>
            <li> then took a little bit of product, taking care not to have those beads, and rubbed it on my skin.</li>
            <li> what you will from my little experiment, and know that I bought mine from the kiosk, not Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now, and there is a little over 3/4 of it</li>
            <li> I add a little at a time (like a little dab size you would use for moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I wipe off my fingers before re-dipping because you will have these little balls of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; peeling off</li>
            <li> It also burns my face a little bit, even after I have washed it off.</li>
            <li> OR it&#x27;s peeling to those damn little acne bumps that will, otherwise, stay there for years.</li>
            <li> Test it for yourself, rub a little of this stuff on anything, your bathroom counter, a piece of plastic, even the box it comes in, they will all \\&quot;peel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It forms little pieces of supposed \\&quot;exfoliated skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I also avoid my cheeks and chin because the product can get stuck to little hairs and it takes a while (and effort) to come off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be nervous when little balls of skin come off, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Both times I have had little balls of exfoliant stuck to my face that I&#x27;ve had to rip off my face with tweasers.</li>
            <li> My hands exfoliated well, but little residue rubbed off when I used it on my legs.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 uses, all the dark pigmentation of sun damage spots were gone!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and in spite of some of the bad ones, I decided to give it a try, being a girl, I like trying new facial things.</li>
            <li> But as previously said the product isnt dead skin and dirt its simply dried product.</li>
            <li> but I am not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll immediately start to see little balls form from the dead skin, debris, etc.</li>
            <li> These people who complain about &amp;#34;sticky white balls&amp;#34; must be doing something wrong, like using it on a wet face, or maybe they have been sold a bogus product on a &#x27;discount&#x27; website.</li>
            <li> I read a review that said the dead skin, dirt, etc that it takes off your skin is just the product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a skin peeling product to remove the dead layer of skin on my face.</li>
            <li> but this helps remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Sticky, but seems to lift dead skin.  </li>
            <li> When I do, I can see traces of the mask that were left behind.</li>
            <li> If I use it everyday, the scars fade in about 3-4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> She dabbed it on my face, said to leave it for a minute, and then slough off the dead cells.</li>
            <li> I will try it again in a few days since it says to use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> and suddenly I went from annoyed and about to walk away to fascinated.</li>
            <li> n rub is not your dead skin that comes off</li>
            <li> Once in the shower, start to rub it into your face with circular motions, and then run your face under water, both accelerating the exfoliation and removing the dead skin</li>
            <li> My only option was to exfoliate it off, which was irritating.</li>
            <li> While it comes in a fancy package, it doesn&#x27;t seem to peel any dead skin away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it...</li>
            <li> I threw this away after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> This product (coupled with Vivo Per Lei Moisturizing Day Cream and Premier Dead Sea Pharmaceutical Gel) has changed my life.  </li>
            <li> I think it might be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> the site looks unprofessional, there are few links and few descriptions about the products.</li>
            <li> There is no way that is dead skin coming off.  </li>
            <li> This product literally peels the dead skin off your face...</li>
            <li> , their interactions create these balled up skin like looking things on your face that makes you think its dead skins.  </li>
            <li> I had dead skin all over my sink and in my hairline.</li>
            <li> Living in Israel will give you a few pointers on how to negotiate.</li>
            <li> Is it removing dead skin ???</li>
            <li> I also want to note, there has been some skeptisism surrounding wether or not the stuff peeling off is balled up product or dead skin.</li>
            <li> (by the way, I also bought the moisturizing day cream which is too heavy for my combo skin during the day</li>
            <li> I tested it out on my husband who had just shaved and he didn&#x27;t have the flakiness on his because he removed his dead skin by shaving.  </li>
            <li> the amount of dead skin that was removed.  </li>
            <li> The product performed exactly like a very expensive version, that I used before.  </li>
            <li> This product removes dead skin in minutes.</li>
            <li> and I notice all the dead skin has been sloughed off of my face.</li>
            <li> I used this product once before and ended up purchasing  a few for some friends</li>
            <li> I did not find any sticky residue left behind at all, on the contrary my skin sucked in the moisturizer without any problems.</li>
            <li> Dead sea minerals my ass.</li>
            <li> They tell you that as you rub this product on your face you can see your dead skin cells coming off,</li>
            <li> if the reviews I read said that it was not dead sin that was coming off, merely the product  \\&quot;rolling up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> All The Dead Skin Cells Just Come Off</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well it exfoliates and removes the dead skin without pain or irritation.  </li>
            <li> I am uncertain why some reviewers feel the clumps after exfoliation are dead skin.  </li>
            <li> so I applied the product to my wrist and began to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Water (aqua), SD alochol 40-2, Dead Sea minerals, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), cetreimonium chloride, propylene glycol, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), acrylates/C10/30, alcyl acrylate crosspolymer, hydrolyzed wheat protein, camellia siensis (green tea) leaf extract, imidazolidinyl urea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> something that I felt got the dead skin off my face without being so abrasive I might as well have just used sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> The dead skin just came sloughing off.  </li>
            <li> and it removes all my dead and dried up skin</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It rids the dead skin clogging your pores, without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> form your face yet isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li> For all of you out there that think this product is peeling off your dead skin, why not take it to your dermatologist and ask them?  </li>
            <li> It took a few days to get every piece off.</li>
            <li> so I deducted 1 star because the product could have killed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not messy or have your face feeling slimy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It rinsed off with a few splashes of lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> She was talking about the product coming from the dead sea...and being in Hawaii, I thought, that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how much dead skin came off my arm</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and 90% less money that the kiosk at the mall!</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower because it&#x27;s not easy to get off using a face cloth in areas hardest hit with excess dead skin.</li>
            <li> I carefully take a little bit and slowly work it in a small circular motion as I move around my face</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t because I saw that I could have bought the 6 pieces all together for LESS THAN HALF of the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; she gave me!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as much as the day cream, just because i never really have time to pamper myself :(&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> once a week put a small amount on your face and rub.....dry skin and dirt forms into balls of dead skin cells...</li>
            <li> If that demo was all skin, your skin would be RAW.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling raw or irritated either.</li>
            <li> This product works and it did not leave my face raw.</li>
            <li> done.&lt;br /&gt;*A little hard to rinse off with just water.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything except to turn into little balls that are hard to get off my face.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 2 days to get all the little balled up bits of the product off my skin.  </li>
            <li> There was very little exfoliating or cleansing power.  </li>
            <li> I would describe it as a &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; instead of a peel, because without even rubbing hard, dirt, oil, residue, makeup and dead skin ball up and rub off your face.</li>
            <li> It is not the product, because I used it sparingly, but I had a hard time removing the excess dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing; if that much exfoliating is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> it does take off some bad skin off your face, but gently.  </li>
            <li> Both times, I had trouble removing the product from my face!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I stocked up on Vivo and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> Not sure why...</li>
            <li> The Vivo Per Lei is a dissapointment, as it&lt;br /&gt;did not work as promised, but only did a mediocre job.</li>
            <li> The company doesn&#x27;t recommend using it everyday, but it hasn&#x27;t irritated or negatively impacted my skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> it flakes off in pieces, the summer months turn it into an oil slick, humid weather</li>
            <li> Not sure it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Really not sure</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; in seconds!</li>
            <li> and I usually have acne, since I have used this (2 weeks)</li>
            <li> PLEASE people dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> but it is not taking any dead skin off at all!</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> I read a review saying that the peeling effect is fake and that it will react the same on any surface, not just skin.</li>
            <li> So I tend to think at least some of it is dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> It is not better than the Clinique products I already use though.</li>
            <li> Not love it, but</li>
            <li> still just became oil slick on my mirror</li>
            <li> no more ingrowns and inflamed bumps in his neck area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they call this a peel.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean by all of the little balls that shed everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have ordered in the past and will order again.  </li>
            <li> I usually dont fall for things like this</li>
            <li> seriously thought about buying this product for $75, but thought I&#x27;d rather purchase it for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> so I bought two for less than the one I was going to get from her!!</li>
            <li> This nasty stuff is almost impossible to get off with warm water AND with soap or facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> Sorry this is long</li>
            <li> My husband, who had some tough black heads, no longer does.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it works; but I am done trying after 3 attempts and being bothered by the sticky residue after application removal attempts, near impossible to remove, it is now recycled.</li>
            <li> I use a clay mask that&#x27;s hard to rinse off.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really hard to get off at that point.</li>
            <li> This one has hardly any abrasion, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is just some sort of gel that even leaves a film on your skin that is oily and hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Nasty</li>
            <li> It also helps my complexion appear brighter as well and not as dull.</li>
            <li> I agree with the posters who say they have a hard time washing this off their face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson the hard way.</li>
            <li> when I put it on my face it was tacky, sticky and hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> some of the residues are hard to remove from my face.</li>
            <li> It was hard to turn away.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> main reason I use this product is because I get Petechia (small broken blood vessels) through my face when I get sick.</li>
            <li> so I use it only about once a month when my hormones are going crazy...</li>
            <li> Then I need to carefully pull them off with my fingers which can sometimes be tedious.</li>
            <li> If I could score it a negative I would.</li>
            <li> One thing that sucks it sticks to the peach fuzz on your face.</li>
            <li> Its really thick and discolored.</li>
            <li> that is absolute crap.</li>
            <li> What I mean by that is</li>
            <li> Apparently, this stuff is cheaper online, so I feel a little bit stupid.</li>
            <li> No more paying $85 at the mall!</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail the other day and was skeptical that it would work correctly.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers talking about how they got ripped off at the malls are obviously fake.  </li>
            <li> Removes all the dead skin and cleanses the pores as well!!  </li>
            <li> Getting this product at this price from Amazon is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> She had the worst time trying to clean it off her face.  </li>
            <li> It will not leave any residue behind ( unless you dont rinse the little dead skin balls or what not off well enough, thats annoying)</li>
            <li> The jar is also very thick, with excessive packaging-</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that the ingredients were not as organic or natural as I was led to believe.  </li>
            <li> I have bad skin, in fact it&#x27;s always been the bane of my social life.</li>
            <li> Anyways, if I didnt use the peel on my nose, I would have to scrub the crap out of my nose with a wash rag or my fingernails everyday just to remove the dang white heads.</li>
            <li> Being a little wary my boyfriend whipped out his phone and searched for on it</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet not good for your face.</li>
            <li> had a terrible problem with adult onset cystic acne that was destroying my face.  </li>
            <li> At least now I know!</li>
            <li> The tell all being that I use epiduo which can dry out my skin rather badly.</li>
            <li> I use it less often, but when I&#x27;ve been in the sun or cold air that I know damaged my skin.</li>
            <li> but when I do have very dry skin or damaged by the sun a ton of bad skin comes off.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for anyone who spent a lot of money on this product.  </li>
            <li> not happy with this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spread a thin layer all over your face before showering in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Well by this this point I was already annoyed.  </li>
            <li> I am not a happy shopper.</li>
            <li> Poor Israeli girls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken out and my skin has become irritated before from not removing it</li>
            <li> I feel like the steam can make it worse (for me).</li>
            <li> I too was annoyed with the sales rep of Vivo per lei.</li>
            <li> I choose to look at the kiosk guy and thank him for showing me something that works, and consider the extra money the price of a \\&quot;consultation\\&quot; rather than an annoying pesky sales scheme.</li>
            <li> Years ago my poor Sister got suckered into getting a Vivo package that had 4 containers</li>
            <li> I have the worse oily skin that&#x27;s always acne prone no matter what i did.</li>
            <li> Addicted to use it.</li>
            <li> it really does work to get all of the dirt and grim out of your pores!</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels but hate that the gritty stuff doesn&#x27;t wash away</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product for elderly people with thin skin and on heart medication.</li>
            <li> I feel like that is false.</li>
            <li> wish the FDA or some sort of agency could monitor companies like this that make false claims about their product.  </li>
            <li> To begin, I don&#x27;t mean to disregard others differing opinions, I am merely giving my own.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It could be outdated or have other ingredients added that are really bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift and before even reading ANYTHING online regarding other people&#x27;s experience, I was disappointed by the ingredients and the results.  </li>
            <li> Now I hate that having spent a lot of money on it.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I hate the way the peel smells, it feels tacky on my skin, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to rub off completely -</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this facial peeling.  </li>
            <li> at least I hope it is since it performed so badly.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I bought it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get pimples too often, but when I do, I get these nasty scars that last for a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me in Hawaii and when I was verrryyy skeptical heard how he got it</li>
            <li> People claiming that the product doesn&#x27;t peel off your skin but rather the mixture itself balls up are wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this is exfoliating anything at all and this company should be reported for selling a FAKE product and scamming people out of hundreds of dollars.  </li>
            <li> these are fake\\&quot;, are wrong.</li>
            <li> dont waste a dime on this crap.</li>
            <li> This sounds like a fake.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical buy some $8-$9 case and see if it works or not for you...</li>
            <li> and I am already addicted!</li>
            <li> He told me the versions sold on Amazon are fake.</li>
            <li> but it was a fake.</li>
            <li> The smell is weird too it smells like scotch tape or wall paint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> My skin DOES respond well to micro chemical peels, but it gets expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was still skeptical and on my drive home</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Am I using it wrong?</li>
            <li> Without the cost of expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li> I never would have bought something that expensive for myself.  </li>
            <li> So... If you EVER get sucked in to their mini store at the mall, just start acting like a crazy person, and don&#x27;t be afraid to yell!!</li>
            <li> This little product used to be expensive but at this price I would be insane not to buy it.</li>
            <li> , I was so disgusted, I threw it away, and gave the other stuff to a friend</li>
            <li> Well, I followed the directions and the advice of other reviewers, and it was just awful.</li>
            <li> It made my skin raw!!!!  </li>
            <li> Wish I could give it 5 stars but the difficulty in removing all the little grains of grit used to exfoliate is really annoying!  </li>
            <li> As you rub it on your face it creates these nasty little balls.</li>
            <li> I was in the mall yesterday and this guy was driving me crazy to try these products on me, so I just let him.  </li>
            <li> I would never purchase this at the mall and pay crazy prices.  </li>
            <li> It hurts and it&#x27;s dangerous.</li>
            <li> I m not too crazy abt</li>
            <li> I also bought the corresponding moisturizing cream, but wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say she talked me into it!  </li>
            <li> it was horrible ,It wouldn&#x27;t come of my face so hard to get it of</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get the grainy pieces off the face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in las vegas which was very expensive.</li>
            <li> Horrible, fells like a sticky hard gel that is impossible to evenly apply on the skin.</li>
            <li> After use, your skin does feel softer, but it is well-nigh impossible to remove the residue, even in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I would like to add to those that have a bad review about this product.</li>
            <li> for those that are complaining about it being sticky and a bad smell, maybe you did get a bad product if you purchased from online.</li>
            <li> This product caused me to breakout really badly.</li>
            <li> it was so bad.  </li>
            <li> Bad product bad company.</li>
            <li> My chin is still prone to acne but doesn&#x27;t break out as bad as it used to.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend said it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad acne</li>
            <li> Too bad they dont sell it at the mall anymore because i will paid $60.00 knowing</li>
            <li> She mentioned to me that she had acne on her forehead and T zone just as bad as me about a year ago</li>
            <li> Together $75 isn&#x27;t a bad deal.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see</li>
            <li> Just received it today, and was shocked when I opened the jar.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well this product works.  </li>
            <li> This did not work at all....very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I have to use something else to rub it off :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, and I should have just returned it, but instead, it&#x27;s still sitting in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is Fake!!</li>
            <li> I am truly angry here!!  </li>
            <li> yes a stupid con guy got me to buy it....</li>
            <li> This is a Worthless product.  </li>
            <li> tried the &amp;#34;counter&amp;#34; test others have claimed when they said the product is worthless.</li>
            <li> I had to use my face scrub and towel to get this crap of my face.</li>
            <li> I just got desperate and used it on my horribly chapped lips to remove flakey skin and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the mall from one of those annoying kiosks</li>
            <li> Yes it worked, but so greasy and sticky it was really annoying and got in my eyes</li>
            <li> the peeling is annoying.</li>
            <li> And it is annoying.</li>
            <li> Now that is bad!  </li>
            <li> Very bad, i don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> the amount of skin coming off was crazy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Sorry!!!  </li>
            <li> It was sold for outrageous prices, almost $80.</li>
            <li> Grainy disgusting feeling on your face</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> but the price was outrageous.  </li>
            <li> (but I have horrible skin and need to)</li>
            <li> Awful product, awful company.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> , it is just horrible.</li>
            <li> The girl was sooo annoying and persistent!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> But once I did my face, it was terrible</li>
            <li> He tried to get an outrageous price ($140)</li>
            <li> It feels like lotion and leaves your face sticky and nasty.  </li>
            <li> worst thing I&#x27;ve bought to date, this product is like putting glue on your face.  </li>
            <li> the wedding coming up, and a wedding gown with a lace jacket over my arms (partly chosen to hide my nasty elbows!)</li>
            <li> She said it was awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this today from a mall kiosk for $37 or so. I read some of the reviews on here, and would like to add some things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at first skeptical. I read a review that said the dead skin, dirt, etc that it takes off your skin is just the product. To test this out, I rubbed some product on some clean plastic. It created gunk. I then rubbed some product, taking care to avoid those beads, on the plastic (different area), and it did not produce that gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then took a little bit of product, taking care not to have those beads, and rubbed it on my skin. It produced gunk. It (the product minus the beads) did NOT produce this gunk on the plastic. After I washed off the gunk, I reapplied the product (not using the beads) in the same place, and it created no gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take what you will from my little experiment, and know that I bought mine from the kiosk, not Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim at the mall (big mistake, buy it on here) but in my opinion, it was still completely worth all the money I spent! I use it every other day (as opposed to twice a week like in the directions) before I get in the shower, then after it sits a minute I rub away the dry skin and rinse. Then I use my usual Clean and Clear Deep Action Exfoliating scrub at the end of my shower. It may sound like my skin would be super irritated, but honestly my skin has never been clearer. For the first time since I hit puberty, I have almost no black heads on my nose. My face is smoother, the tone is more even, and I break out far less often!</li>
            <li> Love this peel. Gentle yet makes&lt;br /&gt;My skin glow the next day. I&#x27;ve bought it several times before.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but I still like it. Definitely nothing like littmann. Better than what I had though. Pretty happy.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best face scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. Got suckered into buying the salt at a mall kiosk for 30, definitely will be buying again but on Amazon.  I use daily and don&#x27;t have a need for lotion anymore on my face.  Also gets tattoos looking amazing even after 4years</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. I use it every other day and it exfoliates so gently and leaves my face feeling like velvet.</li>
            <li> I had bought this same product somewhere else, and I paid a lot of more.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the price, and the quality. It leaves my face soother.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know.... I didn&#x27;t like at all.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of my money...</li>
            <li> Great peeling product for the money.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower once a week and it rinses off nicely with just a little hand scrub. It&#x27;s a winner! Best place to buy is on Amazon not in the malls where they double or triple the cost.</li>
            <li> This is great and really gets in and deep cleans and sheds all that top layer of skin.  Left my face feeling smooth and silky.  Love it</li>
            <li> good product.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered fast</li>
            <li> Met this lady in the mall that recommended I buy this for my acne. Her pricing was way out there, got home and found it on Amazon so I bought two for less than the one I was going to get from her!!</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical about over the counter skin products as most of them don&#x27;t work at all. However, this product is incredible. It has changed the look and feel of my face in just a few short weeks and has completely cleared my daughter&#x27;s skin. I initially bought the product for $50 in Hawaii, and then I found it for much cheaper on Amazon. I have used the product from Hawaii as well as the one from Amazon and they are identical. I have been using it several times a week and I will never stop using it. My face has never looked and felt this good!!</li>
            <li> excellent very good product this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.Very good price.</li>
            <li> These products are excellent for all types of skin, leaves it very soft and not oily. My recommendation is the same for all Vivo products.</li>
            <li> This really works well to exfoliate the dry skin of my face!  It takes awhile to completely remove once applying.  I have to keep wiping in downward as the tiny particles tend to want to stick to any fine facial hair but the improved appearance in my skin afterward is worth it.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all....very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first time I was introduced to this product was at the mall. It was sold for outrageous prices, almost $80. Afterwards, I search the web and started buying from Amazon.com. I love this product. It is the best product I have ever used for my skin. I have very sensitive skin. The slightest tickle from a strand of hair will cause it to flare up and soon it will look like there is a pimple there. I also have slightly oily skin. What I mean by that is if I don&#x27;t wash my face with vivo per lei, it gets oily and I look like I haven&#x27;t washed my face at all. I want to also point out that I am Asian, so I recommend this for those of you who are Asian because we have very sensitive skin. I am 21 years old so you young ones can use this product also. I also use the Vivo per lei day cream, and the cell renewal night cream. What I love about the night cream is that you don&#x27;t have to use it daily. My skin is still very soft even after 3 days of the last application. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now, and there is a little over 3/4 of it left. I use the facial peel every other day so I buy 3-4 at a time esp because it is free shipping over $25. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and perfect for my needs. It gently takes away the dead skin cells from my face and neck to give me a more fresh look and feel.</li>
            <li> During a recent trip to AZ, My mom and aunt got suckered into paying over $50 for the same product. I used it and at the time, thought it was actually worth the money. I was totally thrilled (but remained skeptical) when I saw it for this price on Amazon. I gave it a shot and boy was I ever glad. It&#x27;s the same as the mall, but much much cheaper. This product lasts for over a year (even with my husband using it), but I sent the link to my mom and aunt because of the other awesome products by the same company. I will purchase these products as long as Amazon sells them!!!</li>
            <li> could not have made a better choice when buying this. vivo is normally 78 bucks in the store but i got it for 8, it comes in a wonderful hard case with padding inside, great for a gift</li>
            <li> I purchase many dead sea products and a Vivo brochure came along with my order.  I was looking for a skin peeling product to remove the dead layer of skin on my face. This product really takes the dead skin off gently.  The first time I used it some of my skin lifted to come off but when I rinsed I could not get all of it off my face...I did much better the 2nd time around! I use it at night because my skin does get a little red but it does not last long.  My skin feels smooth and it glows!  Great product and would that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried endless products and this by far is one of the best!  Dead skin comes off instantly and you look refreshed and have a glow.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I would like to add to those that have a bad review about this product. I purchased this item along with a few other items from the mall 2 days ago for $200.00. Some will be for Christmas gifts and some are for myself. I have yet to use the product other than what the rep performed on me in the mall. But, once I try this, for myself...I will give my true reviews. I hope I have not been scammed!!!&lt;br /&gt;As for those that are complaining about it being sticky and a bad smell, maybe you did get a bad product if you purchased from online. I say this only b/c I owned a Tanning Salon and some of my customers would purchase their tanning lotions much cheaper online.  They say it&#x27;s the same product that I have on my shelf. With that being said, you do not know what you are getting when you purchase stuff like this online. It could be outdated or have other ingredients added that are really bad for your skin. I have viewed some of the cheaper items, but the product was posted back in Nov of 2010. Be careful for those dated sites. For those that have purchased it online much cheaper and had great reviews, please share the site that you went to. I have been so busy with Christmas shopping , I have yet to take the time before showering to try it out. I will give my review once I actually use this stuff. I really hope this works as well as it did in the mall.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product! She first tried it out on a Vegas trip and ever since she&#x27;s been using it. It took us a while to find the right price for the product,but we found it here. Looking forward on placing another order soon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for over a year. I am 49 and this has really helped improve tone and texture. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have used Skin VIVO products before and liked them, so I decided to give this Dead Sea Minerals Facial Peeling a try. It is incredible. My skin looked noticeably better- more youthful and radiant- after just two days. My experience is that most skin care products do not deliver on what they promise, so I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have been using the facial peel and daytime moisturizer for a month.  Now I just read a review that someone did not think the Vivo facial peel was removing dead skin.  Well here is my perception.  I am 54 years old and have rosacea and back heads and thickening skin cells, and everything I use irritates my skin and I am out in the desert sun a lot.  Right now I have used Arbonne sunscreen for about 6 months and like it.  Other sunscreens seem like they burn my skin.  But my main concern is that I have dozens of deep set black heads.  There is no point in putting on makeup because my pours just drink it up or it runs off my face in this heat.  I started using the Vivo facial peel every 4 days and at first the facial peel seemed to be irritating my skin, reddening it, but I used the moisturizer to heal and nourish and I kept using it.  Now my skin seems to be more tolerant, less reddening, less oily and behold black heads are coming out easily.  My skin is smooth and silky, and I can&#x27;t wait for day four to come around so I get to use the product again.  I think most of these products are more effective when used on dry skin not wet skin.  At this point I don&#x27;t care what it is doing, it works and is accomplishing what I need.  I love the Butter cream, and the Sea Salt Polisher for my arms and sun damaged body areas like the area just below the neck.  I hope to be able to remove some wrinkles that come with age and sun damage, but even then the facial peel and day time moisturizer does not irritate my skin and I will definitely be buying it from Amazon.  The reviews about the salesman are right on.  BEWARE, they know how to smooth talk and flatter you like no other man can and they talk 90 mph and I flat had to get rude just to get away from them. I&#x27;m a cowgirl and frankly their smooth talk is a line of bull........!</li>
            <li> If you guys really want to see if the stuff rolling off is the product, you should get a pair of gloves and roll it around in the glove to see if the same thing happens.  I can see the dirt and grime literally lifting off of my skin.  The product is clear, and you can see that it takes off dirt, which isn&#x27;t clear.  I&#x27;ve used this on skin after I scrubbed it, and tried it.  Then you can see a difference in color with the product.  It was less dark than if I hadn&#x27;t scrubbed my skin.  You can see it working.  I don&#x27;t want to waste the product on a glove test, because I can see that it definitely works for me and people I tried it on as well.  Thank you for selling this product at a heck of a price!  This even got to my house in barely two days!!  I ordered this same product from a different seller, and I am still waiting for it in the mail, and it&#x27;s been almost a week.  I am very satisfied.  Thank you!  ;D</li>
            <li> Amazing! It works just like Oro gold, but a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product once at a local shopping mall, and now bought another one at Amazon. Used other brands, and I found this one is just much better. It gently scrubs off the dead cells, leaves your skin really fine and smooth. I use it on my face and hands. Wonderfull product. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. I have used it once a week for 3 weeks now and have seen such a difference in my skin. Very easy to use and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this weekly. Seems to work at getting the dry skin off which is what I need this time of year. Can&#x27;t beat the amazon price.</li>
            <li> Purchased from the local shopping mall, the guy would not leave me alone, so I said the hell with it I will buy, but just one bottle. He tried to sell more, but I told him no. Used it later in the night and WOW, I am so serious when I say this stuff is amazing. My skin has never felt so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I love this peel, you can see the results immediately and I use the day cream with it.  I use it a couple times a week, and I feel that it really helps my complexion...making my face look and feel brighter.  Again, I bought this as a pair  with the Vivo  Moisturizing  cream.</li>
            <li> i use this exfoliator 2xweek. my skin is in great condition normally but this helps remove the dead skin. Put on dry and scrub. dry skin will start to come off. rinse. great with use of vit c serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful.  But beware, it&#x27;s very strong.  I have used too much and over-exfoliated parts of my face.  Oops!  Use a small dab, it will last!  It leaves my face feeling so smooth afterward.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product from a home show, of all places. I don&#x27;t normally buy these things, but seeing the amount of dead skin rolling off my face both amazed and horrified me. It also evened out my skin tone temporarily, in that my cheeks are slightly ruddy. It feels very gentle on my face; no abrasives like most scrubs.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so I&#x27;m not sure if the evening of my skin tone will be more prominent or permanent.  However, I am so glad to see Amazon carries it for a fraction of the price of what I paid. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it from here for future purchases.</li>
            <li> 2nd  order- Will order again-Far below the price of Mall Gaffers</li>
            <li> I purchased [[ASIN:B003SSTL42 Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]] from the mall.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice.  Both times, I had trouble removing the product from my face!  After rinsing with cool water, I&#x27;ve had to literally scrub it from my skin!  This was a complete waste of money.  I&#x27;m really pissed!</li>
            <li> This came in a box, however it was taped closed like it had already been opened.  I don&#x27;t think this is a brand new product.  The product itself seemed like it was used also.  The lid did not seem brand new, therefore I&amp;#34;m not sure if this is a new product that was sent out to me.  I have not tried the product to know what it&#x27;s like, because I&#x27;m planning on returning this if indeed this is not a new product.  When I purchased this through Amazon, it stated that it is new.  Plus I wouldn&#x27;t know why someone would send out a used product when it comes to makeup/moisturizer.  I will be contacting Amazon regarding this and will let you know how it goes.</li>
            <li> Sticky, but seems to lift dead skin.  Not the best product of this type I have used, but okay.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me (I have very oily skin). I couldn&#x27;t find the one I usually use (Neutrogena  advanced solutions peel) so I bought this one...</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;*Inexpensive here on Amazon. ( I was at the mall Kiosk and a lady from Israel tried selling me the exact same product for 49.00. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy into her scam.)&lt;br /&gt;*Leaves skin baby soft&lt;br /&gt;*Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;*Doubt that it is actually removing dead skin. I&#x27;m with the other reviewers who think this. I do believe it&#x27;s removing dirt &amp; oil. I think the only way to remove dead skin is to go have microdermabrasion done.&lt;br /&gt;*A little hard to rinse off with just water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s works really well for my skin !! Get rid of all the old skin &amp; dirt very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me...no irritation, but when you put it on your face, these little balls forms (and they&#x27;re not from &amp;#34;excess skin&amp;#34;). I think it&#x27;s just the way the formula works. I prefer the Olay Pro-X and Olay Regenerist lines much better, so I&#x27;d recommend those over this one.</li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product once before in the local mall and paid more for it.  I love the product it is great for someone who gets breakouts.  Just make sure to follow the directions.  I use another product after this as a mositurizer and my skin looks 10 years younger.  Love this stuff</li>
            <li> This product caused me to breakout really badly. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have had much better facial peelings in the past.  I really don&#x27;t see or feel that it is doing anything.  Would never order this again.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this facial peel in Vegas last year.  I paid a horrendous amount of money for it.  I got home and absolutely luv this product.  Of course when I bought it, the woman gave me a card to re-order when I ran out.  I searched on Amazon and found it for 1/4 the price!!  How sweet!  Why do I luv this product?  Well it leaves my skin feeling super super soft afterwards, with no harsh burning at all.  I will say though, be sure to use it on a dry face as it is harder to rinse off when put on a wet face.  It&#x27;s truly amazing stuff for gently &#x27;sloughing&#x27; off dead dry skin.  Luv luv luv it!!!  My order did take FOREVER to arrive but maybe being in Canada was the delay.</li>
            <li> It works amazedly took away datk spots from my face</li>
            <li> My friend discovered this product while on vacation in Hawaii.  She suggested it to me and I read the rave reviews on Amazon, so I decided to try it.  It is absolutely amazing! It takes a complete layer of dead skin off your face leaving it smooth without the sensitivity that most peels provider.  This is worth the money.  I would recommend it to anyone - guys or girls.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best things I have ever used on my face! The first time I used it, i had some dead skin hanging off my face and even after I washed my face it was hanging off, I scrubbed my face with an exfoliator and it helped most of that loose dead skin come off the rest of the way! My face feels so smooth and it doesnt look as rough! I will definately be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! My face looks so refreshed when I use it. I love that it isn&#x27;t drying on my face and it&#x27;s not irritating either.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time while on vacation in Hawaii.  I love it and am so glad to be able to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  I bought it for my wife and she loves it.  The product works and does make the skin really soft and smooth.  Will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool to watch your skin \\&quot;roll off\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t finish the job, when I go to rinse it off the little balls of rolled up skin stay on my cheeks and I have to use something else to rub it off :(</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this it was because I was pressured into it by a very pushy salesperson at a kiosk. I didn&#x27;t really want to buy it, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. When I use it I can really see the dead skin coming off, and my face feels smoother. I use a clay mask that&#x27;s hard to rinse off. After I rinse my face until it looks like it&#x27;s all off, I&#x27;ll use this. When I do, I can see traces of the mask that were left behind. I really, really like this product, but I doubt I would have bought it again if I couldn&#x27;t get it for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After my first night of using this, I am amazed. I read the reviews on here about how the product doesn&#x27;t actually peel your dead skin off. I feel like that is false. When I used it on my forehead... A lot of skin rolled off. After applying in the same area right after... Not that much skin rolled off. So obviously it&#x27;s really peeling my skin off and not just making a chemical reaction to where it&#x27;s making fake dead skin. Lol. I bought this a the mall and I&#x27;m glad the guy lowered the price a lot because it&#x27;s way cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the fact that I read so many great reviews about it.  I do agree with some of the previous reviews that the stuff coming off your face is probably not just dead skin.  I tend to think some may be, but probably nothing you could physically see.  I think it does leave my skin soft and makes it easier to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Will totally recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders all over the body when using. You can&#x27;t believe how much yuck is built up on our outer skin. After using you feel and look like you have new CLEAN refreshed skin and it doesn&#x27;t take much for an area you are cleansing! It is like brand new skin after usage, only use about once a week to ten days.</li>
            <li> I should have known from the price point that this was not a real Vivo Per Lei product, but the proof was definitely in the poor performance.  There was very little exfoliating or cleansing power.  Next time I will spring a little bit more for the real thing.</li>
            <li> One of best exforiator</li>
            <li> I could hardly avoid the cocky saleswoman at Century City who was plugging this and other Vivo products, as she sauntered up to me and offered a free facial. She actually did half my face first so I could feel the difference, and it was AMAZING!! I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t realise how much better my skin could be. Needless to say, I stocked up on Vivo and haven&#x27;t looked back. Best facial care line I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  My skin has never looked better  :)  I am glad that it is on Amazon.com, much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I have never had anything work like this.  You put this on and start rubbing lightly on your face and pretty soon all the dead skin starts to come off. It is amazing! My husband and I both use this.  We are in our 50&#x27;s and my face has never been so smooth.  ONLY buy this on Amazon for the price is great!</li>
            <li> I did love this at first, but its really just nothing more then lifting the very top layer of dry skin, you have to wash to get the pores cleaned out.</li>
            <li> I too was chased down in the mall...the guy would not take no for an answer, but the product did impress me...i bought it!! I did find that you CANNOT rinse it with water...it wll stick to the skin.  you must wipe it off with cotton balls!! Not sure why...but that  was my experience!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes the torturing you do to keep your ACNE PRONE skin clear feels counterproductive because you are left with dry and flaky skin. :( If you are lucky enough to get your acne under control makeup doesn&#x27;t glide on or look very good because your skin in no way looks moisturized. This product helps a lot. HOW I use it: I take 2 days (2 applications to get desired results). I wash my face as normal in the shower usually with a cream cleanser (feels more moisturizing) and leave it WET. I carefully take a little bit and slowly work it in a small circular motion as I move around my face I add a little at a time (like a little dab size you would use for moisturizer). I wipe off my fingers before re-dipping because you will have these little balls of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; peeling off and you don&#x27;t want to put it in the jar with the product... You almost have to curl the tip of your finger so it will not slide off. I don&#x27;t torture my skin or rub for a long time because that would leave it raw and pointless. I just rub off what is willing to come off in one application not forcing it. I repeat the next day and am really happy with the results following this routine. After that makeup goes on like it should and I don&#x27;t clog my pores and my skin IS NO LONGER dry and flaky. I usually put on Cephalin lotion afterwards because it is a great non-comedogenic lotion I read about online (you can get this anywhere) and am happy with how it feels and am able to be diligent using acne medications without fear of lousy counterproductive results.&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this a 5 as I have purchased and used it many times. Originally I got it from my cousin who paid $60 at the mall kiosk like others did. Which brings me to wonder why people are dinging this product here because they overpaid somewhere else. That isn&#x27;t very fair, because it is a good product. I just like to find it for a deal. Sorry this is long but I found good reviews on use of the product are worth the length. Thanks! P.S. it shipped andarrived quickly. I am book marking this for sure!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in a Las Vegas store after having it applied to my arm.  It was quite amazing how it removed dead skin! I am so glad Amazon carries it  because this product is definitely worth using and I will be ordering it again and again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - great price too - this is my second purchase - my skin looks terrific - great wrinkle treatment, as it clears away tons of dead skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was accosted in Las Vegas at a Vivo Per Lei counter. The guy was really persistent, but I was determined not to buy a thing. That is until he used the Facial Peeling on my skin. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin sloughed off with just a little gentle rubbing. Needless to say, I bought it. I used it on my face that night and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth in years. When I got back home, I used it on my son and husband with the same amazing results. My husband, who had some tough black heads, no longer does. Taking the dead layer of skin off really opened his pores to remove them. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei product is excellent for all.  I Love this mark.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it 5 stars but the difficulty in removing all the little grains of grit used to exfoliate is really annoying!  Best part of this is not paying the WAYYYY higher costs those people with kiosks in the mall try to charge.</li>
            <li> not happy with this product</li>
            <li> Was not the same product that I had previously purchased from the mall. This has a very strange texture and doesn&#x27;t seem to be mixed completely.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a facial peel that is natural, safe, and really works.  The Vivo Per Lei is a dissapointment, as it&lt;br /&gt;did not work as promised, but only did a mediocre job.</li>
            <li> This is pretty cool how it works..</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING with out a doubt. I have tried SOOOO many different products and this one beats them all. I highly recommend this product to every women out there who is into their beauty. The best part is the price is right!!!!!! I cannot say enough about this. BUY IT I GARANTEE IT. YOU WILL LOVE THE WAY YOU LOOK AND FEEL!!!!! TRIPLE THUMBS</li>
            <li> great great scrub&lt;br /&gt;the best I know&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always some at home</li>
            <li> don&#x27; think this is legit....yes it removes something...but there&#x27;s no evidence this is actual skin and that it&#x27;s making any type of improvement. I tend to believe the &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; coming off is just the product rubbing off...I&#x27;ve seen no positive results.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff in the mall for $50 and it never occured to me to check for the product on amazon.  Regardless, I am so happy with this product and I would have probably kept buying it from the mall if I didn&#x27;t find it here.  I don&#x27;t get pimples too often, but when I do, I get these nasty scars that last for a couple of months.  I feel like this product not only helps keep pimples at bay, but it also speeds up the time my pimple scars take to fade.  If I use it everyday, the scars fade in about 3-4 weeks.  The company doesn&#x27;t recommend using it everyday, but it hasn&#x27;t irritated or negatively impacted my skin.  My older sister uses it less often because she has much more sensitive skin.  (She also likes to go tanning though, so that might have something to do with it.) I still get pimples from time to time due to stress, but I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion has been significantly clearer.  My mom even asked what I had done to my face after the first couple of times I used the product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not one of those people that doesn&#x27;t shower for a couple of days, but my skin looks so much cleaner.  Both of my sisters and my mom now use the product and they love it!  Maybe this product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it&#x27;s certinately worth the $21 risk to find out.</li>
            <li> It is just a face wash, I was expecting so much more...like a mask that help remove or peel as the name would imply dead skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> You can find Vivo Per Lei products sold for as low as $9 - $29 on places such Amazon, Groupon, Ebay &amp; HautLook/Nordstroms. Then you can go to the Vivo Per Lei  website &amp; the same product sells for $100. Other buyers speak of experiences finding this product at a kiosk in the mall for upwards of $200. If you write to the websites selling these products for 90% off they will all claim the product to be authentic, un-damaged &amp; not expired. You have to wonder!&lt;br /&gt;As far as this product goes: I don&#x27;t like it.  As you rub it on your face it creates these nasty little balls. &amp;#34;If&amp;#34; these little balls were actually dead skin, my face would be red &amp; irritated due to the amount of skin removed. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing; if that much exfoliating is what you are looking for. That much skin removal would be the equivalent of a professional facial peel! And you would need to put another product on the ease the redness &amp; irritation AND you would hear stories upon stories of this happening. You don&#x27;t. After washing the product off your face; which by the way is a bit of a pain as the little balls are all over, your face does feel clean but nothing special by any stretch.&lt;br /&gt;There are many lines out there similar to Vivo Per Lei such as Donna Bella &amp; D&#x27;or 24K. I&#x27;ve always wondered why it is their bottles &amp; jars are so similar. And, why their products sell for over $1000 on their site but all over the web you can get a $999 item for $20! Are all these really the same manufacturer?  Are they are really only worth those heavily discounted prices. Are they a scam?  I really don&#x27;t know.  I do buy them when I can at the reduced prices.  Most of them I like albeit nothing particularly overwhelming.  But as long as they work to some degree of the purposed intended I am happy - I might not be as happy had I paid full price however!&lt;br /&gt;However, as for this product - I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> i saw this item at the mall and got it for less than half the price, i used it once a weeek- works great.  my face feels smother after each use.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two weeks no negative reaction so far!</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!! Doesn&#x27;t take dirt or makeup off. Grainy disgusting feeling on your face</li>
            <li> My face typically feels really soft after I&#x27;ve used this product. However, don&#x27;t believe what people say about being able to scrub off visible dead skin cells. I tried to see if the dirt was just how the product was made or if it was really my skin... It&#x27;s definitely meant to ball up. I rubbed into my counter ten times to see if it still balled up and it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far after getting this as a gift from my dear friend (who I can only imagine also got accosted by a persistent salesperson in Vegas). She dabbed it on my face, said to leave it for a minute, and then slough off the dead cells. I don&#x27;t regularly use any peel or scrub on my face, so tons of stuff came off! It couldn&#x27;t have been the product itself &#x27;balling up&#x27; as another reviewer suggested, because two of my friends also tried it. One had some skin come off and the other (who uses some facial scrub/peel daily) had nothing come off. I hope it works on my scars and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Just buy it and use nothing else. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product,  I have amazing results my skin look very healthy, I love it definitely I will recommend it...</li>
            <li> When using this product you have to be aware that it may take a bit of time and effort to completely take it off your face. It leaves little \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot; and it seems that it attaches to the fine hairs on ones face. A couple of times I had to use a cleanser to get it all off. And a couple of times I didn&#x27;t. It seems to make my face feel smoother after I use it, which is a plus. Hoping it ends up working great despite the \\&quot;hassle\\&quot; of taking it off. But at the price, I&#x27;ll keep it and keep using it.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this facial peeling.  It sticks to my skin and I have to use o body scrub to remove it.  Very, very.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once, but so far I don&#x27;t see any difference. I says \\&quot;face peel\\&quot; so I thought it would be like a mask. This is more of a scrub. Either way, I can&#x27;t tell much difference. I will try it again in a few days since it says to use it twice a week. It is totally not what I expected. The product is more of a gel. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything except to turn into little balls that are hard to get off my face. It also burns my face a little bit, even after I have washed it off.</li>
            <li> It really does the job. My face feels wonderful after using this product. My face feels really smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> I love it, it actually feels like you are taking off all of the dead skin. Your lotion absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;Cant recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a lot from this after reading the reviews, but this really did nothing for me. It makes the whole &#x27;peeling&#x27; experience on anything- even the kitchen sink, so what is coming out may not be old skin after all. I&#x27;d say keep looking...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start on the positive side. The product arrived timely and in good shape. The product is pretty and expensive-looking. That&#x27;s where the positives end. The product did not serve its alleged purpose, at all. No exfoliation. Built into the product is some material that generates what appear to be dirt, but there is not any feeling of exfoliation and my skin felt in no way altered or refreshed. I used the product three times, in an attempt to be fair, and then placed it in the trash. Alternatively, products found to refresh my skin and actually exfoliate it include Skin Obsession crystals and Olay regenerist microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but feel that buying this was a bit of a scam... Did the product do anything? No... It certainly doesn&#x27;t do any peeling, the only thing you peel off your face is this product. Stay away from this item, not worth the money, not worth the time. You&#x27;ll be sending it back before you know it. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I offered this and got the moisturizer instead. I thought I would like it.  Nope! Should have sent it back.</li>
            <li> I have battled combination skin my entire life; during the winter months it&#x27;s so dry it flakes off in pieces, the summer months turn it into an oil slick, humid weather brings it all together: oily t-zone, dry and rough cheeks.  Most exfoliators that I&#x27;ve tried have aggravated the skin more than helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a recent family vacation my aunt, a true product junkie, recommended that I try Vivo&#x27;s Per Lei Facial Peeling.  I first experimented with hers and was pleased with the results -- we were in Florida and my skin was absolutely misbehaving.  This product literally rolled all of the dead skin off of my face and left it feeling smooth.  At that time, this was 5 stars and I ordered a jar for myself that very same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m back home and my skin is behaving a little differently than it was in Florida I went ahead and used it for a second time.  This time though, I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with the results.  It worked well on my forehead, nose, cheeks and chin; the jawline is a different story.  It certainly rolled the dead skin in that area but it didn&#x27;t roll off.  In fact, I&#x27;m 4 hours out right now and am still picking off the white rolled bundles.  Even my Clarisonic wasn&#x27;t able to rid my face of these dead skin cell balls.  So, the 5 star rating dropped to a 3 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product absolutely works and provides incredible results.  The fact that I&#x27;ve spent hours picking at my face (which is a big no-no to begin with) in order to remove the remaining product means that this peel will be going on the shelf, only to be repacked on our next Walt Disney World excursion in 6 months.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;The finest Dead Sea cosmetics and beauty products based on natural ingredients found only in the Dead Sea.  The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> The face peeling mask is totally awesome.  You can see the dirt it lifts from your face.  Because it will roll in balls and sticks to the fine hairs you have on your face...I always use right before I shower.  This product has help keep my face clean and clear of acne as well.  Just awesome...wish it came in a bigger tub...as I went through it pretty quickly using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  I bought it for myself &amp; as a gift to another friend.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
            <li> This peeling gel is certainly worth much more than it is being sold for on amazon - I bought for my sister, my mother, and two friends (and of course myself). Some reviewers are claiming that this product is only appearing to remove dead skin - that the stuff that appears to peel off is actually just the product balling up - this is definitely not the case. I have experimented by using this stuff on areas that are recently well exfoliated by my buff puff - barely anything came off. The product does ball up but it is also picking up dead skin in the process (gross i know, yet fascinating).</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product. It&#x27;s very difficult to get the grainy pieces off the face. When I tried to gently, it left a slight rash on my skin. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. The product is also a sticky mess. I gave it two attempts before discarding it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes you skin feel great.  I was introduced to this product at the mall but the price was outrageous.  I found this product on Amazon for half of the price they quoted.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love this face peel.  It works instantly.  You put the product on your face and start rubbing in a circular motion.  The dry skin starts to slooth off immediately.  It&#x27;s not abbrasive at all.  My face is the smoothest it has ever been.  I would recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li> 2nd Update: July 8, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is breaking me out. I really wanted to like it. The other day I accidentally transferred some of the product onto the outside of the container with my fingers and it dried. When I picked it up later, there was the dried \\&quot;skin\\&quot; like material all over the outside of the bottle. I peeled it off. Definitely the same stuff that is supposedly coming off as skin. I figured it was too good to be true. So my final conclusion is that this product is a scam. If it were really peeling your skin, they&#x27;d having SPF warnings and it would have more of a drying effect. None of it makes any sense. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;Update: I started using it on May 10 and it is now May 27. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s peeling my skin still. Much like face peels, more stuff comes off around the mouth and chin and less on the forehead. Thing is, this stuff is either making me break out OR it&#x27;s peeling to those damn little acne bumps that will, otherwise, stay there for years. Some people say it gets worse before it gets better when treating acne. If this starts to clear up in the next month and this is just a necessary awkward phase, I will change my rating to five stars. Until then, the verdict is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I will change the three stars rating once I figure out how I feel about this product. I have only had this stuff in my possession for 24 hours. The kiosk guy gave me two of them for 100 dollars. Apparently, this stuff is cheaper online, so I feel a little bit stupid. I&#x27;m a big sucker for stuff that exfoliates really well. The salesman put it on my arm and my skin came off instantly and suddenly I went from annoyed and about to walk away to fascinated. I have tried Retin-A and done face peels, but that stuff actually causes my lines to get worse because my skin is so dry and sensitive. (This stuff left my skin all soft and shiny!) I&#x27;m usually a pretty big skeptic about things, however, I am absolutely desperate to get my acne and pores under control before the last signs of youth drain from my face. There&#x27;s no inherent justice in this world though, and so I spent most of my twenties battling acne and my early thirties trying to undo all the acne damage. Such is my lot, it seems. But this stuff, if was in fact doing what it looked like it was doing, is a freakin&#x27; miracle. I have no idea what in the ingredients would cause my skin to come off like that, particularly without any apparent drying agents in the ingredients list. Despite my reservations, (and due to the fact that a combination of fluorescent mall lighting and youth culture worship exhaust my self esteem and logical faculties to the point of momentary insanity) I bought it anyway. I got home and suddenly it dawned on me that the stuff sloughing off might not be skin at all (the ingredient carbomer could be type of wax, actually. typically a thickening agent) ..... Oh my god...... And they don&#x27;t do refunds! I&#x27;ve been taken by a con-artist! So I try it on my face. It appears as if my skin is rolling off in little white balls. At this point though, I have my mind made up that it&#x27;s not skin. If it&#x27;s not skin, then it&#x27;s not dangerous to use it repeatedly. So I try it again. And then I try it again. Then I realize that the tips of my fingers are starting to peel and sting. Ooops. My facial skin is fine but my finger tips are injured! If it&#x27;s not exfoliation, why are my finger pads raw and covered in little white spots of dead skin? Something is going on here, but I&#x27;m just entirely sure what. If anyone has feedback on what they think it might be, I&#x27;m interested to hear what you have to say. I googled every single ingredient on the list and it&#x27;s either a moisturizer or a preservative. It makes no sense! I&#x27;m still not convinced it isn&#x27;t a scam. Will use regularly, see if my skin starts looking better and revisit this review.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Tried it at the mall and happy to have found it online. It really does take all the dead skin away.</li>
            <li> This facial item was bought for my wife and in my observation she is enjoying the product and seems to be well satisfied.</li>
            <li> didnt like the feeling, but the results are good</li>
            <li> My sister is a former seller of the product, 3 years ago, and she needed a guinea pig(me).  She used many VPL products on me and sent a bunch home with me to keep using.  I actually saw &amp; felt results, and fast.  I ran out of a couple products and just stopped using them, instead of asking her for more.  I remember my &#x27;dark spots&#x27; going away and my face never looked better.  I was using the spot treatment every night before bed, using the facial peeling, the peel off mask, the moisturizer, well, just everything.  I was in the mall yesterday and this guy was driving me crazy to try these products on me, so I just let him.  Well, 1 was the facial peeling(it had a different name on the product), he used it on the inside of my wrist, and his results were just as I&#x27;d remembered.  I was like, hmmm, I have this at home and why am I not using it?  So, I&#x27;m sold on the Vivo Per Lei products and will begin using them religiously.  I&#x27;m usually a bit of a skeptic, but this line of products are really awesome!  I&#x27;m going to raid my sis&#x27;s stock, then when I run out.....Amazon or Ebay??  At least try the facial peeling and maybe the spot treatment, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> When I used it to wash my face ,it does rarely work at the first time I cover it.And it only does good work after i have covered it and washed my face the third time.</li>
            <li> I purchased one at the mall kiosk which given is overpriced so when I found this I was very excited given the amount that its selling for on amazon. You do get what you pay for though. This leaves residue on my face that will not be removed unless I intensely scrub it off which never happened to me with the previous one I owned and loved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial scrubs over the years, but I&#x27;ve never used one that was this effective. The grit just keeps rolling of my skin. I use this twice a week, and it has made a significant difference in the smoothness and delicacy of my skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best product for removing dead skin and also polishes as well. Would recommend for people with dry skin. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Same as the $40 ones at the kiosks!</li>
            <li> I did not like this item... it broke me out with big bumps that will not come to a head... will not be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling provided the result I was looking for. My skin has gotten more smooth and clearer since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I will be ordering it again in the future.</li>
            <li> To begin, I don&#x27;t mean to disregard others differing opinions, I am merely giving my own.&lt;br /&gt;I think those who believe there will be the same effect anywhere in the body, and not \\&quot;dead face skin\\&quot; are incorrect. I also tested this on my arm, as well as my mother tested this on her face. She has no acne, whereas I have issues with facial acne.&lt;br /&gt;If I do this daily, the dead skin that comes off my face lessens. If I do this every three days or so, WOAH!!!!!!! I am fascinated by all that comes off and how my skin feels afterward!&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a wonderful investment. I use it daily! (but I have horrible skin and need to) I am also very sensitive, and this absolutely hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS for sure! :-) Happy facial peeling!</li>
            <li> I just love this product. After using it for the first time, the following day a coworker had asked me what was different about me. My skin is definately smoother and fresh looking. I ordered the body scrub..cant wait to try that.</li>
            <li> This contains methylisothiazolinone, which is not disclosed in the listing but should be. Methylisothiazolinone is a known severe irritant and allergen. If you have sensitive skin or know you are sensitive to methylisothiazolinone, I would recommend avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but this stuff is amazing.  My husband bought this for me in Hawaii and when I was verrryyy skeptical heard how he got it (persistent pretty salesgirl...) but once I tried it out I was converted!  This product removes the top layer of skin BEAUTIFULLY!!  I also had some trouble getting the product off after using it but a little cleanser fixed me up.  Honestly I don&#x27;t see how that could be the problem that turns people off from this amazing skincare experience...</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old.  The lady at the mall kiosk was very persuasive and got me to try the Vivo Per Lei on my skin.  I let her rub it on my wrists, and the results pleased me, so I bought it.  When I got home, I read the instructions that said to do a \\&quot;test area\\&quot; first, and I&#x27;m certainly glad I did!  The tender skin on the tiny area of my face where I tried it simply peeled off!  It made my skin raw!!!!  I will not use it again, and would like to suggest that if you are an older person with thinner skin, you should avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I found out about Vivo Per Lei from a very persistent kiosk salesman in Las Vegas. He told me that the product is originally $80 but after I refused to buy it, he dropped the price down to $40 (still paid too much). Nevertheless, I tried the product and I can sincerely say that it works.   People claiming that the product doesn&#x27;t peel off your skin but rather the mixture itself balls up are wrong. This product definitely gets rid of your dead skin. I have chronic dry patches on my skin that no peel, moisturizer, or visit to dermatologist could fix. Now, those patches only reappear if I forget to use Vivo Per Lei twice a week. My skin looks smoother and I have less blackheads on my nose (again, something I couldn&#x27;t get rid of with any other product).   As far as application goes, I just put it on for 5 seconds and then roll away the dead skin with my fingers. The excess product and the dead skin wash away easily with lukewarm water.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this product. It made my skin look great and I couldn&#x27;t be any more happier with it.</li>
            <li> The sales person that I ran into in West Pavilion persuaded me to purchase a box of Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling (they threw in some unnecessary \\&quot;gifts\\&quot;) for a total of $198.52. I found out later on the same product is sold at around $30 on Amazon.com. I went back to them and tried to return the products on the same day but they said \\&quot;no refunds, exchanges only\\&quot;. When I expressed my concern on their pricing, they simply threw in \\&quot;more gifts\\&quot; to justify their outrageous over-priced products. I then googled their company name, and found out there are a lot of similar complaints nationwide. They used high-pressured sales tactics to make the sales and claimed the products on the website are counterfeits.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the hype, this is NOT peeling your skin.  Test it for yourself, rub a little of this stuff on anything, your bathroom counter, a piece of plastic, even the box it comes in, they will all \\&quot;peel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for your skin.  I see a difference in my skin tone and dryness from using and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> its old and its was empty  !! 2 of them !!! do not ways your money !!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Amazing the results you can get with a small amount.  Use it in the bath and you&#x27;ll be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff they sell in the mall with a 1000% mark up.  It works well for the price Amazon sells it for.</li>
            <li> Works as described, and it&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin. I prefer it to mechanical exfoliants like sponges or brushes. This makes my pores appear smaller and I always get compliments on my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li> Like many of the below complaints, I too was suckered into paying a high price for this product. I was disappointed to find that the ingredients were not as organic or natural as I was led to believe.  I also tested the peel on a regular piece of paper and it has EXACTLY THE SAME effect as when you put it on your skin.  It forms little pieces of supposed \\&quot;exfoliated skin\\&quot;.  AND, it does so without tearing away at the paper like water does.  I don&#x27;t believe that this is exfoliating anything at all and this company should be reported for selling a FAKE product and scamming people out of hundreds of dollars.  I think most people see results because they WANT to see results, not because it actually works.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, try some on a piece of paper yourself and see what happens.</li>
            <li> love it and its just as i remembered it from a while ago. .. Much better than the MAll! yay moment!</li>
            <li> I the feeling after I use this.</li>
            <li> I have bad skin, in fact it&#x27;s always been the bane of my social life. This little product used to be expensive but at this price I would be insane not to buy it. The product is painless to use, you just wash your face, apply this application after drying, rub, repeat. Just use it in combination of a medicated cream like gold bond or synalar simple and it will heal your skin. I used the 1.7 fl oz and it lasted me almost 8 months! So if you need a good peel for cheap, this is now it, in fact I will purchase this myself.</li>
            <li> I used once and it was ok.  I thought there would be lot more dry skin coming off. My skin did feel smoother.  I am hoping to see more of an improvement as I use it!</li>
            <li> Amazing work! Helps my face stay clean of acne</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the mall n paid a lot of money thinking that it was going to work ,so I was excited to get it n  to use it,I tried it for a couple of nights n it was horrible ,It wouldn&#x27;t come of my face so hard to get it of and when you put it on your face n rub is not your dead skin that comes off is something else and after u use it your skin doesn&#x27;t feel nice n smooth it feels sticky n dry ,I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I give it one star because she has no choice , but not really deserve any star, better water makes your skin defect in the cream , the money should reenbolsar all person who have .</li>
            <li> its pretty packaging but omg just gel that doesnt really go on or peel off anything...but you get wat you pay for i guess</li>
            <li> The sales rep showed me this stuff on my arm, and on my moms hand. I was amazed at the effects. My skin looked smoother and clearer. My moms hand looks lighter, smoother, and healthier. As many other people on here, I was scammed by the sales rep. He told me this stuff costs 130$. I told him no way. He said for you, 60$. I was walking away, and he lowered it to 28$. I was curious about other people&#x27;s reviews online, so I searched it and food it for 8$ on amazon. Buyer beware. Buy it on amazon not in the mall.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet very effective.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other brands don&#x27;t exfoliate nearly as well as Vivo.  This stuff is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most out of this I would recommend the following procedure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spread a thin layer all over your face before showering in the morning.  Leave it on for about 2-5 minutes as you get ready for your shower.  Once in the shower, start to rub it into your face with circular motions, and then run your face under water, both accelerating the exfoliation and removing the dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face will look and feel youthful and vibrant when you are done.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Did not get to try it.  Product arrived half empty and dried up. I was not going to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling works for me because of my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I found a reasonable price on Amazon, so I continue to use it</li>
            <li> I think my experience with this product is unique. I use Retin-A regularly for acne. Occasionally, it will cause my skin to peel and flake, leaving me looking like I have crumbs stuck to my face. My only option was to exfoliate it off, which was irritating. I used only a tiny bit of this product on the peeling areas, rubbed lightly in a circular motion, and rinsed off using Cetaphil soap. All of the peeling skin was immediately gone- smooth, and not irritated like it would be with a regular exfoliating wash. I know this product is actually removing dead skin because I could SEE the dead skin stuck to my face and then it was gone. I would definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work as expected. While it comes in a fancy package, it doesn&#x27;t seem to peel any dead skin away. It remains sticky on your face until you shower. I have heard great things about this product, but my experience was a dud.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any affect on skin. I used it for months and nothing changed on my skin. I recommend buying other better products from better brands. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it...</li>
            <li> I was also a accosted at the mall kiosk by a very very pushy salesman. He was nice enough, what I could understand(he had a heavy accent), and when he sampled the facial peel on my wrist, I will admit I was pleasantly surprised. I trying to trying to walk away and he just kept offering different deals. .the first being $129.00 just for the facial peel! I finally ended purchasing just the facial peel for $42.00 just to get away from there and get him to stop his practiced speech.  Well by this this point I was already annoyed.  So a few days later I pull it out of the bag and open it only to find that he sold me the tester jar and half of it is gone! And I discover it on Amazon for $9.30! I am livid! The product itself seems okay but that doesn&#x27;t even matter at this point.  Nothing pisses me off more than a sham! And of course the receipt says no returns! I am not a happy shopper. Especially when I know better than to buy into a mall kiosk gimmick!</li>
            <li> Not sure it worked for me. Wanted to see results but didn&#x27;t really notice any change. I used it a few more times and have not used it for a while.</li>
            <li> Love this and have purchased as gifts for friends.  it does take off some bad skin off your face, but gently.  Really not sure how, the gritty pieces in there aren&#x27;t that harsh on your skin, i don&#x27;t even think my face turned red when i wiped it clean but i could see the skin balling up between my fingers.  Definitely don&#x27;t let it dry on your skin, it&#x27;s really hard to get off at that point.</li>
            <li> Ahahahahahahahahaha I was at the Brea Mall in Orange County, California, and came across this product at a Kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a very hot/cute brunette in tight leather pants that made my head do a 180 degree turn, and her coworker signaled me there. They sweet talked me and spouted a bunch of BS, and they tried to pawn this on me for $99 claiming it was worth $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prescription creams that actually work don&#x27;t even cost that much. Poor Israeli girls. Where do they find these patsies? Still, just a few suckers at the mall, and they&#x27;ve more than made their income for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for the first time on my face today and it is EXCELLENT- I give it five stars with the preface that while I&#x27;m not sure if I can give all the credit to the peeling product yet, I am highly satisfied,  but here are the facts- you decide (please disregard the fox news reference, its rhetoric is practically an invasive species where I live): This product immediately went to work on my face. It didn&#x27;t sting or rub harshly like other facial peelers, yet this is what I observed 1)I could see that my skin was getting red (which doesn&#x27;t usually happen unless I&#x27;m seriously going to town or near the equator with 0 spf, my skin is typically very insensitive) 2.) I haven&#x27;t worn makeup for 3-4 days 3) I spray tanned 3 days ago 4)the gel-liquid contains little beads but as I rubbed in a circular motion a ton of other stuff-what I assume is dead skin- came off 5) when I washed my face with water and patted it with a clean towel, and then looked at the towel it was covered with what I assume is the skin (a little gross actually) 6) when I looked in the mirror, my skin still had a pinkish tone that was subsiding and I immediately put on a light moisturizer.  As for my skin now in my subjective opinion, it has a more even quality, my pores seem smaller, and there is a general glowy quality that all girls adore! LOVE this product! Must try!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from 3 different sellers,, best bet Beauty, touchdown, and On Sale.  This is Fake!! I read so many reviews on the Vivo Per Lei products sold here on Amazon that i decided to ignore them and find out for myself.  This product smells like TAR!!  For those folks that left positive reviews, i can&#x27;t help thinking they are all connected to this rip off scheme!  Go to the mall and pay $55 for this product if u really need it. Don&#x27;t even consider this site!! SMDH!!!  I am truly angry here!!  I need my damn refund ASAP!!</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning my facial skin and leaves my face very soft and clean feeling and lookiong.</li>
            <li> This a great product at an amazing price. I&#x27;ve seen this go for $100+ at kiosks, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and was glad to see it didn&#x27;t cause a bad reaction to my skin. I take a small amount with my fingertips and rub in a circular motion around my T zone, with a big emphasis on my nose. You&#x27;ll immediately start to see little balls form from the dead skin, debris, etc. Make sure to wash your face before because the little balls will be black and it looks gross. I also avoid my cheeks and chin because the product can get stuck to little hairs and it takes a while (and effort) to come off. This is the only con I have with this, otherwise I would give a 5 start rating. I then follow with a cleansing toner to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave any product behind. I&#x27;ve broken out and my skin has become irritated before from not removing it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of uses my skin looks a lot clearer (my sister noticed immediately) and it felt softer. My pores look smaller and clearer, too. Be careful how often you use it though - I tried using 2 or 3 times a week but it just broke me out and made my skin red. Don&#x27;t expect this to work the same as a chemical peel or clear your acne. I get microdermabrasion facials and the occasional peel and this is great for in between visits to my aesthetician. It&#x27;s a great alternative for an exfoliate scrub and isn&#x27;t as abrasive as those little beads can be.</li>
            <li> This is a rip off. There are much better peels out there. This one has hardly any abrasion, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people think that this is sloughing off dead skin, it is the material of the gel that starts to clump together not your actual skin doing that. You would have to be using a chemical peel to have that effect on your skin. I honestly did not notice any difference in my face using it. The consistency actually kind of irks me out.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, you apply it on your face then as you wipe it off it like peels in clumps, not really peeling your skin but just the outer layer of gunk on your face and helping those stubborn blackheads to disappear. My face feels so smooth after I do and application. You cant beat this price at the mall they charge you a fortune. I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Forever flawless facial peeling gel is way better but costs a lot more.</li>
            <li> Great facial peeling even for sensitive skin. My face was never smoother! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Its really thick and discolored. Not at all like the 1st one I bought directly from the mall. It still works but now I know why it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I threw this away after using it a few times.  It pinched at the peach fuzz hairs on my face.  It reminded me of putting glue all over my hands as a kid, waiting for it to dry, and then peeling it off.  Glue like residue was sticking to my face after washing it off.</li>
            <li> Someone tried to sell me this in a mall kiosk so I came home and got it here. I loved it the first few times but after that I noticed It was sticking to my fine facial hair and it would not come off. I had to pick each one off like lice- I&#x27;m over this</li>
            <li> My favorite day cream by far.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the more expensive brands. I use this in the shower. I also use this on my upper chest, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> NOT dead skin!! Rub it into a balloon or Xbox controller or ANYTHING, they apparently have skin &#x27;peel&#x27; as well!! Try it for yourself!!</li>
            <li> It works well for the price.  I can see a difference on my face.  I had no allergic reactions.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this on amazon for a fraction of the price. I was ambushed by the &amp;#34;people at the mall&amp;#34;, wanting to make my beautiful skin more luxurious blah blah blah. I had my son with me so they roped him in also. I have to say I loved how it made my skin feel, but wow the price was a slap in the face!!! But wait we will throw this in free!!! Oh but wait let me talk to my manager and maybe I can get the price lower......finally I just said NO Sorry!!!  Out of curiosity months later I looked on Amazon and found it....use it and love it!!!</li>
            <li> This cream is worth the cost on amazon. If you get accosted by anyone working at the Vivo/Premier kiosk at the mall- just turn the other way. It is extremly overpriced there. I&#x27;m from Long Island and he tried to sell it to my for $150, with the day cream for $130. They will try to squeeze as much from you and try to make&lt;br /&gt;You believe they are only doing this for \\&quot;you\\&quot; and throw extras in and lower the cost. Well I only went because a friend recommended it. It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to see that the flakes are NOT dead skin cells. Baby smooth fine pored skin on the top of mind hand would NOT produce that much dead skin. While he was trying to sell me some hand cream I quickly tried rubbing this peel between my two fingers and behold! The \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; in seconds! Ok. So I wound up getting three products for over $100 when he wanted to initally sell me two products for $280. Then I go home on amazon and see that they are all here for much much cheaper. Well, those of you who say \\&quot;Buy from a dealer- these are fake\\&quot;, are wrong. I DID buy from a dealer. I hate the way the peel smells, it feels tacky on my skin, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to rub off completely - it&#x27;s true- if you have even baby fine hairs it will stick like balled up glue. Awful product, awful company.</li>
            <li> This product works good .</li>
            <li> I use this product 1-2 times weekly, then apply my serum and lotion to my skin. They absorb so much better after the peel, and I always get compliments on my skin afterward! One friend asked if I had had a professional facial!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for 2 years now. No one can tell I am in my upper 30s people often think I am mid to upper 20s so I intend to keep using it. Helps clear up acne too so I use it only about once a month when my hormones are going crazy... helps put my skin back on track</li>
            <li> I love it! I reccomend to anyone, I have tried almost everything and I&#x27;m seeing immediate results</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the face and neck. But amazing results when i used it on my armpits. If you think you have clean armpits, try it and think again. I have struggled with dark armpits and tried various products without any results. This peel gets deep in the skin and removes lots of built up residue. I clean my armpits with this peel twice a week and they look, feel and smell cleaner than ever before!</li>
            <li> Found at a mall, resisted the sales lady and found it here for so much cheaper. I am hooked on this product!! I have been using it for a month now on both face and hands.</li>
            <li> I was also accosted in the mall and wasn&#x27;t going to buy but did. Salesmen are good. However, I had a very severe allergic reaction to the peel. So much so I ended up on Prednisone.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this product if u want to feel extra clean, and smell good. Takes a lot of under lying dirt.</li>
            <li> I bought this for way too much at a shopping center kiosk, but was still glad I did because I love the product.  I get sun damage on the lower part of my face that isn&#x27;t protected from a hat and sunglasses while doing yard work, and the peel removes a layer of damaged/freckled skin each time I use it.  It leaves my face very soft and moisture absorbing.  Santa brought one of these to each of the women in my family this year as I wanted everyone to try it.  One word of caution, if you have down on your face, you may have pieces of skin (like sweater woolies) that were exfoliated that will stick to the hairs, and need to work a bit to get them off, but that hassle is worth the exfoliation.  Follow treatment with serum and lotion and you&#x27;ll notice softer skin for days.  They say to use it twice per week.  I use it less often, but when I&#x27;ve been in the sun or cold air that I know damaged my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this skincare line. I have used it for years. Will continue to purchase on amazon!</li>
            <li> . I used it on my face and it was so gentle and non erritating but in the same time so though that I saw my skin rolling from my face .&lt;br /&gt;I difinetley recommend this product, it really works.</li>
            <li> The facial peeling is O.K.  I really haven&#x27;t used it that much as yet.  Again, your price is much better.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I get a rash on my face after I shave. I use the facial peel to remove the top layer of old skin at night band the next morning it is all better.  I hope I can continue to get this product because I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this item quite a few times before and this time used a new vendor on Amazon.  The consistency and even the color of it are different. The product is sticky and isn&#x27;t at all like what I was hoping to receive.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face very soft. I dont believe that its actually gold pieces that they claim at those kiosks in the mall. I would never purchase this at the mall and pay crazy prices.  It&#x27;s worth the money on amazon tho.</li>
            <li> Have used for 2 years. You can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pay $90 for this at the mall. Definitely sloughs off dead skin. Makeup goes on smoother after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since my Dad gifted me my first jar in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I had a terrible problem with adult onset cystic acne that was destroying my face.  This product (coupled with Vivo Per Lei Moisturizing Day Cream and Premier Dead Sea Pharmaceutical Gel) has changed my life.  My complexion looks better than it has in a decade!&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have made a big deal about the fact that the white stuff that comes off as you scrub is not dead skin, which I think is pretty obvious the first time you use it because this gel is SO gentle.  I have never had any irritation after using this product, and I use it every other day (more often than recommended).&lt;br /&gt;The white globs of gel that form as you scrub are sticky - they are carrying away the dead skin cells that you are scrubbing off.  I have actually experimented with this a bit by using it on a patch of very dry cracked skin vs. a patch of freshly scrubbed skin - there are more white globs, and bigger white globs, when you use it on very dry skin.  It really is a facial peel but it is incredibly gentle!&lt;br /&gt;Not only has my disfiguring acne nearly disappeared (only a boil or two in the summer) but my old scars (pits and discoloration) are greatly diminished!  I am so grateful for this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as some reviewers have stated, the sticky white globs can stick to your facial hair a bit where it gets long along your hairline or jawline, but it comes right out if you rise the gel off with a washcloth and use a circular motion on the hairy spots.  It&#x27;s an extra step, but it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.  I use the product while I&#x27;m in the shower so that my skin stays wet during the whole process and I moisturize while my skin is still damp to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Very effective . Does surpass my wife&#x27;s expectations and will want to order again when needed. this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for only 190.00 cheaper than some woman in LAs Vegas was going to give me ( as a deal). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good for me, but I love the way it feels so clean when finished. I use it about once a week!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin that breaks out easily. Humidity, stress, bad water, too much sun, gritty drying cleaners, glycerine filled moisturizers, vibrating skin brushes/ washcloths, glycolic peels, etc. all wreak havoc on my skin! Finding the right products that don&#x27;t irritate is very difficult. As I&#x27;ve gotten older (I&#x27;m almost 30) my skin has just become more and more sensitive. So when I find a product that works I need to stick to it! This product is fantastic. I tried my mom&#x27;s a few years ago when she was raving about her new, gentle exfoliator that she bought for $90 in Hawaii. I was very impressed but $90 was crazy. I was THRILLED when I found it on amazon for so cheap! What&#x27;s so great about this products is that it doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin to get the dead skin off! So many of those gritty, &#x27;peeling&#x27; exfoliators (even the ones with round &#x27;gentle&#x27; beads designed for daily use) just irritate my skin and trigger the oil glands to pump out oil. This is so nice because you simple smooth on the gel, wait a few minutes, and gently rub it off! No scratching, polishing sand! I used to avoid exfoliators like the plague but with this I can finally get off that dead skin! I use it about once a week and follow by washing my face with my cleanser again to make sure all the gel residue is gone. The only complaint I have it that sometimes the little peeling pills can get caught in the fine facial hair on my cheeks. Then I need to carefully pull them off with my fingers which can sometimes be tedious. However I have found that leaving my face wet and drying my hands when putting on the gel helps with that. Also, not using it in the steamy shower helps too. I just use it over the sink. I feel like the steam can make it worse (for me). Overall this is a great alternative to glycolic or salicylic peels and scratchy exfoliators!</li>
            <li> Just after using this for the first time, my face felt smoother and healthier.  I had even gone into work that day and a coworker commented on how my face looked smooth!  I have oily skin and I usually have acne, since I have used this (2 weeks) I haven&#x27;t had any new problem areas pop up.  My face has definitely cleared up and I&#x27;m still surprised at how smooth my face is.  Most facial cleansers and peelers leave my face dry, this product did not.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an actual peel. Its a salt exfoliator. Its ok. It leaves skin smooth, but not what I thought based on the description o &amp;#34;facial peeling&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> Dont know what this is or what it does but I love it. Cant tell whether it is peeling or what but my face is smooth.</li>
            <li> For people saying this stick to your skin when washing in the shower. it says on the box use on DRY skin. thats how it gently takes of ur layer of dry dead cells.and after rubbing it on ur DRY face, it rinses right off with warm water. than i use noxema to gently wash my face and it feels like silk when i lather after using this scrub! it works great, i have sensitive skin that gets redness and this has made my complexion better. annoyed i over paid $40 at a kiosk but still glad i was shown it cause i will from now on buy from amazon. a lil goes a long way. also posts that say its not ur skin, its the product...not true. i tried it on the same hand, after just having the sales women use it that day, and nothing came up. but when i used it on my face, SOOO much came off. my skin is so soft i lovet his stuff! for this price please, its worth trying! i love how my skin feels. even the day after i bought it, my left hand that she showed me on was so much softer than my right. i was so impressed i showed my mother and she ordered it today!</li>
            <li> I was hit up pretty hard in Vegas at the Rio, like a lot of you were lol. I did get this scrub, have been using for 2 weeks now I do like it. I can&#x27;t believe it sells for 10$ on here and I was charged $99!!!</li>
            <li> I open this in the pic on line looks more white like little pearls.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened mind it had a yellow cast and goes on like water.&lt;br /&gt;How ever it did make my face feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;At the mall felt like it had salt in it this don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I threw it out it was so bad.  I am used to quality.  This is just some sort of gel that even leaves a film on your skin that is oily and hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Nasty</li>
            <li> Pretty good exfolliant peel at a great price. Only recommend using once per week to prevent overdrying of facial skin. It is a bit on the watery side compaired to higher end products like Nava Natural. But this one is most affordable</li>
            <li> I fell into the trap of good salesmenship at a kiosk in the mall over this gel.  Bought this way more than it was worth, and I would return it if I could. The gel itself balls up, not any  skin on your face. I&#x27;ll be watching my credit card and make sure no more than what was charged is taken off of my card.</li>
            <li> If I could give no stars I would! This company should be shut down. PLEASE people dont waste your money! I saw this stuff in the mall for $200 to start then they kept trying to get me to buy it and would keep dropping the price. I stood strong. Then I thought huh wonder if they have it on amazon. THEY DID! The price was incredible. Bought it. Can I just tell you it didnt take not even 3 times of use before I realized this stuff is PHONY!I dont know what it is but it is not taking any dead skin off at all! IT just balls up no matter what you put it on. UGH!! Please take my advice dont waste a dime on this crap. This company should be ashamed of them selves!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It makes my face glow by taking off the top layer of dead skin.  It gets rid of scars and wrinkles....I couldn&#x27;t say anything better.</li>
            <li> I use this 3-4 times a week and it keeps my skin free of dead skin and looking completely new. I&#x27;d only have problems after the product was exposed to humid air after awhile as water neutralizes this product which is great truthfully. After a year of use of just one unit I&#x27;m really happy with this. It is the best facial peel I&#x27;ve ever used and was my biggest bang for the buck. If you&#x27;re looking for a working facial peel/exfoliant at a low cost don&#x27;t go buy any products off the shelf, instead, get this. I use this along with Vine Vera Facial Cleanser and I have amazing smooth and clear skin. I&#x27;m a 17 year old male teen with a soft face that matches a baby&#x27;s bottom. Love it.</li>
            <li> 3rd time refill purchased, enjoy very much &amp; love it -- easy to use and the texture is smooth - recommendated</li>
            <li> so just like my title i do agree with the vast majority that this product is somewhat gimmicky implying at all you&#x27;ve sloughed off your face is dead skin when in reality only a small fraction of that is skin and the formula just makes the user in awe of the supposed gunk coming off their face.However I do believe that the product is working and is not solely the formula clumping up due to some type of thermal reaction or friction (insert other possibilities lol) because as i rub more of the product on, the less it clumps up and remains in its gel consistency and mind you i dry off my face each time before rubbing more on to the same area. Regardless of what its actually doing, i know the end results is that i have a clean, poreless face and it feels nice and just on the verge of being a tad dry (the squeaky clean feeling if you will) because this is not a cream cleanser you will of course need to moisturize and my skin feels wonderful the next day. bottom line is this product doe its job and is a fun way to keep you on your face regimen just because its so fun to see the gunk come off. i&#x27;m very lazy with taking my makeup off sometimes and this makes it more enticing to do so, plus it works. This is a similar product to the cult favorite &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; from japan and several other korean brands like missha and etude house has them too.</li>
            <li> I too was annoyed with the sales rep of Vivo per lei. No body likes to be bugged and pushed by want to be car sales(wo)men!!! However I do like the face peel and will also be purchasing from Amazon from here on out...</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It has dried up my acne and it gets rid of the black/white heads on my nose and makes it feel instantly much smoother. I read a lot of the good and negative reviews before buying the peel. Those who say that it&#x27;s \\&quot;balls of glue and not actual skin\\&quot; I believe havent taken a good look at the peel. I&#x27;ve tested it on different parts of my body and some of that dead skin is much darker or much lighter than the rest and skin peels more or less depending on where I apply it or how much I&#x27;ve applied. Anyways, if I didnt use the peel on my nose, I would have to scrub the crap out of my nose with a wash rag or my fingernails everyday just to remove the dang white heads.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliation gel. My skin felt smoother and softer with noticeable fairness afterward. It&#x27;s very light and gentle yet effective. This gel does tend to run and become very liquid like so be careful when its around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy this, just be careful where you store it because it will get watery and messy.  I did not notice much of a fragrance, maybe alcohol but it fades. It will not leave any residue behind ( unless you dont rinse the little dead skin balls or what not off well enough, thats annoying) There are very tiny walnut granules in the gel as well. This was a good deal on amazon compared to buying it at the mall.</li>
            <li> Although I think it should come with some instructions and all the when to use, how to use, when not to use, for how long you should apply it and all. But it works good as a Peeling cream. feel little Burning sensation kind&#x27;a feeling if use it for longer period. don&#x27;t play with cream for more than 15-20 min. Wash hands and face where ever applied.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It is the best exfoliant I have used. Super easy to use and see and feel immediate results.</li>
            <li> I was in Las Vegas a few years ago, and loved it!! So when it was recomended to me on amazon, I picked it up again and I still love it as much as I did then.</li>
            <li> This really works. And is a great value at this price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, true to description.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before via. a friend and I loved it.. But the price was a wallet KILLER.. I couldnt pass up this  so I bought it... And guess what? Still love it!!!! Soft, radiant skin in minutes....</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order this again.  I think it might be a waste of money.  I could not really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. The stuff that rolls off your face is NOT skin folks. It is the gel thickening and drying as it makes contact with your skin and the air. This nasty stuff is almost impossible to get off with warm water AND with soap or facial cleaner. Had to use my Mia face brush to do it and then throw the brush head away! If I could score it a negative I would.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this after only two uses, but....I wonder if it is really exfoliating, or if it&#x60;s just the product &amp;#34;balling&amp;#34; up as you rub it on. That being said, my skin does feel smoother, softer, and tighter with the two uses, so perhaps it is working. At any rate, it feels great, the packaging looks luxurious, and it smells good. it&#x27;s also a bargain, so I will keep using it as long as my skin is looking and feeling this good.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It really works well. I got two more fore my daughters and they love it. Would highly recommend it!,,,</li>
            <li> This is a Worthless product.  It does absolutely nothing.  There are home remedies better than this one.  Don&#x27;t bother with this product.  A waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money, it will &amp;#34;exfoliate any surface you rub it on. It does nothing to your face. SCAM!</li>
            <li> this takes 10 years off my looks and i would recommend it to  all women who care about their skin</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old with moderate adult acne and scarring, so I needed something different and a little more effective than my normal routine. A salesperson at the Mayfair Mall Vivo booth stopped me and had me try this on my wrist and I couldn&#x27;t  resist. I have only been using this for about 3 weeks and my skin has been clearing up tremendously. My family members have been telling me that my skin looks a lot better and they can see a difference too. It&#x27;s also gentle and doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor which is a plus. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the mall nearly two years ago and LOVED how smooth it left my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought it for $30 which is startling now considering how much it costs on Amazon. So cheap! Looks like the saleswoman was lying when she said she would leave it at &amp;#34;half price&amp;#34; for me. Nonetheless, I bought a second jar from here and it is exactly the same and outstanding quality that I remember experiencing. This product helped minimize my blackheads and clear up my acne so I&#x27;m excited to start using it again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for any type of skin. it is like getting a facial every time you use it. My skin feels softer and looks smoother. it has helped me get rid of some dark spots over time. I use it once a week to exfoliate. It will usually last me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Felt a little watery hence the shelf life might be a little long. Overall it feels like glue rubbing off but afterwards your face feels so clean and nice. I will be buying the body scrub next.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product you see and feel it working the first time you use it. People are always putting me at least 5 years younger than I actually am and I believe that&#x27;s due in a great part to this product. Sunscreen also is very important!</li>
            <li> The Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now. I really like it. I don&#x27;t really get how it works, but it definitely does &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the top layer of skin off your face without any burning, redness, irritation, scrubbing or abrasion- instantly. It isn&#x27;t just dirt that comes off- skin feels incredibly smooth, shiny and downy after. I think there must be some light acids in the product that do this. I have reordered it several times and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the &amp;#34;counter&amp;#34; test others have claimed when they said the product is worthless. Actually, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; anything off hard surfaces like marble or stone or glass- but something definitely does happen on wood. This makes sense to me- wood has a grain and it&#x27;s porous and is probably susceptible to the same chemicals in the product as our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing: There are no &amp;#34;dead sea&amp;#34; minerals in this product, as others have noted. The gel is clear and it has little beads in it-- hard to imagine where the &amp;#34;dead sea&amp;#34; part is. The jar is also very thick, with excessive packaging- you don&#x27;t get much in each jar, and I generally dislike products that are so wasteful with packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, aggressive sales: I first bought this product due to an extremely aggressive salesman in Las Vegas- like many others. He swindled me into buying some other product along with this with $150. I&#x27;m not usually the type to fall for hard-sells, but it happened- lack of sleep, alcohol, friends.... When I realized how much I&#x27;d been had the next day, I was pretty angry. But that really doesn&#x27;t reflect on the product- it does reflect on the outlet in the Vegas mall (and myself!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product and I&#x27;ve bought it several times since (for under $10 on Amazon!)</li>
            <li> Hi, I was in LVegas in November, 2013 and was lured into buying 200$ worth of products after being flirted with and convinced there are no better products out there, especially this product here.  I was intrigued after seeing the man rub a bit on the back of my friend&#x27;s hand and seeing all of the dirt come up. I thought it would be great for my face.  I got home and started doing some research about the company and the products only to find a lot of the same products being sold on Amazon for considerably less, considerably!  I can&#x27;t believe how cheap the prices are on here, and the only thing I can imagine is if they are that cheap on amazon, there must be something fishy all together with the company and products being sold.  I looked up the website that was written down for me by the Kiosk manager, and it seems like a hoaks. I&#x27;m an intelligent woman, I believe, and I can&#x27;t be fooled by a website where the products are over 1000$, for a cream or $2000, and none of the products I bought are on this site.  As well. the site looks unprofessional, there are few links and few descriptions about the products. There are too many discrepancies.  I was so angry that I felt like I was taken advantage of and cheated, and if this were a real company in a real store and not a kiosk in Hawaii, or Las Vegas, they would have been investigated or called out, and people would stay away. If there was some way to speak to an authority who chooses in Las Vegas in particular hotels who to put into a kiosk here and there, I would love to speak to them and let them know what this company is doing to its&#x27; clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the face peeling that I spent almost $100 on, is on Amazon for under $10.  What could be a viable reason for this?  I do think the product is interesting and it does seem to peel some dry skin off my face when used, but how do others feel about the products being sold on Amazon from this company?</li>
            <li> When you think your face is clean....once a week put a small amount on your face and rub.....dry skin and dirt forms into balls of dead skin cells...its amazing how radient your face feels after....then mositurize!  It does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this product does not work.  I use it on my feet not good for your face.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; say, as we get older we do not exfoliate naturally as we did when we were younger.  This is a friendly way to do it.  Not harsh and my skin feels very clean; ready for my cream.  I would recommend it for anyone who thinks exfoliating is important as we age.  I use it in the shower because it&#x27;s not easy to get off using a face cloth in areas hardest hit with excess dead skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for some years now and found amazon to be the most economical</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and I am not at all impressed.  There is no way that is dead skin coming off.  My skin looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as it says!  After the first use my skin was soft and glowing.  I read a lot of reviews about whether the product actually peeled dead skin.  For anyone who is skeptical about the product, I can assure you, the first time you use it you will be amazed. It works best when applied to dry skin and you will notice the amount of dead skin removed will vary depending on the length of time between each use.  Great product</li>
            <li> This product seems to work great so far.  :You can actually feel the difference in you skin after using this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!</li>
            <li> I got suckered into purchasing this product at a mall kiosk.  And at first I thought it was great, but I&#x27;m a licensed Aesthetician and I kept wondering if that much skin could really come off after every use.  Then I realized that my dead skin was not actually coming off, it was the gel itself that makes it look like your dead skin is coming off.  Try rubbing it on any smooth surface, even glass, and you will get the same resuts.  In my opinion, the best way to exfoliate your skin is to use a clean wash cloth and plain water, and just scrub in small circular motions with your fingers.  Be sure to get all areas of your face.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial peeling cream because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritating the new skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I first tried this facial scrub when my sister came over for a visit.  She had told me that she purchased her set from a kiosk in the mall.  The set was originally $150.00!?!  But she was able to get her set for $75.00 because the boxes were damaged.  Once I tried the peel (more of a scrub) and the cream I was hooked.  My sister claimed since using the set her rosacea has diminished significantly.  I was nervous to use it because I was afraid it would cause me to breakout, of which it never did:)  I thought I would check Amazon to see if I could snag a better deal and voila, I did.  At the time of this purchase I only paid $18.00 for the set.  A much better deal than the mall.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great price! Fast, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST facial  &#x27;scrub&#x27; EVER!!!!! I have had ultra sensitive skin my whole life I can&#x27;t wear makeup at all because I&#x27;m allergic to everything! This makes my skin feel baby soft. Try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a good peel for the price. It&#x27;s effective, but not irritating. You also don&#x27;t have to use much, a little goes a long way. The only con would be the scent, it&#x27;s not very pleasant but not horrible either. I use it about 3 times a week, and I notice how it keeps my skin looking and feeling smoother. It also helps my complexion appear brighter as well and not as dull. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now, and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The item is working very well, I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Takes off the dead skin to reveal clean and glowing skin underneath.</li>
            <li> This product literally peels the dead skin off your face...and it&#x27;s a good thing :) I felt my face had been dull for a lack of a better word.  The products I was using just wasn&#x27;t exfoliating my skin like I had hoped.  My skin is fresh looking and more supple.  Don&#x27;t be nervous when little balls of skin come off, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  How I found out about this product is when I went to visit my older sister.  I couldn&#x27;t get over how terrific her skin looked.  When I said something to her about how good she looked she told me she had been using these products.  I bought them the next week.  I use the facial peeling once a week and follow it up with the milk cleanser and I use the moisturizing day cream every day in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. i discovered it at a mall kiosk while traveling with my boyfriend. the salesman wanted to sell it to us for $200!! that immediately turned me off, that price made me dislike the product even if i did do something miraculous for my skin. anyway, as the sales man was demonstrating on my hand how it worked, my boyfriend was looking on his phone, i didn&#x27;t know what he was doing at first until the sales man said &amp;#34;he must be looking on ebay or some sh**&amp;#34; When he realized that my boyfriend would find way cheaper prices online, he stopped trying to sell it to me and told us to be on our merry way. So these sales people charge you more than 10 times the price of these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this product works great. I read a review saying that the peeling effect is fake and that it will react the same on any surface, not just skin. well that is a complete lie because i tried rubbing it on my counter top, it did not react the same way as it does my skin. I am african american and if a product claims to remove my dead skin cells, those skin cells would obviously be brown. that&#x27;s exactly what i saw come off my face, brown dead skin cells. my skin was sooo smooth after one application. i continue to use it about once or twice a week and maintain an even complexion. the moral of this story is to never buy anything from mall kiosks because even if the product works you can always find for a bargain on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I read the good and not so good reviews about Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling, nonetheless, I leaned towards the 179 reviewers who 5 stared this product.  In about 3-4 days I received it, that night I did what the directions instructed and was amazed of how much peeling I was experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for over one month, however I&#x27;m becoming skeptical.  Why- I don&#x27;t wear makeup and take good care of my skin, so I don&#x27;t understand why its still peeping the same way it did the first day I used it.  Maybe its not dead skin cells that&#x27;s peeling off, maybe when the gel and tiny granules are mixed together, their interactions create these balled up skin like looking things on your face that makes you think its dead skins.  This puzzles me a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the mall from an obnoxious man. He showed me all these Vivo products when I said no he added three other products for free. I was told I could get it for 50.00 and then I was charged 69.99. He claimed it was &amp;#34;Tax&amp;#34;. I have used this product twice. Both times I have had little balls of exfoliant stuck to my face that I&#x27;ve had to rip off my face with tweasers. Making me look like I had microderm abrasion done with Poison Ivy. Product is NOT returnable! Bad product bad company.</li>
            <li> I really really like it. Very reasonable price.I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is, indeed , a scam.  As a nice treatment that adds a bit of moisture to your skin at $18 here it&#x27;s fine.  It DOES not remove skin.  If that demo was all skin, your skin would be RAW.  I can get this effect with prescription retin a if I use too much.  My skin peels off and it&#x27;s red and raw.  It hurts and it&#x27;s dangerous.</li>
            <li> After using this stuff I never really realized how dirty my face really was.  It really cleans and my face feels fresh</li>
            <li> I  will purchase it again and really love  the product. Great for sensitive and acne prone skin. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Very intense exfoliant... I had dead skin all over my sink and in my hairline. Afterwards, very red and blotchy and it made my skin more patchy than smooth</li>
            <li> This facial peel is amazing! I was shocked to see so much dead skin just wipe right off. My skin was left soft and smooth for weeks. This jar will last a while as a little of this goes a long way. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in las vegas which was very expensive. When I found this product so cheap I figured it was a knock off, but my first positive experience was how quick I received the package, I compared to the bottle from vegas and was exactly the same. The product is exactly the same it takes off all the bad skin off and leaves my face stretched as though I had a face lift. Sometimes my skin is not damaged and use out of habit and nothing peels off but when I do have very dry skin or damaged by the sun a ton of bad skin comes off. Love the&lt;br /&gt; product.</li>
            <li> My skin felt fantastic after using this peel.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product. I just used it and now I have a rash all over my face and I have never had this problem before.  BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Awesome peel!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great price and product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and suffer from psoriasis, live in an arid climate, have a tendency toward combination skin (along my face and neck) and am in my mid-30s.  This is a very gentle but effective exfoliator for my skin - a surprisingly difficult thing to find.  It seems there is great debate about whether or not what peels away is really skin or the product but in my opinion it seems to be both.  The effect is obvious immediately after use.  I use this once a week in conjunction with daily use of Vivo Per Lei Gentle Milk cleanser and Vivo Per Lei day lotion and night cream.  My skin looks better than it has in many years and deep set clogged pores and acne are finally starting to improve without creating psoriasis break outs or aggravation.  It is a great product and this price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff at the mall....yes a stupid con guy got me to buy it....I paid 140 for this the daily moisturizer the toner and the Grataie Nail set....was an ok deal but not compared to amazon!!!wont do that again!!!!and of course it&#x27;s not refundable...same old story right?but I do believe it really works and definitely will last a long time so I&#x27;ll use it and from now on be sure to by it on amazon only!!!!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I purchased in the mall (but not for significantly more than on this site.  Living in Israel will give you a few pointers on how to negotiate. :) )  My skin feels light, clear, and airy after using this product, which hs rare, considering I have large pores, oily/combination skin, and--at 27--the beginnings of wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve noticed my deep-seated white heads have been fewer and fewer, and I try to use this 3 times a week with much success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have noticed, as many others, that this product has a difficult to remove residue.  I have found 2 things solved this issue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the directions tell you this should be applied, in a circular motion, onto *damp* skin.  I have found this to be a very big help.  I will rinse my face beforehand and only blot the skin with a washcloth.  I find that product \\&quot;pilling\\&quot; is much less likely to happen this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I wash the product off (sometimes with a mild cleaner--like Cetaphil) and use an exfoliating wash cloth to dry the skin after in an upward motion (I have one from Ahava that is decent--but am not sure if they sell it in the US or other countries outside Israel).  It is a bit rougher than a regular terry cloth, but not so rough to damage your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pilling is an issue, yes--but not enough of a deterrent for me.  Much more worth it for the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  And here I was, thinking I had it figured out.  It appears that perhaps as the product ages, it also becomes more difficult to remove.  The last time I used this, it pulled off some of my skin along the jawline.  No scarring from it that I can tell, but I had to throw it out--I was too nervous to try it again.</li>
            <li> Too many of the posts are very similar in wording, and saying kiosks are a scam but the stuff is great and they have it cheaper. This sounds like a fake. READ the negative reviews first!</li>
            <li> This is a real review!  I am taking the time to do this because I really do like this product and I want to share my experience.  I am a 35 year old female from New Orleans.  I was approached at the mall 2 weeks ago and I decided to go ahead and splurge on the facial peel ($99).  After buying, I suspected I got scammed and I didn&#x27;t think the product would really work.  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised that I actually did see significant, immediate results!  Skin was more toned, younger looking, clearer, softer, with a more even complexion and smaller pores.  But best of all, my brow is lifted and my lips are fuller.  Seriously!  I guess the old skin was pulling down on my brow and possibly shrinking my lips down?  I don&#x27;t know but I look so much prettier and I am needing less makeup.  I know there is some debate on whether the balls that form are the skin being removed and I can say this...  my husband has very dark skin, and when he used it, the balls were black.  On me they are white.  So I tend to think at least some of it is dead skin cells.  So there you go.  I&#x27;m pleased.  Wish I had paid less, but when you consider that I recently almost bought a different daily peel for $80/month, the $99/year is not so bad.  And I may be able to delay getting a $500 Botox treatment because of the results I am seeing in my brow!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this peeling, I ruined out if it and my skin can feel it, also when I don&#x27;t use it, the make up and lotions feel like a screen on my face, it is just horrible. With this my skin is so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have acne and with in three uses I could tell a huge difference in my skin now I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and my skin is so soft and different than before.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a mall kiosk even though I know better. I had tried their amazing nail kit a couple of years ago and thought it was pretty low quality too. I agree with the posters who say they have a hard time washing this off their face. I&#x27;ve experienced that too. I will keep using until I use it up but won&#x27;t buy again. I have fairly oily skin so I wonder if it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type. I paid $59 for the peel and the day cream. I like the smell of the day cream and my face does feel smooth after using. It is not better than the Clinique products I already use though.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it works; but I am done trying after 3 attempts and being bothered by the sticky residue after application removal attempts, near impossible to remove, it is now recycled. yuck</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and feeling really clean.  I see improvement of my skin tone after one use. Evens out splotchey redness.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care product I have ever used. I got the bar of eucalyptus soap (black bar) night cream, peeling treatment and a body lotion, also eye cream, all for an unreasonable amount of money. I was ticked when I saw the Amazon price BUT my skin is so soft and clean after only two days I don&#x27;t care! It is brighter, smooth and more even already and I&#x27;ve only used the peel once. I love all the products, I have never experienced quick results like this. No lie..... it is terrific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54yrs old, so I&#x27;ve tried MANY products...looking to fight the signs of aging. Most give so-so results. This is one, however, that I will continue to buy time and time again. I&#x27;ve used many different facial scrubs, but this is by far the best exfoliating product I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t work by grinding off the surface cells like scrubs do, but works by dehydrating the surface cells with the high salt/mineral content. (I don&#x27;t think the residue that you see sloughing off is just product. I also tried the gel on my legs and hands. My hands exfoliated well, but little residue rubbed off when I used it on my legs. Since I shave my legs everyday, or at least every other day, I wouldn&#x27;t expect there to be as many dead surface cells present. If it were simply the product balling up, it would produce the same effect regardless where you use it.) Since it works in this manner, you shouldn&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Regardless of how it works, what matters is that it really does work! After just one use my skin felt smoother and softer. After 3-4 uses, all the dark pigmentation of sun damage spots were gone! My skin tone was perfected better than it had ever been with other products I&#x27;ve tried - including very expensive cosmeceuticals obtained through aestheticians. I am very fair skinned and am super sensitive. Many products make me breakout or get red and itchy. Not this one. My skin looks better than it has in years. Friends have asked what I&#x27;m using on my skin. They can see the difference as well.&lt;br /&gt;  Try this. You&#x27;ll like it too!</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all and my skin was in no way refreshed.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is scrubbing at all AND I can&#x27;t get it off my face.  It takes at least 2 days to get all the little balled up bits of the product off my skin.  I have tried it 3 times and now I am throwing it out.  Shame, I was SO excited about this peel.  I hope the day/night cream works better.</li>
            <li> Ok so as I read some reviews I was suckered into this product paying 39.99 (that was what she would pay and I&#x27;m getting a \\&quot;deal\\&quot;) and was a bit upset to see it SO CHEAP on amazon...Those people are good! But as previously said the product isnt dead skin and dirt its simply dried product. It does leave the skin real soft and smooth though and I will definitely use it sparingly (once a week) so hopefully soon people will ONLY buy it on amazon lol</li>
            <li> I purchased this just by reading the reviews... i love it...i can&#x27;t say much but it cleared up my dark spot...oh my gosh you guys need to try this...im buying vivo from now on....</li>
            <li> I just bought the Premier Facial Peel yesterday, and yes I too was lured in by the mall kiosk guy and paid too much. HOWEVER, If he hadn&#x27;t pursued me and convinced me of the quality of this product I would still be looking for something that works for my skin. I am SOOOOOO tired of buying things that don&#x27;t work and am ready for a product that does what it claims. I choose to look at the kiosk guy and thank him for showing me something that works, and consider the extra money the price of a \\&quot;consultation\\&quot; rather than an annoying pesky sales scheme. Now I would be PISSED to have paid this much and not be happy with the product... but after reading the reviews and feeling my skin after one day, it seems to do what it says it does and I am excited about being happy with the results. If it weren&#x27;t for the kiosk guy, I would have never have tried it! So, thank you pesky sales guy for believing in a product so much that you will annoy me at the mall so I can benefit! Also, I thank Amazon retailers for offering a much more reasonable price! I will continue buying my product here ;)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and decided to order it I got it fast and used it and wow! It really works! I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> I was amazed the first time I used this product.  Problem is, I used it a little too often and had to back off for a while.  It does a wonderful job removing dead cells and your skin feels good afterwards.  I read other reviews before purchasing this and they were not overstating the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this peel it seems to remove all of the died skin.  Leaves skin looking refreshed and feeling soft..</li>
            <li> The girl was sooo annoying and persistent! I told her I&#x27;d think about it and come back later, nope she just kept arguing her point. Finally to just get out of there I purchased this peeling mask for $50 seeing its only $8-$9 online really ticks me off!!! So... If you EVER get sucked in to their mini store at the mall, just start acting like a crazy person, and don&#x27;t be afraid to yell!! I&#x27;ve learned my lesson the hard way. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product review: I know there&#x27;s this huge issue on it being a &amp;#34;scam&amp;#34; especially the ingredients, but I know that my face hasn&#x27;t been this soft EVER!! Acne wise- it cleared up all of my forehead &amp;#34;sweat bumps&amp;#34; as the sales rep. Referred to them. My chin is still prone to acne but doesn&#x27;t break out as bad as it used to. Then again I did start taking biotin around the same time I started using this stuff... Either way, I don&#x27;t give a flying fart if its really my skin peeling or not... What I care about is the results I seem to be getting. If you&#x27;re skeptical buy some $8-$9 case and see if it works or not for you...</li>
            <li> I bought this from a mall kiosk a few years ago for MUCH MUCH more money. This product works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got accosted at the mall today by a smooth talker.  He was cute, but I still couldn&#x27;t fall for it.  That was NOT dead skin.  I bet if I would come home with some, put that on a piece of CLEAN, just bleached plastic, I could rub it on there, wait a few seconds and get the same results; \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; looking material from the PRODUCT itself!  Come on!</li>
            <li> My sister and I have both used this product and found it absolutely amazing!  I can feel my skin smoother, fresher, and softer than ever before with just doing this facial peel once or twice a week!  Definitely going to keep getting more when I run out, but I expect that won&#x27;t happen for about a year. Absolutely worth the investment!  .... It does, however, make me wonder if my skin is now more sensitive to sunburning since the top layer has been removed.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when the salespeople at the mall stopped me.  It seemed nice but was much too pricey, then they just kept dropping the price which really made me doubt the product.  When I went home, I did some research and found that most consumers loved the product but hate getting tricked by the slick salespeople.  This feels more like an exfoliator than a skin peel which I love because it is so gentle.  My skin felt very nice after the first use.  I gave the jar to my mother and she loves it.  Amazon really has the best prices around!</li>
            <li> I like how this easily takes off the dead skin on face and makes skin feel so very soft.  Plan on continuing to use it and would recommend it to anyone.  It isn&#x27;t harsh at all on skin  -  quite the opposite.</li>
            <li> I tried the peel about a year ago...you know the guys set up in the malls...I could not beleave all the dry skin it took off. And my face is so soft...love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about two or three weeks now and I already feel and see a difference in my skin already. It&#x27;s a good product. I would recommend it to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does. My skin is a little red afterwards.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend first bought this product from a stand in the mall. He told me to try it and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it. It really does get the dry/dead skin off your face. It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking smooth. Its definitely cheaper on amazon and would never buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Nice product for your face.</li>
            <li> So I was one of those people that got suckered into buying this from a mall kiosk BUT! This product is amazing.... I scrubbed my face with a baby wipe and even washed it before I put the peel on. I had brown makeup coming off of my face with this!! I took it off with a cotton ball. I had my suspicions that it was just the brown beads in it that made it seem like it was skin and makeup, so I tried applying it again to see if anything came off of it. Almost NOTHING came off my face! The cotton ball was a tiny bit brown but it just looked faded like it was leftovers that it missed.. I have no doubt that this stuff actually works!! I love it! I got the face peel, moisterizer, night cream, and the shower foam for 130$ but I&#x27;m not even mad about it, just because this product is so satisfying!  I would buy it again! I would probably buy it off amazon next time though.. Since it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great price!</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Did not work, it isn&#x27;t dry skin that you&#x27;re rubbing off, it&#x27;s the product.</li>
            <li> For a first time peel user, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I thought a peel would turn my face red and take hours to recover from, however I read all the reviews and decided to try this one. It&#x27;s great! Will for sure continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> the product is as good as the 24K option, yet not a pricey and works the same. my face felt great after the application, and feels very clean</li>
            <li> Liquifies instantly, dead skin cell come off easily on my sensitive skin. Love this facial peel. Requires only a small dab of product. I use it 2x a week!</li>
            <li> I usually hide from the Vivo Kiosk people because they come right over to you and are very aggressive with their sales pitch, but the other week the girl caught me!  She wanted to charge me 75.00 for the peel and I said NO, thanks, but then she brought it down to 50.00 (just for me, mind you. LOL) and threw in the milk cleanser as a \\&quot;free gift.\\&quot;  I later found out on Amazon and E-Bay that I paid too much, so please don&#x27;t get suckered into these mall Vivo pushers.  They&#x27;re so pushy!  Anyway, I like the product and use it about twice a week after I wash my face.  I use it dry and have NO problems with it sticking it hairs.  I think it&#x27;s a good product, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay 75.00 for it.  Years ago my poor Sister got suckered into getting a Vivo package that had 4 containers and she paid 300.00 at the mall.  Now that is bad!  Save your money and do not buy this at the mall.  It is well worth the lower prices.</li>
            <li> Use it in dry skin. As soon as got the bright idea to use it in shower, I fell victim to ,the teeny tiny balled up product stuck on the peach fuzz on my face, thing some people have been talking about. On dry skin, I had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my face nice and smooth. Not irritating on my skin, at all. Is it removing dead skin ??? I think so, but I exfoliate quite often so I&#x27;m thinking if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll really see the skin coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. Not love it, but like it enough. Just don&#x27;t put it on wet skin, no matter how keen the idea seems at the time. I&#x27;m now sitting here with &amp;#34; ball beard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> package was opened, and partially used, there were deep finger indentations in the product where someone had scooped out the product, I was so disgusted, I threw it away, and gave the other stuff to a friend</li>
            <li> i received this as a gift and loved the product.  I found it on ebay to give to my family and friends.  I ran out of original and opened a bottle to my disappointment  it smelled, was half filled, when I put it on my face it was tacky, sticky and hard to get off.  My girlfriend said it smells bad.  I think the product was old I couldn&#x27;t find expiration date.  I was really dissappointed because I love the product and thought I found it for a good price.  I am so ashamed to have given to my friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> Nice surprise for me.  Works well with excellent results.</li>
            <li> Bought some in vegas and paid way too much, here the price was reasonable, works awesome, look so much younger when I use it</li>
            <li> Well after seeing this product at the mall many times. I decided to look up amazons price. Luckily it was $6 when I decided to buy it, never buy from mall kiosks. So I tried this product and I did notice that it opens up the pores but to be honest so do many sscrubs that are cheap. I have not seen any results that would make this any better than what you would find elsewhere.  If You buy this product for scars as many I know have then your just wasting money and time. Just get a chemical peel poduct and a retinol cream and add some vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Did not make any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really cool product. When you use it, Its fun to watch as it gathers up all the old dead skin on your face. It works great. The only downside is that it doesnt have that good of a smell to it. But, if you follow it up with the Day Moisturizer or the Renewal Night Cream, they cover up the not so great smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This is so watery &amp; not a lot of pink beads in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Is there a way I can return &amp; exchange these 2 I bought?</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product whore. It is my vice. I have tried a few different peels, a ton of night creams, cleansers and other products. They all make these great promises that consistently fall short and leave you with low expectations for anything else. This facial peel is the only thing that I have ever been impressed by. From the first time you use it, you can actually see the results, which I can&#x27;t say for many other products.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have fair, slightly sensitive skin. This product was super gentle (which you may not expect from a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;. It did not leave my skin red or irritated. I am confident that most people would be okay using it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, you apply it to dry skin and basically rub it on. I would describe it as a &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; instead of a peel, because without even rubbing hard, dirt, oil, residue, makeup and dead skin ball up and rub off your face. It is pretty amazing. Then you splash your face with water, rinse it off, and you are left with a squeaky clean, glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I just got it this week and I am already addicted!</li>
            <li> I love it!  makes your face look new &amp; younger. Peels the old layer of skin off with very little product you only need a very small amount. This product is worth the price and well last you for a while.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> I was acosted by a Vivo rep in Honolulu last month.  She was very persistent, I kept trying to walk away until she put some of the scrub on my arm.  I listened to her sales pitch while she kept rubbing the product on my arm.  Then she rinsed it off with \\&quot;Holy Water from Jeruselem\\&quot;....yeah right.  Any way I was very impressed on how soft my skin felt. Then she put the peel under my eye and WOW!!! I was sold.  So I bought the scrub, peel, moisterizer, body butter and a pumice stone, oh she gave me an extra stone &amp; mud bar for free..all for $180.00.  I have been using the products for about a month and I am very pleased.  I thought I got a bargain until I found the same products on Amazon for about $60.00  That is why I am so pissed.  She made a $120.00 profit off me and I am sure I am not the only one.  Salespeople..deception...ugh!  Lesson learned...buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This product is stunning! I wish I could add pictures because I have before and afters that make my skins improvements quite obvious. To be fair, I used not JUST the facial peel but a whole vivo per lei system. (milk cleanser, toner, day cream &amp; this facial peel twice weekly) I am 29, had lines in my forehead that are almost totally un-noticeable now. I have combo skin and I think alot of my problem was dry patches &amp; blackheads and thid stuff has totally balanced me out. I also want to note, there has been some skeptisism surrounding wether or not the stuff peeling off is balled up product or dead skin. I KNOW its dead skin because I am native american, my husband is white, and my best friend is black and we ALL have a different color (matching our individual coloring) of skin traces left on the cotton pad after using the peel! I am telling you, this stuff is just stunning. I get asked alot what I am doing different with my skin. No need to pay 300$ from rip off kiosks. Amazon sells the real deal. Buy it all. It wont disappoint! (by the way, I also bought the moisturizing day cream which is too heavy for my combo skin during the day so I use it at night. And daytime I use it ONLY on forehead wrinkles. It is improving the depth of my lines and sun damage. Its just a heavier cream than I used to use)</li>
            <li> This item arrived unsealed, which lead me to believe it was not the original, but rather a used item that was refilled with something else. I returned it.</li>
            <li> After using this product as directed, it was nothing but stuck to my face!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing would make it dissolve!  It left me with red/irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as much as the day cream, just because i never really have time to pamper myself :(&lt;br /&gt;but when i do use it, it makes my skin feel so baby soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this in the mall for $120! Love it; better than a salon facial! Have almost everyone I know using it! They commented on how clear my skin is!  Keep up the great prices, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I rarely give a product 1 star, but if I could of give this facial peel zero star I would of give it zero star. I only bought this product because of the great reviews, but I should of listen to the people who give it a 1 star. This must not be the same product people bought in the mall for over $100.00 dollars a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my experiance with this Vivo Per Lei Facial Peel. I&#x27;ve tried it twice and then throw it in the trash. The first time I put the peel serum on my face and leaved it for about 15 minutes and it never fully dry, it was sticky on my face. I proceeded to wash it of my face and that was a disaster. The peel turn like a white glup on my face and would not wash off. I had to used my Aveeno face scrub to get it of my face.  My second time using the peel, I put the peel serum on my face and began to rub my face with my fingers and the peel began to flake of, I thought it was working. I proceeded to wash my face and again this product will not wash of,  I had to use my face scrub and towel to get this crap of my face. The product didn&#x27;t work for me and haven&#x27;t improved my skin in any type of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product wasn&#x27;t good, I would not buy it again and never recommend it to anybody out there.</li>
            <li> What a nicely packaged, and presented jar of garbage, this does nothing, other than to create some sort of barrier on your face, and pretend its taking away dead skin, IT&#x27;S NOT. I read the reviews, and in spite of some of the bad ones, I decided to give it a try, being a girl, I like trying new facial things. I have tried Oil of Olay, which goes deeper into the skin, and even after one use you can see radiance and the suppleness of youth emerging, I dont have the time to repackage and send this back, so I&#x27;ll just chalk it up to my loss.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I spent over $100 on similar facial products.  I wish I would have seen this one first.  It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Ok so I didn&#x27;t get this from Amazon. I got it from the mall I had to write a review because I&#x27;m so in awe of this product. I so I bought it today got suckered into the spiel from the sales lady. Paid 75$ for peel and day cream. I came home find reviews and the price that says 8-20$. I too tried it and tons of skin rolled off my face I&#x27;m trying to figure out how they did this I started doubting it then decided to test it out. I put a lot of product on my finger than rubbed it on a mirror and it did not ball up. I did it for 5 minutes still just became oil slick on my mirror so far I&#x27;m impressed. One thing that sucks it sticks to the peach fuzz on your face. At first I felt duped into wasting a lot of money but after thinking about it I&#x27;m glad I got the real deal and not have to hassle with possibly being sold a fake product. Not to say I probably will try and see if I can get this cheaper in the future if this continues to impress me and I&#x27;ll know what to look for.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I found it in my local mall at one of the kiosks and they wanted nearly $100 for it! So I searched Amazon for it and it was way cheaper and so worth it! It is amazing the way it works. Rub it on dry skin and watch the dead layers of your skin ball up and then simply rinse with water. Only takes the size of a pea to cover the whole face, and so the small container should really last a long time. Once a week is plenty to keep your face fresh. I&#x27;m in love with this product! I bought two extras as Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Use it on my neck, chest and hands also! No more paying $85 at the mall!</li>
            <li> Excellent product to remove dead skin and revitalize a tired face. This is the only product I have found so far to remove makeup by my nose and on my chin, reduce zits, and keep my face looking younger without damaging the skin. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> All I got to say is ....\\&quot;Great Product\\&quot;.... I spent hundreds on LanCome and didn&#x27;t do anything for me... Vivo  was expensive when I bought it at a mall in Tx, but its a good thing that Amazon has it for Less..I LOVE IT !!! And so does my husband... he uses it more then Me.... I give it ***** stars</li>
            <li> I used this about 4 years ago and it worked better back then&lt;br /&gt;Why is it brownish now? Used to be a clearish white.</li>
            <li> It really peels off the yucky layers of skin without feeling harsh! Good product!</li>
            <li> I have never heard of this product before. The first time I used it, the dead skin starting peeling instantly. I have really bad acne and so far my face is soft. I follow up with the vitamin c serum. I am excited to see how my face looks after using it more. I am going to order more from this product line.</li>
            <li> I too had the similar incident with the lady from Honolulu mall -Yuval. She was persistent that I should buy and even gave her number. Now I hate that having spent a lot of money on it.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have used the product for one year and I can say it is good and works really well. I love it! I am reordering it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing  great price too ,I love how this product makes my face feel after I use it,This has to be one of the best things I have ever used on my face! and ( FAST SHIPPING )</li>
            <li> It is gentle. You can feel after 3 seconds that it is working. It reveal fresh layer of the skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Like other posters, I was approached by a very aggressive salesman at the mall. He was cute and I had nothing better to do. I spent $120 but these products were so worth it! I love this facial peeling wash the best. I have black heads and dry skin that is constantly peeling around my forehead. This stuff works wonders to get it off and my skin looks awesome afterwards. Because it is peeling your skin off, don&#x27;t use more than once a week.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I almost got conned in buying this at the mall. The salesperson tried to convince us that this was a $250 product!!! Being a little wary my boyfriend whipped out his phone and searched for on it amazon anddddd yeah.. it was 8 bucks. The whole time the salesperson tried to convince us that this product on amazon was not the same thing! SUREEE...At first I thought it was a knock off version but  no, same thing. I went ahead and bought it for him and he has seen amazing results. He mainly uses it for ingrown hairs around his neck. He used it for about a month maybe 3 times a week or so and saw the promised results... no more ingrowns and inflamed bumps in his neck area. He uses it from time to time now and loves it. Thanks again amazon!</li>
            <li> Vivo peel is ok.But very very sticky and hard to wash off.I m not too crazy abt it.its just ok!</li>
            <li> I like it.It seems very good on skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is effective all day. You should have some by oneself.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail the other day and was skeptical that it would work correctly.  I had read some posts where people were saying that its the product itself that we see flaking up on our face.  Well, this isn&#x27;t true, it is indeed the dead skin that is flaking up on my face.  I tested it out on my husband who had just shaved and he didn&#x27;t have the flakiness on his because he removed his dead skin by shaving.  But once I did my face, it was terrible the amount of dead skin that was removed.  My face feels so much smoother.  I would recommend this product to anybody that would like to see their skin renewed!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It works like a charm and 90% less money that the kiosk at the mall!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB! I purchased this at a mall in Charlotte for $30 (supposedly that was his discounted price). So I&#x27;m glad to find this online at such an affordable price. I am prone to cystic acne and this helps to remove the dead skin on top of the cyst so that it resolves itself much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t have acne issues, this helps to remove dead skin cells and makes your skin fresh without feeling taut or abused, like other exfoliates tend to do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!! It&#x27;s definitely on my top 10 of favs!  It removes dead skin cells, leaving skin feeling soft &amp; looking brighter!</li>
            <li> Hands down best product ever. It definitely works. I have really flakey dry skin and this product helps remove the dead skin and leaves my face smooth and does not damage my sensitive skin. I just got desperate and used it on my horribly chapped lips to remove flakey skin and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> This stuff cost a small fortune in the malls, but it really works.  You only use it twice a week.  Skin is very soft after use.  You just put a little on your finger and rub it on a small part of your face until the old skin sloughs off.</li>
            <li> Love it! Glad I found it online. It was way cheaper and it was the same product and it does what it says.  Skin feels soft after using!</li>
            <li> I have the worse oily skin that&#x27;s always acne prone no matter what i did. I&#x27;ve tried waxing, electrolysis treatments, countless acne products like proactive, neutrogena, mary kay, clean and clear, etc but nothing fixed my problem. this product gave me the normal skin I&#x27;ve been dreaming of and the only product i use which saves me tons of $$!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product while being hounded by a pushy sales rep in Vegas. He tried to get an outrageous price ($140) but I checked the prices on Amazon while in the store and negotiated him down to a more reasonable price. He told me the versions sold on Amazon are fake. When I needed a second container months later, I bought from Amazon and I assure you, what I received is real deal, in the same packaging as the Vegas store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really works. I have mild rosacea on my face and the redness decreases immediately after using it, and smooths out the rest of my face. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> This products is good, it exfoliate your skin and leaves it smooth afterwards. But, the price seemed kind of high to me. All and all its a good product.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product at a local swap meet for $20. Well worth it!  When I ran out I planned on returning but checked out Amazon first. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price. After ordering my daughter told me it probably isn&#x27;t the same product. I am very pleased to say it was. I ended up ordering the moisturizer and eye cream as well!!!  Very happy with the product and price</li>
            <li> I love this facial peel.  My skin has never been so smooth and does not dry your skin. I use the peel twice a week. I put it on clean dry skin and wait 3 min and rub off with my fingers. I then use a face cloth with warm water to remove it all and follow up with face cloth of cold water to close the pores.  My skin feels great. I then use the Vivo moisturising day cream, which I also love. Have been using this for a month now and will definitely continue.</li>
            <li> The product performed exactly like a very expensive version, that I used before.  I will continue to use this product.  excellent deal</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for years. Yes, I was suckered by a vendor at a mall kiosk and was incredibly over charged. However, the product DOES exfoliate and it is NOT the gel itself...lol. Ive done several experiments myself to test this. The tell all being that I use epiduo which can dry out my skin rather badly. when I get that dry, cracked, flaky jazz going on around my nose and upper cheeks, I use the product and the problem is solved. I obviously follow up with a quality moisturizer but this stuff works, and definitely minimizes pores and blotchiness. This product is sooooo cheap online.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s being rubbed off my face - whether it&#x27;s dead skin or the product itself but the texture of my face doesn&#x27;t seem any smoother and I don&#x27;t really notice any difference in other aspects either.  Personally, I&#x27;m not buying again.</li>
            <li> Works just like the ones at the mall but it&#x27;s cheaper. It takes off all your dirt underneath your pores.</li>
            <li> It was priced a lot better than what I saw in the mall. However, I still think the price was a bit high for the amount of product in the container.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the mall for about $100 like four years ago, and I looked for it here thinking it might be cheaper and it was VERY cheap!! I love this product, I have hyperkeratosis just my hands and feet, so when the fall/winter comes or just by being in the a/c or doing chores I get calloused but with the fall/winter my knuckles and top of my fingers get severely dry and ashy and it gets so dry sometimes my skin cracks open in my hands from just bending my fingers . Well I thought of this product and looked for it here, found it and bought it, aaaaand the amount of skin coming off was crazy!! Not all of it fell off I obviously need a manicure  on the thickest areas but it did take alot of skin off, and now for the face it left it so soft like baby skin c: its awesome on knees and elbows too!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird and I&#x27;m not even sure what it does. You rub it on your face and little tiny balls form. I assume this is like, the grease from my face or something. Afterward though, my face feels so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing noteworthy. It isn&#x27;t actually a peel. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Pretty package though. I guess encourages you to wash face</li>
            <li> reasonable priced and works better than any I have ever tried and I have tried quite a few in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels. This truly takes off dead skin cells and skin feels wonderful. I have told my friends about this product.:)</li>
            <li> I love this product from the first time I have used it. Finding this product for this price was excellent. Careful though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product removes dead skin in minutes. I am not sure how it works, but the results are amazing. I use it on my face and my hands. You have to try this product!</li>
            <li> i used once and was burning my face. I am not a sensitive skin.  I am an esthetician, looking for a good product for peeling, this peeling product not only burning my face and also burning my finger. It&#x27;s hurt my skin. never come back again for this products. if you are looking for a good peeling product, please stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> After a day at work, you can come home and use the vivo facial peel, off comes the whole day of makeup and the air around you.&lt;br /&gt;My face is so smooth and feels very clean. I love and you should try it to.</li>
            <li> Fantastic peel, best peel I have found with best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this one time a week, sometimes two, and the way I use it is I rub about a dimes worth on my forehead, a dimes worth on each cheek, and a dimes worth my chin, then I spread it all over my face. I rub lightly until it beads up  and I notice all the dead skin has been sloughed off of my face. I then rinse with warm water. I do notice sometimes I will have some of the peel beaded up on my face that didn&#x27;t come off so I just grab my Proactiv facial scrub or Olay Exfoliating Scrub (any scrub will work though) and use a little bit and that easily takes off what the water did not. After I use the peel my skin feels tight, shinny (not oily), and so soft. I have even had compliments about how well my makeup (foundation) looks and I wasn&#x27;t wearing any, it&#x27;s this peel, it makes my skin look youthful and healthy. I even tested this peel when I first purchased it. I tried it on my face and thought ..I wonder if this is just the product making the beads?  I put the product on my inner wrist because I know this area is normally free from wrinkles, oil, blackheads, whiteheads, sun damage, etc.... nothing! I AM SOLD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have noticed about after a month the peel starts to feel a little rubbery and that makes me think it has somewhat of a short shelf-life so use your peel within a months time for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ANY peach fuzz this peel will stick to it but you can get it off easily by using any exfoliating/facial scrub.  I use Proactive (the 1st Step) Proactiv Renewing Cleanser or Olay Professional Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and they both work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price too and I&#x27;ve heard people paying almost a hundred dollars for it at malls/kiosks. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> The other reviewers talking about how they got ripped off at the malls are obviously fake.  They&#x27;re trying to convince you that they&#x27;re the victim of some sales pitch in order to convince you that this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is...this product does not work.  It comes in a fancy package, but the contents is not a chemical peel.  It feels like lotion and leaves your face sticky and nasty.  Do not buy this product.  You will end up wasting your hard-earned money.  I threw this away in the trash where it belongs.</li>
            <li> Not what I expect it...when i wash my skin after I apply it I feel my skin it&#x27;s not clean I don&#x27;t know but to me it feels  it&#x27;s old product...:(((</li>
            <li> My item seem used the seal was torn already and the box had some stains and indentations not at all brand new...</li>
            <li> shipped fast great product would purchase from them again. I used this product once before and ended up purchasing  a few for some friends they were very impressed</li>
            <li> This product works well but when I bought it in Hawaii a year ago, it seemed to work more effectively. It appears to be made by the same manufacturer so perhaps they have changed the ingredients?</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after using this product it was so much softer i would reccomend to others</li>
            <li> Ok i purchased the product before from the mall and was amazed on the results my mother tried it also and and love it i removed my dark marks and my mother sunspots. But what this seller shipped me was not the real deal. Looked and smelled like the authentic product but it was a fake. To the touch it felt as if i was applying Elmer gule. I was happy think i found this awesome product for the friction of the price but got scammed. I purchased two because of the price and now i reget it. Too bad they dont sell it at the mall anymore because i will paid $60.00 knowing i was getting the the real deal not a very expensive gule substance. Never again will purchase this on Amazon. What a let down.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product . It is easy to use and leaves my face feel smooth . The follow up with the toner and moisture cream makes the whole product line a great value .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake one, I used this on my face (as it says use on a dry face and then clean off by using warm water) and as you&#x27;re rubbing your face it seems like it&#x27;s tiny pieces of paper that forms from the actual product and as you&#x27;re applying more water thinking it&#x27;ll just go away it gets super hard to rub. The smell is weird too it smells like scotch tape or wall paint. It leaves my face super dry. I really want to try and buy again but I need to know the sellers who the people who received the true product, like who they actually bought from, I truly believe if I received a real one I wouldn&#x27;t have had such a bad experience.</li>
            <li> Loved it! My face felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have been using it for a couple of years</li>
            <li> extremely easy to use and it leaves my skin smooth. I use it twice a week for, an my skin never felt better.</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a week at the end of my shower.  It works sort of like magic.  20 seconds into the application it&#x27;s done its thing and is ready to be rinsed off.  Skin is left smoother and lighter than it was.  No side effects.  I use it on forehead, cheeks and the bridge of the nose mainly.</li>
            <li> Bought it at the mall loved the results, I found this company and have been ordering it from this company at a great price</li>
            <li> Excellent product have been using for a number of years</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it when my face is peeling from using retin-a and it&#x27;s amazing! Makes my face feel soft and removes all my peeling dead skin. I will buy this again. And the price is good</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I too, was approached by kiosk salesperson. I would not buy until he came down to what I have paid for other products , in this case the magic number was $29.00. Soooo you can guess the profit these guys at the kiosks make. Anyway I guess I am actually happy for once to have been approached by a salesperson, otherwise I would not have discovered the facial peel. I do love the product. My skin is extremely sensitive and dry. I also have a farm and spend many hours outdoors; even with spf 30 sunblock the sun does it&#x27;s damage. This facial peel is the first one I have used that did not leave my skin feeling so tight I thought it would crack open. Also does not make it irritated or itchy. The peel DOES however, remove the dead layer of skin very effectively. I am impressed and will continue to use the facial peel as long as I can buy it at a reasonable price. I did not find any sticky residue left behind at all, on the contrary my skin sucked in the moisturizer without any problems. I absolutely reccommend this product. In fact I have just purchased 3 more jars through Amazon &amp; plan on giving one to my daughter so she can discover the wonderfulness without inital overpayment to kiosk personnel.</li>
            <li> I can not buy it in Japan so cheep price. When I use it soon after I can feel the difference between before use it and after use it. I feel I must keep use it. This product is so great. Addicted to use it. You should try it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL SMOOTH AFTER ONE USE AND AFTER MULTIPLE USE YOU CAN ACTUALLY CLEAR UP ANY SKIN PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT.  IT PEELS THE TOP LAYER OF DEAD SKIN OFF WHEN YOU USE IT ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars, I would. I have never felt more furious about being swindled into buying something expensive that is absolute crap. What even IS this? It&#x27;s clear goo with little \\&quot;exfoliation balls\\&quot; within. Dead sea minerals my ass. They tell you that as you rub this product on your face you can see your dead skin cells coming off, well let me tell you something very important about that. I rubbed this product on my bathroom counter and \\&quot;Oh look at how many DEAD SKIN CELLS came off the bathroom counter...\\&quot; It&#x27;s a hoax. That&#x27;s not your dead skin peeling off, it&#x27;s the little balls becoming mush. I regret buying this. I would have rather washed my face with worm guts than have bought this. It doesn&#x27;t even SMELL GOOD. And you can hardly wash it off easily. I&#x27;m never being tricked into buying something like this ever again.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It removes all the dead skin, leaving my skin beautiful and glowing.  I paid $60 at the mall for this same product. Definitely order it here next time.</li>
            <li> High quality product for less than half the price at retail stores. Recommending this to my friends who use designer face care.</li>
            <li> My friend got me this from a kiosk in the mall for Christmas and i love it and had to find more, i use it once a week and it makes my skin just glow, it takes the top layer of skin off and you can see it happening the skin just balls up and you wash it off, i&#x27;m over 40 and it makes my skin look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Removes all the dead skin and cleanses the pores as well!!  I&#x27;ve never used anything like this!!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling raw or irritated either.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin after about 2 weeks of use that I have ever seen with an other product.  New product added to my skin care regimen!!!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the \\&quot;new, best thing\\&quot; in skincare, since I started noticing my first fine lines a few years ago. I purchase most of my skincare products on amazon, because I can read reviews and get great discounts. I became aware of this product after receiving an e-mail from amazon regarding their \\&quot;top selling\\&quot; moisturizers (in which the day cream was featured. I had never even heard of this brand. After reading the day cream reviews, I moved on to researching the other products in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me preface my review with my skin type. age, etc (as that makes a huge difference to me when I&#x27;m reading a review - some products are fabulous for some skin types/ages and can be horrific for others). I am 40 years old, very fair skinned (white blond, as a child). Thanks to genetics I have really good skin, very few wrinkles. I also have never really been a tanning freak. In high school, I would occasionally go to the tanning bed &amp; lay out in the sun (particularly before any type of formal dance/special event. For the past 10 years, I have pretty much stayed out of the sun. I would much rather be pale than have leather looking skin. My skin is very sensitive, I can&#x27;t tell you how many moisturizers, foundations, and body lotions I have given away b/c they caused breakouts or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, down to the nitty gritty. One if the reviews I read said that it was not dead sin that was coming off, merely the product  \\&quot;rolling up\\&quot;. I do believe that some of what you see is the product, but after using this for 2 weeks- twice a week, along with the day cream. I can tell you my skin looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skincare regime goes like this - morning, cleanse face with Olay Total Effects cleansing wipe (I NEVER use any soap, or soap based cleanser on my skin), follow with Vivo Per Lei Day Cream &amp; Roc multi-correction anti-gravity eye cream. At night, again cleanse with the Olay total effects wipes (really awesome for getting off eye make-up &amp; it makes your face feel like you have applied a light serum), follow with Roc Night Deep Wrinkle Repair (Retinol)&amp; Roc retinol eye cream. I top those off with the Vivo Day Cream &amp; Roc Multi correction anti-gravity eye cream. Twice a week a use this facial peel in between cleansing and retinol/moisturizers at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, I love this stuff. I have had no allergic reaction or sensitivity. I have tried SO many different things and for me,Vivo &amp; Roc, far out perform any of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Price was much cheaper on Amazon than when I first bought in Vegas.  I look more than 15 years younger using it.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This product came perfectly packaged, brand new, and it does exactly what was demonstrated at the kiosk (for$150), I&#x27;m just not seeing much for long term results. Skin feels very smooth directly after but the next day I&#x27;m back to flakes in areas. Does not seem to prevent whiteheads like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This facial peeling does what it says it does.  I use it more than twice a week.  Highly recommend this product to anyone.  It is cheaper than having a professional do a facial peeling!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years now and haven&#x27;t found any other product that works better or faster than this one. It&#x27;s like having an instant  micro-derabrasion in a jar</li>
            <li> I love this! it really does work to get all of the dirt and grim out of your pores! I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a year.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I can get it at a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Great product</li>
            <li> I bought this initially at Christmas and have never even thought to try another peeling mask since.  Others dry out your face then your skin flakes off, but this just allows your dead skin cells, makeup and dirt to just rub off!  Its a great product and I won&#x27;t use other facial peeling masks again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the mall from one of those annoying kiosks but I loved the product just not the cost.  Getting this product at this price from Amazon is unbelievable! This product peels a layer of skin without irritation just like the photofacials I have gotten at the dermatologist! The product was shipped within one week after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I get these dry patches on my skin and even after I&#x27;d use other well known products and put on my makeup I would still have flaky patches.  This stuff gets those right off and then I use the milk cleanser, facial toner, and moisturizer.  My makeup goes on as smooth as can be without flakes showing up. My skin actually looks smoother and younger because it gets all the dead skin cells off so my skin can breathe and rejuvenate.  I love it.  Nothing else I have found has taken care of those dry patches the way this does. I get compliments all the time about my skin since I have been using this and I never would get compliments before, always criticisms.  I use several of the products together for the total effect, but for me this one has been an amazing cure.</li>
            <li> I bought this product @ LA County Fair for $40 a jar.  I&#x27;m so happy to find a better price on Amazon.com.  I ordered this for my mom to try and she loved it too.  The sad things is when I try to order some more, the price went up.  So I have to look for another seller for the same product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this product works..&lt;br /&gt;It really takes year&#x27;s off your skin....this ones the real deal..I recommend this one 100percent.....</li>
            <li> All The Dead Skin Cells Just Come Off And You Could Really Notice A Change In Your Face Color And Etc.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this product!  I cannot believe how well it exfoliates and removes the dead skin without pain or irritation.  It has made my pores smaller and leaves my face smooth, glowing, and fresh.  And the price is even better!  I have recommended this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> i very good friend recommended for me and use in my face,my skin look great and feel,the price was incredible,very good</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good exfoliating cream after Biore stopped the great cheap product \\&quot;smoothing scrub\\&quot;. I got this one based on good reviews but I am not very satisfied. It&#x27;s very shallow and soft. doesn&#x27;t scrub the face to make an obvious change.</li>
            <li> I was solicited at the Flamingo Las Vegas by hackers in the isle offering a free (haha) sample of this product using Dr. Oz&#x27; name as an endorser of this product.  Once lured in they put some Vivo eye wrinkle cream around my eyes &amp; mouth (I&#x27;m 66) to show me how it reduced wrinkles in a minute or so.  Yes it worked, but so greasy and sticky it was really annoying and got in my eyes so now I am seeing through blurry eyes.  Anyway they offered me a special deal (again, haha) and for only $350.00 (sale price reduced from $475.00) I could get the day cream &amp; night cream and this eye junk.  I took my sample of the day moisturizer cream &amp; left.  When I got home I tried the sample and loved it.  The little sample was good for 4 mornings, don&#x27;t need much.  I really noticed a difference in my face &amp; the wrinkly lines around my eyes &amp; mouth.  Got on Amazon and for $12.99 and free shipping I ordered my day moisturizing cream.  Can&#x27;t wait to get it and use it for a week or so &amp; see results.  Never mentioned anything about a mask or peeling product.  Stay away from those Mall people and kiosks - they will rip you off every time!!!</li>
            <li> I got suckered in by a vendor with a stand in the middle of the mall hallways!  I talked to her for a while.  SHe told me she was only at this mall for a couple days because she travels ALL over the world selling this product!  She does spit a good game.  Needless to say she talked me into it!  A started using it and I loved what I saw!!  My face felt smooth and fresh!  I also got a facial cleanser and a moisturizer with it!  And as a \\&quot;DEAL\\&quot; she doubled what i was getting.  So i was like awesome!  I can give it to my mother and she would love it!!  A couple days after using it I decided to look at the price on AMAZON.  Kinda wish I hadn&#x27;t because I saw that I could have bought the 6 pieces all together for LESS THAN HALF of the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; she gave me!!  I was pissed!  But at myself mainly because I should have know not trust those people!  I know its a scam!  But I had some extra cash that day and my skin could use some improvements Don&#x27;t get me wrong I lOVE the product!  I really do!  The moisturizer that they also have on AMAZON is especially nice paired with with this peel!  So Try it!  You will look.. Just don&#x27;t EVER get suckered into the people in the mall selling this kinda stuff.  And I have been to the mall 5 times after buy this and the same girl is still there!  She lied about being a traveling sales girl for this product!!  I just gave her My LOOK! ha.  Thanks for reading!  Try it out!</li>
            <li> I think this is a lovely item perfect for sensitive skin.  I am uncertain why some reviewers feel the clumps after exfoliation are dead skin.  This beads up after use much like every other exfoliator I have used with one major exception: no red raw face and zero irritation.  Makes my thirtysomething skin look and feel twenty something, for a fraction of the mall cost and no pushy salesman.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price I paid. Just received it today, and was shocked when I opened the jar. It was only half filled! The box says 1.7oz but I don&#x27;t think the content is even 1oz. I&#x27;m very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and genetically have more lines than friends my age or older.  My skin DOES respond well to micro chemical peels, but it gets expensive.  I bought this on sale and was skeptical, but my sister immediately commented on how good I looked.  Apparently, I&#x27;m not sensitive to the product so I leave it on a couple minutes longer and use it more often than they advise...</li>
            <li> This was recomended to me by a friend. It has a gel feeling to it, I was expecting it to be more of a scrub. It did exfoliate a lil but actually left a sticky feeling on parts of my face. Don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest of the jar.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the mall for $39, And got it through Amazon for $9.99. Exact same product works the same to slough dead cells. It&#x27;s a pretty small amount and goes fast</li>
            <li> i bought this item at a mall from a very pushy israeli woman. the only reason i bought was she promised i can return it for refund if i didn&#x27;t like it. she gave me a phone i can supposedly call her. turned out the phone was disconnected. when i went back to return my item, the sales person told me they don&#x27;t issue refund. i called the phone number on the receipt and a lady answered with a &amp;#34;hello?&amp;#34; sounded like she was answering a home phone. she told me the same thing. this company is very misleading and practices unethical business. the peeling is annoying. some of the residues are hard to remove from my face. beware!!!! this company is a SCAM!</li>
            <li> For all who think it is the gel balling up it isn&#x27;t true.  As you keep exfoliating and adding product in the same session, no more dead skin comes off. for the one who said rub it on a balloon is wrong because she probably wasn&#x27;t wearing gloves lol. Anyone who has this knows that eventually there is no more dead skin balling up even after adding more product. This stuff is really really nice!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product ever. Great company bought other things from them and their service is excellent.  Here before you know it.  Wonderful special cosmetic blend of peel chemical. Very soft but your epidermal layer of dirt and daily grime is removed and your skin is amazingly soft and supple.</li>
            <li> You can not imagine how deep is this peelin take out off your face all dead cell and dirt is amazing</li>
            <li> I alway make sure my wife has this stuff, it makes her skin have a glow, and she rarely gets breakout using this and taking vitamins (E and C). It is a very good product and she loves it, and it is very worth the price. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Your dead skin lightly falls off within a minute to reveal soft smooth that your products can actually work with. When you put products on the dead skin they sit on top. Do this as directed and you will feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li> worst thing I&#x27;ve bought to date, this product is like putting glue on your face.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything other than create a big mess.  Do not receommend you buy this product.  The ingredients are not even available on the product.  Avoid this, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I got this at the mall last year and still have some of it, have sensitive dry skin with allergies and this product has no smell and works wonderfully.  All I do is add my cream after use and whalla, no more dry skin and no thickness to skin.  I ordered another one for myself and one for my daughter for christmas.  The packaging is absolutely beautiful as well and I paid a fraction of what I paid at the mall for the exact same product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever!  Buying it online makes it affordable, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> So I also was persuaded to buy this by a very nice sales lady at the mall. She noticed right away that I have acne, sun spots and acne marks. She mentioned to me that she had acne on her forehead and T zone just as bad as me about a year ago and once she used this once a week she started seeing less pimples. To me, her skin was perfect. She could have easily lied to me about her acne just to get my money, but for someone who has been very impatient with her skin, I was sold. Like others have said she used the product on my arm and it was good. I cant really say if it works or not yet but for me it was very easy to get off and didnt leave my skin dry at all. I like it so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they call this a peel.  It&#x27;s not! It&#x27;s more of a facial cleanser.  I first bought this at the mall and liked the way it worked.  My skin feels smooth and moisturized after each use.  Needless to say I was happy to find it in Amazon for a fraction of the price!  I also bought the corresponding moisturizing cream, but wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I use this product once per week.  It makes my skin smooth and works well with the day and night creams.</li>
            <li> I use this product at list 2 times weekly and works amasingly for my face. It takes off all the dead cells and leaves my skin fresh and shiny. will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I understand many people believe it is the product itself that rolls into a ball and creates an illusion of being dead skin. That is true to an extent. I wanted to know for sure so I applied the product to my wrist and began to remove the dead skin. The mixture balled up was a gray color. I then washed it off, dried my wrist, and did it a second time. The balled up mixture was more of an off white and not gray. This product definitely does work. It makes skin absolutely smooth! SOOOO glad I found it for this price!</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my face feel after I use it.  My skin fells so smooth.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is amazing. The product is a dream come thru. It literally removes all the dead skin and gunk in my pores revealing the beautiful, refreshed and glowing skin hiding underneath. Well worth the money. This product is the 30 something womans best friend. No one can believe in 32. I know because its cause of my Vivo. This is my fountain of youth.</li>
            <li> I like the way it felt on my face. But when i tried rinsing it off, it felt like there was still scrub on my face. My face felt very dry. I wont be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> This product cost me the same it would have in store after shipping however it was a good buy glad I finally got to try this product. I like the way it feels but hate that the gritty stuff doesn&#x27;t wash away clean it gets stuck in the peach fuz on my face.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much the same review as everyone else. Saw this at a kiosk for $150 but the guy said he&#x27;d knock it down to $50 \\&quot;for me only.\\&quot; Bought on here for waaaay cheaper and I love it. This really leaves my skin so smooth and clears out the pores. I use it 2-3 times a week because my new birth control has made me break out like crazy, this stuff has helped SO much.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and this was a great price! I will be back for more soon for my friends and family</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ok for what it&#x27;s supposed to do but I don&#x27;t see my skin really take any benefits from this. My husband loved it though for him it did wonders so he&#x27;s on his 2nd jar.</li>
            <li> Product works pretty good, but I&#x27;ve used a another that was a little better in my opinion. This one seems to burn my sensitive skin a little, but it helps with minor blemishes and evens skin tone a little.</li>
            <li> Nice product, seems to do what it is supposed to. I have combination skin which is prone to breakouts . This product seems gentle enough and has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mall of the Palazzo in Las Vegas and absolutely loved this brand.  However, this product felt like I was putting some water resistant glue on my face that had shreds of crumpled up paper.</li>
            <li> Click here to read my review. I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician, blogger and a makeup artist.  http://www.makeupbyjo.com/1/post/2015/07/product-reviewvivo-per-lei-facial-peeling.html</li>
            <li> I used many peeling and exfoliating products and they all did the job, after using my face felt smoother and cleaner. But vivo per lei peeling does not have any effect, in other words does not do anything, my skin still has flakes after using this product. there is white stuff coming out after rubbing this product into my skin, but that is not dead skin like they like to make you believe, it is some of the ingredients this product that react this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most impotant thing is that contains SD alcohol which is very damaging to skin, therefore I trought it to garbage and i will not use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The igredient list : Water (aqua), SD alochol 40-2, Dead Sea minerals, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), cetreimonium chloride, propylene glycol, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), acrylates/C10/30, alcyl acrylate crosspolymer, hydrolyzed wheat protein, camellia siensis (green tea) leaf extract, imidazolidinyl urea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People that have chemistry knowledges should know better, if not a simple search on wikipedia about the ingredients should be enough.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after using this several times I don&#x27;t know that this was worth the cost. I have purchased other facial peels and I have always felt very fresh and clean after use. As with any facial peel product, it takes quite a bit of rinsing to get all of the residue off your face, but that is normal. After using this product my skin feels pretty much the same. I guess I was looking for more of a deep cleaning or exfoliating feeling - which may be my mistake with the purchase of this product if this is not what they are aiming for - but it is certainly not what I was expecting or particularly looking for.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling is a great on the face and great price.</li>
            <li> Same as mall but for way cheaper. Im very happy. Im sure the dead skin is really not skin but chemical reaction from the gel, but I dont care, my skin still feels great.</li>
            <li> However, she was a insanely gorgeous young woman with the most amazing Romanian accent. It was hard to turn away.  I didn&#x27;t want the small piece of soap, nor the &amp;#34;paper towel&amp;#34; to wrap it in, but after a few minutes of an amazing hand massage with the &amp;#34;dead sea salt,&amp;#34; I was sold...but she had more...all I could do was say &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;thank you.&amp;#34;  And hand over a credit card to pay for the $580 bill.&lt;br /&gt;I got home, used the product.  Not sure what exactly it does, but it feels amazing and makes your skill feel new.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m buying more.  But since she is in a city, I only visit once or twice a year, I&#x27;ll buy it on amazon, save hundreds, and when I need some attention, stop by the mall kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care is she made 95% commission on my purchase.  She &amp;#34;put on a show&amp;#34; and presented &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; in the product.  Everyone has to earn a living...and I have no problem paying for the &amp;#34;entertainment&amp;#34; value.&lt;br /&gt;WOW...and thanks Olesea</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product in a mall and paid quite a bit more than what I did on Amazon. My following the directions on the container, your face feels noticeably softer and brighter. I also believe it has helped to reduce the discoloration from sun from my face.</li>
            <li> I totally forgot i had this in my cabinet for a month and i noticed my face was looking pretty unhealthy and grimey.  I wanted a peel, a behold it dawned on me i have Vivo peel.  It does get the grime and dirt off and rejuvenates your skin.  I like this product.  Just be sure to stay away from the Kiosk at the mall, they try to sale it for $100!</li>
            <li> I was amazed how fast and how much dead skin got off. It feels good afterwards and my face looks better.</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday and I already love it. I used it last night and I was amazed. I have used several at home facial peels and either they didn&#x27;t work or they left my face raw. This product works and it did not leave my face raw. It left my face silky smooth and looking great.</li>
            <li> for the money does well. kiosk is a ripoff and I&#x27;ve noticed less and less skin coming off each week but does a good job but keep expectations in check. You&#x27;re not going to look 10yrs younger but smoother healthy skin sure.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it cause me so many pimples on this product. Dnt want to recomment it. I think, they have to add more descriptions on this product.</li>
            <li> I love the facial peel, toner, moisture day cream &amp; night cream.  I have senitive skin &amp; it all works great for me.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to know I could buy this product so much cheaper on Amazon!  My daughters even like it.  I like this line a lot.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them.  That is, until I found Vivo Per Lei!  I&#x27;ve tried time and time again to find a really good exfoliant... something that I felt got the dead skin off my face without being so abrasive I might as well have just used sandpaper.  When I stumbled across this I was sold.  I didn&#x27;t buy it right away at the mall kiosk but I went back a few months later because it was Christmas time when they showed it to me and I didn&#x27;t have the money at the time to spend on myself and this stuff at mall kiosks tends to be pretty expensive.  This stuff was so good I literally had dreams about it and every time I looked at my face and thought about exfoliating this stuff popped right to my mind.  I got it home and that night I put it on my face and I was in heaven.  The dead skin just came sloughing off.  It was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products.  Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com.  I love these products enough that I would spend the money but it&#x27;s always nice to save a bundle!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Works so good and the price is awesome. Before using this peoduct, I had so many blemishes. My family noticed how smooth my face is and the blemishes are fading..</li>
            <li> Love it! Exactly like the one I saw at the mall but cheaper from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I get acne sometimes and my face is really dry I use it once a week and it removes all my dead and dried up skin, I would recommend to use a moisteriser after every use though</li>
            <li> Won´t work.  I did not notice any difference in my face.  Not as advertised.  It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Same as what you get at mall!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well this product works.  I really didn&#x27;t expect the product to work well, so I was pleasantly surprised.  I use this product roughly one a week and it removes all of the dead skin cells from my face, leaving it feeling very fresh and smooth.  It is not harsh on the skin at all.  You only need a small amount for each use so each container will last roughly 6 months.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the over priced stuff at the mall. I have exfoliated my whole body and barely made a dent in the container.</li>
            <li> Bought at a mall kiosk \\&quot;under pressure\\&quot;, but it seemed to work well.  However, there&#x27;s a reason they do the test on the inside of your wrist!  This stuff is nearly impossible to get off of your face if you have any kind of fine hair at all!  Face wash, makeup remover &amp; scrubbing with a towel did not get it all off - I ended up picking the residue off so I could put my make up on.  On top of that, I paid $70 for the scrub &amp; moisturizer - double the Amazon price.  Not happy, but should have known better than to cave in to sales pitch at a mall kiosk!</li>
            <li> even when I use a buffing agent, when I use the vivo, I still get more dead skin.  it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Those people at the mall sure are pushy! Luckily, I talked the man down to $20 from $85. Why do they act like Vanna White when they present it? Anyway, I know a lot of people wonder if it&#x27;s actually removing dead skin, I had the same thought at first. Well, I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious to see that it is and I don&#x27;t mean by all of the little balls that shed everywhere. You can see the skin become more smooth and so much less dull. I really love using this under my eyes. You need to be careful, but the dry dead skin that collects under there from daily foundation use is wiped away in a flash! Applying my foundation after using this is AMAZING!! The entire day my face takes on a beautiful glow and is less oily and more porcelain like. Give it a try! Amazon&#x27;s prices are far better than the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; at the mall.</li>
            <li> I am getting married in a month and my fiance and I were walking around the mall when we were grabbed by a pushy sales girl selling Vivo products. However, it worked for her, maybe because the products sell themselves, because I walked away with some. I have very sensitive skin and allergic to almost everything I put on my face, but this is gentle and works for me. I also have a unique skin situation that leaves my elbows dry and gray, which has been lovingly called \\&quot;zombie elbow\\&quot; by some friends with similar issues. Nothing ever works on this issue - lotions, gels, other products, nothing. That is, until I had the bright idea to try this product. Using this peeling product once a day for several days has left my elbows soft and moisturized. They haven&#x27;t been like this since I was a baby! Seriously, this is similar to a little miracle in that this can sometimes be a painful ailment with the elbows cracking and catching on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the wedding coming up, and a wedding gown with a lace jacket over my arms (partly chosen to hide my nasty elbows!) I don&#x27;t have to worry about them catching and hurting, or cracking or bleeding. It&#x27;s an amazing product, that&#x27;s versatile to be used on troublesome areas such as elbows, knuckles and ankles (I&#x27;ve used it here too) that helps to take off the caked on cracked dry skin. It&#x27;s amazing. Just follow up with a moisturizing cream and voila! Magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you want to try it on these type of troublesome areas, and for a good, fresh face peel! Versatility is fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> using once a week works great, hope it last longer that I expect. Would like to have had more instructions and content of product with this</li>
            <li> Do not use with too much water other wise you will get all these mini-balls of product attach to even the most minimal facial hair. I didn&#x27;t even know I had facial hair until using this product. When I used it dry that did not occur and I had much better results.</li>
            <li> Very watery and has to rub for a long time to get the peeling effect.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use that is the main reason for using it.  It works really well.  I have used this before</li>
            <li> I also bought this product from a smooth talking salesman in Las Vegas for $49.  A deal just for me because I live here and will bring other customers.  Well I love the product it works.  It leaves my skin silky smooth.  I also bought the eye serum.  Saw instant results for $99.00  Wish I had reviewed the product first, but like most of you I had never heard of it.  But I can&#x27;t complain too much, I&#x27;ll just laugh because I got suckered. But I found a great product in the interim. I&#x27;m gonna tell others about it, but I&#x27;ll tell them to shop amazon, like me, next time.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product from my aunt. But I didnt want to pay the $45 price that it was being listed for on other sites and/or stores.</li>
            <li> Saved a ton of money buying it from amazon rather than the mall.  Same exact product and worked great.</li>
            <li> I llove the way it works, its not greasy and it really does remove the dead skin on the face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who these &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; actually are but this product is only for people who want to waste their money. It&#x27;s not even good for feet let alone your face. The material that you&#x27;ll see rubbing off is the balls melting from the heat/friction action. Try at home peels that use actual exfoliant acids with a name you trust.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.. It&#x27;s amazing how this product leaves your skin. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This works great and is gentle on your skin.  I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was 12 (I&#x27;m in my thirties now) and this peeling helps keep my skin clear, it&#x27;s incredible. It rids the dead skin clogging your pores, without drying out your skin. No harsh chemicals or smells and this is such a great price! The first jar I purchased was at the mall for $30.  I also use and highly recommend vivo day cream</li>
            <li> I too was hooked in at a mall kiosk by a pushy saleswoman, but I love this stuff.. for all those who say it isn&#x27;t skin that is exfoliating I tried it on half my face and on one of my hands.. I asked my family and bf if they noticed a difference and they all did.  I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of the face peel and moisturizer but I love this product. And I plan to buy a lot here</li>
            <li> Great and works better than the super Expensive items</li>
            <li> Love this stuff too makes skin feel like its soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  I highly recommend for exfoliating your face!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  I&#x27;ve used others that worked better that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Love the product and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad to keep this stuff handy.  It works well and is gentle on my skin, which seems to get more and more sensitive the older I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I use this product is because I get Petechia (small broken blood vessels) through my face when I get sick. It&#x27;s a common enough problem for people, but it makes me look like I have the measles for a few days.  It isn&#x27;t fun, but I can live with it.  The bigger problem is that once my skin heals up, it looks a lot thicker and ruddier than usual.  I&#x27;ve found that using a facial peel (like Vivo Per Lei&#x27;s) helps slough off the dead skin and even out the skin tone a lot more than just washing and moisturizing.  I don&#x27;t use it as consistently as I should, but I can always tell the difference in my skin afterward.  Now I&#x27;m no doctor or dermatologist, and don&#x27;t claim that this is what people should do if they deal with Petechia... it&#x27;s just what I do myself.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find.  Really helps clean my face.  Came in real fast.  Very good quality.  I have ordered in the past and will order again.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Just like most people I got way overcharged for this in the kiosk at the mall but never the less this stuff is fabulous. I got so many compliments on my skin and my sister loves it too. Buy it at Amazon though, never at a kiosk. Amazon process are great and WELL WORTH IT..I PROMISE U WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.  Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special for my skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I paid $40 or it at the mall.... At least now I know! It works what more can I say!? The product is pretty okay</li>
            <li> The box that the jar was in, not the shipping box, appeared to be tampered with as it was not sealed.  My daughter, none-the-less, tried the product.  She said it was awful.  She had the worst time trying to clean it off her face.  The product stuck to the peach fuzz on her face and she, literally, had to pick off with her fingers.  I definitely do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am buying this for my wife, who currently lives overseas, and with some claims of residue I had to test it first before I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news, there was none. Used it on dry face then washed off with warm water. No residue on my skin or lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any facial changes, but I&#x27;m a guy so what do I know. I did feel my skin feeling a bit tighter though, I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad. Ladies, let me know! The smell is also light and I didn&#x27;t notice it lingering around.</li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC !!! Try it...you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> I was really tempted to purchase this at the mall for $40 (this is with what they told me was half off!!) But I came home and tried my luck here, and I can&#x27;t be more pleased that I waited!!! It takes off a layer of dirt and grime form your face yet isn&#x27;t harsh. And it is way less than a facial, and you can use it countless times, for $13 it was totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works... I would definately recommend getting a facial scrubber too though, because I cleansed my face thoroughly first and used a small amount and tons of dead skin came off.  It is not the product, because I used it sparingly, but I had a hard time removing the excess dead skin.  I had to use a dry rag to rub off what I couldn&#x27;t get off, after repeated rinsings.  A good facial brush scrubber like the Olay Pro worked great the next time I used the product.  Whatever I couldn&#x27;t remove from simply washing... the rotating bristles from the brush did.  Great combination and my skin looked radiant, pink and felt so smooth.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just bought it at the mall for $29 plus tax. She said she gave me her manager discount (from $129). I had never heard of it before but was amazed by the amount of dead skin it took off my hand, and how smooth it felt afterwards. I have not used it on my face YET but i cant wait til tonight to try it. I usually dont fall for things like this but I saw it with my own eyes. I was still skeptical and on my drive home I kept thinking about trying it on a smooth surface with latex gloves on to make sure its not a well disguised scam (I&#x27;m very skeptic, usually if its too good its not true). First thing I did when i got home was google it, saw it here so of course had to check it out. Then I read reviews about how it has the same affect on any item, like glass etc. let me tell you NO IT DOES NOT. Not plastic against plastic, or rubber against plastic. Its nothing, just like a regular, watery serum. That only made me more exited about the product because now i know its not just spmething hidden within the ingerients.</li>
            <li> this may be the best facial product I ever used.  I initially found this product at the international market in Honolulu 6 yrs ago.  I paid 50.00 for it as I was so impressed by the demo.  Finding this online  for 10.00 is a steal.  It removes the top layer of dead skin better than any facial peel or skin care product I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve paid 100.00 for products that give much less.  This is a miracle facial and easy to use.  Simply dampen you face, apply a small amount and rub in a soft circular upward motion adding more as required.  I have introduced this product to my daughter and others and they have become fans as well.  I couldn&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this.  LOVE IT  LOVE IT  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Not as promised. sorry</li>
            <li> WHEN I BOUGHT THIS THE 1ST TIME, I GOT RIPPED OFF AT A KIOSK IN A MALL. THE ONLY CONSOLATION WAS FINDING OUT ABOUT THE PRODUCT. GLAD TO HAVE FOUND A GOOD DEAL ON THIS AND WILL BUY AGAIN, IN FACT I PLAN TO BUY MORE FOR MY DAUGHTERS.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift and before even reading ANYTHING online regarding other people&#x27;s experience, I was disappointed by the ingredients and the results.  For all of you out there that think this product is peeling off your dead skin, why not take it to your dermatologist and ask them?  I&#x27;ll save you the trip:  IT&#x27;s NOT!  This product will \\&quot;flake\\&quot; off if you scrub it on your office desk!  It&#x27;s a waxy ingredient that coagulates no matter where it&#x27;s applied.  It&#x27;s total junk and if you bought it at one of those kiosks at the mall, you got scammed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the FDA or some sort of agency could monitor companies like this that make false claims about their product.  Good people shouldn&#x27;t have to waste their hard earned money on a crook&#x27;s crock pot recipe!</li>
            <li> I am a self proclamined beauty buff and bought this stuff because the reivews were pretty high, and I am always looking for a good peel. Well, I followed the directions and the advice of other reviewers, and it was just awful. All these little pills stuck to my skin and the fine peach fuzz on my face, and no matter what I tried to get it off, it would not come off! It took a few days to get every piece off. I was so disappointed, and I should have just returned it, but instead, it&#x27;s still sitting in my cabinet. I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> My husband was accosted by persistent sales girl from kiosk at Tyson&#x27;s Corner 2. After much harrassing, he finally purchased. I tried it, only to have it adhere to my jawline where there is a bit of facial hair. I could not get it off with rubbing alcohol, vaseline or hot washcloths. Thinking I had let it dry too long, I tried it again. The same thing happened. I had to use a pumice stone to get the stuff off my jawline. I emailed the company because the product must be defectiv or at least I hope it is since it performed so badly. I did see on their website, All sales final, no refunds. How convenient. I have not heard back from.  When first approached, the sales girl wanted to charge him $125, she finally dropped to $40 so at least it wasn&#x27;t the full price.</li>
            <li> 4 Warnings!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st - If you have congestive heart failure... be warned that the sea salt is absorbed into your skin and can cause major heart  and health problems.... my ankles and feet looked like elephantiasis after using this product for only 3 days! I was not warned of this ... so I deducted 1 star because the product could have killed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd - Hands down...the price online beats the kiosk price that I paid $70 for, deserves 1 star for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd - I saw a definite reduction of crows feet and smile lines from using it every two days for 6 days... Deserves five stars for this reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th - The kiosk reps lead you to believe that the 24 months stated on the box will entitle you to a $10 refilled jar of products (Still higher than online product) if returned to the kiosk in 24 months when actually that is an expiration date.  Deserves minus 1 star for this reason.</li>
            <li> I dont underatand why it has good reviews. It doesnt work well. ... finally i bought other brand again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as magical as the moisturizing cream! But only take it once a week and do not use water when doing so. Got to love those Israelis! :)</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever tried, my skin has never looked this smooth.  I have started giving this as birthday presents and they say it is the best present they have ever gotten.  I would rare this a 25 if I could..</li>
            <li> I was introduce to this product when visiting a mall in Tallahassee Florida. The woman charged some major bucks for the other products that I bought - eye serum, moisture, body salts, body moisturizer and hand cream. This stuff really works and cleans the pores of the skin really well. You can see it working. It&#x27;s not harsh and smells good. I do not recommend this product for elderly people with thin skin and on heart medication.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful exfoliant for you hands and face and is so effective, but gentle. I am very, very particular about my skin and believe me it pays off using good products and a regimented program for your skin. Thanks again Amazon for such a great place to shop for my favorites.</li>
            <li> Love it! Let my mom use it and now she wants me to by some for all the girls in the family.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my face. Very simple and easy to use. Not messy or have your face feeling slimy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The product is okay.  I can&#x27;t see a huge amount of difference, but my skin looks renewed, so I will purchase at least one more jar in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial product!  Both my husband and I use it.  Husband loves that he gets a very close shave after using.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this.  I received mine but wasn&#x27;t yet done with my original. So when I finally opened it i realized it was all dried out.  It had been over a month since I purchased so I dI&#x27;d not send it back.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It is easy to use and it will definitely remove the dead skin cells. My skin is soft and takes in the Day Cream very well!! Would recommend this even for sensitive skin but don&#x27;t use it more than once a week!</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this product was from a kiosk at the mall. The scrub, a day cream, and a night cream were $200. So when the scrub was about half gone, I started searching the internet for a better price. I thought I had found a good deal with this purchase from Amazon, but the scrub is diluted and takes 3-4 times as much to do the same as my original (from the mall). The original has many more of the dark scrubbing  particles in it than this one. So it is not such a good deal after all.</li>
            <li> I was in an upscale Nashville mall with my autistic son when a kiosk sales lady asked if I was interested in a demonstration of the Vivo per Lei and Gratiae skin care lines. I have been looking for a good facial peel for a long time, but have extremely sensitive skin. (I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything except plain yellow Dial soap and St. Ives apricot scrub.) Always looking for a chance to show social interaction to my son, I agreed. The sales lady was sweet and knowledgable, and gave my son a double-sided mirror to play with. I was impressed by the dead skin that came off my wrist, but like I said, I&#x27;m allergic to so many products I didn&#x27;t want to commit to buying anything without seeing if my skin was irritated afterwards. She gave me her card and I went on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned 5 days later, ready to buy the peel. I told her that I had a strict budget of $100. She provided me with the peel, Gratiae face wash, and a body soap for $87 total (including tax). The peel works wonderfully- My skin is smooth, my blackheads are disappearing, and there has been no redness or irritation. These people who complain about &amp;#34;sticky white balls&amp;#34; must be doing something wrong, like using it on a wet face, or maybe they have been sold a bogus product on a &#x27;discount&#x27; website. More skin came off around my mouth and nose, as with normal face masks, and only a little came off my cheeks (I exfoliate every day). It rinsed off with a few splashes of lukewarm water. The results are immediately noticeable. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Biggest joke of a product ever.  You are just rubbing the product into balls on your skin.  It is not dead skin!  I looked at the ingredients and it is the carbomer (an acrylic-also used in hair gels) balling up.  If it was actually your skin, your face would be feeling it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It is amazing the amount of people believing that those little polymer balls is their skin rubbing off -_-  My face felt the same as before.  Look at the ingredients and don&#x27;t be fooled.  There are no active ingredients in this product that would be peeling your skin.  This is literally water, dead sea salt, and some granules of nut shell powder along with various chemicals/synthetics.  There are much more effective face masks out there than this &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; which shouldn&#x27;t even be called a peel.</li>
            <li> Sales people are Vultures, they over price the product at $100.00 per pair, then give you a good deal, HAH! I paid 60.00 for peel and moisturizer, now finding it sells for appx. 24.99 each, well at any rate, the peel is weird, but works, I thought they put \\&quot;Glue\\&quot; in the peel, as it seemed to roll like dry glue, still not sure, but it did make my face appear to be more youthful!? I used it every night with the moisturizer and suddenly people were asking if I had just come from the Spa..I love the stuff, and will continue using it, but they should really get rid of those people in the malls selling products for all kinds of prices, it de-values it&#x27;s real worth.</li>
            <li> produce works very well.does what its supposed to.face feels soft and looks good.i have never had a product like this before</li>
            <li> the product works really well and price is quite reasonable, will continue to order regularly and recommned to other friends</li>
            <li> Made a big difference by using this product.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to all to try this product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very bad, i don&#x27;t like this. On my face is like gam</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I&#x27;m never without it now that I&#x27;ve discovered it.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly and is doing exactly what my granddaughter needed.  She had patches of dry skin on her face and it has eliminated them.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for anyone who spent a lot of money on this product.  It works, but it&#x27;s not amazing or anything, just does what it says, its a really light peel, more of an exfolient.  I didn&#x27;t have any pilling effect as some reviewers claimed.</li>
            <li> When you use it you feel under your fingers  like a lot of dirt is beeing peeled off but no result after you wash the face off. it just contains something that make you feel this. Plus I dont like the smell at all. It is very rare when cosmetics smell seems unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and just got married for the 2nd time, and our honeymoon was in Hawaii.  A beatiful sales lady pulled me and my husband off to the side, and did the test on our arms.  I was impressed so I let her do the peel on my face (my husband left at this point and continued shopping elsewhere).  She was talking about the product coming from the dead sea...and being in Hawaii, I thought, that makes sense.  I bought the peel and night cream and she threw in the body salt for a price of $150.00.  So, what do I do now that I am running out.  I don&#x27;t what to pay $150.00 every couple of months on two products for my face.  Well, time was nearing and I just needed to buy more.  Thank God for the internet, and the search function.  I can&#x27;t believe that I am able to purchase 5 of their products for approx $70.00 in total.  Thank you Amazon for saving my face!</li>
            <li> Worked the first time, never worked afterwards. Am I using it wrong? 8D</li>
            <li> Leaves skin visibly clean.</li>
            <li> Horrible, fells like a sticky hard gel that is impossible to evenly apply on the skin. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> This is okay, but if left on the skin too long, it dries and becomes hard to remove.  It is scent free.  For aging skin it is good because it is not an abrasive exfollient that can microscopically tear the skin, speeding up the aging process.</li>
            <li> i got this at the mall and paid way to much , i compared the boxes when i recieved this in the mail and i feel there was littl changes but the product feels the same i luv it</li>
            <li> I bought mine at the mall for 60 bucks, found it on here for 9 bucks. I ordered it while I still had mine so I could stock up. The real stuff is light in color, has no smell, leaves skin smooth and the consistency is light. However, the stuff I got from amazon, seller touchdown, was not the real stuff. For one it was browner in color, smells like glue, is thicker in consistency and DOES NOT leave your skin soft. I know that you can get the real product online as my mom got her real product from amazon. I will send the fake product back and keep trying different sellers till I get the real stuff.</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, I originally purchased this product from the stands in the middle of the mall, which in turn cost me a ton of money! They wanted $80 for just the peeling mask &amp; day moisturizer. &amp; I addressed this issue with the salesman &amp; he told me it wouldn&#x27;t be the same product if I ordered it off here but I just received the SAME product here through amazon for obviously a much cheaper price! So my plea with everyone considering this product, buy it on here!!! It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I absolutely love &amp; now that I found it cheaper, I love it more!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and im so glad i found this stuff. This stuff works wonderful&lt;br /&gt;i love it so much</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This is the best exfoliater I have ever used. You literally rub the gel into your skin on your face in circular motions and all the skin just comes right off. It may look gross because it&#x27;s dead skin but your skin is amazingly soft after! If your face has flakes of dry skin or patches of dry skin this works great to remove all of that dry &amp; dead skin. Best exfoliater of all time, hands down! This price is so amazing I was scammed the first time I purchased this in a mall at a kiosk for about $100. They mark the price up majorly in retail locations. Buy it here on Amazon for the best price, this product is top notch!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is really a scrub. But it really gets rid of all the old dry skin. leaving a clean &amp; radiant glow to your face.  I use it just before a shower so it&#x27;s easy to completely wash off.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I use it once a week on my face an neck to exfoliate. Make sure you use it in the shower because the little granules of dead skin/product will get all over. It does make a mess but it&#x27;s worth it because afterwards your skin is soft and moisturized (but not to an oily degree). I also appreciate how there is no irritation when using this product. I have found that Vivo Per Lei is a great line and I LOVE how you can get the products for a fraction at Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works really well no mickey mouse.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the one I bought at the mall.</li>
            <li> Every now and again, there is a product you buy that the second you are out, you have to immediately get more. This is that product for me. Originally, I discovered this product in the mall. A lady came up to me, put it on my arm and I was amazed at how much dead skin came off my arm (well, equally amazed and grossed out). I purchased it, but when I used it all up, was determined to find a more affordable alternative. ENTER VIVO PER LEI!!! It is the exact same stuff and is literally 1/5 the price. I bought some for my best friend, mom, hell, at this price I&#x27;d buy it for just about anyone. It works instantly, you just put some all over your face and its like magic, the dead skin just seems to lift off your face. And... I have super sensitive skin and get reactions off of anything and this stuff gives me no reaction whatsoever.  VIVA LA VIVO!!!</li>
            <li> I love it ,it is the best</li>
            <li> Like the texture, smoothness of the gel cream. Find it does a great job exfoliating and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Really exfoliates.  But three friends one for Christmas.  Great wrapping and box.  I then bought more items from this line.  So well priced.</li>
            <li> I was approached by the kiosk people regarding this product.  Initially, I thought \\&quot;what a great deal!\\&quot;  Then I had a friend look it up on Amazon for me.  The guy stated he would give it to me at \\&quot;cost\\&quot; but that was still $39.  Then he added the facial cream for $29 more plus tax.  Together $75 isn&#x27;t a bad deal.  But you can get these products together for less than $40 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another poster that it&#x27;s not dead skin, it is simply the product balling up.  It is gross to look at but that&#x27;s their selling point.  It did leave my skin smoother and with a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously thought about buying this product for $75, but thought I&#x27;d rather purchase it for a lot less.  For $13, I recommend trying this product.  You are suppose to use it once a week and they claim the container will last 2 years (a little goes a long way although when they applied it to my arm that wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;a little\\&quot;).  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in texture, but I did notice a difference in tone and shading compared to my other arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to try this, spend $13 on Amazon.  You may end up being charged anywhere between $40 and $150 for this product through the kiosk.  They told me it&#x27;s $150 through their website online!</li>
            <li> After use, your skin does feel softer, but it is well-nigh impossible to remove the residue, even in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, it isn&#x27;t skin coming off, it is something in the product.  And it is annoying.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product while vacationing in Las Vegas.  They used it on me during a facial.  I was using Oil of Lay (which I had used for many years.)  I haven&#x27;t used anything else since and will attest to the fact that is one of the greatest products for facial exfoliation ever!!!! Would recommend this to all women. My friends and family have complimented me on how great my skin is looking.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great peel. After two uses my skin feels so much smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very dry skin and this peel helps get it off.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I bought some it was at the mall. It was over 40$ .&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER get it from there again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and price!  My face feels so smooth after using it.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this facial peeling. It removes dead skin cells, excess oil, leaving a refreshed and clear skin.Without the cost of expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better result. But it does get rid of some dry skin. I will not purchase it again .</li>
            <li> OK, a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; exaggeration, but in all seriousness it&#x27;s a great product. I don&#x27;t feel my age, and wanted to look how I feel. I stated using this as it stated two times a week, I have increased it to three times a week, and I&#x27;m careful to make sure to thoroughly wash my face completely to make sure that there is no trace of it left over on my face and my skin looks and FEELS so smooth. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments since using this from friends and family that I look great or I look well rested. I have reordered this almost in BULK because as is usual with a good regiment, the manufacturers either change the formula not for the better or discontinue because of lack of sales. My opinion, TRY IT. If it works well for you, STOCK UP!</li>
            <li> Love this product it does clean your skin. The price was right before i run out of it&lt;br /&gt;i will ordor more.</li>
            <li> I use this facial peeling scrub twice a week and follow up with the vivo day cream.  I have notice a considerable difference in my skin in a few short weeks.  With a brightness and lessen of pores.  The price was perfect.  I first found out about these when in las VEgas at a casino who had a store but was offering the 2 products for about $349.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make-up, nor fuss with a lot of beauty products.  However, whenever I want to exfoliate my face this is stuff I use.  It cleans away dead skin, and leaves a smooth finish on your face.  I originally bought this product at a kiosk in a Mall in New Mexico.  I bought this and the daily skin cream (that&#x27;s good stuff too) for my daughter for $60.00.  I never would have bought something that expensive for myself.  My daughter made me try it, and I was really impressed with the results.  So, I googled this product and saw that Amazon sold it for a MUCH CHEAPER PRICE!  So, then I bought some for myself, and I always buy this as gifts for friends, because I know that they are going to love it too!  Everyone that I have given this to as a gift is totally sold on it.  Great Product, and great prices on Amazon.  Don&#x27;t get ripped off at the Mall!</li>
            <li> This works very well and your skin feels so soft afterwards however use this product over this because you will shed dead skin.</li>
            <li> keeps the skin smooth and soft.  not harsh on the skin, thus does not dry out your face after using.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Vegas the first time and paid a lot more for it than I did on Amazon. It is a great facial peeling gel. I put it on my face and let it sit for about 1 or 2 then start rubbing my face. I also used it on my heels and it worked very well on my dry heels. I do like the scent and the way it makes my face glow after using it. I use when I feel my face needs it. I probably use it about once every week to two weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  my face and neck have not been this soft or clear since i as a teenager.</li>
