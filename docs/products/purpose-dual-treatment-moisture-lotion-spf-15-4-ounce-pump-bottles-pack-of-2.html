            <li>Wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>many people are allergic to.</li>
            <li>Most of them caused me to break out, but I got samples of Purpose from my Dermatologist</li>
            <li>I love that it includes 15 SPF, too.</li>
            <li>It works much better than it claims to.</li>
            <li>recommended by a dermatologist many years ago</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time it&#x27;s sold out so</li>
            <li>I have to drain the remaining stuff into a better bottle.</li>
            <li>Very light &amp; won&#x27;t clog your pores or cause breakouts, so it is great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, and has a neutral scent, which is important, as I&#x27;m sensitive to chemical scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Purpose for many years, on advice of dermatologist, and was so happy to have finally found something with SPF protection that didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I used this for 15 y years it was the absolute best lotion for my sensitive skin, it was lightweight, scent less, and perfect!</li>
            <li>So that confirmed my loyalty to Purpose</li>
            <li>having it delivered is important for me.  </li>
            <li>Almond-Aloe Moisturizer Fragrance Free</li>
            <li>Like many others who&#x27;ve used this product for many years, it&#x27;s very noticable that the ingredients have changed</li>
            <li>The new formula bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used and really liked Purpose Dual Treatment for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I have found all of these to be true.  </li>
            <li>they probably don&#x27;t even know they are killing their golden goose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;J&amp;J - Please revert to your original formula - I can no longer use the product and am very</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that these companies mess with a good thing, and don&#x27;t properly test their own formula changes.</li>
            <li>Delivery is quick, fast, and convenient.  </li>
            <li>Then, when you get near the bottom of the bottle, easily 20% of the lotion won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>I like Purpose lotion very much.</li>
            <li>So beware that the product might not perform as it has for many of us all these last years.</li>
            <li>it has a very light scent and it feels so soothing after a long day.  </li>
            <li>supplier shipped the product very promptly and it has now been recieved in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>pores,\\&quot; and \\&quot;light enough for every day use.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I compared the ingredients to my old bottle and sure enough they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>Just bought two new bottles of the stuff and after the first application broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give me irritation and pimples like most other moisturizers and the sunscreen</li>
            <li>It should be recalled along with so many other of J&amp;J&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I tend to really stock up on products, so I just encountered the new formula.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Purpose user for over 20 years, and so it was big surprise when I opened a new bottle to find that it smelled funny (more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer) and that it slightly burned my skin.</li>
            <li>facts\\&quot; on the upper right corner of the label.</li>
            <li>tried Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer SPF 15 made by Simple Skin Care which is an offshoot of Pond&#x27;s, but it was highly scented and made my eyes burn.  </li>
            <li>This new formula burns my face.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the bottle now says \\&quot;see new drug</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years by getting free samples from a relative.  </li>
            <li>B001ET73D8 Cetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 15, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]].</li>
            <li>The last bottle I got, however, was the new formula and it made my whole face break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>A quick check of the Active Ingredients of an older and brand new bottle showed that Johnson and Johnson have changed the sunscreen ingredient recently.</li>
            <li>I used the old formula for 25 years.  </li>
            <li>Does anyone have suggestions for a lotion that works as well as the old stuff?  </li>
            <li>and I cannot find anything that works as well as the old Purpose.</li>
            <li>old reviews are on the old product.</li>
            <li>These are also not quite as moisturizing as the old Purpose</li>
            <li>Just started using the new bottle on my face right after shaving (which is when I typically put it on) and</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will bomb like the New Coke - wait till they bring it back.</li>
            <li>the new formula is completely different.</li>
            <li>Every single time you pump out lotion, a dried-up plug comes out, too, meaning you&#x27;re wasting as much as you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>please go back to your old formula!</li>
            <li>They changed the formula in a major way without any indication on the packaging.</li>
            <li>bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to sumbit feedback on the Purpose website - but after a month of always getting \\&quot;Site is busy - please come back</li>
            <li>far as the quality of the product, people always tell me that I look younger than my age</li>
            <li>I have been using this since I was a teenager because I have such sensitive skin using anything else would make me break out.  </li>
            <li>The key words in the product description, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, are \\&quot;oil free,\\&quot; \\&quot;fragrance free,\\&quot; \\&quot;won&#x27;t clog</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad that J&amp;J has basically ruined a really good lotion.</li>

            <li> I am finding this harder and harder to find locally and I live in the city!</li>
            <li> The latter is slightly scented, unfortunately, but I got used to that pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years, and over the past few years it has become harder to find, due to the manufacturer stopping production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But recently they changed the formula that includes a harsh chemical.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying a few different lotions for the past several months</li>
            <li> I called J&amp;J and they refunded the purchase price of the new bottles, but I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s unlikely that they will change the formula back.</li>
            <li> I have also been using this for many years and the new formula is horrible.</li>
            <li> within seconds I got that burning sensation that other moisturizers used to give me.</li>
            <li> The new formula smells horrible, like every other sunscreen (the old one had no scent at all), and irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy and had an old bottle almost gone and a new bottle of Purpose Dual Treatment - and tested them side by side.  </li>
            <li> It helps tame the redness associated with it.  </li>
            <li> Really, Reallly bad stuff.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> it using this moisturizer faithfully over the past 15+ years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Earth Science doesn&#x27;t have a facial moisturizer with a sunscreen and without a scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find now a days</li>
            <li> later\\&quot; on submitting a complaint I have given</li>
            <li> At times I have found it difficult to find in stores and have tried other brands of lotion.  </li>
            <li> It now has a bad \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell, a slightly greasy film, and an active ingredient that no longer moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s thick and greasy feeling and smells like sunscreen!</li>
            <li> This soothes my face instead of stinging or irritating.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a number of years, since I got sick of harsh alcohol based after shaves.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s like every other mosturizer I hate.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This lotion never makes you feel greasy or dirty like some sunscreens.</li>
            <li> How disappointing.  </li>
            <li> artificial perfumes,\\</li>
            <li> Sorry I cheated on you, Purpose!  </li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so disgusted when I put it on my face</li>
            <li> This is the WORST packaging!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  it has a very light scent and it feels so soothing after a long day.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a man and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for years.  Doesn&#x27;t give me irritation and pimples like most other moisturizers and the sunscreen keeps my face from burning outside on the weekends (I always used to forget sunscreen).</li>
            <li> I have been a Purpose user for over 20 years, and so it was big surprise when I opened a new bottle to find that it smelled funny (more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer) and that it slightly burned my skin. A quick check of the Active Ingredients of an older and brand new bottle showed that Johnson and Johnson have changed the sunscreen ingredient recently. So beware that the product might not perform as it has for many of us all these last years. I called J&amp;J and they refunded the purchase price of the new bottles, but I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s unlikely that they will change the formula back. If any one has substitution suggestions definitely please post!</li>
            <li> I used the old formula for 25 years.  This stuff irritates my skin.  I am SO disappointed!  Does anyone have suggestions for a lotion that works as well as the old stuff?  I have been trying a few different lotions for the past several months and I cannot find anything that works as well as the old Purpose.</li>
            <li> Nice price for two bottles.  I am finding this harder and harder to find locally and I live in the city!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this stuff for years.  It doesn&#x27;t sting, it moisturizes and isn&#x27;t greasy.  It really is perfect.  I recently thought I would switch to a cheaper product at Trader Joes that seemed to be the same thing, but I noticed when I put it on my face it stung a bit, which Purpose never does.  So that confirmed my loyalty to Purpose and we&#x27;re back to using it again.  Sorry I cheated on you, Purpose!  Never again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purpose for many years, on advice of dermatologist, and was so happy to have finally found something with SPF protection that didn&#x27;t make me break out. No more. Just bought two new bottles of the stuff and after the first application broke out in a rash. Realized it had that sunscreen smell and looked at the ingredients: they&#x27;ve replaced the titanium dioxide with oxybenzone--the sunscreen stuff many people are allergic to. What a disappointment. Johnson &amp; Johnson if you&#x27;re reading this (ha!) please go back to your old formula! If anyone has any suggestions for a product that works as well as Purpose did but without this sunscreen chemical, please post!</li>
            <li> This new formula burns my face.  I was very unhappy and had an old bottle almost gone and a new bottle of Purpose Dual Treatment - and tested them side by side.  The new formula bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used and really liked Purpose Dual Treatment for over 10 years.  It was the only lotion I could use on my face and I used it religiously after every shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J&amp;J - Please revert to your original formula - I can no longer use the product and am very bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to sumbit feedback on the Purpose website - but after a month of always getting \\&quot;Site is busy - please come back later\\&quot; on submitting a complaint I have given up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they probably don&#x27;t even know they are killing their golden goose.</li>
            <li> Living in California, my face is constantly chapped and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different moisturizers. Most of them caused me to break out, but I got samples of Purpose from my Dermatologist and I&#x27;ve been using it for years ever since. The fact that it also has sunscreen is a great plus.</li>
            <li> Bought for the kids - It works and is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs!  Even with using Accutane this helped to minimize the dryness.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion for people with rosacea. It helps tame the redness associated with it.  I like Purpose lotion very much.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product. They changed the formula in a major way without any indication on the packaging. They have not responded to complaints. I&#x27;ve used this for 20 years, and loved it - there was nothing else like it. The new formula smells horrible, like every other sunscreen (the old one had no scent at all), and irritates my sensitive skin. Hopefully this will bomb like the New Coke - wait till they bring it back.</li>
            <li> purpose dual treatment is the best lotion with spf  i recommends this product</li>
            <li> Good to use under makeup, can be reapplied as needed.</li>
            <li> Like many others who&#x27;ve used this product for many years, it&#x27;s very noticable that the ingredients have changed and it&#x27;s nothing like what it was before. It&#x27;s too bad that J&amp;J has basically ruined a really good lotion. It now has a bad \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell, a slightly greasy film, and an active ingredient that no longer moisturizes. This lotion went from the best to the worst. It should be recalled along with so many other of J&amp;J&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years by getting free samples from a relative.  When I ran out I wasn&#x27;t sure where to purchase it, but was pretty sure that amazon.com would have the best price and I was correct.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality of the product, people always tell me that I look younger than my age and I believe part of that it using this moisturizer faithfully over the past 15+ years.</li>
            <li> I, too, had been using this for over 10 years and loved it. The last bottle I got, however, was the new formula and it made my whole face break out in a rash. I threw it away and am now using the Cetaphil daily moisturizer with SPF 15 [[ASIN:B001ET73D8 Cetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 15, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]. We&#x27;ll see how that goes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer 20 years on the advice of a dermatologist. It&#x27;s great, and has a neutral scent, which is important, as I&#x27;m sensitive to chemical scents. I love that it includes 15 SPF, too. UPDATE: it is now SPF 10 for some reason, which is a bummer, but I am still using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 20 years. One of the only moisturizers that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Just started using the new bottle on my face right after shaving (which is when I typically put it on) and within seconds I got that burning sensation that other moisturizers used to give me. I compared the ingredients to my old bottle and sure enough they changed the formula. It&#x27;s identical to a bottle of Neutrogena I have. What the hell did they change for? Now it&#x27;s like every other mosturizer I hate. Really, Reallly bad stuff. Now I have to start looking for a replacement. Anyone have any suggestion?</li>
            <li> recommended years ago by my spouses dermatologist. She has been using it over twenty years. Amazon is a convenient, guaranteed way to find it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have also been using this for many years and the new formula is horrible. it now has a scent and a burning sensation. I will not buy again unless it changes back. old reviews are on the old product. the new formula is completely different. do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wait edit review may 31 2013: I checked at Wal-Mart for the heck of it and they seemed to have changed it back. no scent again and the texture is the same as it used to be. I noticed the bottle now says \\&quot;see new drug facts\\&quot; on the upper right corner of the label. changed to 4 stars</li>
            <li> This lotion never makes you feel greasy or dirty like some sunscreens. It lasts hours longer than it claims to. I have been using it for years. My local cvs quit carrying it. It is not supposed to be waterproof but I don&#x27;t seem to burn after swimming. It works much better than it claims to.</li>
            <li> recommended by a dermatologist many years ago and I have been using the product for over 30 years.,  skin looks great, no need to spend a lot of money to get a quality moisturizer</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by my dermatologist years ago. I have been using it ever since. Very light &amp; won&#x27;t clog your pores or cause breakouts, so it is great for sensitive skin like mine. Has a nice smell too. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I have been using this since I was a teenager because I have such sensitive skin using anything else would make me break out.  It&#x27;s hard to find now a days so I ordered online and I will continue to do so because of the convenience of going out and shopping for it in stores.  Most of the time it&#x27;s sold out so having it delivered is important for me.  Delivery is quick, fast, and convenient.  It&#x27;s also on time delivery.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years, and over the past few years it has become harder to find, due to the manufacturer stopping production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This supplier shipped the product very promptly and it has now been recieved in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to all involved.</li>
            <li> Excellent arrived ahead of projected time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and I use this after shaving in the morning.  I have used it for a number of years, since I got sick of harsh alcohol based after shaves.  This soothes my face instead of stinging or irritating.  At times I have found it difficult to find in stores and have tried other brands of lotion.  I always return to this one when I can.  The key words in the product description, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, are \\&quot;oil free,\\&quot; \\&quot;fragrance free,\\&quot; \\&quot;won&#x27;t clog pores,\\&quot; and \\&quot;light enough for every day use.\\&quot;  I have found all of these to be true.  The SPF 15 is nice to have too.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist years ago.  But recently they changed the formula that includes a harsh chemical.  I recently noticed my eyes burning all the time since I use this on my face.  Then I read about others having rash and burning problems.  I suggest you avoid this product altogether.  It has gone from my dermatologist recommended daily face cream, to off my list altogether.  It&#x27;s a shame that these companies mess with a good thing, and don&#x27;t properly test their own formula changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I tend to really stock up on products, so I just encountered the new formula.  How disappointing.  Not only does it smell, but it irritates.  Of course, I keep things away from my eyes, but my eyes have still been irritated and burning ever since I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can recommend an unscented, hypoallergenic substitute, please do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer SPF 15 made by Simple Skin Care which is an offshoot of Pond&#x27;s, but it was highly scented and made my eyes burn.  They claim \\&quot;no artificial perfumes,\\&quot; but don&#x27;t seem to grasp the concept of not perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using two Earth Science&#x27;s products instead of Purpose.  Almond-Aloe Moisturizer Fragrance Free I use at night.  Almond-Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 I use in the daytime.  The latter is slightly scented, unfortunately, but I got used to that pretty quickly.  Unfortunately Earth Science doesn&#x27;t have a facial moisturizer with a sunscreen and without a scent.  These are also not quite as moisturizing as the old Purpose was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally I&#x27;d like to find an unscented hypoallergenic moisturizer with SPF 30 or SPF 45.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended it 20 years ago, been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!!!! I used this for 15 y years it was the absolute best lotion for my sensitive skin, it was lightweight, scent less, and perfect! Now it&#x27;s thick and greasy feeling and smells like sunscreen! It made my face look shiny! I was so disgusted when I put it on my face, I immediately washed it off! How gross. I can&#x27;t believe they changed something that worked so well. Never again.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST packaging! Every single time you pump out lotion, a dried-up plug comes out, too, meaning you&#x27;re wasting as much as you&#x27;re using. Then, when you get near the bottom of the bottle, easily 20% of the lotion won&#x27;t come out. I have to drain the remaining stuff into a better bottle. Please just put it in a plastic squeeze thingie like everybody else. Off to Kiehls!</li>
