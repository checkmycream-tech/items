            <li>Purchasing these would be a great way to decide if you want the full size bottle in either Pink Friday,</li>
            <li>colors themselves were pretty good, though I expected them to be just a tad more shinier and brighter after looking at the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that these are mini bottles not the full sized ones, this was perfect for her because she likes to try out the different colors before she actually buys them.</li>

            <li>The colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING ALSO!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this little bundle of joy Saturday and it arrived today (Monday)....</li>
            <li>The color was had huge chunks of sparkles and is not the real color at all.</li>
            <li>This collection has really fun,</li>
            <li>in all, I would probably recommend these to someone, especially if they are traveling somewhere or just need a nice pop of color in a compact bottle to stash in their purse.</li>
            <li>and did it on &#x27;em (light green) have to be applied about 4 time before it looks good.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>I love these mini OPI collections because I can try out several colors without having to commit to the price of a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was SURPRISED because I didn&#x27;t read it careful and was expecting it to be the full size bottles, but at this price that would have been to good to be true.</li>
            <li>My delivery arrived very fast, but it was not as described.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many different colors over the year of nail polish but these four never faded in the week that I wore them.</li>
            <li>Love these colors... \\&quot;Pink Friday\\&quot; is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I usually love the regular non-glitter OPI nail lacquers.</li>
            <li>be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY NEED TO PICTURE THE EXACT COLORS CUSTOMERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE SAMPLE PHOTOS.............</li>
            <li>I loved the colors but the bottles are really small.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors look pretty good but to get a nice looking and full nail, you must apply at least two coats and with these small bottles, you may only have enough nail polish for two rounds each.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for the  glitter polish though.</li>
            <li>Received the package fast.</li>
            <li>They go on very well in just two coats (three or four for Save Me if you use it alone).  </li>
            <li>I really like the teal looking color.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SOOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>Had the website been more careful, I could have caught this mistake before hand.</li>
            <li>i have purchased other OPI minis that performed way better.</li>
            <li>but after seeing a couple vids on youtube I saw the typo and ordered a full size of &#x27;Metallic 4 Life&#x27; instead along with the shatter &#x27;Super Bass&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind this is a mini set so my new bottle is almost gone.</li>
            <li>the polishes have gorgeous colors, although one of the colors i got was wrong they took care of it inmediately, very responsive to customer&#x27;s emails... &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>colors are vivid &amp; they stay on for about a week chip proof</li>
            <li>I painted my nails with two coats, followed by two coats of clear topcoat on Sunday night.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It came really early.</li>
            <li>but I found the polish to be very thin and it took a couple coats to get it to look good.</li>
            <li>For six dollars over this price I could have gotten the whole set at my local salon in the actual .5oz size.</li>
            <li>also, it does not include a black looking metallic color, its actually a silver confetti polish with some colorful glitter.</li>
            <li>and I was very surprised that they lasted to long.</li>
            <li>Wednesday night I gave up and decided to take off the whole mess.</li>
            <li>I love the colors such as the green, teal, and pink in the sample package, but the only issue I had was that the box have the picture of the black \\&quot;Matallic for life\\&quot; on the web-site, but upon delivery and opening the package I notice that it was the \\&quot;Save</li>

            <li> Most of the colors look pretty good but to get a nice looking and full nail, you must apply at least two coats and with these small bottles, you may only have enough nail polish for two rounds each.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the  glitter polish though.</li>
            <li> Received the package fast.</li>
            <li> They go on very well in just two coats (three or four for Save Me if you use it alone).  </li>
            <li> I really like the teal looking color.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SOOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> Had the website been more careful, I could have caught this mistake before hand.</li>
            <li> i have purchased other OPI minis that performed way better.</li>
            <li> but after seeing a couple vids on youtube I saw the typo and ordered a full size of &#x27;Metallic 4 Life&#x27; instead along with the shatter &#x27;Super Bass&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is a mini set so my new bottle is almost gone.</li>
            <li> the polishes have gorgeous colors, although one of the colors i got was wrong they took care of it inmediately, very responsive to customer&#x27;s emails... &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> colors are vivid &amp; they stay on for about a week chip proof</li>
            <li> I painted my nails with two coats, followed by two coats of clear topcoat on Sunday night.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It came really early.</li>
            <li> but I found the polish to be very thin and it took a couple coats to get it to look good.</li>
            <li> For six dollars over this price I could have gotten the whole set at my local salon in the actual .5oz size.</li>
            <li> also, it does not include a black looking metallic color, its actually a silver confetti polish with some colorful glitter.</li>
            <li> and I was very surprised that they lasted to long.</li>
            <li> Wednesday night I gave up and decided to take off the whole mess.</li>
            <li> I love the colors such as the green, teal, and pink in the sample package, but the only issue I had was that the box have the picture of the black \\&quot;Matallic for life\\&quot; on the web-site, but upon delivery and opening the package I notice that it was the \\&quot;Save</li>
            <li> They last a long time and don&#x27;t chip!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, who goes through a whole bottle of nail polish before it goes hard.</li>
            <li> Love the crazy Nicki Minaj mini colors.</li>
            <li> the only reason i wanted this was because of Pink friday and Metallic 4 life.</li>
            <li> pink need several coats.</li>
            <li> but my set actually had \\&quot;Save me\\&quot; which is the other metallic in the collection.  </li>
            <li> but pink Friday (the pink one)</li>
            <li> The pink and lime green is a sheer color.</li>
            <li> Not much to reivew about this product due to the samples are just way they say, &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So when I first got the product I thought it was something wrong because I had the \\&quot;Save</li>
            <li> As other people have said, the set does NOT come with Metallic 4 Life.  </li>
            <li> I knew I wold be getting small vials, but these are absolutely tiny.</li>
            <li> I spent a HALF OF AN HOUR scrubbing my nails with acetone and the glitter was still stuck on like glue.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a long time and although its small I still have some</li>
            <li> i was extremely bummed out when i got this !</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are just limited edition colors</li>
            <li> Me\\&quot; color that I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> It has those long skinny pieces of glitter that are hard to place and even out.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the Nikki Minaj colors and resorted to ordering from Amazon to find the color \\&quot;Pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all if the sets came like this, but you may get Save Me instead of Metallic for Life.</li>
            <li> Not sure why my set was mislabeled</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed when I saw my Metallic for Life which was not the real color.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it can be hard to hold the brush.</li>
            <li> I received one of the wrong colors, and my pink looked used even though I never opened the package.</li>
            <li> However, in the set i got SAVE ME instead of Metallic 4 life which was a total let down :(</li>
            <li> The bottles are way too small for $12!</li>
            <li> You have to put at least 2 coats for the color to pop!</li>
            <li> Also not pleased since I am unable to return this product.</li>
            <li> and I can say the minis are of poor quality.</li>
            <li> The amount charged for this item is ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> CRAZY ABOUT THE MINI OPI COLLECTIONS COMING OUT</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, i wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; have bought it if i knew it was this small.</li>
            <li> I ended up going out and buying \\&quot;Metallic for life\\&quot; because I wanted it so bad.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan :(</li>
            <li> When I was done, my nails were in the worst shape imaginable</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible</li>

            <li> i was extremely bummed out when i got this ! the only reason i wanted this was because of Pink friday and Metallic 4 life. However, in the set i got SAVE ME instead of Metallic 4 life which was a total let down :(</li>
            <li> I love the colors and was so excited to receive this. My delivery arrived very fast, but it was not as described. It was described as the bottles were .5 oz, I did research beofroe my purchase to check what size that was and it was a goodsize bottle, yet when they arrived they were only 3.75mg, which is a much, much smaller size. For six dollars over this price I could have gotten the whole set at my local salon in the actual .5oz size. I encourage this seller to do more research when posting items for sale so others are not deceived.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when seeing these colors came in mini bottles. However, I was disappointed when I saw my Metallic for Life which was not the real color. The color was had huge chunks of sparkles and is not the real color at all. 3/4 were good.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the Nikki Minaj colors and resorted to ordering from Amazon to find the color \\&quot;Pink Friday\\&quot;. These bottles are perfect for trying out a nail color without committing to a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many different colors over the year of nail polish but these four never faded in the week that I wore them. It also took 6 days before they even chipped. I wash my hands a lot and I was very surprised that they lasted to long. Great colors, Great buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this little bundle of joy Saturday and it arrived today (Monday).... superb! Buyer beware, these ARE NOT .5 oz bottles, they are 3.75 ml bottles. Purchasing these would be a great way to decide if you want the full size bottle in either Pink Friday, Fly, Did It On Em or Metallic 4 Life. Not sure if these are just limited edition colors but I think they should keep them on the list of beautiful polishes. Good job Nicki and OPI!</li>
            <li> I love the colors! It is however NOT Metallic 4 Life, it is Save Me. I am wearing Fly with Save Me on top, and I love it! Gorgeous colors!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 12 year old daughter. All the advertised colors were in the box. The colors are very pretty. Love how they over packaged it to make sure there was no breakage. Great service!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sisters bday. She loved it and I got it at an awesome price.</li>
            <li> This collection has really fun, bright colors! I love all of them, and I was especially excited to try Metallic 4 Life, but my collection contained Save Me instead. The seller told me that this was a manufacturer error and offered a refund, but I decided to keep my collection anyway. I&#x27;m not sure if all if the sets came like this, but you may get Save Me instead of Metallic for Life. Still awesome colors!</li>
            <li> I love how these colors apply. You don&#x27;t need many coats and they are very nice. I definitely recommend the collection.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT. I was SURPRISED because I didn&#x27;t read it careful and was expecting it to be the full size bottles, but at this price that would have been to good to be true. I have had it for a long time and although its small I still have some so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love these colors... \\&quot;Pink Friday\\&quot; is by far my favorite. I really don&#x27;t care for the  glitter polish though. It has those long skinny pieces of glitter that are hard to place and even out. It all goes on pretty nice with one coat but I prefer to put on two.</li>
            <li> I received one of the wrong colors, and my pink looked used even though I never opened the package. Besides that what I received was fine...</li>
            <li> I decided to just get this set and try them out to see which colors I would Love and which ones I wouldn&#x27;t....Turns out I love them ALL in the set!! So I will be purchasing the full sizes. However OPI made a typo because it says &#x27;Metallic 4 Life&#x27; as the glitter polish, but it&#x27;s actually &#x27;Save Me&#x27; that comes with the set. Just thought I&#x27;d give anybody a heads up. Because I was going to just buy the full size of &#x27;save me&#x27; but after seeing a couple vids on youtube I saw the typo and ordered a full size of &#x27;Metallic 4 Life&#x27; instead along with the shatter &#x27;Super Bass&#x27;. The cream colors are perfect for spring/summer and the glitter is a perfect top coat combo!</li>
            <li> Colors are all great!  You have to put at least 2 coats for the color to pop! The nail polish doesn&#x27;t chip until 4/5 days.  Def recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love these mini OPI collections because I can try out several colors without having to commit to the price of a full size bottle.  My only gripe would be that in the picture shown the glitter polish on the end is \\&quot;Metallic for Life\\&quot; heck even the box has it labeled as that but my set actually had \\&quot;Save me\\&quot; which is the other metallic in the collection.  I ended up going out and buying \\&quot;Metallic for life\\&quot; because I wanted it so bad.  Not sure why my set was mislabeled but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great. I love it and the delivery was fast. Even though they are the mini&#x27;s they are still good.</li>
            <li> So when I first got the product I thought it was something wrong because I had the \\&quot;Save Me\\&quot; polish instead of \\&quot;Metallic 4 Life\\&quot;, however I love this polish!!! Makes me happy just looking at it!</li>
            <li> I loved the colors but the bottles are really small. I gave this to someone as a birthday gift. But I guess I did not read the description.</li>
            <li> It was not brought to my attention that I was purchasing a mini set. Also not pleased since I am unable to return this product.</li>
            <li> Received the package fast. 1/8 the size but perfect for travel or if you just wanted to experiment with 4 funky colors without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I love the collection. all the colors are great. My favorite is fly. It came really early. Get it because you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are great!  I absolutely LOVE fly; It&#x27;s such a great aqua color!  As other people have said, the set does NOT come with Metallic 4 Life.  Instead it comes with save me, a very pretty bar glitter polish- the bar glitter is holographic.  They go on very well in just two coats (three or four for Save Me if you use it alone).  I have yet to use Did it on &#x27;Em and Pink Friday, but they seem like very great spring shades.</li>
            <li> I love the colors BUT i was expecting to get the 0.5 fl oz as described by the item description and all i got was the mini 1/8 fl oz. which is A LOT SMALLER! I am very disappointed, i wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; have bought it if i knew it was this small.</li>
            <li> OPI never disappoints with their color collections, and I love these &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; bottles. Especially for a teenage girl. You know teenagers, what is &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; today is not tomorrow. The price was right. Shipped quickly. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> it is the mini size but liked it anyway my niece is a big fan of nicki and it was a gift so anything nicki is great &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought these nail polishes because I love Nicki Minaj. the colors are great, but the 4th color is listed as &amp;#34;metallic 4 life&amp;#34; when in reality you get &amp;#34;save me&amp;#34; instead.</li>
            <li> Thank you! My sister loves them.</li>
            <li> delivery was very fast and they have great customer service. the polishes have gorgeous colors, although one of the colors i got was wrong they took care of it inmediately, very responsive to customer&#x27;s emails... &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I just received this set in the mail yesterday and I cannot wait to try them out! They will look great for spring and summer!</li>
            <li> I usually love the regular non-glitter OPI nail lacquers. So I had a fair amount of confidence with the brand. I bought the color \\&quot;Metallic 4 Life\\&quot; at my local salon, so this is no reflection on this seller at all. My problem is with the product itself. I painted my nails with two coats, followed by two coats of clear topcoat on Sunday night. Before I could even get to work on Monday morning I had three chipped nails! By Tuesday afternoon it was peeling off in sheets. Wednesday night I gave up and decided to take off the whole mess. I spent a HALF OF AN HOUR scrubbing my nails with acetone and the glitter was still stuck on like glue. I had to alternate between soaking my nails with polish remover and scraping off the glitter with my thumbnail. When I was done, my nails were in the worst shape imaginable and I had to sand and buff the surface of them all in order to just get them smooth again. And even after all of that, there are still minute pieces of glitter stuck to some of my nails. So for $8.50 a bottle you end up with chipped nails and ultimately, sore fingers. Horrible, horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This assortment comes with the regular lacquers, which I recommend, but stay away from the horrid \\&quot;Metallic 4 Life\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love the colors from the Nicki Minaj OPI collection but I found the polish to be very thin and it took a couple coats to get it to look good. It also chips quickly, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this item but it was nice to try out.</li>
            <li> First of all, they&#x27;re small. I knew I wold be getting small vials, but these are absolutely tiny. Most of the colors look pretty good but to get a nice looking and full nail, you must apply at least two coats and with these small bottles, you may only have enough nail polish for two rounds each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors themselves were pretty good, though I expected them to be just a tad more shinier and brighter after looking at the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would probably recommend these to someone, especially if they are traveling somewhere or just need a nice pop of color in a compact bottle to stash in their purse.</li>
            <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
            <li> Not much to reivew about this product due to the samples are just way they say, &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;. I bought the full sizes in some of the colors and I can say the minis are of poor quality. I am not a fan :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister. She loves OPI nail polishes and she told me this is one her favorites! What a great price too! Keep in mind that these are mini bottles not the full sized ones, this was perfect for her because she likes to try out the different colors before she actually buys them.</li>
            <li> My niece is going to love this. She wanted the perfume but there was no way I spending that kind of money on her when she isn&#x27;t allowed to wear the perfume anyways.</li>
            <li> I love these colors&lt;br /&gt;I bought just to save&lt;br /&gt;But i ended up using them a couple of time&lt;br /&gt;The colors are vivid &amp; they stay on for about a week chip proof&lt;br /&gt;Love Nicki!</li>
            <li> Only 2 of the polishes go on okay but pink Friday (the pink one) and did it on &#x27;em (light green) have to be applied about 4 time before it looks good. Keep in mind this is a mini set so my new bottle is almost gone.</li>
            <li> the aqua color and the lime color and/or pink need several coats. not the quality i&#x27;m used to from OPI. also, it does not include a black looking metallic color, its actually a silver confetti polish with some colorful glitter. i have purchased other OPI minis that performed way better.</li>
            <li> The amount charged for this item is ridiculous!! The bottles are way too small for $12! The package advertised a color that WAS NOT INCLUDED in mine. Until Amazon start selling the regular size bottles, I REFUSE to purchase any more polish on this site!!</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes. The colors are great. Especially for summer. I didn&#x27;t think id like that greenish color but its a neon and is actually really nice in person. I love the pink, its good for any season.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved this colors and the fact that she has Nicki Minaj nail polish.  I found the polish on this site called best holiday gifts to give.</li>
            <li> Colors were great, formula not so much, get it together OPI!</li>
            <li> this has to be the best nail polish i ever bought thank u opi and nicki . . . .</li>
            <li> I really like the teal looking color. The pink and lime green is a sheer color. You would have use 2 or more coat.</li>
            <li> got this to test colors. love them all</li>
            <li> Love the crazy Nicki Minaj mini colors. The mini are great to test the color before buying the regular size bottle.</li>
            <li> Great vibrant colors. OPI is a great brand. Received at a good time. Definitely recommend this product to anyone who paint their nails.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty. They last a long time and don&#x27;t chip! They aren&#x27;t the big size so next time I will buy them in the bigger size.</li>
            <li> CRAZY ABOUT THE MINI OPI COLLECTIONS COMING OUT AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION THESE COLORS ARE AMAZING I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT 3 OUT OF THE 4 LET ME TELL YOU THESE ARE GREAT! I AM SO HAPPY COULDNT FIND THIS ITEM ANYWHERE IN THE STORE!! THANK YOU SOOO MUCH. FAST SHIPPING ALSO!! WILL BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER VERY TRUSTED LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the colors and would recommend this product to anyone who wants to be colorful. Just fyi the bottles are pretty small so sometimes it can be hard to hold the brush.</li>
            <li> I love the colors such as the green, teal, and pink in the sample package, but the only issue I had was that the box have the picture of the black \\&quot;Matallic for life\\&quot; on the web-site, but upon delivery and opening the package I notice that it was the \\&quot;Save Me\\&quot; color that I had previously purchased. Had the website been more careful, I could have caught this mistake before hand. But in turn the other colors are beautiful I just wished I was able to sample the \\&quot;Metalic for Life\\&quot;. I guess I will have to just buy it seperate!!! I give it 4 stars just because of the web-site error with the colors that is in the photos!!!! THEY REALLY NEED TO PICTURE THE EXACT COLORS CUSTOMERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE SAMPLE PHOTOS.............</li>
            <li> I love the OPI mini sets. Let&#x27;s face it, who goes through a whole bottle of nail polish before it goes hard. This way you get the same quality, yet 4 great colors for what you would pay for one full size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those who like cool colors and cool color combinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this nail polish to color shrinky dinks once they are shrunk.</li>
