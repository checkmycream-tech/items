    <ol>
            <li>Excellent delivery time.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep using this brand, which is a bit sturdier than others I&#x27;ve tried, and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li>The night guard is excellent.  </li>
            <li>so it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li>This mouth guard works perfect no grinding no sore tongue or grinding into the sides of my tongue.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter and it fits my mouth perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is the best night guard I have ever used.</li>
            <li>For best results use fingers to push molding for best shaping.</li>
            <li>After molding it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>And I still can not figure out why anyone would pay the exorbitant prices to have a custom fitted guard at the dentist&#x27;s office when this product works every bit as good!!!</li>
            <li>I re-heated it 3 times to get the perfect</li>
            <li>BEST PRICE FOR THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>The best thing is the price.</li>

            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>This one works great!</li>
            <li>but thankfully you can re do it until you get it perfect.</li>
            <li>The best night guard in my opinion for the $.</li>
            <li>The best nightguard!</li>

            <li>I was impressed with the reviews for this product.  </li>

            <li>I just bought the Doctor&#x27;s nightguard and i can&#x27;t believe how great this is!</li>
            <li>but since I probably have to, I&#x27;m happy I found this product!  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to the one that cost me $250 from my dentist!</li>
            <li>Despite my best efforts, I could not get it to mold correctly around my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Best grinding protection you can buy at this price.</li>
            <li>Mine fits perfectly and stays in place no problem.</li>

            <li>Very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li>Best price i have found.</li>
            <li>but once I did, it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I always spit night guards out, not this one, it works great and doesn&#x27;t take over your mouth!</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I found these on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for the great price!</li>

            <li>, this is the perfect solution!</li>
            <li>You do have to follow the directions perfectly</li>
            <li>But, IMO, this product was absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the best solution I&#x27;ve found for an \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; solution because it doesn&#x27;t have any bulk in the front of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best mouth guard for grinding teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve found for the price.</li>
            <li>I did my best to follow the instructions</li>
            <li>Working great to reduce tooth sensitivity and pain!!</li>
            <li>This thing works great!  </li>

            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>It looks great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not that great for grinding teeth.</li>
            <li>Works great but needs to be replaced often.</li>
            <li>Fits so nice and very easy to use!!!!!</li>
            <li>, I have no pain, no clicking and eating has been a joy.</li>
            <li>Really great that you can mold it to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This one is a fraction of the cost and works great.  </li>
            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>This one is great.</li>
            <li>I had always used Dentek &amp; it is great</li>
            <li>This product may be great for some but not so great for others.  </li>
            <li>but this is a great product for the price point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it though.</li>
            <li>It has helped me with my jaw pain a great deal.</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>and they are great</li>
            <li>It would have been great to have two for a redo.</li>
            <li>The best of this kind</li>
            <li>Great purchase for anyone with that problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with the product...</li>
            <li>Even my dentist was happy that I started using it.</li>
            <li>Great product, save yourselves hundreds of dollars making Dentists rich.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it &amp;#34;sized&amp;#34; into my mouth great</li>
            <li>A great alternative to the guards that can be purchased at Wal-Mart or Target for $30 and wear out after 1-3 months.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Advanced Comfort\\&quot; seemed like the best one, and an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This nightguard is amazing!</li>
            <li>This will provide the best fitting mold.  </li>
            <li>The fitting is not 100% perfect</li>
            <li>IN ONE FASTENED TOGETHER CREATING A PERFECT SUPPORT FOR YOU TOP AND BOTTOM TEETH</li>
            <li>Buy nice or buy twice!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would consider this a successful &amp; dramatically cheaper alternative to the product that a dentist would make for you.</li>
            <li>It is amazing: fits perfectly, doesn&#x27;t fall out, and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The quality is really good</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s fairly bulky and after molding when I tried to sleep with it</li>
            <li>I believe it is a good product for the price and all.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to work, but I did not have a good result.  </li>
            <li>This started out as a good product.</li>
            <li>Its good.</li>
            <li>Works but not as good as doctor prescribed</li>
            <li>Now it feels as good as the one from the dentist.</li>
            <li>so it really isn&#x27;t a good product for clenching or grinding.  </li>
            <li>he laughed and suggested this product.</li>
            <li>I read a reco from a dentist to do that and mine has stayed in good shape after about a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product and works b</li>
            <li>The one my dentist showed me was thinner yet, but this one is good</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bulky and once it is fitted correctly it feels good in the mouth and protects my teeth from my clenching.</li>
            <li>This was a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Follow directions and the fit is perfect.</li>
            <li>I recommend for this good product.</li>
            <li>Instructions are good and tell you step by step what to do</li>
            <li>but it did take 3 to 4 times to get a perfect fit for her teeth.  </li>
            <li>and this isn’t as perfect fit as going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>As good as the guard provided by your dentist.</li>
            <li>Not so good either.</li>
            <li>After all, the reviews are good.</li>
            <li>This is a good night guard.  </li>
            <li>good am use any night</li>
            <li>am sleep good to use this good for me</li>
            <li>but as for the product itself, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to wear - all in all, an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I fit The Doctor&#x27;s twice, with no issues, to get the best</li>
            <li>It also feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I resized this twice, and still have a not so perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>However, about 2 seconds after putting it in my mouth I started gagging; hardly a good way to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>Good price as an alternative to custom made dental guard that costs hundreds.  </li>
            <li>The result is good though, I have been using mine for 2 months now without any problems, it stays well and prevents grinding.</li>
            <li>and this is just as good, save your money and follow the directions</li>
            <li>but I loved it...</li>
            <li>It is still holding up fairly well and doing its job.</li>
            <li>A good value.</li>
            <li>the night guard turned out to a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>but my store didnt have it so thought would try this one, all its good for is the trash</li>
            <li>good mouth guard ...</li>
            <li>Good quality materials.  </li>
            <li>Good thing you can mold and remold since I didn&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>Also, I used on my lower teeth as others have suggested and seemed to be a good idea.</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t a perfect fit for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but I eventually got it to fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Your choice and good luck.</li>
            <li>say on the product that it should be good for 6 months</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Something else may come along soon, but for now, it is good.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the original (now I know this is called \\&quot;Classic\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>I bought some efferdent tablets to clean it, and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Durable and confortable, very good fit.</li>
            <li>very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>this is a great product i use it every night, and am really glad i got it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;</li>
            <li>happy with my purchase:)</li>
            <li>but I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Sure must be a nice hunk of plastic!  </li>
            <li>Just boil it for 30 seconds and it works so much better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off going to the dentist and have a mouth piece fitted to your mouth!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get it molded perfectly the first time</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>I love this night guard!</li>
            <li>Makes me glad I&#x27;m wearing it!  </li>
            <li>one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is much better than the original in two ways.</li>
            <li>It was stated that this product was used to help alleviated SNORING!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>:) I CAN SLEEP!</li>
            <li>Love ya Jaxie!</li>
            <li>I sleep better knowing that I didn&#x27;t spend $500 for a piece of plastic!</li>
            <li>Favorite guard and cheaper then in store!</li>
            <li>No instructions for stove top!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Great and inexpensive product, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great product and easy to set up.</li>
            <li>This night guard is a perfect fit and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>this is a great mouth guard, and molded fine to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I found this product easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, and from what I understand, it&#x27;s a great deal cheaper than having to go to the dentist and have them make you a custom one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Re-fitted it, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing and works with my CPAP mask.</li>
            <li>it creates a great fit.</li>
            <li>Great fit</li>
            <li>but it still doesn&#x27;t fit that great.</li>
            <li>great fit.</li>
            <li>This nightguard is great; comfortable and made out of a sturdy material.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing seeing the bite marks I make in this thing.  </li>
            <li>they work great and are cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing what this night guard can do.</li>
            <li>and the fit is great.  </li>
            <li>If anyone knows of this kind of produce, please let me know.</li>
            <li>How effective.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say the this product has allowed me to sleep again by taking the pressure off my jaw and letting me relax the over stressed joint.</li>
            <li>You mold it to your teeth with your fingers while it&#x27;s warm</li>
            <li>The gel is pushed out and kind of spill over to the guard.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and fit it, not burning myself, and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>It now fits and seems effective.</li>
            <li>By the way, the case it comes with is nice and</li>
            <li>This nightguard is awesome it stays in place and is much cheaper than what I was going to pay at my dentists office.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I liked the product, and what it did for my jaw</li>
            <li>It still prevents the teeth from grinding so that&#x27;s not an issue, but it would be nice if it fully covered the molars</li>
            <li>My dentist says that over the counter night guards can sometimes do more damage than good.</li>
            <li>None of them have been both a good fit and not bulky, let alone inexpensive!</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions in order to get a good mold.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I found the Plackers Grind</li>
            <li>To be honest, I want to return it, but do not know their policy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the one from the dentist&#x27;s office (well over $450.00), so this was a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li>It is every bit as good as the one I had made at the dentist, and the price was so much better.</li>
            <li>I kindly rejected that</li>
            <li>This Night Guard fits her perfectly since it&#x27;s her teeth making the mold and it doesn&#x27;t cause much discomfort.</li>
            <li>It is as good or better.</li>
            <li>I have never used any kind of nightguard before even though my dentist always recommended that I did.</li>
            <li>inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but how should I know?</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to wear at night</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all that hassle, his particular AC Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard really impressed me.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it looked strong and very suitable for the job.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit, good product, holds up!</li>
            <li>The maker would be well-advised to include a time-line of the heating, cooling, sucking, and pressing steps needed to achieve a good fit.  </li>
            <li>fits good and easy to sleep with.</li>
            <li>This might be a great product for someone with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bite but, because I have a mild underbite, with this guard</li>
            <li>This allows you to fit the device yourself, yes, but it also means that there is a pleasantly chewy object in your mouth all night.  </li>
            <li>I bought this night guard and set it all up, followed the instructions which were very easy, and slept with it.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to mold just follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Very easy to mold your teeth for this product.  </li>
            <li>I found that it was very easy to prep and use.</li>
            <li>very easy to shape with the instructions.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use if you follow the instruction closely.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to mold this mouthpiece...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this, it&#x27;s made sleeping much more bearable!</li>
            <li>This doctors night guard is the one recomended by my dentist pretty easy to form and works great!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and effective in stopping me from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use(the instructions are easy to read for how you mold it), and the case for it it great.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, but the product itself isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>I love how this comes with easy directions and it works so easy and is a perfect fit for my mouth.</li>
            <li>The night guard worth great</li>
            <li>Just as effective and you can replace them every 6 months which seems so much more sanitary</li>
            <li>By far the best guards I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a good, cheap alternative to the super-expensive night bruxism guards that dentists sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a good fit with this product.  </li>
            <li>At this point after wearing it for a while the fit isn&#x27;t too good</li>
            <li>This is the best night guard that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>but these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying and post when I get a good fit.</li>
            <li>I had to mold it twice before I can get a good fit.</li>
            <li>it kinda makes my front gums sore, and can fall out if I turn over, but it was cheaper and more effective than this one was and didn&#x27;t require any molding.</li>
            <li>Good product you might have to remold it a couple of times to get a comfortable fit good price compared to drug store prices</li>
            <li>and I got a good fit.</li>
            <li>Good instructions on how to fit it,</li>
            <li>It does not custom fit my teeth, but still does just as good a job as the ones from the dentists.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li>the fit is good.  </li>
            <li>It molded and fit perfectly on the first try.</li>
            <li>I boiled it right and got a good fit, great</li>
            <li>A great fit and so easy to use to protect my teeth from grinding my teeth during my sleep.  </li>
            <li>Instructions for sizing were easy to follow and the fit is great.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job if you mold it right.</li>
            <li>This one is still going strong after 6 months!</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy to fit, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>I was able to get it to fit perfectly after the first try.  </li>
            <li>Honestly the best night guard that you can purchase for yourself; without the hassle of scheduling a dental appointment to make a mold of your teeth, paying $100&#x27;s (even with dental insurance), and then having to wait an &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; number of days to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grinding your teeth...clenching...jaw popping out and snapping back in....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mouth guards for sleeping, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Very easy to fit to your mouth too!</li>
            <li>Works great,, much cheaper then the one dentist wanted to make me !</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s exactly why these are so great.  </li>
            <li>This product was super easy to mold correctly and produces a great \\&quot;seal\\&quot; to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this mouth guard and it was really easy to mold!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li>this mouth guard was very comfortable</li>
            <li>Very comfortable</li>
            <li>The night guard is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Does the job &amp; very comfortable</li>
            <li>For the tremendous abuse my jaws put this thing through, and the benefit I receive from it, I consider that fair use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It is the lowest profile molded mouth guard available, and much better priced than the dentist!</li>
            <li>Good product: fit and comfort pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to mold and get a good fit .</li>
            <li>Good value and easy to use and fit to your moutn.  </li>
            <li>Not to say any are very comfortable, but this one is the most acceptable I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is my own fault for not reading the fine print, but I made an assumption when it popped up in the snore-aid catagory when my mother sent the link to me.</li>
            <li>Attempted fitting per instructions 3x.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to fall asleep with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Seems to conform even better after you have worn it a while each night.</li>
            <li>Sure beats paying $400 at the dentist to get a night guard fitted.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions before fitting it and during fitting it, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It is more bulky than Den-Tek, but I think that aids in the effectiveness.</li>
            <li>how well you sleep at night with one of those on :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered two more.  </li>
            <li>Oh ok, I understand...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stinking disgrace that that warning isn&#x27;t more forthright and noticeable before purchase.</li>
            <li>If you have &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; sleep apnea, try a double-biteguard (forms to top teeth *and* bottom teeth)--it</li>
            <li>I feel loads better.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a perfect, nearly professional fit.</li>
            <li>guard is NOT bulky and honestly, you can mold it to fit either the top OR bottom of your teeth;</li>
            <li>My husband grinds his teeth and has worn these night guards for many years now.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it takes more than one try to &amp;</li>
            <li>Better than spending $300 at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>If you do, it will be touching you</li>
            <li>We are both getting more sleep at night.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a thinner product that would offer more comfort.  </li>
            <li>DenTek is much better.</li>
            <li>My dentist said it would be better to have one custom made so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ground the point off an incisor (eye tooth), and I wonder what an x-ray will reveal because I&#x27;ve been clenching more than grinding.  </li>
            <li>I tried twice to mold it and it wouldn&#x27;t stay at the top of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is the only guard I&#x27;ve used that stays in place perfectly all night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I love that I can close my mouth over it, which I could not do with the target</li>
            <li>others, it really is a much more affordable option than a dental guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li>the teeth grinding has subsided anyway, I was put on meds in which one of the side effects was that...doing better now though.</li>
            <li>but its more mentaly knowing i had it on</li>
            <li>I had a better mouth guard years ago, but it is no longer sold.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend, this says do not use for TMJ or for more than 3 months?</li>
            <li>Decided to give it a try anyway, and caused way more jaw pain than I had without it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for 100% sure</li>
            <li>When I have it in, I tend to salivate more though</li>
            <li>molding process went ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved it around between the spice shelf, the counter, and the top of the microwave.</li>
            <li>but she wanted to see if it was something she would be able to use.  </li>
            <li>I would go with a more slimline one if you know you can wear it and sleep.  </li>
            <li>Most of these mouth guards sell for a lot more at retail pharmacies.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I won&#x27;t grind my teeth once I hit the pillow :-)</li>
            <li>Package arrived with a note, that the carton is ripped but the product is ok.</li>
            <li>As a long-time user of a sports mouthguard and someone able to read directions, I feel as though the moulding of this Nightguard should be within my capabilities.</li>
            <li>it is more of a muscular issue than a teeth</li>
            <li>it is more of a muscular issue than a teeth issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, now that it fits and I&#x27;ve been using it, I don&#x27;t wake up in the mornings with tension headaches any more.  </li>
            <li>Love these night guards.  </li>
            <li>I spit it out more often than some others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love this thing</li>
            <li>OK, my dentist says &amp;#34;get one because you are grinding you teeth as you sleep.&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Yes, this does work based on many months of use.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>You get the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I have had TMJ issues for a number of years and tried many solutions.</li>
            <li>This one is WAY better than those.</li>
            <li>Dentist said if I didn&#x27;t get a custom mouth-guard I&#x27;d lose more.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this one,some of what I was considering @</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like to be able to use them.  </li>
            <li>Plus at this price, I can afford to replace it more often than the dentist version.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than having headaches and shots of pain up the side of my head.</li>
            <li>Too squishy, which I think encouraged me to grind even more.</li>
            <li>She indicated that she was able to fully close her mouth and didn’t drool with it in.  </li>
            <li>Wife tells me I snore more with it.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use it.</li>
            <li>if there was a how-to instructional video on fitting the guard posted on the company site.</li>
            <li>Makes me snore more, so the hubby tells me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to do so.  </li>
            <li>However, my jaw hurt more than ever, and it continued to click and pop throughout the day.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not buying any more of these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;things</li>
            <li>This could lead to jaw pain &amp; even more TMJ issues.</li>
            <li>It may take a couple of times to get the fitting</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to shape the mouthpiece to my fitting</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I tried (which I did 5 times).</li>
            <li>I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep and this has been going on for many years.</li>
            <li>The fitting process is better and easier for The Doctor&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and she OK&#x27;d it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Almost like it could do a lot more damage to my jaw than my teeth could do on their own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM</li>
            <li>hurts more if I wear this product overnight.</li>
            <li>Much better than Plackers brand.</li>
            <li>It ended up fitting but was still way too bulky.</li>
            <li>(so many reviews scared me about the molding process)-</li>
            <li>Im sure it will do the trick for the time being</li>
            <li>I have gone through many nightgaurds.</li>
            <li>My teeth would have a lot more edges on them.</li>
            <li>It molded to my teeth perfectly after following the directions..</li>
            <li>I was able to fall asleep again &amp; woke up with a bit of relief in my jaw.  </li>
            <li>so I did have to cut it a bit to make it more comfortably fitting.  </li>
            <li>I admit, I haven&#x27;t used it two nights in a row, and I&#x27;m sure if I did that, it would relieve most if not all of my jaw pain.</li>
            <li>Others may be satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I WAS able to sleep with it without feeling like I was choking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Knowing that would be more than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li>This mouth guard doesn&#x27;t fit all!</li>
            <li>tax thinking it was better than a $5 one.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off with a sports mouth guard.</li>
            <li>While this is my third time to purchase, this is an absolutely wonderful product and does the job as it is designed to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I have to get used to but way better than grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li>These work much better for me than the flimsy type that has a flexible front.  </li>
            <li>This nightguard is much better for me.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions for fitting and it stays in by itself, and helps with my severe jaw-clenching at night.</li>
            <li>for my own personal experience with this night guard, I followed the directions as instructed, and I was able to fit the night guard perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a different brand that worked perfectly</li>
            <li>So much better than paying the $400 my dentist wanted for a custom night guard.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s tricky to mold; most guards have a groove in the front to position between your front teeth - this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I wear a nightguard most nights for teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>it prevents my teeth from looking more rotten at the bottom front.</li>
            <li>My teeth are safe and my destist approves.</li>
            <li>This product may work better for someone with a wider mouth.</li>
            <li>you may have to remold it as many suggested.</li>
            <li>Nice fit.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is a bit &#x27;gummy&#x27; and squishy, which can cause more problems with clenching</li>
            <li>The product now feels a lot better and keeps me from clenching my teeth at night.</li>
            <li>It is better to go without a guard than to use this one.</li>
            <li>Fits great and very comfy.</li>
            <li>Admitedly, I have not tried that many semi-permanent guard, but the reasons I like this one are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than spending $600 for a bite guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Maybe for some people, they work okay, but I had difficulty getting them fitted for my teeth after&lt;br /&gt;following</li>
            <li>He said there was nothing he could do for my gum erosion but that eventually I would need more root canals -</li>
            <li>got this to try and love it.</li>
            <li>The guard has a gel layer that molds to the top row of your teeth and stays there no matter what.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work, but it does.  </li>
            <li>but couldn&#x27;t mold the material up to the top of my teeth/gum line in the front.&lt;br /&gt;The product</li>
            <li>Works as stated just wondering if i grind more with this thing in.. ehh</li>
            <li>Follow the directions for fitting.  </li>
            <li>Amazon definitely has the best price on this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many a nightguard, and this one is the easiest to form, and the most comfortable when wearing!</li>
            <li>It also alleviates the front rim on the top where I would grind the most</li>
            <li>Could have used better instructions; had to repeat sizing procedure.  </li>
            <li>Priced appropriately.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>You better off giving The Doctor&#x27;s Guard company $20.00 dlls and forget about it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>so i bought two more on sale.</li>
            <li>, I have mastered the fitting process and all I can say is they do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>I was extremely satisfied with the refund policy even though the product was not for me.</li>
            <li>If my mouth opens (like most people does when they&#x27;re sleeping), it falls out or gets out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also tried many times to refit and it doesn&#x27;t re-mold.  </li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve put this 20 bucks towards a custom fitting at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>, I noticed that It made me produce more saliva in my mouth as if my mouth thought I had food in it.</li>
            <li>have not needed to redo the fitting procedure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried fitting again.  </li>
            <li>I had some extra practice with these, as my dog thought it was the world&#x27;s best chew toy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problem fitting it.</li>
            <li>I still think the design could be improved a bit, but it&#x27;s already better than it was.</li>
            <li>I am able to use it every night and not wake up feeling like I need to throw up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but still bulky.</li>
            <li>I read the steps through a couple more times to make sure &amp; got everything set up to mold it to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can sure feel a difference in my jaw if I don&#x27;t wear it for a night or two.</li>
            <li>It fits OK</li>
            <li>I have gotten many of these to prevent my grinding problem because I didn&#x27;t trust the $600 dentist one.</li>
            <li>I love these night guards.</li>
            <li>The $500 ones the dentist makes are probably better.</li>
            <li>Eh this is OK as a temporary stop-gap.  </li>
            <li>I found a much better solution here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They used to include stove top</li>
            <li>This is more durable than the ones you buy at the dentist for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the best part: headaches are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty handy person, I do all sorts of crafts, stained glass, pottery, sewing, needle work, so I am adept at using my hands and fingers to create.  </li>
            <li>Works best if your teeth are pretty straight.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is easy to mold into your teeth and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>So, now, what&#x27;s great is that normally I wake up with my molars hurting and since wearing this nightguard, my teeth pain is gone.</li>
            <li>I was able to create a perfect fit after a second try.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even realize its in my mouth at night which is a pretty good recommendation.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and precise and the fit is excellent.</li>
            <li>Ive never tried one of these before so as my first one I would say its a good one.</li>
            <li>This is a great substitute until you can get a new one.  </li>
            <li>It is better than spending $500 for a dentist to do the job more accurately.  </li>
            <li>Fitting was easy and well documented.</li>
            <li>The fitting instructions are quite good--thorough and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>instead and was able to mold this easily.</li>
            <li>You can spend more, but I can imagine getting a better fit or simpler process for making \\&quot;personalized\\&quot; than what they do.  </li>
            <li>Its of course not the most comfortable thing in the world but its not terrible.</li>
            <li>I am sure that their are slimmer and more comfortable one out there</li>
            <li>know this is suuuper cheap, but I would love it better if it was longer.</li>
            <li>It fit nicely after the molding process, but just wasn&#x27;t as comfortable as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Better because its much cheaper and still does a good job.</li>
            <li>Definitely more comfortable and unobtrusive than most mouthgaurds I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This one is the best because it&#x27;s the most minimal.  </li>
            <li>For us, the most important part was shaping the material up onto the roof of the mouth, which provides more suction holding power.  </li>
            <li>The isntructions are very detailed and accurate</li>
            <li>Comfortable, very easy to fit.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, easy to get that custom fit at home.</li>
            <li>The easiest &amp; most comfortable guard to make.  </li>
            <li>Got it, he followed the directions completely and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use fingers to mold the product at the roof of the mouth and rear teeth for snug fit.</li>
            <li>whichever is more comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consulted a representative via telephone who said to try it two more times in boiled water to see if the fit would improve.  </li>
            <li>I followed the fitting instructions precisely, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>but it has been a great help with grinding thus far</li>
            <li>This cost $17 and is probably more comfortable than the rigid plexiglass piece he makes.</li>
            <li>Did re-heat on one side to get a better fit</li>
            <li>I have to go through the fitting process twice before I get the fit I want</li>
            <li>These are the most comfortable night guards I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>but after she got used to it, it was comfortable and she was able to sleep with it all night.  </li>
            <li>And thus, it appears you must be skilled to simultaneously and precisely manipulate, adjust, press, position, hold, squeeze, suck, ect.. .</li>
            <li>Got a good fit on the first try.  </li>
            <li>Works great - saved me $800, which my dentist wanted to replace my old night guard.  </li>
            <li>If padding/softness is more important to you than bulkiness, you&#x27;ll probably prefer this one.</li>
            <li>so it is more comfortable, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Great alternative for someone like myself who cannot afford one made by a professional.</li>
            <li>There are others out there that fit and work much better for me than this one.</li>
            <li>The front has been redesigned also and is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>and they say you can get another one free if you screw up the process of heating it up and fitting it...</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s more comfortable than the one</li>
            <li>I have had professional night guards and crappy &amp;#34;2 for 1&amp;#34;s bought at CVS, and this night guard has been great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked great for a month so far, and hasn&#x27;t worn out at all.</li>
            <li>Like most people buying this product, I was looking for a night guard after my dentist said I grind my teeth and quoted me $500 for a custom fit one.</li>
            <li>This one is significantly more comfortable.</li>
            <li>These are cheap and work just as well or better.</li>
            <li>The instructions go to great length &amp; frequently repeat to follow the steps to the letter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will get more comfortable as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I think immersing it in boiling water would have made a better fit, but the instructions didn&#x27;t mcall for that.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and does it at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Directions are good and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;3 minutes in the microwave&amp;#34; means absolutely nothing instructional wise, since there are 500, 600, 700, 800, and 1000+ watt microwaves, and each one&#x27;s time will vary.</li>
            <li>The instructions make fitting this thing sound easy, it is anything but easy.  </li>
            <li>good news is that they are super easy to customize and I think it&#x27;s actually a fun project</li>
            <li>Be sure to soften it in very hot boiling water before fitting it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do better and the product will fit into my mouth completely fine.</li>
            <li>It molds perfectly to my mouth and lasts for months as long as you keep it clean.</li>
            <li>Overall good for the grinding issue though!</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I knew a friendly dental assistant would be able to mold it to my mouth.</li>
            <li>Cool way to save your teeth!</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth from grinding and stays in place at night.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to either clean it more thoroughly than brushing every so often, or replace it over time-</li>
            <li>Easy.  </li>
            <li>and I found it easy to mold.</li>
            <li>It was easy to mold when boiled on the stove and then bit.</li>
            <li>easy.</li>
            <li>easy.</li>
            <li>It was fairly easy to get fitted.  </li>
            <li>Once fitted (instructions are easy, I&#x27;ll give it up for that)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mold</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to mold.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and am using it.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to mold to my mouth.</li>
            <li>As an at home use product, it is really easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust to my bite.  </li>
            <li>Easy to mold/</li>
            <li>Casting of teeth impression was easy and did work as advertised, but it is a mouthful.</li>
            <li>It would be easy to trim if required.</li>
            <li>It does not mold to the mouth easily.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep as easy</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars for these reasons as I kept biting through thinner guards that were easy on the jaw and spitting out thicker ones in my sleep.</li>
            <li>I adjusted to using it very quickly, in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to mold and fits my mouth without falling out.  </li>
            <li>I had to cut mine like a J cuz of the shape of my teeth/mouth, it was easy to do.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy, but ensure you follow them step-by-step.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to shape and trim.</li>
            <li>Easy to form.</li>
            <li>We had to heat it up about three times to get the ideal fit, but I think it will go faster next time.  </li>
            <li>After a visit to the dentist, he strongly recommended that I get a mouth guard because I was grinding my teeth at night.</li>
            <li>But far superior than many others tried.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t leach onto your teeth as strong but if you are grinding your teeth, it will stay in.</li>
            <li>Would be perfect except for the fact it is too narrow to fit either my top or bottom</li>
            <li>The thing won&#x27;t fit securely in my mouth -- falls out despite doing the boiling and fitting and molding precisely as per instructions.</li>
            <li>I am sure this is good for some people, also sure there are some like me who weren&#x27;t aware of the new model, so-be advised.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit your mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I got out my magnifying glass and read the fine print on the side of the box.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comfortable</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fine in the morning</li>
            <li>It works just fine on my bottom teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works just fine on my bottom teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I slept fine through the night.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and it works fine.</li>
            <li>and it did fine.</li>
            <li>This was easy to use, I was nervous about the fit</li>
            <li>Easy to prepare, and so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>and you should get it just fine.</li>
            <li>this is gonna work just fine.....</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to fit.</li>
            <li>The Doc&#x27;s nightguard was easy to fit and you can refit it, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve remolded twice and it seems fine.</li>
            <li>find this product comfortable to use, easy to mold</li>
            <li>I purchased this item without reading the fine print.  </li>
            <li>So easy to custom fit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, mold, fit.  </li>
            <li>For temporary use, these might be fine.</li>
            <li>and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic item so easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to mold and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>But yes, in a pinch, this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>But I decided to give it a try and it felt fine at night.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and fitting it was a breeze.</li>
            <li>but it was fairly easy to mold and align well for a perfect tight fit.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to mold before I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Several years ago I purchased a large Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard and it fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>And I got a large and it was huge, so medium actually worked best for me.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions carefully, it really does make for a nice fit.</li>
            <li>Felt like a huge wad of gum in my mouth.</li>
            <li>After that it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is a huge improvement from not having anything.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t need a huge review.</li>
            <li>This is relatively comfortable, and has been an overall great product, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the great product.</li>
            <li>Fingers crossed it will somehow miraculously fit this time around.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and durable.</li>
            <li>The chips keep needing to be filled and then I keep chipping the fillings.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap store brands, like</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s comfortable this way</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not that comfortable</li>
            <li>The fit also doesn&#x27;t hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can speak well with it, it&#x27;s slim and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Even after I fit it, it would not stay in my mouth at night.....</li>
            <li>If doesn&#x27;t fit, repeat procedure with 20 seconds in boiling water...</li>
            <li>Just a hassle creating the custom fit mold sometimes.</li>
            <li>They changed out it was made and now it won&#x27;t fit my mouth at all.</li>
            <li>My dentist offered to fit me with a nightguard, but as a twenty-something there was no way i was going to spend hundreds of dollars on one.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions to make this fit</li>
            <li>The Nightguard was reasonably comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Follow them closely and precisely.  </li>
            <li>Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit.</li>
            <li>Once you fit it to your mouth it comfortable.</li>
            <li>I got this night guard to replace a professionally-made one that no longer fit.</li>
            <li>I understand now why it was so cheap</li>
            <li>Well worth the price (and better than the $500 quoted from the dentist).  </li>
            <li>Comfortable when sleeping</li>
            <li>They said cheaper kinds wouldn&#x27;t be as comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, and did not slip out or move at all while I slept.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just too cheap with my time and money to get one from my dentist.</li>
            <li>This product did not work for me even after having a replacement night guard was issued and also after six attempts to custom fit it.</li>
            <li>I could not get this one to fit and hold on to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Tried to reheat but still doesn&#x27;t fit right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they will send you a FREE replacement nightguard and also offer help on molding it if you require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap but serves the purpose.  </li>
            <li>You may need to buy 2-3 per year, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than getting one fit by a money-hungry dentist.</li>
            <li>One size does not always fit all.</li>
            <li>I had to heat mine up twice to get it to fit</li>
            <li>It stays in place and is comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li>Could not get a comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li>It help me to stop make sound while I sleep.  </li>
            <li>After I use this problem, my husband never hear any sound from my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>The one from my dentist fits much better and was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and you get cheap.  </li>
            <li>fit.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to just go buy a cheap mouth guard instead.</li>
            <li>It fit well for her mouth except for the front teeth a bit</li>
            <li>She indicated she is amazed at how comfortable this is in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really like about it is that you boil it and it fits to your own teeth, so</li>
            <li>It is BPA free, and you don&#x27;t have to spend $200 on a mouthguard - you can buy this</li>
            <li>I fit these the way I was supposed to</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve gone through two of them and although i have followed the directions, i can&#x27;t get it to fit</li>
            <li>how do i remold it to where it&#x27;s comfortable?  </li>
            <li>Could not get it to fit into mouth.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my mouth in a way that was comfortable to sleep.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>This re-expands the cushion and keeps it comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable at night!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to finally find a mouth guard that stays in my mouth all night</li>
            <li>Fit</li>
            <li>but it seems as if it isn&#x27;t comfortable...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t quite get the fit</li>
            <li>It doesnt fit well.</li>
            <li>I even heated it 2 times and cannot get it to fit my mouth.</li>
            <li>Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard Advanced Comfort instructions indicate that if you have one or</li>
            <li>I molded this product as directed, but had issues getting it to fit well.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to fit the guard four times and it will not stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Boiled it and fit it to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a Guaranteed Fit and they will send you another one... that won&#x27;t fit?</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re welcome to send me my $20 back.</li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t fit like a glove.</li>
            <li>Not too bulky, but I had to try twice to get the fit.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fit my sons with for football).</li>
            <li>and I could never get it to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>I had one that I didn&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li>It might of worked, had it fit.</li>
            <li>followed the directions as precisely as I could, but just couldn&#x27;t get this to work out.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear at night.</li>
            <li>The best mouthguards out there, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li>you follow the directions, you can mold this into a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>it didnt fit well at all anyway</li>
            <li>When shaping the products to fit my teeth, I followed the directions and the product did lock onto my teeth-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the fit since it appears to be a one size</li>
            <li>I have tried to shape this to fit my mouth.</li>
            <li>Unbelievably low price for a great product.  </li>
            <li>However, it is bulkier than custom fit night guard</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t fit (</li>
            <li>My tongue is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even breathe comfortably with this</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that my dentist asked me to let him see it because-- in his opinion</li>
            <li>My GF who works in a dental office had free custom ones made for me ...</li>
            <li>But it is not as comfortable as the custom job my dentist makes from a mold of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has worn retainers for braces and night guards prepared by my dentist, I know how mouth guards are supposed to fit.</li>
            <li>Until buying this night guard, I couldn&#x27;t find any that actually fit my mouth.</li>
            <li>It was easy to mold and even easier to clean.</li>
            <li>how well it fit me after going through the process.</li>
            <li>This is inexpensive, comfortable &amp; it does the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am completely comfortable with this $17 piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t imagine that a moulded guard would make that much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit in the mouth after forming it.</li>
            <li>They stay in comfortably.</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak after each use with a denture tablet to keep fresh.</li>
            <li>I tried to fit it to my mouth and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t fit well enought that it wouldn&#x27;t fall out when I opened my mouth.</li>
            <li>So comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have many porcelain crowns, so it&#x27;s essential that I wear a good nightguard to prevent severe damage to my teeth at night.</li>
            <li>I really think that it would be perfect if they made a LARGER size.</li>
            <li>Got it instead of the NTI recommended by my dentist (it would have cost over $1K), so far so good.</li>
            <li>It allows you to mould it to your teeth and for the most part, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>so I made sure I did everything right.  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions through a couple of times and gathered everything I needed to make sure I could follow the steps and get the timing right.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortable, very secure, and the first mouthguard that I can wear all night without finding it tossed across the room.</li>
            <li>so I got this new one and fit it so much better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably more suitable for a young child.  </li>
            <li>I followed the enclosed instructions exactly, and wasn&#x27;t able to get the protector to fit correctly - it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place, kept falling off my teeth when opening my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I tried to fit it the first time, but I shifted my teeth forward a bit while fitting it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different night guards and The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard provides the best fit and is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely be signing up for auto shipping as I&#x27;m very satisfied with each purchase.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product because most of the older reviews were good.</li>
            <li>Still, despite the fact that the part of the guard OUTSIDE my teeth protrudes more than I&#x27;d like (or would be most comfortable), I still do like the night guard and wear it most</li>
            <li>and he said the same thing, he reccomended he make me one (which he&#x27;ll be doing as soon as I get my cavities filled) and said in the meantime the next best thing is an athletic nightguard that features a top and bottom guard fastened together.&lt;br /&gt;check</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I had to trim the ends a little to make it more comfortable, but once I did it worked great.</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly - and maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had some experience fitting the other</li>
            <li>The only good thing was that it&#x27;s easy to mold</li>
            <li>This Doctor&#x27;s night guard was easy to mold, it only took one try, and it has a really good grip on my teeth, did not shift even the tiniest bit overnight.</li>
            <li>The material is a soft plastic that is easily trimmed with a warm kitchen knife.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get an adequate fit on the first try, despite the detailed instructions being unclear and almost self-contradictory.  </li>
            <li>I am glad it is not expensive.</li>
            <li>After the first night he felt 100% migraine free, and hasn&#x27;t had one in over a week!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my small mouth.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I did a good job molding it because I woke up without any problems - it stays securely attached even if you open your mouth if you follow the molding procedures correctly.  </li>
            <li>I might have done a better job during the molding process but really, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable, it stays in place all night, and I&#x27;m not worried about chewing through my teeth...</li>
            <li>and I made sure to do exactly as noted.  </li>
            <li>: Make sure you have it exactly where you want it because once you make your imprint, it&#x27;s there to stay.</li>
            <li>In all fairness, I have significant TMJ and need to use a custom made guard to avoid problems.  </li>
            <li>it is unique to you.</li>
            <li>The results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used athletic mouth guards over my lifetime and am quite familiar with how to mold them.  </li>
            <li>Not even too excited to use it again.</li>
            <li>, check to make sure the water temperature is between x and x degrees.&amp;#34; This way, we know how hot the water should</li>
            <li>I got originally-</li>
            <li>Also, as for the fitting, you have to follow the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure the plastic part is in fully boiling hot water.</li>
            <li>defeating the purpose, for sure) in order to keep from drooling on myself and to keep it from falling out, which it did the first night I used it.</li>
            <li>The plastic is thicker and thinner where it needs to be as opposed to the original that had uniform thickness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t throw it out after it didn&#x27;t seem to work at first.</li>
            <li>You may be nervous at first when it comes to fitting, just follow instructions and it will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(I have a big mouth I guess :P)</li>
            <li>WHile I was very fortunate to get a good fit the first time, in terms of my bite, I did not feel that I was as successful at forming the OUTSIDE edge to conform to the outside of my teeth.</li>
            <li>but it has worked just fine from the very first night</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to clean, I just brush it with my toothbrush/paste.</li>
            <li>this thing is super comfortable and allows me to close my mouth.</li>
            <li>As a professional dental hygienist I&#x27;m very impressed with the way these specific guards are made.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a good enough fit for me to keep wearing</li>
            <li>These are super comfortable, not noticeable while sleeping and</li>
            <li>The informative insert suggests you clean your guard with Efferdent- to kill germs.</li>
            <li>keep it clean and sanitary</li>
            <li>keep it clean and sanitary</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the trick to keeping them clean.</li>
            <li>The Doctors Nightguard is super affordable, you set it up in 5 minutes and it is so comfortable, no problem falling asleep.</li>
            <li>For those users out there giving this a positive review, you are deluding yourselves into thinking that this appliance is healthy for you.</li>
            <li>I never could get it hot enough that it formed a really good bond on the top teeth.</li>
            <li>She found that using your fingers to press the guard right after the hot water to get a better fit.  </li>
            <li>I have a very small mouth and this is the perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and pleased at how easy it was to \\&quot;boil and bite\\&quot; to custom fit it.  </li>
            <li>And the price was right!</li>
            <li>well she was right!</li>
            <li>My main concern before using this product if I was going to be able to sleep comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to fit, stays in place, very comfortable, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Great delivery...product as expected</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about being able to get a good custom fit and more so about being able sleep with this.</li>
            <li>and it fit comfortably the first night.  </li>
            <li>Happiness at last!</li>
            <li>20 seconds channel side up to cool before you place in mouth...</li>
            <li>Yes, it is much cheaper than the dentist-made guard, but you may do your jaw more damage by using it.</li>
            <li>Only good thing about it is the plastic case, which my grandson loves to play with,.</li>
            <li>Then let it cool.</li>
            <li>If you have no experience in the process, it&#x27;s still possible to get a good result ...</li>
            <li>and I was able to get used to it much quicker.</li>
            <li>It might be a personal problem but still wanted to give fair warning.</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing this on amazon which I found to have the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li>got a good fit the first try, but I can understand that many people would need two tries.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t want to spend too much to find out she would not be able to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li>And reasonable pricing on top of that.  </li>
            <li>Works out how it should and mine lasted a full year</li>
            <li>You can even answer the phone while wearing it and not talk like you have a mouth full of food.&lt;br /&gt;Yet</li>
            <li>But if you need a guard that is solid and a good value then I&#x27;d recommend these.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product and because of the reviews was encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s better for their bottom line, but not so much for me.</li>
            <li>I tried fitting it three times without being able to obtain a proper fit.</li>
            <li>Drop it in boiling water; let cool; insert to mold and wear.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost me much.</li>
            <li>in summary: cheap, sturdy alternative to a custom nightguard, but obviously it&#x27;s not as thin and comfortable as a custom fit one.</li>
            <li>Placed it on a plate to cool for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>It really could not be better.  </li>
            <li>While fitting, I noticed it didnt have as much material to mold to my outer and inside of my teerh.  </li>
            <li>I love them so much, although I have to keep re-purchasing because I somehow lose them.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not bad...</li>
            <li>Not bad for an over the counter product though...</li>
            <li>The thing was easy to soften, but I found the guard itself to be too large to fit in and stay in my mouth at night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to follow the instructions to the letter AND to follow them very quickly to get a good fit, especially when the guard first comes out of the hot water and the bite channel is malleable.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, good price, new condition.</li>
            <li>This nightguard was easy to mold and they fit very well.</li>
            <li>It makes no sense to me why this product doesn&#x27;t come with a huge warning right on the front of the box.</li>
            <li>I can never get this mouth guard to fit right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years, if you fit it right, there aren&#x27;t any problems with it staying in place all night.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get the fit right and get it to stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Should have stayed with the 1st fit even though it wasn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get it to fit right, after 4 times I just gave up</li>
            <li>how am i supposed to get it to fit right?  </li>
            <li>I tried remolding it over and over and it just never wanted to fit right</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to get the right fit and used the guard for one night.  </li>
            <li>I never got this to fit right.  </li>
            <li>fit right.</li>
            <li>IF you get the fit right.</li>
            <li>It was easy to re-fit the mouth guard after I messed up on the first try.</li>
            <li>It is very large, and even after boiling it and shaping it to my teeth, I felt that it didn&#x27;t fit me.</li>
            <li>last one lasted forever, great price, easy fit, comfortable, simple</li>
            <li>other issues I&#x27;ve experienced is aching teeth</li>
            <li>It seems from the reviews that it works great for some people &amp; doesn&#x27;t work for other people.  </li>
            <li>This product is the most comfortable and natural mouth guard I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best biteguard I&#x27;ve found, after trying 5 different versions from different manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>Many did not have enough material on the sides and wouldn&#x27;t grip my molars to keep the guard attached to my top teeth.</li>
            <li>Before wearing a nightguard I&#x27;d be lucky going 2 nights in a row without waking up with a headache.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li>you could get a away with a quick toothbrush scrubbing of the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I wore it the first night and thought ok this is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>I made three attempts at molding it to fit my teeth but still could not get quite what I would call a fit that anyone could reasonably get used to .  </li>
            <li>They last me about a year, and at this price it&#x27;ll take many many years before I reach $500.</li>
            <li>, you will love this, takes a few nights to break it in but its good</li>
            <li>so it wears out quickly.</li>
            <li>I spent about an hour sizing and resizing this and never got a good fit.  </li>
            <li>It was easy enough to mold it using the hot water, but it really wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, so glad I found it</li>
            <li>This plastic is much softer and has more shock absorption, but I still ground right through it.</li>
            <li>My dentist relatives suggest that these tend to be easier to get right, because if a top night guard doesn&#x27;t fit right, it starts moving around the bones in your head and has more potential to cause jaw problems and headaches.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more comfortable than the first because the guard doesn&#x27;t go up that high.</li>
            <li>I used it anyway, which just led to my jaw hurting more than it normally does when I wake up.</li>
            <li>You do have to do a lot of pressing on the guard while molding it to make sure you end up with a secure fit around your back teeth and the roof of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>This may be a great product for average size humans, but if you have an ogre head like I do, it may be too small/narrow.  </li>
            <li>For a person with Trigeminal Neuralgia is a cheap option, and a good option, but is better no wait to late with the problem for get one of this.</li>
            <li>I tried other mouth guards, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, easy to mold yourself and at night its easy to forget its in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is however super functional, easy to mold and really does help.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s particularly choke-on-able and even though I followed the instructions to the absolute letter, even though I tried it 3 times in about 30 minutes (which it clearly states you can do by re-boiling and re-molding if the first fit isn&#x27;t great)</li>
            <li>The price here is about half of what you find at Walmart, so for that it is great.</li>
            <li>As others have noted it is not quite easy to fit, so you will most likely ruin the first one learning.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and much better and a hell of a lot cheaper than the one my dentist made for me when I first needed to wear these guards at night.</li>
            <li>You shipped it fast and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this first in 2011.  </li>
            <li>I have even had a number of occlusion plates made at the dentist,which I have begun to chew through on the first night!</li>
            <li>suspected that there had to be a cheaper (much cheaper) version that worked like my old high school football teeth guards: boil and bite into it for a good fit.</li>
            <li>The first three times I tried to fit it - it didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>First off, it took 3 times before I could get the fit right.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions EXACTLY, and the fit was just right.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars except that the fitting process can be tricky and I normally have to do it twice before I get it right.</li>
            <li>Fitting it was fairly easy although it did take us a second attempt.</li>
            <li>The custom fitting process is well described and easy to follow (similar to the dozens of mouth guards</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super petite and was worried that the night guard would be too big, but it fit perfectly with little adjustments.</li>
            <li>If you follow the (easy) directions, you&#x27;ll mold the mouth guard to fit securely on your teeth to where they won&#x27;t fall off if you open your mouth.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine but really flimsy.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve tried a few nighttime mouth guard brands before, most notably the Dentek Pro Sleep Easy Dental Guard.  </li>
            <li>It worked great at night, no trouble breathing or closing my mouth (make sure you press front into front teeth slightly when forming it).</li>
            <li>Once I got a good tight fit</li>
            <li>If you take a little time to learn the process and learn what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish, before you start boiling the water and melting the bite mold, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This one is tougher which is great, but I look a little like a football player at bedtime.</li>
            <li>just great cost is little high&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fit&#x27;s fine when I go to bed, but loosens up as I sleep, then falls completely out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>The idea might be good but only a certain part of the guard is moldable to your mouth.</li>
            <li>you just have to reheat and then after fitting to your teeth, take it out and squeeze the side a little to make it fit more snug.</li>
            <li>The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced is easily and quickly fitted exactly to my mouth, directions are clear and concise, and I am able to use it every night without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>Two tips can help a lot in getting a good fit- to make sure the front edge of the guard is as close as possible to the teeth, and to push up hard with your thumbs, as the provided illustration suggests, on the back in order to ensure a good fit that doesn&#x27;t either push out your front lip or keep your mouth agape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the fit and function of this sleeping mouth guard.</li>
            <li>Working very well, fits comfortably within my mouth, and stays in place overnight.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit quite as well as the ones that my dentist makes, but it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>much too bulky to be comfortable; it made me gag.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions, but didn&#x27;t fit very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not round like a mouth is supposed to be, it&#x27;s more V shaped.</li>
            <li>Your jaw health is worth a visit to the dentist-</li>
            <li>I think I will try to have a professional one made and bite the bullet on costs to have a more restful sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, and I can sleep better using it than a one from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Was it worth the trade off?</li>
            <li>and whether or not it&#x27;s safe to chew on soft plastic every night for years on end.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s comfortable, I was likely to wear it more often in the beginning</li>
            <li>I had to boil this several times before I was able to get a fit that worked.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find how many of my co-workers use dental protectors.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it much more than that unless your grinding is quite modest.</li>
            <li>I really think it worked best when I left it in the latter location.</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I used this product for awhile and is OK but not as nearly as comfortable as the custom fitted one I later got from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Stays in place well, seems durable ( two weeks use so far), and okay for speaking.</li>
            <li>The front lip of this appliance is absurdly narrow and if you don&#x27;t get it to fit perfectly, your bite will be off and it will screw up your mouth possibly causing TMJ.</li>
            <li>Professionally made night guards are pricey, but there is a reason - they work, they fit and they will save your teeth!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep ordering when needed, because the comfort is worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I got my&#x27;s money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>After that it definitely did work effectively with clenching.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size to stop me from grinding and not be so annoyed during the night that I spit it out.</li>
            <li>Me, my dentist, and my perio  agree it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So far, it is a much better value.</li>
            <li>It stills seems a bit overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it does cost a fraction of what the dentist charges, and it does work so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t get warm enough.  </li>
            <li>(Can you actually drown in your own saliva?</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s a much better fit vs. prior nighttime mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying for around $20.</li>
            <li>well worth it to protect your teeth from the damage of night grinding.</li>
            <li>It has however relieved some of the jaw pain that I was experiencing each morning from my night grinding, and that has made it worth it.</li>
            <li>I finally did it and am satisfied with the fit and the fact that it prevents teeth grinding.  </li>
            <li>so far, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews and decided it was worth a try for the money.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick to my mouth though at night, it ends up in the middle of my teeth, but in any case its effective and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried twice to complain on their own website and it goes to a blank screen.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any success in the 3 times</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried another one from Amazon that comes with a plastic tray to aid in fitting it to ones mouth and that one has been far easier to get working though it has had its problems as well.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Better than the old model, as it&#x27;s thinner.</li>
            <li>It stays in place and kind of &#x27;sticks&#x27; to my upper teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely made, and will last.  </li>
            <li>I recently started grinding my teeth/clenching at night (stress, I&#x27;m sure of it) and decided to get one of these sexy mouth guards I have heard so much about.</li>
            <li>I found the instructions very helpful, but also found that I was happy that I followed them carefully.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that it is a temporary product; it will wear out after a couple months, but for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it to me.</li>
            <li>#34;How is that going to fit my mouth?&amp;#34; It didn&#x27;t come anywhere close to fitting properly</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is much smaller and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is definitely easy and I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Might as well just save up for the real thing, as if this thing doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>Other than that, as I said earlier great fit and comfortable.</li>
            <li>and she was able to remold my original NTI so that I could wear it again and after only two nights with my NTI-</li>
            <li>a cheap night guard, this little guy does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>This really must be heated in hot water for a good fit, it took me two tries</li>
            <li>Easy to shape to your own mouth, takes less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>THey last  a long time and fit great.  </li>
            <li>And the funny thing is that I didn&#x27;t perform the forming process 100% correctly so the next Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard I buy will probably feel even more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Given the current price it&#x27;s probably a good idea to replace with a new one more frequently.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It falls right out.  </li>
            <li>I made an appointment right after trying this.</li>
            <li>so I bought this product because the price was right.</li>
            <li>right (or screw up the process).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have remolded it about four times, and I just can&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li>It works but didn&#x27;t mold quite right and falls out of my mouth while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I started wearing it right away.</li>
            <li>That is what I need and price is right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bulky &amp; my mouth doesn&#x27;t close right because of it&#x27;s bulk.  </li>
            <li>Feels like it fits right, but won&#x27;t stay on my teeth.</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>unless or until i can get the ones i have to work right.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Falls right out no matter</li>
            <li>The reason I give it 2 stars instead of just one is that it works as promised--if done right</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I have severe TMJ to the point that I could no longer eat without clicking, pain and dislocation of my jaw, right side.</li>
            <li>boiling process that you have to go through, however, I didn&#x27;t get quite right at first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it get it just right.  </li>
            <li>His receptionist recommended this, and I&#x27;m right grateful.</li>
            <li>and it still wasn&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li>For the money, it is the right product..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really can&#x27;t go in much more detail other than that, it feels pretty good quality, the fit has stayed exact for over two weeks, definitely worth it if you grind your teeth, or have jaw pain, or possibly both like me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can say anything positive about this product!</li>
            <li>I also had to call the Manufacturer direct once when I had a problem with the fitting, and they were very helpful, resolving the problem quickly.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the excess saliva issue was overwhelming since I&#x27;m more prone to salivating than the average person (according to my dentist and orthodontist).</li>
            <li>Was not able to get a good fit.</li>
            <li>Just too small for a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>I went with a Sleep Right guard that has a small band on the front portion of the teeth (doesn&#x27;t wrap all the way around all the teeth - just on the molars) and that worked great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mold to my teeth by following the detailed directions included.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit, just a simple boil and bite like any sports mouth guard.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last forever, but they are comfortable and easy to mold.</li>
            <li>doesnt mold easy &amp; even then wont fit well, especially with the front teeth</li>
            <li>bought this because I was grinding my teeth and my teeth were becoming sensitive.  </li>
            <li>But, shortly after I decided to retire my $425 dentist fitted rigid plastic night guard that no longer fit as good and the plastic too rigid for my grinding.&lt;br /&gt;After these 9 years I am finally beginning to wear this one out.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered on time, was much cheaper than professional nightguards, but from another side it does not fit my jaw perfectly.</li>
            <li>Yes, I clench/grind heavily, so for this Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard Advance to work is amazing to me!  </li>
            <li>Easy to mold, comfortable to wear, easily cleaned with half a denture cleaner tab.</li>
            <li>But My Wife says that the very first night that I almost stopped snoring, ( I never Snore), and My jaw muscles are starting to feel better in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for your guard..</li>
            <li>Sleeping with a guard is still not fun, but this one is just as good as the dentist&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>It is tricky to fit, and I think I could have done a better job on that, but it still doesn&#x27;t come loose, and I haven&#x27;t even begun to chew through it after a couple of weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same pair, still going strong!</li>
            <li>The best fit so far for a small adult mouth.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get it right the first or fifth time, you can start over again, no need to throw it out and buy another one.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend buying this as a cheaper option!</li>
            <li>And, if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, you can heat it up and try again.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get the bite quite right on the first try, you can even re-do it.</li>
            <li>It will work if you have an assistant to exactly time each step, and press everything just right.</li>
            <li>Tried it the first night, don&#x27;t think I got set right for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>How many hours do I have to bite this thing for how many months everyday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably good to note that I&#x27;m an adult female with a semi-narrow jaw line.</li>
            <li>It fit much better, had a harder bottom, and you boiled it.  </li>
            <li>I got it quickly from Amazon, took a couple of minutes to read the instructions, and got ready to do it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to boil them multiple times to get them to fit, but it does eventually fit.</li>
            <li>And this guard really helps me at a tremendously lower price than getting one from a dentist.</li>
            <li>Directions are clear and easy to follow to mold to mouth.</li>
            <li>The good news was Amazon has the guard at half the price.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see much difference in fit and feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than the one my dentist sells, is more comfortable, and lasts about as long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to redo the fitting twice to get it right despite following the instructions to the letter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now to be honest I did wake up one morning with the guard loose</li>
            <li>Not easy to form to teeth, better off buying one that does not require fitting to mouth.</li>
            <li>Its not bulky like other ones and not super thin like its the perfect size and its super easy to mold to your own teeth!</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>i took the other poster&#x27;s advice and molded it to my bottom teeth, and it feels more secure that way.  </li>
            <li>Was easy to fit as advertised but final apparatus is very bulky.</li>
            <li>I expect this is because the mold is more important and trickier due to the lack of bulk of the guard.</li>
            <li>The fitting process takes less than 10 minutes and once complete, the protector goes in and stays in place nicely.</li>
            <li>I have always had a teeth grinding problem at night and recently it because severe to the point where my some of my teeth were chipping &#x3D;[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The molding of the product was super easy.</li>
            <li>instructions were pretty clear, although I didnt get a good tight fit the first time</li>
            <li>If you need a night guard, I recommend just finding a way to get a professional one, there is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I cashed in the certificate for a replacement at a local store but haven&#x27;t tried fitting the replacement protector yet.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>I went back to my dentist and ordered a custom nightguard, which I love.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that I havent been able to fall asleep with it in.</li>
            <li>It only wraps around your top teeth but not your front ones.</li>
            <li>you have TMJ, discuss this product with your dentist first.</li>
            <li>I sleep with an upper and lower now, and this works much better for me than the double-biteguard, which always leaves my gums swollen and hurting by morning.</li>
            <li>Tossed the guard the first week.</li>
            <li>Once you prep to have it mold to your mouth and place it into your mouth the first time.</li>
            <li>I have been told that sounds similar to a child violently striking a bow against a violin string</li>
            <li>Doctor said all my teeth had shifted and that the only touching teeth were my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant the first night I used it.  </li>
            <li>: Though the instructions say that this is for your top teeth only, I made a bottom night guard.</li>
            <li>First night I tried the Grind Guard and could not close my mouth well.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and considering that it wasn&#x27;t my first time molding a night guard</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>, no discomfort at first i kept messing with it</li>
            <li>When the first one fell apart, I purchased another one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I did exactly as the instructions said &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t mold.</li>
            <li>I rinse the guard every morning when I wake up with some hot water and put it in its case.</li>
            <li>so I had to dunk it again in the hot water and start over.</li>
            <li>The first night was kind of rough.</li>
            <li>Second night went better.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions pretty close</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to refer back to them when going through the fitting process.  </li>
            <li>However, none of the more recent (2015) reviews were.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>just had my first crown done just before I got this guard.</li>

            <li>I AM NOW WEARING MY FIRST  DOCTORS NIGHT GUARD FOR GRINDING TEETH.</li>
            <li>and I sure didn&#x27;t want to spend another several hundred to replace it.</li>
            <li>and I am waking up w/out headaches for the first time in</li>
            <li>but this is THE ONLY ONE that stays put and has protected my teeth through many years now.</li>
            <li>so you have the directions to refer to when you need to dunk this thing in the hot water again to re-seat it in against your teeth).</li>
            <li>I would like to try to remold it up higher in the front in the hopes of thinning it out.</li>
            <li>(but, I don&#x27;t really snore!)</li>
            <li>The old saying is you pay cheap</li>
            <li>so far i dont feel any pain with my custom fit.</li>
            <li>After a week or two of wearing this, I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel!</li>
            <li>There was some difficulty fitting it forward enough.  </li>
            <li>I am Fire Fighter, Married, Mom of 4...</li>
            <li>well, the fitting is the same - boil and bite.</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just molded my second, and have 3 more or order just in case.</li>
            <li>I tend to sleep more with my mouth open as a result of using it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m guessing this product is for light grinders looking to avoid gum recession not heavy grinders doing damage control</li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions *exactly</li>
            <li>I actually sanded the excess on a belt sander and it is better.</li>
            <li>The first over the counter night brace that did the job like a professionionaly fitted night brace.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>followed the directions EXACTLY</li>
            <li>The fitting process was simple.</li>
            <li>A portion hung off my back molars, and I was hoping for something that would allow my teeth to slide more as I slept to relieve the torque that can occur with teeth clenching.</li>
            <li>Actually this fits better than the one I paid $350</li>
            <li>Amazon has them so much cheaper (at $16) than $35 at CVS!  </li>
            <li>Follow the instructions exactly, and read them in advance.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure not to let the mouthguard touch anything but your fingers when it is sticky and melty inside, or the inner goo will stick and stretch.</li>
            <li>This product really helped me to save my teeth!</li>
            <li>* Pretty sturdy case&lt;br /</li>
            <li>my first breaks down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and don&#x27;t understand why it feels so bulky.</li>
            <li>Laying in bed the first night i thought:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went in the trash after the first week.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and don&#x27;t walk up with headaches and face pain if I remember to put this in.</li>
            <li>(I know the dentist guard is a lot of--too much-- $$$!)</li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t gonna last me probably more than a year.</li>
            <li>We placed the mouth guard in hot water to soften so she could mold it in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Out of desperation I tried this one &amp; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I was now more determined to try to sleep with this, or that this one is softer than the dentists one, but I was able to fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>The first night it felt too bulky &amp; I woke up with a headache.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the first time I set it, but just reheated in a mug and fine-tuned it.</li>
            <li>I tried this over the counter guard first.  </li>
            <li>However, I have gone back to the old one because the fit is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Boiling then form the guard on my teeth was not difficult.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this nightguard numerous times, and have been satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>After the first night of wearing it, I fully anticipated that I would pull it out in my sleep and find it on the floor.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like me or being softened in hot water.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this item when I first started using it, and I&#x27;m still not entirely sold.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do - protect your teeth from nighttime grinding.</li>
            <li>Also, it is still hot after you have waited the instructed 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>We followed the directions exactly and it just kept falling out of my husbands mouth.</li>
            <li>I tried to make this work but after fitting it several times, I would wake up in the morning thinking my teeth were going to fall out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bulky as compared to the one you get in the dentists office and thinner too I bit through it on first night.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve tried, but couldn&#x27;t imagine having to wear each night.</li>
            <li>I clench my teeth at night which causes severe neck and head aches upon waking and this was the cheap alternative to getting a professional mouth guard made.</li>
            <li>After following the instructions, I was able to mold the mouth guard to my teeth and use it, without the night drooling.</li>
            <li>but after the first night, the palate part of the guard molded to the shape of the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li>It fell out the first night (getting used to it), but after that, no problem.</li>
            <li>I mangled the first one</li>
            <li>Sure beats the $800 estimate my dentist have me for a night guard that does the same thing.</li>
            <li>exactly that it comes with</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind it!</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely recommend this to any of my friends!</li>
            <li>But it works well and one always change the shape using hot water.</li>
            <li>My first attempt to remedy this was by getting a custom made night guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li>(I did buy my first two from the dentist.. about $350 each.)  </li>
            <li>No wonder the real thing costs over $300!</li>

            <li>Second try may have been better.</li>
            <li>I Followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>I first thought this product wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The reason I mention it is the extra \\&quot;mold\\&quot; material that is placed on the roof of your mouth while you \\&quot;suck/vacuum/bite\\&quot; in the process makes the guard fit really well and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>My first thought however upon opening the box was &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this was my first time sleeping with a dental guard, I felt like it took a couple of weeks for me to get used to it throughout the night.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t expect this to hold up as well as it has.</li>
            <li>Still, I like the mix of soft fit with a tougher bottom and switching out every 6 months as they recommend is working well for me.</li>
            <li>stopped using this as soon as a was able to visit a Dentist for a proper night guard.</li>
            <li>Really?!?  </li>
            <li>Quite frankly -- and I&#x27;m not being facetious or melodramatic -- I&#x27;d recommend that anyone thinking about buying this should first try a $2 mouth guard like high-school football players use.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Dentists charge an arm and a leg to fit the mouth guard professionally.  </li>
            <li>I lost the first one..</li>
            <li>Stays in place all night, and is not difficult to mold.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one first.  </li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly and</li>
            <li>This is my first one</li>
            <li>They only last about 6 months for me, but they&#x27;re easy to fit and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;t less bulky and more comfortable than I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Wished they put less gel inside to accommodate for the expansion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is cheap and works ok for my mouth.</li>
            <li>You can either do the quick fit method using the microwave or use the traditional method using a saucepan on the stovetop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The primary difference is that it contains less material which is supposed to be better.</li>
            <li>Be very precise when you shape these to fit your teeth, make sure the front two teeth are at the very edge and after you bite down and suck in use your fingers to further mold the sides.</li>
            <li>Despite following the directions very carefully, I could not get a good fit.</li>
            <li>Took numerous attempts to get a decent fit and after that, it still didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>The ideal guard would be soft on top and bottom with the hard piece in the middle.</li>
            <li>The night guard is very hard to get a good fit.  </li>
            <li>My old one, lost recently, was the cheaper Rite Aid Nite protector which only had the soft part and worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to make, following the directions, though it did take three times until I got it just right.</li>
            <li>Like anything, it might take a little getting used to, but I have to admit it is way more comfortable than I could have ever imagined.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this as a spare for my professionally made night guard in case I lost it.</li>
            <li>my original at myrtle beach a month ago ( was a year old).</li>
            <li>wore it for 1 week and stopped because I became more convinced that the flat bottom of it is damaging/going to damage my jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Maybe other reviewers just did their own thing and didn&#x27;t follow the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works its new came quick  </li>
            <li>Also, cut at an angle so the mouth guard is at a nice \\&quot;slope\\&quot; shape instead straight, rough cut off.  </li>
            <li>Easy instructions to boil in a small pot of water, cool, and fit into the mouth.</li>
            <li>If you notice any kind of discomfort or some odd sensations while using this, I&#x27;d sincerely question the product and potentially inquire with your dentist or the company if you should even be using this one.</li>
            <li>Make sure read the instructions very well before starting the process.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these things from cvs for way more than it is on amazon because i was starting to realize how much i grind my teeth at night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using one of these for over a year now, and it&#x27;s still good, but starting to deteriorate from my regular grinding and clenching in my sleep.</li>
            <li>I know that your dentist mouth guard is much more expensive but the cost can always be negotiated and you will get a custom fit product and most dentist will adjust them as many times are necessary.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, it has gotten more comfortable</li>
            <li>If your mouth is narrow then I suppose it will fit ok</li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;ll try the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version which appears to be all hard plastic, or if I&#x27;ll try another brand.right, because if a top night guard doesn&#x27;t fit right, it starts moving around the bones in your head and has more potential to cause jaw problems and headaches.</li>
            <li>If the mold is too large for your mouth, snip off the ends with a pair of scissors and dip it in hot water to soften the edges.</li>
            <li>these definitely won&#x27;t fit as tight as custom one&#x27;s made at a dentist office which sit right up to my gum-line, but they&#x27;re good enough especially given the tremendous cost savings!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a high success rate and using it nightly, lasted about 3 months before feeling the need to replace it.  </li>
            <li>it fits better &amp; more easily than other brands, and I notice it less.  </li>
            <li>biggest positive about this product is the durability.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty much as well as I could expect for an inexpensive, DIY solution.</li>
            <li>None of the other ones would fit securely on our teeth.  </li>
            <li>Well-made videos work better than long instructions.</li>
            <li>No More dental night protector to work far better, far more comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter and while still soft, I spent a minute or so pushing it up around my teeth with my fingers for a better fit.</li>
            <li>Considering you can usually find this on Amazon for under $20, it is a good deal and</li>
            <li>The key with this one is to be very, very careful during the fitting- be sure to follow the directions exactly as listed.</li>
            <li>Do not expect this to \\&quot;mold\\&quot; on its own if you just bite down on it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty comfortable to  wear as long as you fit it properly, and if you can&#x27;t fit it properly they have some kind of money back guarantee, but I&#x27;ve never had to use the guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Over time, if you are as enthusiastic a chewer as I am, your teeth start to make their way down through the cushion.</li>
            <li>It was easy to mold and fit nicely, however I have a very small mouth and the actual width of the tray could not be made narrower with molding.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t enough height to keep it nestled on to my top teeth, even though I know I couldn&#x27;t have gotten a much closer fit from the inner, malleable material.</li>
            <li>The directions were easy to follow and the process was pretty simple, worked just fine without the wooden stick FYI.</li>
            <li>Have tried several similar products , all for same use, and this one is, by far, the best</li>
            <li>But not as comfortable as professionally created night guards by dentists, tho the price is not that much high.</li>
            <li>It has very little getting in the way in the front, which is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The end fit leaves your front teeth mostly exposed in front, so your upper lip lies comfortably flat.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to custom fit, but it is too tight.</li>
            <li>The fitting was never snug and would not stay in my mouth for very long once I fell asleep before falling out.</li>
            <li>So she tells me that she really wants me to have one because I really need it, and is willing to sell it to me for her cost, around $350.  </li>
            <li>This one is easy to use ( if you&#x27;ve ever had to boil and form a mouthguard for sports before, this works the same way), and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like i</li>
            <li>Was easy enough to find them online.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to mold.</li>
            <li>I tried it - had to search, btw, could NOT find in wal-mart/Pharmore/rite-aid etc - but amazon saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One easy boil/mold later, and I had an easy-to-wear &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; piece.</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to mold</li>
            <li>I ordered this product as a quick and inexpensive alternative to a professional bite guard provided by my dentist.</li>
            <li>After following instructions, I got the device to fit pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The directions are simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to mold.  </li>
            <li>Also easy to reform the mold multiple times if mistakes are made.</li>
            <li>(if you follow the instructions) and strong enough for the job.</li>
            <li>after molding it for the second attempt, and biting it strong for a minute, the thinner part (the corner of the mouth guard) broke and already got a hole.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for my teeth grinding and it doesn&#x27;t feel like too large of an object to breath or anything.</li>
            <li>However, the guard is fairly large and I just can&#x27;t sleep with it in because of that.  </li>
            <li>After molding and remolding, this night guard is quite large and uncomfortale.</li>
            <li>I am 6 foot and 250lbs with a fairly large mouth.</li>
            <li>my jaw size (otherwise I&#x27;m a large person).  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is if you mess up the molding process beyond repair there&#x27;s a number you can call on the instruction booklet</li>
            <li>I do like this nightguard, it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of a dentists and is softer and more comfortable in the mouth,they say they don&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li>(always kept fitting loose).</li>
            <li>This guard is much lighter and smaller than a sports guard so it easy to sleep with it in over night.</li>
            <li>is fine) and then popped back into your mouth.</li>
            <li>Way less bulky, and far more comfortable.</li>
            <li>With this particular item you will heat up in hot water and form it to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>A realistic thing would be to cover all the teeth, including the wisdom teeth!</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend you try this product, it really does work.</li>
            <li>The other product reviews mentioning the importance of fitting the guard to the exact instructions were very helpful</li>
            <li>This item is adjustable and comes with it&#x27;s own little case.</li>
            <li>The instructions say if you are unsuccessful the first time, you can put it back in the hot water, reheat it and wait for it to cool and shape it back to the original shape with your fingers.  </li>
            <li>hard for me to make a good mold</li>
            <li>really hard to get it to fit to your teeth and then be able to sleep with it.</li>
            <li>I tried a few others and feel like I would choke on them in my sleep since they aren&#x27;t secure, or comfortable.</li>
            <li>This thing is huge and I wasn&#x27;t used to a big piece of plastic in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I tried to reshape it following the directions but it didn&#x27;t make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I  really need it for my bottom teeth, so that is what I took the impression of.</li>
            <li>Then I called the manufacturer, per the instructions, and they mailed me a certificate for a free replacement, which arrived about a week later.  </li>
            <li>Gets grungy after 6 months but inexpensive enough to ditch and fit another.</li>
            <li>and I have found them to be really helpful when trying to curb my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grind as much.</li>
            <li>and it seems very durable,</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all you really need because the thickness is like a bumper where you can&#x27;t close your mouth or clench to grind.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;m not grinding too much in my sleep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fitting is fairly straight forward and just takes about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>No way I&#x27;m paying that much for a hunk of plastic.  </li>
            <li>I carefully followed the fitting instructions found inside the box.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than having one made by your dentist.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is why the dentists charge big bucks to properly fit their TMJ patients with guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this it!</li>
            <li>So, I sent a message via their website and a second mouthpiece arrived at my door within the week with a kindly worded letter offering any assistance (short of someone coming to my house and putting it in my mouth for me, haha)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much again</li>
            <li>He suggested that it would be very harmful to my teeth over time.</li>
            <li>This just isn&#x27;t comfortable enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compared to that at pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to pay for it.</li>
            <li>This mouth guard works very well.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a cheaper night guard to see if it even worked before spending so much money at the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really stay in place.</li>
            <li>There seems to be too much material to work it correctly, and to make it stay in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I really miss it if I don&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li>the sucking is supposed to do is beyond me), counted to thirty like the directions say, and then molded it with my fingers as much as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not really a bother most of the time.</li>
            <li>It does not form to my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Well, this is really all the comfort I need.</li>
            <li>I probably have a smaller mouth and this fits comfortably.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if I ever end up chewing through it, but so far well well worth it</li>
            <li>The third time, it fit like a charm.</li>
            <li>It wants to float.</li>
            <li>This really shouldn&#x27;t be considered an anti-snoring device AT ALL.</li>
            <li>I watched a bunch of youtube tutorials and tried several times to get this thing to work, but it just didn&#x27;t fit my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I mold it to fit, and have even tried to alter it to be bigger, but nothing</li>
            <li>If you form the mouthguard properly to your teeth, it should suction into your mouth and fit snugly while sleeping.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive mouth guard that prevents grinding of the teeth at night.</li>
            <li>but the inconvenience of the way it felt and it coming out every night was too much for me.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>The price is fairly cheap for the potential amount of relief</li>
            <li>The price is fairly cheap for the potential amount of relief it could bring!</li>
            <li>Might fit people with larger choppers.</li>
            <li>My grinding problem is not severe, so I tried a cheepie ($8)night guard which is really an athletic mouth guard, but it was too bulky.  </li>
            <li>I had forgotten my custom night gaurd at home and need something fast.</li>
            <li>I have sleep apnea and was really apprehensive about using one of these</li>
            <li>When I heard about the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard and saw how reasonably priced it was, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>My dentist implored me to please start wearing a guard soon after the crown was put in so that I would not put so much pressure on it.</li>
            <li>My dentist implored me to please start wearing a guard soon after the crown was put in so that I would not put so much pressure on it.</li>
            <li>BUT IT DOES WORK REALLY</li>
            <li>IT HAS HELPED MY TEETH ALL READY.</li>
            <li>The fit of this nightguard is similar to others I have tried OTC meaning it is a bit bulky.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten a night guard from the dentist because the price is way too much</li>
            <li>Cheap night guards like this could end up costing you thousands in dental bills later.</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than going to the dentist to have a mouth guard made.  </li>
            <li>Very bulky.  </li>
            <li>But the thing can be plumped up again (much like fluffing your pillow) in the hot/cold water and putting in your mouth to re-mold the plastic to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>It could be that the initial fit was faulty on my part.</li>
            <li>I really like this night guard because it has some give.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve removed it, reheated it, tried squeezing the guard together with my fingers to make a smaller fit, and it just won&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li>The guard did prevent me from grinding my teeth, but I never could get the gum line smooth enough for long-lasting comfort.</li>
            <li>I have a real problem with grinding my teeth while sleeping.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both wear night guards and tried several options available at CVS.  </li>
            <li>The cost is extremely reasonable for what the product achieves.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Sounds very pedestrian</li>
            <li>This works very well..  </li>
            <li>It really helps curb my snoring habits.  </li>
            <li>Really dries mouth out.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just too much hassle.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i have problems clenching my teeth while sleeping and work really well</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the only OTC night guards we recommend at our office because they are the closest we&#x27;ve found to a custom fit lab made appliance.  </li>
            <li>one does the job, yet is much thinner in front.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t wear this anymore, it causes so much pain.  </li>
            <li>My husband tried to re-form it several times to get it to fit.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand to have it in my mouth for a whole night.</li>
            <li>This was an all-around unsatisfying purchase.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t close my mouth really</li>
            <li>This is really a glorified mouthguard.  </li>
            <li>I just followed the directions very closely.  </li>
            <li>It took two times for me to fit it correctly - not a big deal.</li>
            <li>so I should really use it I guess.</li>
            <li>Having worn a mouth guard 40 some years ago, I discovered they really haven&#x27;t improved much on the boil in water/ form in you</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>And considering my dentist wants $300 to make a guard, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the reviewers who are having issues with fit, didn&#x27;t follow the instructions properly and/or didn&#x27;t use a mirror?</li>
            <li>Unless you are some sort of space wizard genius you are not going to fit this thing properly.</li>
            <li>The latter are comfortable, but don&#x27;t get the job done</li>
            <li>Fits really well.</li>
            <li>Nothing compared to getting a real night guard fitted by the dentist.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for this to work</li>
            <li>so I absolutely need these to cushion my teeth when I sleep.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found it to fall out or have any problems really.</li>
            <li>it STILL doesnt fit properly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for someone who hasn&#x27;t much money.</li>
            <li>how much for another one?</li>
            <li>So feels very unnatural and also makes me drool.</li>
            <li>But I am very thankful to whomever made this because I have no dental insurance</li>
            <li>I LOVE that the bottom of the guard is of a harder material, so</li>
            <li>Sometimes when there&#x27;s too much stress in work.</li>
            <li>so I cleaned it really well before I did anything with it.</li>
            <li>Like many of you, I spent hundred of dollars on fancy smancy guards.</li>
            <li>Developing it was not too much of a problem, however I did have to reheat it once or twice.</li>
            <li>Its way to big for my mouth and doesn&#x27;t fit well at all.</li>
            <li>so ultimately I still prefer a custom fit night guard</li>
            <li>The reason I got this over-the-counter product is because I asked my dentist how much it would be for a custom one.</li>
            <li>fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Better off just paying the extra and getting custom fit ones from your dentist.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a real solution, go to the dentist and get fitted.</li>
            <li>It is simple to customize the fit.</li>
            <li>The dentist wants me to wear a night guard and to have one made professionly his cost was $400.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>So, its&#x27; very uncomfortabel to sleep; I cannot fall asleep with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This night guard is very tricky to mold.</li>
            <li>Overall it still feels comfortable in my mouth when I sleep.</li>
            <li>They need a lot of trimming to be comfortable, but once they are done, they last awhile.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get comfortable with my mouth propped open all night.</li>
            <li>This nightguard really helped me to stop grinding my teeth while I sleep.  </li>
            <li>This has been really helpful.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I wondered if the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; really was going to apply here...</li>
            <li>No discomfort when I have it on yet it securely attaches onto my upper teeth.</li>
            <li>You will have just as much luck with an athletic mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t trim it very well to form</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting too much compared with a custom guard.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t really mold well around my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and it feels as comfortable as possible and stays in place.  </li>
            <li>This one works really well</li>
            <li>but mine is wearing really well.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow directions carefully.</li>
            <li>So far, it rarely has fallen out at night, and all the grinding has stopped.  </li>
            <li>Really want to make it work</li>
            <li>However, for the price and quality this is not that much of an issue.</li>
            <li>Its really the closest thing to not having anything in your mouth.</li>
            <li>purchased this 2nd one attempting to keep the guard far forward to attempt to get more material in front of my teeth with no results.  </li>
            <li>I have had many which have been replaced simply because they were old.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t hurt my jaw and after a few days it healed up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Difficult to get a really good fit.</li>
            <li>The fit was not perfect but good for the cost versus custom made night guard.</li>
            <li>I needed to find a new one very fast</li>
            <li>This was fine for the first 5-6 days, but the form became loose and allowed for movement, which rendered the unit ineffective.</li>
            <li>guard was easy to fit and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>My family is full of dentists, but I live too far away for any of them to make me a night guard and get it adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did take 2 tries to get the right fit</li>
            <li>I honestly did not have any trouble fitting the mouth guard like some other reviewers commented.</li>
            <li>This saves me thousands of dollars on crown replacements and root canals, not to mention just plain keeping my own teeth.</li>
            <li>I might as well just pay my dentist $175 to make sure it fits correctly and to my teeth,as I could spend as much trying all of these other ones.</li>
            <li>These mouthguards work the best for me, after trying at least three other brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the older \\&quot;classic\\&quot; large has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>in All this guard provided more support and protection than the other (over the counter) ones I have tried</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS</li>
            <li>i used my other one foe more than a year before it started falling apart.</li>
            <li>It worked without us having to deform the guard back to its original shape.</li>
            <li>This one fits snugly more than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>That is simply way more than I would be willing to spend, especially for something that is made for wear and tear (and which I will have to replace who knows</li>
            <li>Then again, I have a very small mouth, so the way mine turned out may just be as good as it&#x27;s going to get for a small-mouthed person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  then took a knife &amp; whittled down the excess plastic at the back which made it considerably more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 7 other brands over the past decade and nothing comes close to this easy to mold, easy to use and easy to keep (in its storage box).</li>
            <li>I had trouble with fitting it even though I followed the instructions EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li>it is not good for folks who suffer from TMJ, would have been great if that was spelled out clearly.</li>
            <li>I use a tooth brush and some paste to clean it and occasionally use denture cleaner.</li>
            <li>It requires daily Efferdent treatments to clean it up.  </li>
            <li>This has a lot of cushioning for the gums, which is nice, but ultimately it results in a much bulkier mouthguard than the Oral B professional slim fit nighttime dental guard, which I prefer (not available on Amazon at this time).</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t remember how many years I kept my first one, but it was quite a few.</li>
            <li>I did not get the hot-water timing thing down good because the final product was a flabby piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li>I realize, though, that if it went back too much farther it would be uncomfortable for others, so I&#x27;m prepared to accept that sacrifice for the greater teeth-grinders&#x27; good.</li>
            <li>When the TMJ pain starts up again years later, the custom jobs won&#x27;t fit as my teeth have drifted a bit or a new crown</li>
            <li>Fortunately, these tend to last me six months or so, so I can live with some twice-yearly annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time i got the right prodcut, the second I did not.</li>
            <li>The newest version is less bulky, a tad longer in the back which is good for me since I have a lot of teeth</li>
            <li>And it is good enough, I grind my teeth less at night and my jaw is no longer sore when I wake up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, but follow the directions for fitting it very carefully.</li>
            <li>I can only say to give it a try because it may actually fit you and the price is great considering how expensive the custom ones are.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is the fact that I followed the directions to the T and got an amazing fit.</li>
            <li>The device is difficult to get it to fit securely and comfortably.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine anything that fits over my teeth would be comfortable all night long.</li>
            <li>The molding process was difficult and did not produce a secure and comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with time and a bunch of sleepless nights I could get used to it, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me to try.</li>
            <li>Ok product but not worth the money they are selling it for.</li>
            <li>as I do, you may have more issues than the average person in getting ajusted to this night guard.</li>
            <li>as I do, you may have more issues than the average person in getting ajusted to this night guard.</li>
            <li>Maybe this would be better if different sizes were available, one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li>It seems to be thick enough to keep them from touching, but I would feel better about some added length..</li>
            <li>I left a good amount of space to conform around my front teeth, but it was not enough to fully cover (and I don&#x27;t have an oddly giant mouth or anything)</li>
            <li>The inner part is thicker and taller after fitting as it oozes up and around to shape to fit your teeth and a bit of gum.  </li>
            <li>As well the material is pretty soft and within two or three nights my teeth would begin to wear away cuts in the plastic which would then in turn cut my gums</li>
            <li>far as I am concerned the product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product after discovering that I (as well as many other people!)</li>
            <li>A little note, make sure you do not cut too much off.  </li>
            <li>Just need to get the fit right, but the company guarantees that so there is no risk if you mess it up.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to a T.In fact,I read the instructions several times BEFORE having my husband read them out loud, AS I was doing it,to make sure I was following them correctly and exactly.</li>
            <li>I have used at least five other brands and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>This works better and causes less jaw pain than my $800.00 dentist made device.</li>
            <li>But be sure to shop around because often sellers like wmart have comparable products for nearly half the price.</li>
            <li>I actually messed up two or three times and was still able to put it back in the water and re-mold it.</li>
            <li>I replaced the guard again and wore it for a while more, but it left me with the same sensation upon removing it.</li>
            <li>This company used to make an older version called the classic.  </li>
            <li>I went back on line today and paid the extra money for a Den Tec night guard which is more streamlined and lightweight.</li>
            <li>The one I had was older and could not longer be used.  </li>
            <li>I did not know when I got older</li>
            <li>The guard does not get soft enough to fit in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It properly covers more of the back teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely not intended to last more than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It was much too wide and fit</li>
            <li>I got it close enough that I was confident I wouldn&#x27;t choke on it in the middle of the night, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner that older models</li>
            <li>The first time I don&#x27;t think I got it hot enough</li>
            <li>They fit nicely and seem to last a long time unlike other guards he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>You know, like when you open your eyes in the morning and the very first thing you do is groan from the head pain.</li>
            <li>If I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom I tend to take it out, falling back asleep with it in at that point feels a little disruptive, but I assume that&#x27;s still better than nothing, and way better than spending hundreds of dollars at the dentist for something custom made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my fifth attempt at fitting it and it still will not hold tight in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Took several tries (reheating, and pressing back to the original shape) to get the fit right and to get it to stay in place without holding the guard in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My dentist highly recommended this mouth piece.</li>
            <li>Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone that grinds their teeth -</li>
            <li>my teeth are protected at night,no need for those high pricy one.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and will buy it again when the one I have wears out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this night guard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, if you grind your teeth, I highly recommend your get one made from your dentist-</li>
            <li>It took me two tries, and then I ultimately just realized it was as good as I was going to get it because essentially my bite is much longer than than the guard.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this guard.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this nightguard for overnight grinders.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>One of my sides is more like this than the other...and the one that&#x27;s less ideal has a little more bulk than I&#x27;d prefer between my cheek and gum that bugs me just a little if I sleep on that side (I like really small profile mouth</li>
            <li>it took me a couple of tries but it works fine.</li>
            <li>Last a long time even though I am a pretty strong grinder at night.</li>
            <li>I had a little more stress in my life</li>
            <li>I wish that I molded it a little better because it hurts my mouth</li>
            <li>A little too bulky for me, although it is more rigid than others</li>
            <li>It seems to seat OK and floats around a little</li>
            <li>My teeth are no longer grinding at night and my jaw feels a little bit better in the morning.</li>
            <li>starts to get a little ripe (no surprise there), but for the money the quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li>, I went back to the product after a few days &amp; found out that w/the heat of my mouth - it molded in &amp; fit fine.  </li>
            <li>It took several fittings and i had to re-heat it a few times but with a little effort it fits great!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as though you have a slab of concrete in your mouth; you can sleep with your mouth</li>
            <li>closed easily &amp; comfortably.  </li>
            <li>This one is much thinner and stays locked in place like the professionally made ones.</li>
            <li>This newer one is much shallower and does not suction to your teeth as the old ones did.</li>
            <li>after 3 tries of molding this, I could not get it to fit.  </li>
            <li>This one is made of much thicker material and has lasted over 3 months thus far.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how well it will last, but the comfort it gives him is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Does discolor over time which the dentist says is normal.  </li>
            <li>I could close my mouth as normal.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I realize this isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a custom night guard again, because I&#x27;d done that many years ago and then gave up on wearing it within a year or so and all that money was wasted.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t waste $300 on the custom one from my dentist.</li>
            <li>It also changed my teeth, so it felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t positioning normally.  </li>
            <li>It works after a few tries at fitting to your mouth; not a substitute for your dentists efforts but a good temporary appliance if you need an extra or forgot to bring your regular one on vacation, as I did.</li>
            <li>During the application process, for the first time apparently, I molded all the way around my mouth using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even swallow or breath normally without having to take it out.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try since it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost and achieves the same goal.  </li>
            <li>quite the fight fit the first few times.  </li>
            <li>I have a 50% success rating and retrying isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m basically part Velicoraptor because I normally chew through my night</li>
            <li>In any case the low cost and comfort are well worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use while my normal night guard was sent out for repairs as I get a headache when I don&#x27;t wear it.  </li>
            <li>May be fine for other needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard plastic like the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this night guard, but I had a few problems:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>After three \\&quot;remelts\\&quot; I finally got it right.</li>
            <li>They last about 6 months and the price is right</li>
            <li>But when you do get it right, you won&#x27;t sleep the same without it.</li>
            <li>The third time I got it right though</li>
            <li>It molds easily, however I found that if you have a &amp;#34;larger head&amp;#34; than the average person, it will form to your teeth, but will not adjust to your mouth width without warping/twisting.  </li>
            <li>I do think that some videos of how to fit the product would be extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li>You do have to boil it a little bit longer than the instructions say, but once you get it warm enough</li>
            <li>The new instructions suck..</li>
            <li>this was new to me.  </li>
            <li>I am on amazon looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>and I had to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>and I just want to mould a new one to fit.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Now my jaw hurts and I have to search for something new.  </li>
            <li>Looks like the dentist is going to get a new car.</li>
            <li>Can easily last a good year if not longer for me, and I grind my teeth hard.</li>
            <li>I think I messed up the fit a little, since it grips in the back but slips off in the middle near my front teeth, but it seems to be doing okay.</li>
            <li>The new design is roughly half that of the classic large and it uses a fraction of the material of the classic large (which would cause the user to chew through the new design much</li>
            <li>Having been a grinder my entire life this night guard has been the easiest to form and is&lt;br /&gt;much smaller than the sports guards that are available.</li>
            <li>I bought a second guard (same item) and fit it to my lower teeth.  </li>
            <li>I tried three times to get the guard to stay in place when my mouth was open as the instructions state indicates a proper fit.  </li>
            <li>When following the directions it is very simple to mold and fits well and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>To the company&#x27;s credit, they offer free replacement if you call them and tell them you are not satisfied with the first (practice) mold.</li>
            <li>Simple fit process is the same as the one use for sports guards.  </li>
            <li>I think it is much more comfortable and cheaper than the expensive one the Dentist sold me.  </li>
            <li>I might refit a 3rd time to see if I can smooth it out at the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Dentek</li>
            <li>I followed directions precisely and even bought a second one thinking I didn&#x27;t mold the plastic enough around my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made to fit the upper teeth for those who are unaware of this malady.</li>
            <li>Its just a very simple basic piece of lightweight plastic, designed to be comfortable and prevent grinding and clenching.</li>
            <li>I also had to cut it down a little more and use a lighter to soften hard areas, but it works great.</li>
            <li>When I finally got the fit right, it&#x27;s still not very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have made this discovery for so little money!</li>
            <li>If you mess up, it&#x27;s easy to try and redo again.  </li>
            <li>Per the instructions, I tried reshaping the gel back to original and going through the molding process a second time.  </li>
            <li>The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard is not slick when moistened in your mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable but really does the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll speak first about problems encountered with similar products.</li>
            <li>I boiled water in my microwave, put the blank NightGuard into the hot water, waited two minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was just one old dentist or if that&#x27;s normal, but I found it intolerable</li>
            <li>After many adjustments, it finally got to the point where I could wear it regularly, and shortly after that, it broke one night in my mouth</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised that this mouth guard works!  </li>
            <li>The chance of it melting the first or second time you try to custom fit it, is not worth the price, to me.</li>
            <li>The first two nights I used it, I ended up removing it in the middle of the night when I woke up</li>
            <li>I kept the first one for months and months, until I finally bit through it.  </li>
            <li>Tried several times, exactly according to instructions.</li>
            <li>I have recently started grinding my teeth more due to an infection under one of my molars in my jaw.</li>
            <li>so we just sat it in hot water for 2 minutes, put it back in place, and then he pushed it tighter to his teeth.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a mouth anti-grinding guard, so I may have problems with the device that anyone who already uses such device may no longer experience.  </li>
            <li>Apparently these weren&#x27;t designed for straight men.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li>first time I adapted the mouthguard to my mouth I made a mistake, so I had to do it again, on this second occasion</li>
            <li>First off, this night guard is meant to be used by individuals who grind their teeth only.  </li>
            <li>I was able to follow the instructions for fitting easily enough, but it&#x27;s just too uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>This is actually the first nightguard I ordered after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>is my second one, as I lost the first one recently during air travel, and I bought it because the first was working so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WHEN THIS WILL DO EXACTLY THE SAME JOB ?</li>
            <li>What I can suggest is you should soak the night guard in the hot water until it feels sticky on its side, not just following the time on the instruction.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my mouth even after trimming it down.</li>
            <li>I can no longer bite down comfortably even when I&#x27;ve removed the dental guard.</li>
            <li>con is that it is a bit bulky and needs to be trimmed down to fit.</li>
            <li>Very easy to mold (takes just a few moments) and seems to last about 1.5-2 months.</li>
            <li>Seem cheap compared to the hard mold I first got from the dentist</li>
            <li>My DMD stated a new soft guard would have been $450 and not covered by insurance...</li>
            <li>This was a cinch to fit, although the instructions make it seem complex at first.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother him, he got used to it easily in just a few nights.  </li>
            <li>I used to play footballl, and this feels no better quality than my old mouthguards, except that it is much more slim.  </li>
            <li>If you are very picky and sensitive about the fit, you may need to work a little harder to get it to feel right.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the instructions and do as others here have suggested by constantly sucking in air after biting down and using your fingers to mold the nightguard all around your teeth.</li>
            <li>I broke out the sharp, nearly clean adult scissors and trimmed this beast.</li>
            <li>the only thing positive I can say is that it came in on time.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t quite reach my last two teeth, but I guess it&#x27;s better too short than too long.</li>
            <li>For me, I was less likely to pull the night guard out while sleeping when I used it for the top teeth.  </li>
            <li>There is a newer version of this product that uses blue plastic which I have found is more durable and has less problems with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The molding process takes about 30 minutes, and then it gels comfortably and tight to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I think from the guard being fit onto my teeth too tight.</li>
            <li>Was very careful with the instructions; however, it doesn&#x27;t replace a true mouthguard supplied by a dentist.</li>
            <li>Molding it to my teeth was easy enough, and while it does seem to last about 6-8 months, paying $20 twice a year is a HECK of a lot cheaper than getting it through my dentist&#x27;s provide (which fits the same and costs over $400)</li>
            <li>and it is far easier to use, causes far less salivation and does the primary job of preventing me from grinding my teeth at night.</li>
            <li>Every time I try to fit the inside of the teeth, the outside edge pops loose - and vice versa.</li>
            <li>However, it is a big large and there is a gap.</li>
            <li>It did not shape well enough to be tight fitting.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; is inaccurate, it looks like it&#x27;s for a child when compared to the large one (same brand) that was purchased before.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little getting used to, but once you get used to using it, you will sleep comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few others and this one is really strong, and lasts pretty long!</li>
            <li>I only now replaced it with the grindguardn night guard (which I&#x27;ve read many positive reviews about - if you&#x27;re able to spend a little extra, I would recommend looking into it), because I accidentally left it out of it&#x27;s case for a few hours and my dogs chewed it to shreds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>guard was too large for my mouth and sent it back with no response so far?</li>
            <li>i was not super excited about paying another 300 bucks for another one-</li>
            <li>since lovely insurance doesnt cover hardly any of it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried really hard to get used to this night guard, but I have not been able to do it.  </li>
            <li>I am more of a clencher, so did not need a hard molded guard.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the bottom of the guard were a bit softer and maybe had the hard surface under a softer layer like the top part of it</li>
            <li>I decided to try it again and made sure to clench extremely hard while it was in the molding phase.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions to the T and am still not very satisfied with the fit.</li>
            <li>I kept waking up with dry mouth due to me not being able to close my mouth all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who it would fit as I consider myself an average size in general.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to fit, and a non-professional fit affects your jaw position causing pain and additional grinding.</li>
            <li>I think if you also have this issue, you might want to steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li>I read through the instructions completely and then gathered all of my supplies while reading through the directions again.</li>
            <li>I dunno how long it&#x27;s gonna hold up, but it&#x27;s not nearly as uncomfortable as I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>I then saw a commercial for this product and went straight out and bought it.</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read elsewhere, it happens with use of these things, even if it&#x27;s professionally made.</li>
            <li>I can say I have finally found one comfortable enough to actually sleep with through the night.</li>
            <li>and I have also waken up with a severe headache and achy, sensitive teeth as a result of clenching my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I redid it a few times, but never got a comfortable result.</li>
            <li>far my headaches have not gone away completely</li>
            <li>If you are clenching and/or grinding your teeth you should get checked for whatever damage you&#x27;ve done so far anyway.  </li>
            <li>this one gets old, I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.</li>
            <li>3 mouth guards so far - including a sports guard (1 week)</li>
            <li>so this is adding some protection until I get some professional work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to wear one before but recently developed TMJ after a car accident.</li>
            <li>works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add some perspective, I am a smallish 20 year old woman, and I consider my mouth to be smallish as well.</li>
            <li>The night guard stopped the clenching pain completely but caused the roof of mouth pain, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>Look somewhere else like a professional dentist....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This brings me to really the only \\&quot;con\\</li>
            <li>TO MAKE SOFT</li>
            <li>If you do manage to get it to fit properly, which I believe is an impossibility, it is so uncomfortable you probably will not be able to sleep.</li>
            <li>Not comfortable, but I think I can trim it to fit my teeth.</li>
            <li>Spend the money &amp; get a professional one.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t deep enough to make a solid fit.</li>
            <li>This design was very inferior which resulted in it falling out of my mouth during the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li>but these last much longer.</li>
            <li>After my professional night guard shattered, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300 out of pocket.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to alleviate some discomfort after grinding teeth at night.</li>
            <li>I microwaved it for 2 minutes and shaped it - WOW.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought LOTS of these dental guards and this one has lasted the longest by far.</li>
            <li>I verified this with my dentist and ended up forking over $150 for a professional occlusal guard.</li>
            <li>They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li>(Seems that this product has been developed by an entrepreneurial dentist -- who&#x27;s been used to having an assistant around.)</li>
            <li>Personally, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this product.  </li>
            <li>That was the old &amp;#34;Original.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to read the directions a few times before you move ahead to boiling the guard and then placing it in mouth.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to find flaws with this as someone who paid for the professional dentist fitted one (way over $300) but so far I have not.</li>
            <li>soft guard</li>
            <li>If you grind your teeth, go to your dentist and spend the big bucks for a real one.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford to get a splint from the dentist, so I tried the $17 route and it is working so far.  </li>
            <li>To everyone&#x27;s surprise I really wasn&#x27;t a big mouth, just misunderstood.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be soft when it comes time to sleep.</li>
            <li>So much so that my upper teeth shifted and chewed into my tongue.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I tried to get the gel to soften but it took a few times and the guard still doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>I wore a dental retainer/nightguard when young and couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as professionally made guard from the dentist at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I ended up going with the professional night guard from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable and lasting quality.</li>
            <li>and now I have no trouble sleeping with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I must suggest someone who uses this instead of seeing a dentist at all, or where the pain never goes away, should see a dentist at least once to make sure bruxism/TMJ is the correct diagnosis ...</li>
            <li>i may need to just have it professionally fitted.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got an old package..</li>
            <li>but I like the soft bit feel.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re making the mold, try to get the outer edges of your teeth near the outer edges of the guard, so the soft squishy material that is being molded tends to go towards the roof of your mouth instead of between your gums and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Others have said it&#x27;s too soft and they chewed through it.</li>
            <li>When I was done, I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way that it&#x27;s going to come off unexpectedly</li>
            <li>Do not delay in replacing (as I did not replace until nearly 5 mo, and the headaches, etc.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about this product just remember it can only do so much.</li>
            <li>Not everyone has or wants a microwave, yet the instructions are ONLY for microwave use.  </li>
            <li>But then, it only cost 20% as much and didn&#x27;t require a couple of dental visits.</li>
            <li>And, so far it works...</li>
            <li>I definitely moved my jaw too much when molding it</li>
            <li>they do not fit comfortably and the pressure points on your gums cause ulcers/blisters.</li>
            <li>certainly more missing upper teeth</li>
            <li>I tried wearing it briefly, but I just couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Carefully and quickly lined the guard up with my teeth- paying particular attention to the front teeth- getting them as close to the front of the guard as possible, without going OVER the border of the guard.</li>
            <li>It also caused a weird itching and swelling in my gums and lips, so it may not be a good idea for those with latex allergies</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly thick so for even the most robust chewers out there</li>
            <li>which is nice but even after trying to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it out I still was sleeping with my mouth open because it was so thick.</li>
            <li>After trying a second time(another gentle boil) I molded it as much as I could and waited while biting and sucking in to create the vacuum.</li>
            <li>When I bit down until the gel was cool it just fell off.</li>
            <li>says that you can wait for it to cool down a bit, form it into the way it was when you got it, and try again.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>ended up having some real jaw issues for the first time like a month later, probably unrelated to the nightguard but likely related to the grinding/clenching.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t slip off and is not tight at all.</li>
            <li>And unlike the dentist ones, it&#x27;s soft, so it isn&#x27;t an irritant, and no sharp edges!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the main problem with the device is the soft plastic that sits next to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The size / mass of it simply would not accomadate my apparent large jaw frame.</li>
            <li>The first ones fit really well, but pushed my lips out a bit (definitely NOT attractive!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable or at least not annoying enough to wear</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how other night guards work, but I am not crazy about this one.</li>
            <li>but if this saves one other person because it sticks out then its worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely used it due to the discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It sat too high near my back teeth and hurt my jaw.</li>
            <li>Sleeping with it felt a little strange at first, but I got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy but don&#x27;t mess up, you only get one time to mold it to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>In the small fine print it says DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE TMJ....???</li>
            <li>Then I just soak it in denture cleaner to clean every few days.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I have a small mouth, so it fits just fine.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try a fourth fitting, but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li>The first time,there wasn&#x27;t enough material to mold around my teeth enough to have it stay in place.</li>
            <li>After decades of grinding my teeth, being lectured to by my dentist, and going through no less than four nightguards (two from the dentist and two over the counter)</li>
            <li>Mainly because it was on sale and the same price as online without the wait.</li>
            <li>Only issue on the first try was it not staying on his teeth with his mouth open</li>
            <li>There is no extra material in the front, so it is not uncomfortable on the inside of the upper lip</li>
            <li>I will be buying the classic instead of this model next time.</li>
            <li>and I have a small mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you are able to suck air thru your teeth during the molding/hardening process, you deserve a medal.&lt;br /&gt;Third, each morning after wearing for several nights</li>
            <li>I think I should have tried to line it up a little better, it sticks out of my mouth a bit causing dry mouth at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased mouth guards from my dentist which cost over $200 and also tried doityourself-like these which only cost me less than $20, I really can&#x27;t say that one is that much better than the other.  </li>
            <li>I have been a teeth grinder for several years, grinding down my eye teeth primarily.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a super hard grinder like me, I think this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>It does feel a little large in large in my mouth</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and will order it again if my current one needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete scam,even if you are a dentist I could almost guarantee no success on getting it done right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bulky in the mouth but soft enough to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is not very heavy</li>
            <li>#34;advanced comfort.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why am i not able to get it comfortable?  </li>
            <li>mouth is small and this guard fit</li>
            <li>really well i will buy as long as they make them.</li>
            <li>I can usually wear this guard all night comfortably.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be effective if it won&#x27;t stay in my mouth!</li>
            <li>I had no problem making the mold of my teeth and it fit perfectly in my small mouth.</li>
            <li>My back molars weren&#x27;t coming together normally.</li>
            <li>it forms a tight fit to the upper teeth.</li>
            <li>This is for people with very large mouths, in addition, it was difficult to form and heat even following the step by step directions more than once.</li>
            <li>Luckily I purchased 2 different brands and had no problem with the other brand.</li>
            <li>The satisfaction guarantee allows you to mail them your used guard and they send you back a new one in the correct size for you to remold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would just say, I have been using this mouthguard for over 5 years with multiple new purchases of this brand and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li>New (current dentist) suggested I try this before re-molding for the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I tried it for several days, thinking that it was just my jaw getting used to the new mouth guard, but it never improved.</li>
            <li>I have had 2 of these for the last 5 years (got a new one cuz a pet destroyed it).</li>
            <li>but the fit was so bad I tried trimming some edges to make it better.</li>
            <li>It was quite easy to fit and seems much less irritating than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>It was very invasive and made my dry mouth even drier.</li>
            <li>I do however have a pretty small mouth and this fits really well</li>
            <li>I tried several variations of night guards, and they mostly worked shoddily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently noticed grinding my teeth, so I am trying a cheaper option than a real dental guard.</li>
            <li>somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I found a different mouth guard at Walmart that comes with a blue case that works much better.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Just make sure to following the direction properly while forming the mouthguard to your teeth, which isn&#x27;t too difficult but takes a quick read through of the instructions.</li>
            <li>I bought it, took the trouble to get it molded to fit, but used ONCE only.</li>
            <li>It cost twice as much as the Dentek ones I was buying (same price but only one in the box) but it has lasted 4-5 times longer.</li>
            <li>Had to remold it a few times to get it to fit properly.  </li>
            <li>The instructions seem more complicated than it really is.  </li>
            <li>The first night I used it,  I feel asleep within  a few minutes; just like normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, has a soft gel lining, and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>I did have to trim it down to be a little less bulky, but way more comfortable than my last nightguard.</li>
            <li>One major problem here.</li>
            <li>(does that mean I&#x27;m better at doing this than the actual dentist?!)</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad this mouthguard at least helps me!)</li>
            <li>I am a major night \\&quot;Clencher\\&quot; and often awake to sore jaws and tooth pain.</li>
            <li>I am a major jaw clencher and grinder, and needed a replacement for my $500 mouthguard after my dogs ate it.</li>
            <li>I want to keep all my original teeth like my grandmother who had all of them intact and lived past a hundred (lost count).</li>
            <li>you have previously used the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; Large, this newly redesigned product will not work for you.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time she has used a guard and found initially it made her mouth dry</li>
            <li>If it came in a small I might reconsider, but this was too comfortable due to large size.  </li>
            <li>When I fit it the second time I bit down normally and spent a lot of time conforming it to my teeth and the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I clench my teeth all the time; and it&#x27;s becoming a serious problem for me.</li>
            <li>This was relatively easy to fit (very similar to molding a mouth guard if you ever had to do that for sports), but I found the end result product to be a bit bulky and awkward to wear.  </li>
            <li>The first one I thought I may have not properly followed directions as it falls loose in my mouth and becomes a choking hazard.  </li>
            <li>It was large even after trimming it and it certainly did not fit snug enough to stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Typical, pay more &amp; get less.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time getting it to fit to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>too hard to fit in my mouth</li>
            <li>The lack of a front lip makes it hard to fit.</li>
            <li>It is ridiculously hard to fit.</li>
            <li>The fitting process was straight forward, had to do a refit due to not bitting down properly the first time, which wasn&#x27;t hard at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the other brands, you boil water and feel like you only have one chance to get it right.  </li>
            <li>Night Guard is a good product, but it is quiet hard to adjust to your mouth when you are under 5foot 5\\&quot; and have a narrow mouth in weight.</li>
            <li>It fit, but was pretty uncomfortable and I kept spitting it out at night.  </li>
            <li>But it was difficult to fit it the first time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if this is a con for the product or just a fit issue for me personally.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if this is a con for the product or just a fit issue for me personally.</li>
            <li>My old mouthguard was big and bulky.</li>
            <li>Once I noticed, I stopped and since I&#x27;m young, my teeth went back to how they were before.</li>
            <li>I think the big difference with this one is the two layers, with the soft layer being the one pressed up against your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I have to trim the back of my mouth guards because of a sensitive crown.  </li>
            <li>This night guard works well enough as far as I know.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for just over 3 months now and I have barely even scratched the under-surface with my lower teeth.</li>
            <li>last bout of pain and tooth sensitivity had lasted nearly three months.</li>
            <li>(21 year old female)</li>
            <li>I even tried trimming the edges so that it wouldn&#x27;t go so far back in my mouth, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I am only replacing it to see if there is a difference between an 8 month old and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advice for you all: these soft ones only encourage your bruxism.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another in the near future, to keep just in case</li>
            <li>It is too big and my lips do not close completely when I have it in.</li>
            <li>There is way too much product left in the middle of your upper mouth.  </li>
            <li>kid is 6 years old, so I just trimmed off about 3/8 of an inch off the rear molar area on each side so it wouldn&#x27;t be too big.  </li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>Read the instructions carefully before you start the molding process, especially if this is the first time you&#x27;re doing it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt the internal part of your cheeks and allows you to breathe normally with your mouth open.</li>
            <li>Lame that I had to find out how to set this up on my own.  </li>
            <li>believe this is true, because even before he mentioned it, when I removed the guard in the morning, my jaw felt \\&quot;not right\\&quot; and when I bit down, I was biting kind of awkwardly too forward or backward.</li>
            <li>It was pretty worn down after two or three</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mold, but the guard seems too wide for my mouth; the front also has a very low profile which makes it difficult to fit well.</li>
            <li>This is for upper teeth only I am going to try the new one on my lower teeth</li>
            <li>I still have some minor issues with part of my tongue and/or roof of my mouth suffering from getting dry, but I&#x27;m willing to consider that an idiosyncrasy of my mouth, not a defect of the product.</li>
            <li>Having used one made by a dentist, and &amp;#34;paid for it&amp;#34;  about $500, very nice, but very expensive when this does the same thing for grinders.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, it takes a few minutes to get it right.</li>
            <li>only grinds a little or only when they&#x27;re awake (eg: while using a computer) or anyone who has a special shaped bite I guess.</li>
            <li>The device itself is a little bulky around the sides and far too large to be swallowed.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first guard I don&#x27;t take out in the middle of the night due to uncomfort.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon shipped it quickly.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s your first time, it&#x27;s very hard to remember exactly what the product looked like when you took it out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Following the instructions carefully (boiling water for 50 seconds, cooling for 20 seconds, molding for 20 seconds, additonal molding, etc.), I found this product extremely difficult to mold into a comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li>I tried several times, and eventually, it did get enough shape to finally stay in my mouth in a semi-fitted fashion, although this required much time and work, with several reshapings.</li>
            <li>Also, I have an average sized mouth without any wisdom teeth and the back of the trays are barely long enough to fit all my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, It does a an extra hard plate under the soft mold-able part.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had a completely different one from another brand (Dentek) in the past and it was actually comfortable enough to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Other OTC mouthguards have lasted me much longer.</li>
            <li>Too thick, causing significant jaw pain in the morning.</li>
            <li>This one so far is lasting much longer than any other brand I have tried!</li>
            <li>I must have tried at least 10 times to try to get a custom fit following the directions.  </li>
            <li>However, since I do have my wisdom teeth, I feel like the protection doesn&#x27;t go back far enough.</li>
            <li>Normallly my tongue rests on the back of my top front teeth, but the thickness behind my teeth wouldn&#x27;t let my tongue stretch out</li>
            <li>No trouble with it being too long (toward the back of my mouth), but it seems to be too thick (up and down) to stay on its own.</li>
            <li>I followed instructions to the letter -- even had someone hold a watch to count off the exact instructions down to the second.</li>
            <li>the first 3 nites my mouth was a little sore.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came up a little higher over my front teeth</li>
            <li>Does make my teeth feel a little funny in the morning</li>
            <li>The process of fitting this thing was really painful for my jaw muscles, and I&#x27;ve never managed to get it right.  </li>
            <li>Will try a 3rd time but even following directions to a T, hard to fit.</li>
            <li>It will clearly prevent you from grinding your teeth as long as you wear it every night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I trimmed back the plastic that clearly wasn&#x27;t doing anything, such as that flap at the back of my front teeth.</li>
            <li>It barely fits and does NOT stay in properly, I can&#x27;t sleep with it in cause</li>
            <li>I have one that&#x27;s noticeably crooked and the front edge of it barely fits into the tray, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d either be unable to fall asleep because it was irritating, I&#x27;d spit it out while I slept, or I&#x27;d wake up with very attractive giant puddles of drool on my pillow.</li>
            <li>I had issues the first few nights getting used to having it in my mouth and some mornings I have a momentary issue with gagging when I take it OUT of my mouth, but otherwise, no problems at all in terms of gagging.</li>
            <li>I had issues the first few nights getting used to having it in my mouth and some mornings I have a momentary issue with gagging when I take it OUT of my mouth, but otherwise, no problems at all in terms of gagging.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I would have trouble sleeping with it in because it is pretty bulky</li>
            <li>It was very difficult to get a good impression of your teeth.</li>
            <li>A little complicated to get the molding right but an ok product.</li>
            <li>Been using it for many months but the wear and tear is minimal even though I am a serious grinder.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t bit down too much when forming.  </li>
            <li>I bought this nightguard since it was recommended to cut down on my snoring, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>Just boil water and bite down for your imprint and its ready.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it came out right.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t bite down too hard while you are fitting it</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to form to my mouth than the ones I have previously had.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as described and it does not fit properly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thin and fits my very teeth well.</li>
            <li>This one holds good, and no more broken teeth.</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago I purchased my first nightguard (this one) after learning I grind my teeth so badly at night that I fractured a filling, which then caused a new cavity to form under the original filling.</li>
            <li>Placed in boiling water few seconds then into my mouth to bite down and fit on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little large on the sides for my mouth</li>
            <li>I was able to eventually chew through it and decided that the few hundred dollars spent is not worth it, although I was told there is a stronger material they could have given me (which is something they should have offered to begin with.)</li>
            <li>The Den-Tek guard was slick which caused my jaw to move unnaturally left and right</li>
            <li>I was afraid of what it would feel like, having a piece of plastic in my mouth, and as I sit with it in, trying to get used to the sensation right now, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of material around the sides, so when you bite in, it really forms a tight grip.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I purchased this product once a couple years ago and it wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I did buy some Efferdent tablets and use them maybe once a week, but on a daily basis I wash it well when I first take it out and then at night when I put it back in, I soak it in Listerine Total Care for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>tried several times, made a whole mess of it.</li>
            <li>The system is a hard lower level (like the sole of a shoe) and slight outer frame (just tall enough to give it shape) that stands up to many months of grinding with no change.</li>
            <li>The second time I got it hot enough but found it difficult to get my fingers around it in the right spots</li>
            <li>;, it&#x27;s still much less expensive than the hundreds it costs to have a similar product nicely delivered to you by a professional.  </li>
            <li>To make matters worse, when I tried to contact customer service my only option was to do so online, but when I attempted to use the online form to submit my questions and complaints the site made it impossible for me to effectively submit any meaningful information.</li>
            <li>This product is nearly impossible to get to fit right</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive about spending so much for this night guard at a pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>First, unless I bought a child&#x27;s size, the thing is very small - it didn&#x27;t cover my last molars completely</li>
            <li>As other reviews have stated, this new \\&quot;one size fits all\\</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have proof of whether this is true, but I seriously think this thing will buy my mouth enough time to perhaps heal some of the damage.  </li>
            <li>The instruction procedure is very complex and precise.</li>
            <li>It does not get soft enough to push the thick sides up against your gumline for a tight fit.</li>
            <li>Once you fail for the first time, you cannot get it back to the original shape, and then you will for sure to fail in later tries.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty much unusable, even after soaking it in a boiling water per instructions, the plastic is too hard and it will not bite down and adjust at all.</li>
            <li>By the second fitting, I was ready to throw in the towel and chalk this up to another bad purchase.  </li>
            <li>The directions aren&#x27;t so clear on this, but it&#x27;s like a basic mouthpiece you would use for athletics, with a harder bottom.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent delivery time.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep using this brand, which is a bit sturdier than others I&#x27;ve tried, and hope for the best.</li>

            <li> This is the best night guard I have ever used.</li>
            <li> For best results use fingers to push molding for best shaping.</li>
            <li> After molding it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> And I still can not figure out why anyone would pay the exorbitant prices to have a custom fitted guard at the dentist&#x27;s office when this product works every bit as good!!!</li>
            <li> I re-heated it 3 times to get the perfect</li>

            <li> However, it &amp;#34;sized&amp;#34; into my mouth great</li>
            <li> A great alternative to the guards that can be purchased at Wal-Mart or Target for $30 and wear out after 1-3 months.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Advanced Comfort\\&quot; seemed like the best one, and an excellent price.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This nightguard is amazing!</li>
            <li> This will provide the best fitting mold.  </li>
            <li> The fitting is not 100% perfect</li>
            <li> IN ONE FASTENED TOGETHER CREATING A PERFECT SUPPORT FOR YOU TOP AND BOTTOM TEETH</li>
            <li> Buy nice or buy twice!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would consider this a successful &amp; dramatically cheaper alternative to the product that a dentist would make for you.</li>
            <li> It is amazing: fits perfectly, doesn&#x27;t fall out, and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The quality is really good</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s fairly bulky and after molding when I tried to sleep with it</li>
            <li> I believe it is a good product for the price and all.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, but I did not have a good result.  </li>
            <li> This started out as a good product.</li>
            <li> Its good.</li>
            <li> Works but not as good as doctor prescribed</li>
            <li> Now it feels as good as the one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> so it really isn&#x27;t a good product for clenching or grinding.  </li>
            <li> he laughed and suggested this product.</li>
            <li> I read a reco from a dentist to do that and mine has stayed in good shape after about a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product and works b</li>
            <li> The one my dentist showed me was thinner yet, but this one is good</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bulky and once it is fitted correctly it feels good in the mouth and protects my teeth from my clenching.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy.  </li>
            <li> Follow directions and the fit is perfect.</li>
            <li> I recommend for this good product.</li>
            <li> Instructions are good and tell you step by step what to do</li>
            <li> but it did take 3 to 4 times to get a perfect fit for her teeth.  </li>
            <li> and this isn’t as perfect fit as going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> As good as the guard provided by your dentist.</li>
            <li> Not so good either.</li>
            <li> After all, the reviews are good.</li>
            <li> This is a good night guard.  </li>
            <li> good am use any night</li>
            <li> am sleep good to use this good for me</li>
            <li> but as for the product itself, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to wear - all in all, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I fit The Doctor&#x27;s twice, with no issues, to get the best</li>
            <li> It also feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I resized this twice, and still have a not so perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> However, about 2 seconds after putting it in my mouth I started gagging; hardly a good way to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Good price as an alternative to custom made dental guard that costs hundreds.  </li>
            <li> The result is good though, I have been using mine for 2 months now without any problems, it stays well and prevents grinding.</li>
            <li> and this is just as good, save your money and follow the directions</li>
            <li> but I loved it...</li>
            <li> It is still holding up fairly well and doing its job.</li>
            <li> A good value.</li>
            <li> the night guard turned out to a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> but my store didnt have it so thought would try this one, all its good for is the trash</li>
            <li> good mouth guard ...</li>
            <li> Good quality materials.  </li>
            <li> Good thing you can mold and remold since I didn&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> Also, I used on my lower teeth as others have suggested and seemed to be a good idea.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t a perfect fit for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but I eventually got it to fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Your choice and good luck.</li>
            <li> say on the product that it should be good for 6 months</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Something else may come along soon, but for now, it is good.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the original (now I know this is called \\&quot;Classic\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I bought some efferdent tablets to clean it, and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Durable and confortable, very good fit.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great product i use it every night, and am really glad i got it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;</li>
            <li> happy with my purchase:)</li>
            <li> but I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Sure must be a nice hunk of plastic!  </li>
            <li> Just boil it for 30 seconds and it works so much better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off going to the dentist and have a mouth piece fitted to your mouth!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get it molded perfectly the first time</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> I love this night guard!</li>
            <li> Makes me glad I&#x27;m wearing it!  </li>
            <li> one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is much better than the original in two ways.</li>
            <li> It was stated that this product was used to help alleviated SNORING!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> :) I CAN SLEEP!</li>
            <li> Love ya Jaxie!</li>
            <li> I sleep better knowing that I didn&#x27;t spend $500 for a piece of plastic!</li>
            <li> Favorite guard and cheaper then in store!</li>
            <li> No instructions for stove top!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Great and inexpensive product, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Great product and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> This night guard is a perfect fit and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is a great mouth guard, and molded fine to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I found this product easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, and from what I understand, it&#x27;s a great deal cheaper than having to go to the dentist and have them make you a custom one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Re-fitted it, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing and works with my CPAP mask.</li>
            <li> it creates a great fit.</li>
            <li> Great fit</li>
            <li> but it still doesn&#x27;t fit that great.</li>
            <li> great fit.</li>
            <li> This nightguard is great; comfortable and made out of a sturdy material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing seeing the bite marks I make in this thing.  </li>
            <li> they work great and are cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing what this night guard can do.</li>
            <li> and the fit is great.  </li>
            <li> If anyone knows of this kind of produce, please let me know.</li>
            <li> How effective.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say the this product has allowed me to sleep again by taking the pressure off my jaw and letting me relax the over stressed joint.</li>
            <li> You mold it to your teeth with your fingers while it&#x27;s warm</li>
            <li> The gel is pushed out and kind of spill over to the guard.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and fit it, not burning myself, and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> It now fits and seems effective.</li>
            <li> By the way, the case it comes with is nice and</li>
            <li> This nightguard is awesome it stays in place and is much cheaper than what I was going to pay at my dentists office.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I liked the product, and what it did for my jaw</li>
            <li> It still prevents the teeth from grinding so that&#x27;s not an issue, but it would be nice if it fully covered the molars</li>
            <li> My dentist says that over the counter night guards can sometimes do more damage than good.</li>
            <li> None of them have been both a good fit and not bulky, let alone inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions in order to get a good mold.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I found the Plackers Grind</li>
            <li> To be honest, I want to return it, but do not know their policy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the one from the dentist&#x27;s office (well over $450.00), so this was a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li> It is every bit as good as the one I had made at the dentist, and the price was so much better.</li>
            <li> I kindly rejected that</li>
            <li> This Night Guard fits her perfectly since it&#x27;s her teeth making the mold and it doesn&#x27;t cause much discomfort.</li>
            <li> It is as good or better.</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of nightguard before even though my dentist always recommended that I did.</li>
            <li> inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but how should I know?</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to wear at night</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all that hassle, his particular AC Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard really impressed me.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it looked strong and very suitable for the job.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit, good product, holds up!</li>
            <li> The maker would be well-advised to include a time-line of the heating, cooling, sucking, and pressing steps needed to achieve a good fit.  </li>
            <li> fits good and easy to sleep with.</li>
            <li> This might be a great product for someone with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bite but, because I have a mild underbite, with this guard</li>
            <li> This allows you to fit the device yourself, yes, but it also means that there is a pleasantly chewy object in your mouth all night.  </li>
            <li> I bought this night guard and set it all up, followed the instructions which were very easy, and slept with it.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to mold just follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Very easy to mold your teeth for this product.  </li>
            <li> I found that it was very easy to prep and use.</li>
            <li> very easy to shape with the instructions.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use if you follow the instruction closely.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to mold this mouthpiece...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this, it&#x27;s made sleeping much more bearable!</li>
            <li> This doctors night guard is the one recomended by my dentist pretty easy to form and works great!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and effective in stopping me from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use(the instructions are easy to read for how you mold it), and the case for it it great.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but the product itself isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> I love how this comes with easy directions and it works so easy and is a perfect fit for my mouth.</li>
            <li> The night guard worth great</li>
            <li> Just as effective and you can replace them every 6 months which seems so much more sanitary</li>
            <li> By far the best guards I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a good, cheap alternative to the super-expensive night bruxism guards that dentists sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a good fit with this product.  </li>
            <li> At this point after wearing it for a while the fit isn&#x27;t too good</li>
            <li> This is the best night guard that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> but these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying and post when I get a good fit.</li>
            <li> I had to mold it twice before I can get a good fit.</li>
            <li> it kinda makes my front gums sore, and can fall out if I turn over, but it was cheaper and more effective than this one was and didn&#x27;t require any molding.</li>
            <li> Good product you might have to remold it a couple of times to get a comfortable fit good price compared to drug store prices</li>
            <li> and I got a good fit.</li>
            <li> Good instructions on how to fit it,</li>
            <li> It does not custom fit my teeth, but still does just as good a job as the ones from the dentists.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li> the fit is good.  </li>
            <li> It molded and fit perfectly on the first try.</li>
            <li> I boiled it right and got a good fit, great</li>
            <li> A great fit and so easy to use to protect my teeth from grinding my teeth during my sleep.  </li>
            <li> Instructions for sizing were easy to follow and the fit is great.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job if you mold it right.</li>
            <li> This one is still going strong after 6 months!</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy to fit, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was able to get it to fit perfectly after the first try.  </li>
            <li> Honestly the best night guard that you can purchase for yourself; without the hassle of scheduling a dental appointment to make a mold of your teeth, paying $100&#x27;s (even with dental insurance), and then having to wait an &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; number of days to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grinding your teeth...clenching...jaw popping out and snapping back in....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mouth guards for sleeping, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Very easy to fit to your mouth too!</li>
            <li> Works great,, much cheaper then the one dentist wanted to make me !</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s exactly why these are so great.  </li>
            <li> This product was super easy to mold correctly and produces a great \\&quot;seal\\&quot; to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth guard and it was really easy to mold!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li> this mouth guard was very comfortable</li>
            <li> Very comfortable</li>
            <li> The night guard is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Does the job &amp; very comfortable</li>
            <li> For the tremendous abuse my jaws put this thing through, and the benefit I receive from it, I consider that fair use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It is the lowest profile molded mouth guard available, and much better priced than the dentist!</li>
            <li> Good product: fit and comfort pretty good.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold and get a good fit .</li>
            <li> Good value and easy to use and fit to your moutn.  </li>
            <li> Not to say any are very comfortable, but this one is the most acceptable I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is my own fault for not reading the fine print, but I made an assumption when it popped up in the snore-aid catagory when my mother sent the link to me.</li>
            <li> Attempted fitting per instructions 3x.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to fall asleep with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Seems to conform even better after you have worn it a while each night.</li>
            <li> Sure beats paying $400 at the dentist to get a night guard fitted.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions before fitting it and during fitting it, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It is more bulky than Den-Tek, but I think that aids in the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> how well you sleep at night with one of those on :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered two more.  </li>
            <li> Oh ok, I understand...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stinking disgrace that that warning isn&#x27;t more forthright and noticeable before purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; sleep apnea, try a double-biteguard (forms to top teeth *and* bottom teeth)--it</li>
            <li> I feel loads better.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a perfect, nearly professional fit.</li>
            <li> guard is NOT bulky and honestly, you can mold it to fit either the top OR bottom of your teeth;</li>
            <li> My husband grinds his teeth and has worn these night guards for many years now.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it takes more than one try to &amp;</li>
            <li> Better than spending $300 at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> If you do, it will be touching you</li>
            <li> We are both getting more sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a thinner product that would offer more comfort.  </li>
            <li> DenTek is much better.</li>
            <li> My dentist said it would be better to have one custom made so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ground the point off an incisor (eye tooth), and I wonder what an x-ray will reveal because I&#x27;ve been clenching more than grinding.  </li>
            <li> I tried twice to mold it and it wouldn&#x27;t stay at the top of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is the only guard I&#x27;ve used that stays in place perfectly all night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I love that I can close my mouth over it, which I could not do with the target</li>
            <li> others, it really is a much more affordable option than a dental guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> the teeth grinding has subsided anyway, I was put on meds in which one of the side effects was that...doing better now though.</li>
            <li> but its more mentaly knowing i had it on</li>
            <li> I had a better mouth guard years ago, but it is no longer sold.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend, this says do not use for TMJ or for more than 3 months?</li>
            <li> Decided to give it a try anyway, and caused way more jaw pain than I had without it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for 100% sure</li>
            <li> When I have it in, I tend to salivate more though</li>
            <li> molding process went ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved it around between the spice shelf, the counter, and the top of the microwave.</li>
            <li> but she wanted to see if it was something she would be able to use.  </li>
            <li> I would go with a more slimline one if you know you can wear it and sleep.  </li>
            <li> Most of these mouth guards sell for a lot more at retail pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I won&#x27;t grind my teeth once I hit the pillow :-)</li>
            <li> Package arrived with a note, that the carton is ripped but the product is ok.</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of a sports mouthguard and someone able to read directions, I feel as though the moulding of this Nightguard should be within my capabilities.</li>
            <li> it is more of a muscular issue than a teeth</li>
            <li> it is more of a muscular issue than a teeth issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, now that it fits and I&#x27;ve been using it, I don&#x27;t wake up in the mornings with tension headaches any more.  </li>
            <li> Love these night guards.  </li>
            <li> I spit it out more often than some others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love this thing</li>
            <li> OK, my dentist says &amp;#34;get one because you are grinding you teeth as you sleep.&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Yes, this does work based on many months of use.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> You get the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I have had TMJ issues for a number of years and tried many solutions.</li>
            <li> This one is WAY better than those.</li>
            <li> Dentist said if I didn&#x27;t get a custom mouth-guard I&#x27;d lose more.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this one,some of what I was considering @</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to be able to use them.  </li>
            <li> Plus at this price, I can afford to replace it more often than the dentist version.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than having headaches and shots of pain up the side of my head.</li>
            <li> Too squishy, which I think encouraged me to grind even more.</li>
            <li> She indicated that she was able to fully close her mouth and didn’t drool with it in.  </li>
            <li> Wife tells me I snore more with it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use it.</li>
            <li> if there was a how-to instructional video on fitting the guard posted on the company site.</li>
            <li> Makes me snore more, so the hubby tells me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been able to do so.  </li>
            <li> However, my jaw hurt more than ever, and it continued to click and pop throughout the day.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not buying any more of these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;things</li>
            <li> This could lead to jaw pain &amp; even more TMJ issues.</li>
            <li> It may take a couple of times to get the fitting</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to shape the mouthpiece to my fitting</li>
            <li> no matter how many times I tried (which I did 5 times).</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep and this has been going on for many years.</li>
            <li> The fitting process is better and easier for The Doctor&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and she OK&#x27;d it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost like it could do a lot more damage to my jaw than my teeth could do on their own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM</li>
            <li> hurts more if I wear this product overnight.</li>
            <li> Much better than Plackers brand.</li>
            <li> It ended up fitting but was still way too bulky.</li>
            <li> (so many reviews scared me about the molding process)-</li>
            <li> Im sure it will do the trick for the time being</li>
            <li> I have gone through many nightgaurds.</li>
            <li> My teeth would have a lot more edges on them.</li>
            <li> It molded to my teeth perfectly after following the directions..</li>
            <li> I was able to fall asleep again &amp; woke up with a bit of relief in my jaw.  </li>
            <li> so I did have to cut it a bit to make it more comfortably fitting.  </li>
            <li> I admit, I haven&#x27;t used it two nights in a row, and I&#x27;m sure if I did that, it would relieve most if not all of my jaw pain.</li>
            <li> Others may be satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I WAS able to sleep with it without feeling like I was choking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Knowing that would be more than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li> This mouth guard doesn&#x27;t fit all!</li>
            <li> tax thinking it was better than a $5 one.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off with a sports mouth guard.</li>
            <li> While this is my third time to purchase, this is an absolutely wonderful product and does the job as it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I have to get used to but way better than grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> These work much better for me than the flimsy type that has a flexible front.  </li>
            <li> This nightguard is much better for me.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions for fitting and it stays in by itself, and helps with my severe jaw-clenching at night.</li>
            <li> for my own personal experience with this night guard, I followed the directions as instructed, and I was able to fit the night guard perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a different brand that worked perfectly</li>
            <li> So much better than paying the $400 my dentist wanted for a custom night guard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s tricky to mold; most guards have a groove in the front to position between your front teeth - this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wear a nightguard most nights for teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> it prevents my teeth from looking more rotten at the bottom front.</li>
            <li> My teeth are safe and my destist approves.</li>
            <li> This product may work better for someone with a wider mouth.</li>
            <li> you may have to remold it as many suggested.</li>
            <li> Nice fit.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is a bit &#x27;gummy&#x27; and squishy, which can cause more problems with clenching</li>
            <li> The product now feels a lot better and keeps me from clenching my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> It is better to go without a guard than to use this one.</li>
            <li> Fits great and very comfy.</li>
            <li> Admitedly, I have not tried that many semi-permanent guard, but the reasons I like this one are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than spending $600 for a bite guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Maybe for some people, they work okay, but I had difficulty getting them fitted for my teeth after&lt;br /&gt;following</li>
            <li> He said there was nothing he could do for my gum erosion but that eventually I would need more root canals -</li>
            <li> got this to try and love it.</li>
            <li> The guard has a gel layer that molds to the top row of your teeth and stays there no matter what.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work, but it does.  </li>
            <li> but couldn&#x27;t mold the material up to the top of my teeth/gum line in the front.&lt;br /&gt;The product</li>
            <li> Works as stated just wondering if i grind more with this thing in.. ehh</li>
            <li> Follow the directions for fitting.  </li>
            <li> Amazon definitely has the best price on this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many a nightguard, and this one is the easiest to form, and the most comfortable when wearing!</li>
            <li> It also alleviates the front rim on the top where I would grind the most</li>
            <li> Could have used better instructions; had to repeat sizing procedure.  </li>
            <li> Priced appropriately.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> You better off giving The Doctor&#x27;s Guard company $20.00 dlls and forget about it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> so i bought two more on sale.</li>
            <li> , I have mastered the fitting process and all I can say is they do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I was extremely satisfied with the refund policy even though the product was not for me.</li>
            <li> If my mouth opens (like most people does when they&#x27;re sleeping), it falls out or gets out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also tried many times to refit and it doesn&#x27;t re-mold.  </li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve put this 20 bucks towards a custom fitting at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> , I noticed that It made me produce more saliva in my mouth as if my mouth thought I had food in it.</li>
            <li> have not needed to redo the fitting procedure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried fitting again.  </li>
            <li> I had some extra practice with these, as my dog thought it was the world&#x27;s best chew toy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problem fitting it.</li>
            <li> I still think the design could be improved a bit, but it&#x27;s already better than it was.</li>
            <li> I am able to use it every night and not wake up feeling like I need to throw up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but still bulky.</li>
            <li> I read the steps through a couple more times to make sure &amp; got everything set up to mold it to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can sure feel a difference in my jaw if I don&#x27;t wear it for a night or two.</li>
            <li> It fits OK</li>
            <li> I have gotten many of these to prevent my grinding problem because I didn&#x27;t trust the $600 dentist one.</li>
            <li> I love these night guards.</li>
            <li> The $500 ones the dentist makes are probably better.</li>
            <li> Eh this is OK as a temporary stop-gap.  </li>
            <li> I found a much better solution here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They used to include stove top</li>
            <li> This is more durable than the ones you buy at the dentist for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the best part: headaches are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty handy person, I do all sorts of crafts, stained glass, pottery, sewing, needle work, so I am adept at using my hands and fingers to create.  </li>
            <li> Works best if your teeth are pretty straight.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is easy to mold into your teeth and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> So, now, what&#x27;s great is that normally I wake up with my molars hurting and since wearing this nightguard, my teeth pain is gone.</li>
            <li> I was able to create a perfect fit after a second try.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even realize its in my mouth at night which is a pretty good recommendation.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and precise and the fit is excellent.</li>
            <li> Ive never tried one of these before so as my first one I would say its a good one.</li>
            <li> This is a great substitute until you can get a new one.  </li>
            <li> It is better than spending $500 for a dentist to do the job more accurately.  </li>
            <li> Fitting was easy and well documented.</li>
            <li> The fitting instructions are quite good--thorough and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> instead and was able to mold this easily.</li>
            <li> You can spend more, but I can imagine getting a better fit or simpler process for making \\&quot;personalized\\&quot; than what they do.  </li>
            <li> Its of course not the most comfortable thing in the world but its not terrible.</li>
            <li> I am sure that their are slimmer and more comfortable one out there</li>
            <li> know this is suuuper cheap, but I would love it better if it was longer.</li>
            <li> It fit nicely after the molding process, but just wasn&#x27;t as comfortable as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Better because its much cheaper and still does a good job.</li>
            <li> Definitely more comfortable and unobtrusive than most mouthgaurds I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This one is the best because it&#x27;s the most minimal.  </li>
            <li> For us, the most important part was shaping the material up onto the roof of the mouth, which provides more suction holding power.  </li>
            <li> The isntructions are very detailed and accurate</li>
            <li> Comfortable, very easy to fit.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, easy to get that custom fit at home.</li>
            <li> The easiest &amp; most comfortable guard to make.  </li>
            <li> Got it, he followed the directions completely and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use fingers to mold the product at the roof of the mouth and rear teeth for snug fit.</li>
            <li> whichever is more comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consulted a representative via telephone who said to try it two more times in boiled water to see if the fit would improve.  </li>
            <li> I followed the fitting instructions precisely, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> but it has been a great help with grinding thus far</li>
            <li> This cost $17 and is probably more comfortable than the rigid plexiglass piece he makes.</li>
            <li> Did re-heat on one side to get a better fit</li>
            <li> I have to go through the fitting process twice before I get the fit I want</li>
            <li> These are the most comfortable night guards I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> but after she got used to it, it was comfortable and she was able to sleep with it all night.  </li>
            <li> And thus, it appears you must be skilled to simultaneously and precisely manipulate, adjust, press, position, hold, squeeze, suck, ect.. .</li>
            <li> Got a good fit on the first try.  </li>
            <li> Works great - saved me $800, which my dentist wanted to replace my old night guard.  </li>
            <li> If padding/softness is more important to you than bulkiness, you&#x27;ll probably prefer this one.</li>
            <li> so it is more comfortable, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great alternative for someone like myself who cannot afford one made by a professional.</li>
            <li> There are others out there that fit and work much better for me than this one.</li>
            <li> The front has been redesigned also and is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> and they say you can get another one free if you screw up the process of heating it up and fitting it...</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s more comfortable than the one</li>
            <li> I have had professional night guards and crappy &amp;#34;2 for 1&amp;#34;s bought at CVS, and this night guard has been great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked great for a month so far, and hasn&#x27;t worn out at all.</li>
            <li> Like most people buying this product, I was looking for a night guard after my dentist said I grind my teeth and quoted me $500 for a custom fit one.</li>
            <li> This one is significantly more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and work just as well or better.</li>
            <li> The instructions go to great length &amp; frequently repeat to follow the steps to the letter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will get more comfortable as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I think immersing it in boiling water would have made a better fit, but the instructions didn&#x27;t mcall for that.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and does it at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Directions are good and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;3 minutes in the microwave&amp;#34; means absolutely nothing instructional wise, since there are 500, 600, 700, 800, and 1000+ watt microwaves, and each one&#x27;s time will vary.</li>
            <li> The instructions make fitting this thing sound easy, it is anything but easy.  </li>
            <li> good news is that they are super easy to customize and I think it&#x27;s actually a fun project</li>
            <li> Be sure to soften it in very hot boiling water before fitting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do better and the product will fit into my mouth completely fine.</li>
            <li> It molds perfectly to my mouth and lasts for months as long as you keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Overall good for the grinding issue though!</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I knew a friendly dental assistant would be able to mold it to my mouth.</li>
            <li> Cool way to save your teeth!</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth from grinding and stays in place at night.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to either clean it more thoroughly than brushing every so often, or replace it over time-</li>
            <li> Easy.  </li>
            <li> and I found it easy to mold.</li>
            <li> It was easy to mold when boiled on the stove and then bit.</li>
            <li> easy.</li>
            <li> easy.</li>
            <li> It was fairly easy to get fitted.  </li>
            <li> Once fitted (instructions are easy, I&#x27;ll give it up for that)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mold</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to mold.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and am using it.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to mold to my mouth.</li>
            <li> As an at home use product, it is really easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust to my bite.  </li>
            <li> Easy to mold/</li>
            <li> Casting of teeth impression was easy and did work as advertised, but it is a mouthful.</li>
            <li> It would be easy to trim if required.</li>
            <li> It does not mold to the mouth easily.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep as easy</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars for these reasons as I kept biting through thinner guards that were easy on the jaw and spitting out thicker ones in my sleep.</li>
            <li> I adjusted to using it very quickly, in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to mold and fits my mouth without falling out.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut mine like a J cuz of the shape of my teeth/mouth, it was easy to do.</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy, but ensure you follow them step-by-step.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to shape and trim.</li>
            <li> Easy to form.</li>
            <li> We had to heat it up about three times to get the ideal fit, but I think it will go faster next time.  </li>
            <li> After a visit to the dentist, he strongly recommended that I get a mouth guard because I was grinding my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> But far superior than many others tried.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t leach onto your teeth as strong but if you are grinding your teeth, it will stay in.</li>
            <li> Would be perfect except for the fact it is too narrow to fit either my top or bottom</li>
            <li> The thing won&#x27;t fit securely in my mouth -- falls out despite doing the boiling and fitting and molding precisely as per instructions.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is good for some people, also sure there are some like me who weren&#x27;t aware of the new model, so-be advised.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit your mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I got out my magnifying glass and read the fine print on the side of the box.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fine in the morning</li>
            <li> It works just fine on my bottom teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works just fine on my bottom teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I slept fine through the night.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and it works fine.</li>
            <li> and it did fine.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use, I was nervous about the fit</li>
            <li> Easy to prepare, and so comfortable.  </li>
            <li> and you should get it just fine.</li>
            <li> this is gonna work just fine.....</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to fit.</li>
            <li> The Doc&#x27;s nightguard was easy to fit and you can refit it, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve remolded twice and it seems fine.</li>
            <li> find this product comfortable to use, easy to mold</li>
            <li> I purchased this item without reading the fine print.  </li>
            <li> So easy to custom fit.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, mold, fit.  </li>
            <li> For temporary use, these might be fine.</li>
            <li> and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item so easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy to mold and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> But yes, in a pinch, this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a try and it felt fine at night.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and fitting it was a breeze.</li>
            <li> but it was fairly easy to mold and align well for a perfect tight fit.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to mold before I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I purchased a large Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard and it fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> And I got a large and it was huge, so medium actually worked best for me.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions carefully, it really does make for a nice fit.</li>
            <li> Felt like a huge wad of gum in my mouth.</li>
            <li> After that it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is a huge improvement from not having anything.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t need a huge review.</li>
            <li> This is relatively comfortable, and has been an overall great product, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the great product.</li>
            <li> Fingers crossed it will somehow miraculously fit this time around.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and durable.</li>
            <li> The chips keep needing to be filled and then I keep chipping the fillings.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap store brands, like</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s comfortable this way</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that comfortable</li>
            <li> The fit also doesn&#x27;t hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can speak well with it, it&#x27;s slim and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Even after I fit it, it would not stay in my mouth at night.....</li>
            <li> If doesn&#x27;t fit, repeat procedure with 20 seconds in boiling water...</li>
            <li> Just a hassle creating the custom fit mold sometimes.</li>
            <li> They changed out it was made and now it won&#x27;t fit my mouth at all.</li>
            <li> My dentist offered to fit me with a nightguard, but as a twenty-something there was no way i was going to spend hundreds of dollars on one.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions to make this fit</li>
            <li> The Nightguard was reasonably comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Follow them closely and precisely.  </li>
            <li> Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit.</li>
            <li> Once you fit it to your mouth it comfortable.</li>
            <li> I got this night guard to replace a professionally-made one that no longer fit.</li>
            <li> I understand now why it was so cheap</li>
            <li> Well worth the price (and better than the $500 quoted from the dentist).  </li>
            <li> Comfortable when sleeping</li>
            <li> They said cheaper kinds wouldn&#x27;t be as comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, and did not slip out or move at all while I slept.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just too cheap with my time and money to get one from my dentist.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me even after having a replacement night guard was issued and also after six attempts to custom fit it.</li>
            <li> I could not get this one to fit and hold on to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Tried to reheat but still doesn&#x27;t fit right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they will send you a FREE replacement nightguard and also offer help on molding it if you require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap but serves the purpose.  </li>
            <li> You may need to buy 2-3 per year, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than getting one fit by a money-hungry dentist.</li>
            <li> One size does not always fit all.</li>
            <li> I had to heat mine up twice to get it to fit</li>
            <li> It stays in place and is comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> Could not get a comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li> It help me to stop make sound while I sleep.  </li>
            <li> After I use this problem, my husband never hear any sound from my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> The one from my dentist fits much better and was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and you get cheap.  </li>
            <li> fit.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to just go buy a cheap mouth guard instead.</li>
            <li> It fit well for her mouth except for the front teeth a bit</li>
            <li> She indicated she is amazed at how comfortable this is in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I really like about it is that you boil it and it fits to your own teeth, so</li>
            <li> It is BPA free, and you don&#x27;t have to spend $200 on a mouthguard - you can buy this</li>
            <li> I fit these the way I was supposed to</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve gone through two of them and although i have followed the directions, i can&#x27;t get it to fit</li>
            <li> how do i remold it to where it&#x27;s comfortable?  </li>
            <li> Could not get it to fit into mouth.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my mouth in a way that was comfortable to sleep.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> This re-expands the cushion and keeps it comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable at night!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to finally find a mouth guard that stays in my mouth all night</li>
            <li> Fit</li>
            <li> but it seems as if it isn&#x27;t comfortable...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t quite get the fit</li>
            <li> It doesnt fit well.</li>
            <li> I even heated it 2 times and cannot get it to fit my mouth.</li>
            <li> Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard Advanced Comfort instructions indicate that if you have one or</li>
            <li> I molded this product as directed, but had issues getting it to fit well.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to fit the guard four times and it will not stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Boiled it and fit it to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a Guaranteed Fit and they will send you another one... that won&#x27;t fit?</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re welcome to send me my $20 back.</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t fit like a glove.</li>
            <li> Not too bulky, but I had to try twice to get the fit.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fit my sons with for football).</li>
            <li> and I could never get it to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> I had one that I didn&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li> It might of worked, had it fit.</li>
            <li> followed the directions as precisely as I could, but just couldn&#x27;t get this to work out.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear at night.</li>
            <li> The best mouthguards out there, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li> you follow the directions, you can mold this into a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> it didnt fit well at all anyway</li>
            <li> When shaping the products to fit my teeth, I followed the directions and the product did lock onto my teeth-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the fit since it appears to be a one size</li>
            <li> I have tried to shape this to fit my mouth.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably low price for a great product.  </li>
            <li> However, it is bulkier than custom fit night guard</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t fit (</li>
            <li> My tongue is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even breathe comfortably with this</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that my dentist asked me to let him see it because-- in his opinion</li>
            <li> My GF who works in a dental office had free custom ones made for me ...</li>
            <li> But it is not as comfortable as the custom job my dentist makes from a mold of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has worn retainers for braces and night guards prepared by my dentist, I know how mouth guards are supposed to fit.</li>
            <li> Until buying this night guard, I couldn&#x27;t find any that actually fit my mouth.</li>
            <li> It was easy to mold and even easier to clean.</li>
            <li> how well it fit me after going through the process.</li>
            <li> This is inexpensive, comfortable &amp; it does the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am completely comfortable with this $17 piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t imagine that a moulded guard would make that much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in the mouth after forming it.</li>
            <li> They stay in comfortably.</li>
            <li> Make sure to soak after each use with a denture tablet to keep fresh.</li>
            <li> I tried to fit it to my mouth and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t fit well enought that it wouldn&#x27;t fall out when I opened my mouth.</li>
            <li> So comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have many porcelain crowns, so it&#x27;s essential that I wear a good nightguard to prevent severe damage to my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> I really think that it would be perfect if they made a LARGER size.</li>
            <li> Got it instead of the NTI recommended by my dentist (it would have cost over $1K), so far so good.</li>
            <li> It allows you to mould it to your teeth and for the most part, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> so I made sure I did everything right.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions through a couple of times and gathered everything I needed to make sure I could follow the steps and get the timing right.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely comfortable, very secure, and the first mouthguard that I can wear all night without finding it tossed across the room.</li>
            <li> so I got this new one and fit it so much better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably more suitable for a young child.  </li>
            <li> I followed the enclosed instructions exactly, and wasn&#x27;t able to get the protector to fit correctly - it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place, kept falling off my teeth when opening my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I tried to fit it the first time, but I shifted my teeth forward a bit while fitting it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different night guards and The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard provides the best fit and is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely be signing up for auto shipping as I&#x27;m very satisfied with each purchase.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because most of the older reviews were good.</li>
            <li> Still, despite the fact that the part of the guard OUTSIDE my teeth protrudes more than I&#x27;d like (or would be most comfortable), I still do like the night guard and wear it most</li>
            <li> and he said the same thing, he reccomended he make me one (which he&#x27;ll be doing as soon as I get my cavities filled) and said in the meantime the next best thing is an athletic nightguard that features a top and bottom guard fastened together.&lt;br /&gt;check</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I had to trim the ends a little to make it more comfortable, but once I did it worked great.</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly - and maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had some experience fitting the other</li>
            <li> The only good thing was that it&#x27;s easy to mold</li>
            <li> This Doctor&#x27;s night guard was easy to mold, it only took one try, and it has a really good grip on my teeth, did not shift even the tiniest bit overnight.</li>
            <li> The material is a soft plastic that is easily trimmed with a warm kitchen knife.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get an adequate fit on the first try, despite the detailed instructions being unclear and almost self-contradictory.  </li>
            <li> I am glad it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> After the first night he felt 100% migraine free, and hasn&#x27;t had one in over a week!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I did a good job molding it because I woke up without any problems - it stays securely attached even if you open your mouth if you follow the molding procedures correctly.  </li>
            <li> I might have done a better job during the molding process but really, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable, it stays in place all night, and I&#x27;m not worried about chewing through my teeth...</li>
            <li> and I made sure to do exactly as noted.  </li>
            <li> : Make sure you have it exactly where you want it because once you make your imprint, it&#x27;s there to stay.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, I have significant TMJ and need to use a custom made guard to avoid problems.  </li>
            <li> it is unique to you.</li>
            <li> The results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used athletic mouth guards over my lifetime and am quite familiar with how to mold them.  </li>
            <li> Not even too excited to use it again.</li>
            <li> , check to make sure the water temperature is between x and x degrees.&amp;#34; This way, we know how hot the water should</li>
            <li> I got originally-</li>
            <li> Also, as for the fitting, you have to follow the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure the plastic part is in fully boiling hot water.</li>
            <li> defeating the purpose, for sure) in order to keep from drooling on myself and to keep it from falling out, which it did the first night I used it.</li>
            <li> The plastic is thicker and thinner where it needs to be as opposed to the original that had uniform thickness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t throw it out after it didn&#x27;t seem to work at first.</li>
            <li> You may be nervous at first when it comes to fitting, just follow instructions and it will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I have a big mouth I guess :P)</li>
            <li> WHile I was very fortunate to get a good fit the first time, in terms of my bite, I did not feel that I was as successful at forming the OUTSIDE edge to conform to the outside of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but it has worked just fine from the very first night</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to clean, I just brush it with my toothbrush/paste.</li>
            <li> this thing is super comfortable and allows me to close my mouth.</li>
            <li> As a professional dental hygienist I&#x27;m very impressed with the way these specific guards are made.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a good enough fit for me to keep wearing</li>
            <li> These are super comfortable, not noticeable while sleeping and</li>
            <li> The informative insert suggests you clean your guard with Efferdent- to kill germs.</li>
            <li> keep it clean and sanitary</li>
            <li> keep it clean and sanitary</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the trick to keeping them clean.</li>
            <li> The Doctors Nightguard is super affordable, you set it up in 5 minutes and it is so comfortable, no problem falling asleep.</li>
            <li> For those users out there giving this a positive review, you are deluding yourselves into thinking that this appliance is healthy for you.</li>
            <li> I never could get it hot enough that it formed a really good bond on the top teeth.</li>
            <li> She found that using your fingers to press the guard right after the hot water to get a better fit.  </li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and this is the perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and pleased at how easy it was to \\&quot;boil and bite\\&quot; to custom fit it.  </li>
            <li> And the price was right!</li>
            <li> well she was right!</li>
            <li> My main concern before using this product if I was going to be able to sleep comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to fit, stays in place, very comfortable, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Great delivery...product as expected</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about being able to get a good custom fit and more so about being able sleep with this.</li>
            <li> and it fit comfortably the first night.  </li>
            <li> Happiness at last!</li>
            <li> 20 seconds channel side up to cool before you place in mouth...</li>
            <li> Yes, it is much cheaper than the dentist-made guard, but you may do your jaw more damage by using it.</li>
            <li> Only good thing about it is the plastic case, which my grandson loves to play with,.</li>
            <li> Then let it cool.</li>
            <li> If you have no experience in the process, it&#x27;s still possible to get a good result ...</li>
            <li> and I was able to get used to it much quicker.</li>
            <li> It might be a personal problem but still wanted to give fair warning.</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing this on amazon which I found to have the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> got a good fit the first try, but I can understand that many people would need two tries.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t want to spend too much to find out she would not be able to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li> And reasonable pricing on top of that.  </li>
            <li> Works out how it should and mine lasted a full year</li>
            <li> You can even answer the phone while wearing it and not talk like you have a mouth full of food.&lt;br /&gt;Yet</li>
            <li> But if you need a guard that is solid and a good value then I&#x27;d recommend these.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product and because of the reviews was encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s better for their bottom line, but not so much for me.</li>
            <li> I tried fitting it three times without being able to obtain a proper fit.</li>
            <li> Drop it in boiling water; let cool; insert to mold and wear.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost me much.</li>
            <li> in summary: cheap, sturdy alternative to a custom nightguard, but obviously it&#x27;s not as thin and comfortable as a custom fit one.</li>
            <li> Placed it on a plate to cool for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It really could not be better.  </li>
            <li> While fitting, I noticed it didnt have as much material to mold to my outer and inside of my teerh.  </li>
            <li> I love them so much, although I have to keep re-purchasing because I somehow lose them.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not bad...</li>
            <li> Not bad for an over the counter product though...</li>
            <li> The thing was easy to soften, but I found the guard itself to be too large to fit in and stay in my mouth at night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to follow the instructions to the letter AND to follow them very quickly to get a good fit, especially when the guard first comes out of the hot water and the bite channel is malleable.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, good price, new condition.</li>
            <li> This nightguard was easy to mold and they fit very well.</li>
            <li> It makes no sense to me why this product doesn&#x27;t come with a huge warning right on the front of the box.</li>
            <li> I can never get this mouth guard to fit right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years, if you fit it right, there aren&#x27;t any problems with it staying in place all night.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get the fit right and get it to stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Should have stayed with the 1st fit even though it wasn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to fit right, after 4 times I just gave up</li>
            <li> how am i supposed to get it to fit right?  </li>
            <li> I tried remolding it over and over and it just never wanted to fit right</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to get the right fit and used the guard for one night.  </li>
            <li> I never got this to fit right.  </li>
            <li> fit right.</li>
            <li> IF you get the fit right.</li>
            <li> It was easy to re-fit the mouth guard after I messed up on the first try.</li>
            <li> It is very large, and even after boiling it and shaping it to my teeth, I felt that it didn&#x27;t fit me.</li>
            <li> last one lasted forever, great price, easy fit, comfortable, simple</li>
            <li> other issues I&#x27;ve experienced is aching teeth</li>
            <li> It seems from the reviews that it works great for some people &amp; doesn&#x27;t work for other people.  </li>
            <li> This product is the most comfortable and natural mouth guard I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best biteguard I&#x27;ve found, after trying 5 different versions from different manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> Many did not have enough material on the sides and wouldn&#x27;t grip my molars to keep the guard attached to my top teeth.</li>
            <li> Before wearing a nightguard I&#x27;d be lucky going 2 nights in a row without waking up with a headache.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li> you could get a away with a quick toothbrush scrubbing of the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I wore it the first night and thought ok this is pretty neat.</li>
            <li> I made three attempts at molding it to fit my teeth but still could not get quite what I would call a fit that anyone could reasonably get used to .  </li>
            <li> They last me about a year, and at this price it&#x27;ll take many many years before I reach $500.</li>
            <li> , you will love this, takes a few nights to break it in but its good</li>
            <li> so it wears out quickly.</li>
            <li> I spent about an hour sizing and resizing this and never got a good fit.  </li>
            <li> It was easy enough to mold it using the hot water, but it really wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, so glad I found it</li>
            <li> This plastic is much softer and has more shock absorption, but I still ground right through it.</li>
            <li> My dentist relatives suggest that these tend to be easier to get right, because if a top night guard doesn&#x27;t fit right, it starts moving around the bones in your head and has more potential to cause jaw problems and headaches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more comfortable than the first because the guard doesn&#x27;t go up that high.</li>
            <li> I used it anyway, which just led to my jaw hurting more than it normally does when I wake up.</li>
            <li> You do have to do a lot of pressing on the guard while molding it to make sure you end up with a secure fit around your back teeth and the roof of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> This may be a great product for average size humans, but if you have an ogre head like I do, it may be too small/narrow.  </li>
            <li> For a person with Trigeminal Neuralgia is a cheap option, and a good option, but is better no wait to late with the problem for get one of this.</li>
            <li> I tried other mouth guards, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, easy to mold yourself and at night its easy to forget its in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is however super functional, easy to mold and really does help.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s particularly choke-on-able and even though I followed the instructions to the absolute letter, even though I tried it 3 times in about 30 minutes (which it clearly states you can do by re-boiling and re-molding if the first fit isn&#x27;t great)</li>
            <li> The price here is about half of what you find at Walmart, so for that it is great.</li>
            <li> As others have noted it is not quite easy to fit, so you will most likely ruin the first one learning.</li>
            <li> It is very durable and much better and a hell of a lot cheaper than the one my dentist made for me when I first needed to wear these guards at night.</li>
            <li> You shipped it fast and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this first in 2011.  </li>
            <li> I have even had a number of occlusion plates made at the dentist,which I have begun to chew through on the first night!</li>
            <li> suspected that there had to be a cheaper (much cheaper) version that worked like my old high school football teeth guards: boil and bite into it for a good fit.</li>
            <li> The first three times I tried to fit it - it didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> First off, it took 3 times before I could get the fit right.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions EXACTLY, and the fit was just right.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars except that the fitting process can be tricky and I normally have to do it twice before I get it right.</li>
            <li> Fitting it was fairly easy although it did take us a second attempt.</li>
            <li> The custom fitting process is well described and easy to follow (similar to the dozens of mouth guards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super petite and was worried that the night guard would be too big, but it fit perfectly with little adjustments.</li>
            <li> If you follow the (easy) directions, you&#x27;ll mold the mouth guard to fit securely on your teeth to where they won&#x27;t fall off if you open your mouth.  </li>
            <li> and it was fine but really flimsy.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve tried a few nighttime mouth guard brands before, most notably the Dentek Pro Sleep Easy Dental Guard.  </li>
            <li> It worked great at night, no trouble breathing or closing my mouth (make sure you press front into front teeth slightly when forming it).</li>
            <li> Once I got a good tight fit</li>
            <li> If you take a little time to learn the process and learn what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish, before you start boiling the water and melting the bite mold, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> This one is tougher which is great, but I look a little like a football player at bedtime.</li>
            <li> just great cost is little high&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fit&#x27;s fine when I go to bed, but loosens up as I sleep, then falls completely out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The idea might be good but only a certain part of the guard is moldable to your mouth.</li>
            <li> you just have to reheat and then after fitting to your teeth, take it out and squeeze the side a little to make it fit more snug.</li>
            <li> The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced is easily and quickly fitted exactly to my mouth, directions are clear and concise, and I am able to use it every night without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> Two tips can help a lot in getting a good fit- to make sure the front edge of the guard is as close as possible to the teeth, and to push up hard with your thumbs, as the provided illustration suggests, on the back in order to ensure a good fit that doesn&#x27;t either push out your front lip or keep your mouth agape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the fit and function of this sleeping mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Working very well, fits comfortably within my mouth, and stays in place overnight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit quite as well as the ones that my dentist makes, but it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> much too bulky to be comfortable; it made me gag.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions, but didn&#x27;t fit very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not round like a mouth is supposed to be, it&#x27;s more V shaped.</li>
            <li> Your jaw health is worth a visit to the dentist-</li>
            <li> I think I will try to have a professional one made and bite the bullet on costs to have a more restful sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, and I can sleep better using it than a one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Was it worth the trade off?</li>
            <li> and whether or not it&#x27;s safe to chew on soft plastic every night for years on end.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s comfortable, I was likely to wear it more often in the beginning</li>
            <li> I had to boil this several times before I was able to get a fit that worked.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find how many of my co-workers use dental protectors.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it much more than that unless your grinding is quite modest.</li>
            <li> I really think it worked best when I left it in the latter location.</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for awhile and is OK but not as nearly as comfortable as the custom fitted one I later got from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Stays in place well, seems durable ( two weeks use so far), and okay for speaking.</li>
            <li> The front lip of this appliance is absurdly narrow and if you don&#x27;t get it to fit perfectly, your bite will be off and it will screw up your mouth possibly causing TMJ.</li>
            <li> Professionally made night guards are pricey, but there is a reason - they work, they fit and they will save your teeth!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep ordering when needed, because the comfort is worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I got my&#x27;s money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> After that it definitely did work effectively with clenching.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to stop me from grinding and not be so annoyed during the night that I spit it out.</li>
            <li> Me, my dentist, and my perio  agree it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So far, it is a much better value.</li>
            <li> It stills seems a bit overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it does cost a fraction of what the dentist charges, and it does work so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t get warm enough.  </li>
            <li> (Can you actually drown in your own saliva?</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s a much better fit vs. prior nighttime mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying for around $20.</li>
            <li> well worth it to protect your teeth from the damage of night grinding.</li>
            <li> It has however relieved some of the jaw pain that I was experiencing each morning from my night grinding, and that has made it worth it.</li>
            <li> I finally did it and am satisfied with the fit and the fact that it prevents teeth grinding.  </li>
            <li> so far, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided it was worth a try for the money.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to my mouth though at night, it ends up in the middle of my teeth, but in any case its effective and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried twice to complain on their own website and it goes to a blank screen.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any success in the 3 times</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried another one from Amazon that comes with a plastic tray to aid in fitting it to ones mouth and that one has been far easier to get working though it has had its problems as well.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Better than the old model, as it&#x27;s thinner.</li>
            <li> It stays in place and kind of &#x27;sticks&#x27; to my upper teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely made, and will last.  </li>
            <li> I recently started grinding my teeth/clenching at night (stress, I&#x27;m sure of it) and decided to get one of these sexy mouth guards I have heard so much about.</li>
            <li> I found the instructions very helpful, but also found that I was happy that I followed them carefully.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it is a temporary product; it will wear out after a couple months, but for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> #34;How is that going to fit my mouth?&amp;#34; It didn&#x27;t come anywhere close to fitting properly</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is much smaller and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is definitely easy and I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Might as well just save up for the real thing, as if this thing doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li> Other than that, as I said earlier great fit and comfortable.</li>
            <li> and she was able to remold my original NTI so that I could wear it again and after only two nights with my NTI-</li>
            <li> a cheap night guard, this little guy does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> This really must be heated in hot water for a good fit, it took me two tries</li>
            <li> Easy to shape to your own mouth, takes less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> THey last  a long time and fit great.  </li>
            <li> And the funny thing is that I didn&#x27;t perform the forming process 100% correctly so the next Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard I buy will probably feel even more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Given the current price it&#x27;s probably a good idea to replace with a new one more frequently.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It falls right out.  </li>
            <li> I made an appointment right after trying this.</li>
            <li> so I bought this product because the price was right.</li>
            <li> right (or screw up the process).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have remolded it about four times, and I just can&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li> It works but didn&#x27;t mold quite right and falls out of my mouth while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I started wearing it right away.</li>
            <li> That is what I need and price is right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky &amp; my mouth doesn&#x27;t close right because of it&#x27;s bulk.  </li>
            <li> Feels like it fits right, but won&#x27;t stay on my teeth.</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> unless or until i can get the ones i have to work right.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Falls right out no matter</li>
            <li> The reason I give it 2 stars instead of just one is that it works as promised--if done right</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I have severe TMJ to the point that I could no longer eat without clicking, pain and dislocation of my jaw, right side.</li>
            <li> boiling process that you have to go through, however, I didn&#x27;t get quite right at first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it get it just right.  </li>
            <li> His receptionist recommended this, and I&#x27;m right grateful.</li>
            <li> and it still wasn&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li> For the money, it is the right product..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really can&#x27;t go in much more detail other than that, it feels pretty good quality, the fit has stayed exact for over two weeks, definitely worth it if you grind your teeth, or have jaw pain, or possibly both like me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can say anything positive about this product!</li>
            <li> I also had to call the Manufacturer direct once when I had a problem with the fitting, and they were very helpful, resolving the problem quickly.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the excess saliva issue was overwhelming since I&#x27;m more prone to salivating than the average person (according to my dentist and orthodontist).</li>
            <li> Was not able to get a good fit.</li>
            <li> Just too small for a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> I went with a Sleep Right guard that has a small band on the front portion of the teeth (doesn&#x27;t wrap all the way around all the teeth - just on the molars) and that worked great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to mold to my teeth by following the detailed directions included.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit, just a simple boil and bite like any sports mouth guard.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last forever, but they are comfortable and easy to mold.</li>
            <li> doesnt mold easy &amp; even then wont fit well, especially with the front teeth</li>
            <li> bought this because I was grinding my teeth and my teeth were becoming sensitive.  </li>
            <li> But, shortly after I decided to retire my $425 dentist fitted rigid plastic night guard that no longer fit as good and the plastic too rigid for my grinding.&lt;br /&gt;After these 9 years I am finally beginning to wear this one out.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered on time, was much cheaper than professional nightguards, but from another side it does not fit my jaw perfectly.</li>
            <li> Yes, I clench/grind heavily, so for this Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard Advance to work is amazing to me!  </li>
            <li> Easy to mold, comfortable to wear, easily cleaned with half a denture cleaner tab.</li>
            <li> But My Wife says that the very first night that I almost stopped snoring, ( I never Snore), and My jaw muscles are starting to feel better in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for your guard..</li>
            <li> Sleeping with a guard is still not fun, but this one is just as good as the dentist&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> It is tricky to fit, and I think I could have done a better job on that, but it still doesn&#x27;t come loose, and I haven&#x27;t even begun to chew through it after a couple of weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same pair, still going strong!</li>
            <li> The best fit so far for a small adult mouth.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it right the first or fifth time, you can start over again, no need to throw it out and buy another one.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend buying this as a cheaper option!</li>
            <li> And, if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, you can heat it up and try again.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get the bite quite right on the first try, you can even re-do it.</li>
            <li> It will work if you have an assistant to exactly time each step, and press everything just right.</li>
            <li> Tried it the first night, don&#x27;t think I got set right for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> How many hours do I have to bite this thing for how many months everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s probably good to note that I&#x27;m an adult female with a semi-narrow jaw line.</li>
            <li> It fit much better, had a harder bottom, and you boiled it.  </li>
            <li> I got it quickly from Amazon, took a couple of minutes to read the instructions, and got ready to do it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to boil them multiple times to get them to fit, but it does eventually fit.</li>
            <li> And this guard really helps me at a tremendously lower price than getting one from a dentist.</li>
            <li> Directions are clear and easy to follow to mold to mouth.</li>
            <li> The good news was Amazon has the guard at half the price.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see much difference in fit and feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than the one my dentist sells, is more comfortable, and lasts about as long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to redo the fitting twice to get it right despite following the instructions to the letter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now to be honest I did wake up one morning with the guard loose</li>
            <li> Not easy to form to teeth, better off buying one that does not require fitting to mouth.</li>
            <li> Its not bulky like other ones and not super thin like its the perfect size and its super easy to mold to your own teeth!</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> i took the other poster&#x27;s advice and molded it to my bottom teeth, and it feels more secure that way.  </li>
            <li> Was easy to fit as advertised but final apparatus is very bulky.</li>
            <li> I expect this is because the mold is more important and trickier due to the lack of bulk of the guard.</li>
            <li> The fitting process takes less than 10 minutes and once complete, the protector goes in and stays in place nicely.</li>
            <li> I have always had a teeth grinding problem at night and recently it because severe to the point where my some of my teeth were chipping &#x3D;[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The molding of the product was super easy.</li>
            <li> instructions were pretty clear, although I didnt get a good tight fit the first time</li>
            <li> If you need a night guard, I recommend just finding a way to get a professional one, there is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I cashed in the certificate for a replacement at a local store but haven&#x27;t tried fitting the replacement protector yet.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li> I went back to my dentist and ordered a custom nightguard, which I love.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that I havent been able to fall asleep with it in.</li>
            <li> It only wraps around your top teeth but not your front ones.</li>
            <li> you have TMJ, discuss this product with your dentist first.</li>
            <li> I sleep with an upper and lower now, and this works much better for me than the double-biteguard, which always leaves my gums swollen and hurting by morning.</li>
            <li> Tossed the guard the first week.</li>
            <li> Once you prep to have it mold to your mouth and place it into your mouth the first time.</li>
            <li> I have been told that sounds similar to a child violently striking a bow against a violin string</li>
            <li> Doctor said all my teeth had shifted and that the only touching teeth were my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> so I was hesitant the first night I used it.  </li>
            <li> : Though the instructions say that this is for your top teeth only, I made a bottom night guard.</li>
            <li> First night I tried the Grind Guard and could not close my mouth well.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and considering that it wasn&#x27;t my first time molding a night guard</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> , no discomfort at first i kept messing with it</li>
            <li> When the first one fell apart, I purchased another one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I did exactly as the instructions said &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t mold.</li>
            <li> I rinse the guard every morning when I wake up with some hot water and put it in its case.</li>
            <li> so I had to dunk it again in the hot water and start over.</li>
            <li> The first night was kind of rough.</li>
            <li> Second night went better.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions pretty close</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to refer back to them when going through the fitting process.  </li>
            <li> However, none of the more recent (2015) reviews were.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> just had my first crown done just before I got this guard.</li>
            <li> just had my first crown done just before I got this guard.</li>
            <li> I AM NOW WEARING MY FIRST  DOCTORS NIGHT GUARD FOR GRINDING TEETH.</li>
            <li> and I sure didn&#x27;t want to spend another several hundred to replace it.</li>
            <li> and I am waking up w/out headaches for the first time in</li>
            <li> but this is THE ONLY ONE that stays put and has protected my teeth through many years now.</li>
            <li> so you have the directions to refer to when you need to dunk this thing in the hot water again to re-seat it in against your teeth).</li>
            <li> I would like to try to remold it up higher in the front in the hopes of thinning it out.</li>
            <li> (but, I don&#x27;t really snore!)</li>
            <li> The old saying is you pay cheap</li>
            <li> so far i dont feel any pain with my custom fit.</li>
            <li> After a week or two of wearing this, I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel!</li>
            <li> There was some difficulty fitting it forward enough.  </li>
            <li> I am Fire Fighter, Married, Mom of 4...</li>
            <li> well, the fitting is the same - boil and bite.</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just molded my second, and have 3 more or order just in case.</li>
            <li> I tend to sleep more with my mouth open as a result of using it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m guessing this product is for light grinders looking to avoid gum recession not heavy grinders doing damage control</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions *exactly</li>
            <li> I actually sanded the excess on a belt sander and it is better.</li>
            <li> The first over the counter night brace that did the job like a professionionaly fitted night brace.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> followed the directions EXACTLY</li>
            <li> The fitting process was simple.</li>
            <li> A portion hung off my back molars, and I was hoping for something that would allow my teeth to slide more as I slept to relieve the torque that can occur with teeth clenching.</li>
            <li> Actually this fits better than the one I paid $350</li>
            <li> Amazon has them so much cheaper (at $16) than $35 at CVS!  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions exactly, and read them in advance.  </li>
            <li> Also, be sure not to let the mouthguard touch anything but your fingers when it is sticky and melty inside, or the inner goo will stick and stretch.</li>
            <li> This product really helped me to save my teeth!</li>
            <li> * Pretty sturdy case&lt;br /</li>
            <li> my first breaks down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and don&#x27;t understand why it feels so bulky.</li>
            <li> Laying in bed the first night i thought:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went in the trash after the first week.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and don&#x27;t walk up with headaches and face pain if I remember to put this in.</li>
            <li> (I know the dentist guard is a lot of--too much-- $$$!)</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t gonna last me probably more than a year.</li>
            <li> We placed the mouth guard in hot water to soften so she could mold it in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Out of desperation I tried this one &amp; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I was now more determined to try to sleep with this, or that this one is softer than the dentists one, but I was able to fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> The first night it felt too bulky &amp; I woke up with a headache.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the first time I set it, but just reheated in a mug and fine-tuned it.</li>
            <li> I tried this over the counter guard first.  </li>
            <li> However, I have gone back to the old one because the fit is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Boiling then form the guard on my teeth was not difficult.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this nightguard numerous times, and have been satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> After the first night of wearing it, I fully anticipated that I would pull it out in my sleep and find it on the floor.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like me or being softened in hot water.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this item when I first started using it, and I&#x27;m still not entirely sold.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do - protect your teeth from nighttime grinding.</li>
            <li> Also, it is still hot after you have waited the instructed 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> We followed the directions exactly and it just kept falling out of my husbands mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried to make this work but after fitting it several times, I would wake up in the morning thinking my teeth were going to fall out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bulky as compared to the one you get in the dentists office and thinner too I bit through it on first night.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve tried, but couldn&#x27;t imagine having to wear each night.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night which causes severe neck and head aches upon waking and this was the cheap alternative to getting a professional mouth guard made.</li>
            <li> After following the instructions, I was able to mold the mouth guard to my teeth and use it, without the night drooling.</li>
            <li> but after the first night, the palate part of the guard molded to the shape of the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> It fell out the first night (getting used to it), but after that, no problem.</li>
            <li> I mangled the first one</li>
            <li> Sure beats the $800 estimate my dentist have me for a night guard that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> exactly that it comes with</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind it!</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely recommend this to any of my friends!</li>
            <li> But it works well and one always change the shape using hot water.</li>
            <li> My first attempt to remedy this was by getting a custom made night guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> (I did buy my first two from the dentist.. about $350 each.)  </li>
            <li> No wonder the real thing costs over $300!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I followed the procedure for molding exactly</li>
            <li> B008YEMVSI DenTek Professional Fit Dental Guard Maximum Protection For Nighttime Teeth Grinding (Bruxism) With 1-year Protection Guarantee]]</li>
            <li> /&gt;The package is too fancy should have two or three in one such package for the&lt;br /&gt;money or slightly more.</li>
            <li> I followed the instruction step by step on how to make one that fits exactly onto your teeth and</li>
            <li> I got it at first try</li>
            <li> this is something I was willing to try to help stop my snoring.  </li>
            <li> if I can find the custom job in the first place).  </li>
            <li> followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> #34;WHY does a dental mouthpiece cost so much?&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> This is the best on the market--I wear it every night with out fail.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hot water.</li>
            <li> But that night it actually was a lot more snug.  </li>
            <li> Second try may have been better.</li>
            <li> I Followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> I first thought this product wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The reason I mention it is the extra \\&quot;mold\\&quot; material that is placed on the roof of your mouth while you \\&quot;suck/vacuum/bite\\&quot; in the process makes the guard fit really well and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> My first thought however upon opening the box was &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this was my first time sleeping with a dental guard, I felt like it took a couple of weeks for me to get used to it throughout the night.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t expect this to hold up as well as it has.</li>
            <li> Still, I like the mix of soft fit with a tougher bottom and switching out every 6 months as they recommend is working well for me.</li>
            <li> stopped using this as soon as a was able to visit a Dentist for a proper night guard.</li>
            <li> Really?!?  </li>
            <li> Quite frankly -- and I&#x27;m not being facetious or melodramatic -- I&#x27;d recommend that anyone thinking about buying this should first try a $2 mouth guard like high-school football players use.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Dentists charge an arm and a leg to fit the mouth guard professionally.  </li>
            <li> I lost the first one..</li>
            <li> Stays in place all night, and is not difficult to mold.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one first.  </li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly and</li>
            <li> This is my first one</li>
            <li> They only last about 6 months for me, but they&#x27;re easy to fit and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;t less bulky and more comfortable than I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Wished they put less gel inside to accommodate for the expansion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is cheap and works ok for my mouth.</li>
            <li> You can either do the quick fit method using the microwave or use the traditional method using a saucepan on the stovetop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The primary difference is that it contains less material which is supposed to be better.</li>
            <li> Be very precise when you shape these to fit your teeth, make sure the front two teeth are at the very edge and after you bite down and suck in use your fingers to further mold the sides.</li>
            <li> Despite following the directions very carefully, I could not get a good fit.</li>
            <li> Took numerous attempts to get a decent fit and after that, it still didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> The ideal guard would be soft on top and bottom with the hard piece in the middle.</li>
            <li> The night guard is very hard to get a good fit.  </li>
            <li> My old one, lost recently, was the cheaper Rite Aid Nite protector which only had the soft part and worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to make, following the directions, though it did take three times until I got it just right.</li>
            <li> Like anything, it might take a little getting used to, but I have to admit it is way more comfortable than I could have ever imagined.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as a spare for my professionally made night guard in case I lost it.</li>
            <li> my original at myrtle beach a month ago ( was a year old).</li>
            <li> wore it for 1 week and stopped because I became more convinced that the flat bottom of it is damaging/going to damage my jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe other reviewers just did their own thing and didn&#x27;t follow the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it works its new came quick  </li>
            <li> Also, cut at an angle so the mouth guard is at a nice \\&quot;slope\\&quot; shape instead straight, rough cut off.  </li>
            <li> Easy instructions to boil in a small pot of water, cool, and fit into the mouth.</li>
            <li> If you notice any kind of discomfort or some odd sensations while using this, I&#x27;d sincerely question the product and potentially inquire with your dentist or the company if you should even be using this one.</li>
            <li> Make sure read the instructions very well before starting the process.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these things from cvs for way more than it is on amazon because i was starting to realize how much i grind my teeth at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for over a year now, and it&#x27;s still good, but starting to deteriorate from my regular grinding and clenching in my sleep.</li>
            <li> I know that your dentist mouth guard is much more expensive but the cost can always be negotiated and you will get a custom fit product and most dentist will adjust them as many times are necessary.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, it has gotten more comfortable</li>
            <li> If your mouth is narrow then I suppose it will fit ok</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;ll try the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version which appears to be all hard plastic, or if I&#x27;ll try another brand.right, because if a top night guard doesn&#x27;t fit right, it starts moving around the bones in your head and has more potential to cause jaw problems and headaches.</li>
            <li> If the mold is too large for your mouth, snip off the ends with a pair of scissors and dip it in hot water to soften the edges.</li>
            <li> these definitely won&#x27;t fit as tight as custom one&#x27;s made at a dentist office which sit right up to my gum-line, but they&#x27;re good enough especially given the tremendous cost savings!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a high success rate and using it nightly, lasted about 3 months before feeling the need to replace it.  </li>
            <li> it fits better &amp; more easily than other brands, and I notice it less.  </li>
            <li> biggest positive about this product is the durability.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty much as well as I could expect for an inexpensive, DIY solution.</li>
            <li> None of the other ones would fit securely on our teeth.  </li>
            <li> Well-made videos work better than long instructions.</li>
            <li> No More dental night protector to work far better, far more comfortably.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter and while still soft, I spent a minute or so pushing it up around my teeth with my fingers for a better fit.</li>
            <li> Considering you can usually find this on Amazon for under $20, it is a good deal and</li>
            <li> The key with this one is to be very, very careful during the fitting- be sure to follow the directions exactly as listed.</li>
            <li> Do not expect this to \\&quot;mold\\&quot; on its own if you just bite down on it</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty comfortable to  wear as long as you fit it properly, and if you can&#x27;t fit it properly they have some kind of money back guarantee, but I&#x27;ve never had to use the guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Over time, if you are as enthusiastic a chewer as I am, your teeth start to make their way down through the cushion.</li>
            <li> It was easy to mold and fit nicely, however I have a very small mouth and the actual width of the tray could not be made narrower with molding.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough height to keep it nestled on to my top teeth, even though I know I couldn&#x27;t have gotten a much closer fit from the inner, malleable material.</li>
            <li> The directions were easy to follow and the process was pretty simple, worked just fine without the wooden stick FYI.</li>
            <li> Have tried several similar products , all for same use, and this one is, by far, the best</li>
            <li> But not as comfortable as professionally created night guards by dentists, tho the price is not that much high.</li>
            <li> It has very little getting in the way in the front, which is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The end fit leaves your front teeth mostly exposed in front, so your upper lip lies comfortably flat.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to custom fit, but it is too tight.</li>
            <li> The fitting was never snug and would not stay in my mouth for very long once I fell asleep before falling out.</li>
            <li> So she tells me that she really wants me to have one because I really need it, and is willing to sell it to me for her cost, around $350.  </li>
            <li> This one is easy to use ( if you&#x27;ve ever had to boil and form a mouthguard for sports before, this works the same way), and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like i</li>
            <li> Was easy enough to find them online.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to mold.</li>
            <li> I tried it - had to search, btw, could NOT find in wal-mart/Pharmore/rite-aid etc - but amazon saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One easy boil/mold later, and I had an easy-to-wear &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; piece.</li>
            <li> It was easy enough to mold</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a quick and inexpensive alternative to a professional bite guard provided by my dentist.</li>
            <li> After following instructions, I got the device to fit pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The directions are simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to mold.  </li>
            <li> Also easy to reform the mold multiple times if mistakes are made.</li>
            <li> (if you follow the instructions) and strong enough for the job.</li>
            <li> after molding it for the second attempt, and biting it strong for a minute, the thinner part (the corner of the mouth guard) broke and already got a hole.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for my teeth grinding and it doesn&#x27;t feel like too large of an object to breath or anything.</li>
            <li> However, the guard is fairly large and I just can&#x27;t sleep with it in because of that.  </li>
            <li> After molding and remolding, this night guard is quite large and uncomfortale.</li>
            <li> I am 6 foot and 250lbs with a fairly large mouth.</li>
            <li> my jaw size (otherwise I&#x27;m a large person).  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is if you mess up the molding process beyond repair there&#x27;s a number you can call on the instruction booklet</li>
            <li> I do like this nightguard, it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of a dentists and is softer and more comfortable in the mouth,they say they don&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> (always kept fitting loose).</li>
            <li> This guard is much lighter and smaller than a sports guard so it easy to sleep with it in over night.</li>
            <li> is fine) and then popped back into your mouth.</li>
            <li> Way less bulky, and far more comfortable.</li>
            <li> With this particular item you will heat up in hot water and form it to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> A realistic thing would be to cover all the teeth, including the wisdom teeth!</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend you try this product, it really does work.</li>
            <li> The other product reviews mentioning the importance of fitting the guard to the exact instructions were very helpful</li>
            <li> This item is adjustable and comes with it&#x27;s own little case.</li>
            <li> The instructions say if you are unsuccessful the first time, you can put it back in the hot water, reheat it and wait for it to cool and shape it back to the original shape with your fingers.  </li>
            <li> hard for me to make a good mold</li>
            <li> really hard to get it to fit to your teeth and then be able to sleep with it.</li>
            <li> I tried a few others and feel like I would choke on them in my sleep since they aren&#x27;t secure, or comfortable.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge and I wasn&#x27;t used to a big piece of plastic in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried to reshape it following the directions but it didn&#x27;t make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I  really need it for my bottom teeth, so that is what I took the impression of.</li>
            <li> Then I called the manufacturer, per the instructions, and they mailed me a certificate for a free replacement, which arrived about a week later.  </li>
            <li> Gets grungy after 6 months but inexpensive enough to ditch and fit another.</li>
            <li> and I have found them to be really helpful when trying to curb my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grind as much.</li>
            <li> and it seems very durable,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all you really need because the thickness is like a bumper where you can&#x27;t close your mouth or clench to grind.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;m not grinding too much in my sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fitting is fairly straight forward and just takes about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> No way I&#x27;m paying that much for a hunk of plastic.  </li>
            <li> I carefully followed the fitting instructions found inside the box.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than having one made by your dentist.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is why the dentists charge big bucks to properly fit their TMJ patients with guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this it!</li>
            <li> So, I sent a message via their website and a second mouthpiece arrived at my door within the week with a kindly worded letter offering any assistance (short of someone coming to my house and putting it in my mouth for me, haha)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much again</li>
            <li> He suggested that it would be very harmful to my teeth over time.</li>
            <li> This just isn&#x27;t comfortable enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to that at pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to pay for it.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard works very well.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a cheaper night guard to see if it even worked before spending so much money at the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really stay in place.</li>
            <li> There seems to be too much material to work it correctly, and to make it stay in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I really miss it if I don&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> the sucking is supposed to do is beyond me), counted to thirty like the directions say, and then molded it with my fingers as much as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really a bother most of the time.</li>
            <li> It does not form to my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Well, this is really all the comfort I need.</li>
            <li> I probably have a smaller mouth and this fits comfortably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if I ever end up chewing through it, but so far well well worth it</li>
            <li> The third time, it fit like a charm.</li>
            <li> It wants to float.</li>
            <li> This really shouldn&#x27;t be considered an anti-snoring device AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I watched a bunch of youtube tutorials and tried several times to get this thing to work, but it just didn&#x27;t fit my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I mold it to fit, and have even tried to alter it to be bigger, but nothing</li>
            <li> If you form the mouthguard properly to your teeth, it should suction into your mouth and fit snugly while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive mouth guard that prevents grinding of the teeth at night.</li>
            <li> but the inconvenience of the way it felt and it coming out every night was too much for me.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> The price is fairly cheap for the potential amount of relief</li>
            <li> The price is fairly cheap for the potential amount of relief it could bring!</li>
            <li> Might fit people with larger choppers.</li>
            <li> My grinding problem is not severe, so I tried a cheepie ($8)night guard which is really an athletic mouth guard, but it was too bulky.  </li>
            <li> I had forgotten my custom night gaurd at home and need something fast.</li>
            <li> I have sleep apnea and was really apprehensive about using one of these</li>
            <li> When I heard about the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard and saw how reasonably priced it was, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> My dentist implored me to please start wearing a guard soon after the crown was put in so that I would not put so much pressure on it.</li>
            <li> My dentist implored me to please start wearing a guard soon after the crown was put in so that I would not put so much pressure on it.</li>
            <li> BUT IT DOES WORK REALLY</li>
            <li> IT HAS HELPED MY TEETH ALL READY.</li>
            <li> The fit of this nightguard is similar to others I have tried OTC meaning it is a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten a night guard from the dentist because the price is way too much</li>
            <li> Cheap night guards like this could end up costing you thousands in dental bills later.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper than going to the dentist to have a mouth guard made.  </li>
            <li> Very bulky.  </li>
            <li> But the thing can be plumped up again (much like fluffing your pillow) in the hot/cold water and putting in your mouth to re-mold the plastic to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> It could be that the initial fit was faulty on my part.</li>
            <li> I really like this night guard because it has some give.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve removed it, reheated it, tried squeezing the guard together with my fingers to make a smaller fit, and it just won&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> The guard did prevent me from grinding my teeth, but I never could get the gum line smooth enough for long-lasting comfort.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with grinding my teeth while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both wear night guards and tried several options available at CVS.  </li>
            <li> The cost is extremely reasonable for what the product achieves.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Sounds very pedestrian</li>
            <li> This works very well..  </li>
            <li> It really helps curb my snoring habits.  </li>
            <li> Really dries mouth out.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just too much hassle.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have problems clenching my teeth while sleeping and work really well</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the only OTC night guards we recommend at our office because they are the closest we&#x27;ve found to a custom fit lab made appliance.  </li>
            <li> one does the job, yet is much thinner in front.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t wear this anymore, it causes so much pain.  </li>
            <li> My husband tried to re-form it several times to get it to fit.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand to have it in my mouth for a whole night.</li>
            <li> This was an all-around unsatisfying purchase.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t close my mouth really</li>
            <li> This is really a glorified mouthguard.  </li>
            <li> I just followed the directions very closely.  </li>
            <li> It took two times for me to fit it correctly - not a big deal.</li>
            <li> so I should really use it I guess.</li>
            <li> Having worn a mouth guard 40 some years ago, I discovered they really haven&#x27;t improved much on the boil in water/ form in you</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> And considering my dentist wants $300 to make a guard, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the reviewers who are having issues with fit, didn&#x27;t follow the instructions properly and/or didn&#x27;t use a mirror?</li>
            <li> Unless you are some sort of space wizard genius you are not going to fit this thing properly.</li>
            <li> The latter are comfortable, but don&#x27;t get the job done</li>
            <li> Fits really well.</li>
            <li> Nothing compared to getting a real night guard fitted by the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for this to work</li>
            <li> so I absolutely need these to cushion my teeth when I sleep.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found it to fall out or have any problems really.</li>
            <li> it STILL doesnt fit properly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for someone who hasn&#x27;t much money.</li>
            <li> how much for another one?</li>
            <li> So feels very unnatural and also makes me drool.</li>
            <li> But I am very thankful to whomever made this because I have no dental insurance</li>
            <li> I LOVE that the bottom of the guard is of a harder material, so</li>
            <li> Sometimes when there&#x27;s too much stress in work.</li>
            <li> so I cleaned it really well before I did anything with it.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I spent hundred of dollars on fancy smancy guards.</li>
            <li> Developing it was not too much of a problem, however I did have to reheat it once or twice.</li>
            <li> Its way to big for my mouth and doesn&#x27;t fit well at all.</li>
            <li> so ultimately I still prefer a custom fit night guard</li>
            <li> The reason I got this over-the-counter product is because I asked my dentist how much it would be for a custom one.</li>
            <li> fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Better off just paying the extra and getting custom fit ones from your dentist.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a real solution, go to the dentist and get fitted.</li>
            <li> It is simple to customize the fit.</li>
            <li> The dentist wants me to wear a night guard and to have one made professionly his cost was $400.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> So, its&#x27; very uncomfortabel to sleep; I cannot fall asleep with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This night guard is very tricky to mold.</li>
            <li> Overall it still feels comfortable in my mouth when I sleep.</li>
            <li> They need a lot of trimming to be comfortable, but once they are done, they last awhile.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get comfortable with my mouth propped open all night.</li>
            <li> This nightguard really helped me to stop grinding my teeth while I sleep.  </li>
            <li> This has been really helpful.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I wondered if the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; really was going to apply here...</li>
            <li> No discomfort when I have it on yet it securely attaches onto my upper teeth.</li>
            <li> You will have just as much luck with an athletic mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t trim it very well to form</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting too much compared with a custom guard.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t really mold well around my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it feels as comfortable as possible and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> This one works really well</li>
            <li> but mine is wearing really well.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow directions carefully.</li>
            <li> So far, it rarely has fallen out at night, and all the grinding has stopped.  </li>
            <li> Really want to make it work</li>
            <li> However, for the price and quality this is not that much of an issue.</li>
            <li> Its really the closest thing to not having anything in your mouth.</li>
            <li> purchased this 2nd one attempting to keep the guard far forward to attempt to get more material in front of my teeth with no results.  </li>
            <li> I have had many which have been replaced simply because they were old.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t hurt my jaw and after a few days it healed up nicely.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to get a really good fit.</li>
            <li> The fit was not perfect but good for the cost versus custom made night guard.</li>
            <li> I needed to find a new one very fast</li>
            <li> This was fine for the first 5-6 days, but the form became loose and allowed for movement, which rendered the unit ineffective.</li>
            <li> guard was easy to fit and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> My family is full of dentists, but I live too far away for any of them to make me a night guard and get it adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did take 2 tries to get the right fit</li>
            <li> I honestly did not have any trouble fitting the mouth guard like some other reviewers commented.</li>
            <li> This saves me thousands of dollars on crown replacements and root canals, not to mention just plain keeping my own teeth.</li>
            <li> I might as well just pay my dentist $175 to make sure it fits correctly and to my teeth,as I could spend as much trying all of these other ones.</li>
            <li> These mouthguards work the best for me, after trying at least three other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the older \\&quot;classic\\&quot; large has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> in All this guard provided more support and protection than the other (over the counter) ones I have tried</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS</li>
            <li> i used my other one foe more than a year before it started falling apart.</li>
            <li> It worked without us having to deform the guard back to its original shape.</li>
            <li> This one fits snugly more than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> That is simply way more than I would be willing to spend, especially for something that is made for wear and tear (and which I will have to replace who knows</li>
            <li> Then again, I have a very small mouth, so the way mine turned out may just be as good as it&#x27;s going to get for a small-mouthed person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  then took a knife &amp; whittled down the excess plastic at the back which made it considerably more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 7 other brands over the past decade and nothing comes close to this easy to mold, easy to use and easy to keep (in its storage box).</li>
            <li> I had trouble with fitting it even though I followed the instructions EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li> it is not good for folks who suffer from TMJ, would have been great if that was spelled out clearly.</li>
            <li> I use a tooth brush and some paste to clean it and occasionally use denture cleaner.</li>
            <li> It requires daily Efferdent treatments to clean it up.  </li>
            <li> This has a lot of cushioning for the gums, which is nice, but ultimately it results in a much bulkier mouthguard than the Oral B professional slim fit nighttime dental guard, which I prefer (not available on Amazon at this time).</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t remember how many years I kept my first one, but it was quite a few.</li>
            <li> I did not get the hot-water timing thing down good because the final product was a flabby piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> I realize, though, that if it went back too much farther it would be uncomfortable for others, so I&#x27;m prepared to accept that sacrifice for the greater teeth-grinders&#x27; good.</li>
            <li> When the TMJ pain starts up again years later, the custom jobs won&#x27;t fit as my teeth have drifted a bit or a new crown</li>
            <li> Fortunately, these tend to last me six months or so, so I can live with some twice-yearly annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time i got the right prodcut, the second I did not.</li>
            <li> The newest version is less bulky, a tad longer in the back which is good for me since I have a lot of teeth</li>
            <li> And it is good enough, I grind my teeth less at night and my jaw is no longer sore when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, but follow the directions for fitting it very carefully.</li>
            <li> I can only say to give it a try because it may actually fit you and the price is great considering how expensive the custom ones are.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the fact that I followed the directions to the T and got an amazing fit.</li>
            <li> The device is difficult to get it to fit securely and comfortably.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine anything that fits over my teeth would be comfortable all night long.</li>
            <li> The molding process was difficult and did not produce a secure and comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with time and a bunch of sleepless nights I could get used to it, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me to try.</li>
            <li> Ok product but not worth the money they are selling it for.</li>
            <li> as I do, you may have more issues than the average person in getting ajusted to this night guard.</li>
            <li> as I do, you may have more issues than the average person in getting ajusted to this night guard.</li>
            <li> Maybe this would be better if different sizes were available, one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> It seems to be thick enough to keep them from touching, but I would feel better about some added length..</li>
            <li> I left a good amount of space to conform around my front teeth, but it was not enough to fully cover (and I don&#x27;t have an oddly giant mouth or anything)</li>
            <li> The inner part is thicker and taller after fitting as it oozes up and around to shape to fit your teeth and a bit of gum.  </li>
            <li> As well the material is pretty soft and within two or three nights my teeth would begin to wear away cuts in the plastic which would then in turn cut my gums</li>
            <li> far as I am concerned the product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product after discovering that I (as well as many other people!)</li>
            <li> A little note, make sure you do not cut too much off.  </li>
            <li> Just need to get the fit right, but the company guarantees that so there is no risk if you mess it up.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a T.In fact,I read the instructions several times BEFORE having my husband read them out loud, AS I was doing it,to make sure I was following them correctly and exactly.</li>
            <li> I have used at least five other brands and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This works better and causes less jaw pain than my $800.00 dentist made device.</li>
            <li> But be sure to shop around because often sellers like wmart have comparable products for nearly half the price.</li>
            <li> I actually messed up two or three times and was still able to put it back in the water and re-mold it.</li>
            <li> I replaced the guard again and wore it for a while more, but it left me with the same sensation upon removing it.</li>
            <li> This company used to make an older version called the classic.  </li>
            <li> I went back on line today and paid the extra money for a Den Tec night guard which is more streamlined and lightweight.</li>
            <li> The one I had was older and could not longer be used.  </li>
            <li> I did not know when I got older</li>
            <li> The guard does not get soft enough to fit in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It properly covers more of the back teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely not intended to last more than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It was much too wide and fit</li>
            <li> I got it close enough that I was confident I wouldn&#x27;t choke on it in the middle of the night, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner that older models</li>
            <li> The first time I don&#x27;t think I got it hot enough</li>
            <li> They fit nicely and seem to last a long time unlike other guards he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> You know, like when you open your eyes in the morning and the very first thing you do is groan from the head pain.</li>
            <li> If I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom I tend to take it out, falling back asleep with it in at that point feels a little disruptive, but I assume that&#x27;s still better than nothing, and way better than spending hundreds of dollars at the dentist for something custom made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fifth attempt at fitting it and it still will not hold tight in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Took several tries (reheating, and pressing back to the original shape) to get the fit right and to get it to stay in place without holding the guard in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist highly recommended this mouth piece.</li>
            <li> Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone that grinds their teeth -</li>
            <li> my teeth are protected at night,no need for those high pricy one.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and will buy it again when the one I have wears out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this night guard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, if you grind your teeth, I highly recommend your get one made from your dentist-</li>
            <li> It took me two tries, and then I ultimately just realized it was as good as I was going to get it because essentially my bite is much longer than than the guard.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this guard.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this nightguard for overnight grinders.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of my sides is more like this than the other...and the one that&#x27;s less ideal has a little more bulk than I&#x27;d prefer between my cheek and gum that bugs me just a little if I sleep on that side (I like really small profile mouth</li>
            <li> it took me a couple of tries but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Last a long time even though I am a pretty strong grinder at night.</li>
            <li> I had a little more stress in my life</li>
            <li> I wish that I molded it a little better because it hurts my mouth</li>
            <li> A little too bulky for me, although it is more rigid than others</li>
            <li> It seems to seat OK and floats around a little</li>
            <li> My teeth are no longer grinding at night and my jaw feels a little bit better in the morning.</li>
            <li> starts to get a little ripe (no surprise there), but for the money the quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li> , I went back to the product after a few days &amp; found out that w/the heat of my mouth - it molded in &amp; fit fine.  </li>
            <li> It took several fittings and i had to re-heat it a few times but with a little effort it fits great!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel as though you have a slab of concrete in your mouth; you can sleep with your mouth</li>
            <li> closed easily &amp; comfortably.  </li>
            <li> This one is much thinner and stays locked in place like the professionally made ones.</li>
            <li> This newer one is much shallower and does not suction to your teeth as the old ones did.</li>
            <li> after 3 tries of molding this, I could not get it to fit.  </li>
            <li> This one is made of much thicker material and has lasted over 3 months thus far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how well it will last, but the comfort it gives him is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Does discolor over time which the dentist says is normal.  </li>
            <li> I could close my mouth as normal.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I realize this isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a custom night guard again, because I&#x27;d done that many years ago and then gave up on wearing it within a year or so and all that money was wasted.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t waste $300 on the custom one from my dentist.</li>
            <li> It also changed my teeth, so it felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t positioning normally.  </li>
            <li> It works after a few tries at fitting to your mouth; not a substitute for your dentists efforts but a good temporary appliance if you need an extra or forgot to bring your regular one on vacation, as I did.</li>
            <li> During the application process, for the first time apparently, I molded all the way around my mouth using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even swallow or breath normally without having to take it out.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try since it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost and achieves the same goal.  </li>
            <li> quite the fight fit the first few times.  </li>
            <li> I have a 50% success rating and retrying isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basically part Velicoraptor because I normally chew through my night</li>
            <li> In any case the low cost and comfort are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use while my normal night guard was sent out for repairs as I get a headache when I don&#x27;t wear it.  </li>
            <li> May be fine for other needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard plastic like the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this night guard, but I had a few problems:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> After three \\&quot;remelts\\&quot; I finally got it right.</li>
            <li> They last about 6 months and the price is right</li>
            <li> But when you do get it right, you won&#x27;t sleep the same without it.</li>
            <li> The third time I got it right though</li>
            <li> It molds easily, however I found that if you have a &amp;#34;larger head&amp;#34; than the average person, it will form to your teeth, but will not adjust to your mouth width without warping/twisting.  </li>
            <li> I do think that some videos of how to fit the product would be extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li> You do have to boil it a little bit longer than the instructions say, but once you get it warm enough</li>
            <li> The new instructions suck..</li>
            <li> this was new to me.  </li>
            <li> I am on amazon looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> and I had to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> and I just want to mould a new one to fit.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Now my jaw hurts and I have to search for something new.  </li>
            <li> Looks like the dentist is going to get a new car.</li>
            <li> Can easily last a good year if not longer for me, and I grind my teeth hard.</li>
            <li> I think I messed up the fit a little, since it grips in the back but slips off in the middle near my front teeth, but it seems to be doing okay.</li>
            <li> The new design is roughly half that of the classic large and it uses a fraction of the material of the classic large (which would cause the user to chew through the new design much</li>
            <li> Having been a grinder my entire life this night guard has been the easiest to form and is&lt;br /&gt;much smaller than the sports guards that are available.</li>
            <li> I bought a second guard (same item) and fit it to my lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> I tried three times to get the guard to stay in place when my mouth was open as the instructions state indicates a proper fit.  </li>
            <li> When following the directions it is very simple to mold and fits well and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> To the company&#x27;s credit, they offer free replacement if you call them and tell them you are not satisfied with the first (practice) mold.</li>
            <li> Simple fit process is the same as the one use for sports guards.  </li>
            <li> I think it is much more comfortable and cheaper than the expensive one the Dentist sold me.  </li>
            <li> I might refit a 3rd time to see if I can smooth it out at the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Dentek</li>
            <li> I followed directions precisely and even bought a second one thinking I didn&#x27;t mold the plastic enough around my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made to fit the upper teeth for those who are unaware of this malady.</li>
            <li> Its just a very simple basic piece of lightweight plastic, designed to be comfortable and prevent grinding and clenching.</li>
            <li> I also had to cut it down a little more and use a lighter to soften hard areas, but it works great.</li>
            <li> When I finally got the fit right, it&#x27;s still not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have made this discovery for so little money!</li>
            <li> If you mess up, it&#x27;s easy to try and redo again.  </li>
            <li> Per the instructions, I tried reshaping the gel back to original and going through the molding process a second time.  </li>
            <li> The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard is not slick when moistened in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable but really does the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll speak first about problems encountered with similar products.</li>
            <li> I boiled water in my microwave, put the blank NightGuard into the hot water, waited two minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was just one old dentist or if that&#x27;s normal, but I found it intolerable</li>
            <li> After many adjustments, it finally got to the point where I could wear it regularly, and shortly after that, it broke one night in my mouth</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised that this mouth guard works!  </li>
            <li> The chance of it melting the first or second time you try to custom fit it, is not worth the price, to me.</li>
            <li> The first two nights I used it, I ended up removing it in the middle of the night when I woke up</li>
            <li> I kept the first one for months and months, until I finally bit through it.  </li>
            <li> Tried several times, exactly according to instructions.</li>
            <li> I have recently started grinding my teeth more due to an infection under one of my molars in my jaw.</li>
            <li> so we just sat it in hot water for 2 minutes, put it back in place, and then he pushed it tighter to his teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a mouth anti-grinding guard, so I may have problems with the device that anyone who already uses such device may no longer experience.  </li>
            <li> Apparently these weren&#x27;t designed for straight men.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> first time I adapted the mouthguard to my mouth I made a mistake, so I had to do it again, on this second occasion</li>
            <li> First off, this night guard is meant to be used by individuals who grind their teeth only.  </li>
            <li> I was able to follow the instructions for fitting easily enough, but it&#x27;s just too uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> This is actually the first nightguard I ordered after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> is my second one, as I lost the first one recently during air travel, and I bought it because the first was working so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WHEN THIS WILL DO EXACTLY THE SAME JOB ?</li>
            <li> What I can suggest is you should soak the night guard in the hot water until it feels sticky on its side, not just following the time on the instruction.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my mouth even after trimming it down.</li>
            <li> I can no longer bite down comfortably even when I&#x27;ve removed the dental guard.</li>
            <li> con is that it is a bit bulky and needs to be trimmed down to fit.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mold (takes just a few moments) and seems to last about 1.5-2 months.</li>
            <li> Seem cheap compared to the hard mold I first got from the dentist</li>
            <li> My DMD stated a new soft guard would have been $450 and not covered by insurance...</li>
            <li> This was a cinch to fit, although the instructions make it seem complex at first.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother him, he got used to it easily in just a few nights.  </li>
            <li> I used to play footballl, and this feels no better quality than my old mouthguards, except that it is much more slim.  </li>
            <li> If you are very picky and sensitive about the fit, you may need to work a little harder to get it to feel right.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions and do as others here have suggested by constantly sucking in air after biting down and using your fingers to mold the nightguard all around your teeth.</li>
            <li> I broke out the sharp, nearly clean adult scissors and trimmed this beast.</li>
            <li> the only thing positive I can say is that it came in on time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite reach my last two teeth, but I guess it&#x27;s better too short than too long.</li>
            <li> For me, I was less likely to pull the night guard out while sleeping when I used it for the top teeth.  </li>
            <li> There is a newer version of this product that uses blue plastic which I have found is more durable and has less problems with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The molding process takes about 30 minutes, and then it gels comfortably and tight to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I think from the guard being fit onto my teeth too tight.</li>
            <li> Was very careful with the instructions; however, it doesn&#x27;t replace a true mouthguard supplied by a dentist.</li>
            <li> Molding it to my teeth was easy enough, and while it does seem to last about 6-8 months, paying $20 twice a year is a HECK of a lot cheaper than getting it through my dentist&#x27;s provide (which fits the same and costs over $400)</li>
            <li> and it is far easier to use, causes far less salivation and does the primary job of preventing me from grinding my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Every time I try to fit the inside of the teeth, the outside edge pops loose - and vice versa.</li>
            <li> However, it is a big large and there is a gap.</li>
            <li> It did not shape well enough to be tight fitting.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; is inaccurate, it looks like it&#x27;s for a child when compared to the large one (same brand) that was purchased before.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to, but once you get used to using it, you will sleep comfortably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others and this one is really strong, and lasts pretty long!</li>
            <li> I only now replaced it with the grindguardn night guard (which I&#x27;ve read many positive reviews about - if you&#x27;re able to spend a little extra, I would recommend looking into it), because I accidentally left it out of it&#x27;s case for a few hours and my dogs chewed it to shreds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> guard was too large for my mouth and sent it back with no response so far?</li>
            <li> i was not super excited about paying another 300 bucks for another one-</li>
            <li> since lovely insurance doesnt cover hardly any of it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to get used to this night guard, but I have not been able to do it.  </li>
            <li> I am more of a clencher, so did not need a hard molded guard.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the bottom of the guard were a bit softer and maybe had the hard surface under a softer layer like the top part of it</li>
            <li> I decided to try it again and made sure to clench extremely hard while it was in the molding phase.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to the T and am still not very satisfied with the fit.</li>
            <li> I kept waking up with dry mouth due to me not being able to close my mouth all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who it would fit as I consider myself an average size in general.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to fit, and a non-professional fit affects your jaw position causing pain and additional grinding.</li>
            <li> I think if you also have this issue, you might want to steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li> I read through the instructions completely and then gathered all of my supplies while reading through the directions again.</li>
            <li> I dunno how long it&#x27;s gonna hold up, but it&#x27;s not nearly as uncomfortable as I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> I then saw a commercial for this product and went straight out and bought it.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read elsewhere, it happens with use of these things, even if it&#x27;s professionally made.</li>
            <li> I can say I have finally found one comfortable enough to actually sleep with through the night.</li>
            <li> and I have also waken up with a severe headache and achy, sensitive teeth as a result of clenching my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I redid it a few times, but never got a comfortable result.</li>
            <li> far my headaches have not gone away completely</li>
            <li> If you are clenching and/or grinding your teeth you should get checked for whatever damage you&#x27;ve done so far anyway.  </li>
            <li> this one gets old, I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.</li>
            <li> 3 mouth guards so far - including a sports guard (1 week)</li>
            <li> so this is adding some protection until I get some professional work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to wear one before but recently developed TMJ after a car accident.</li>
            <li> works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add some perspective, I am a smallish 20 year old woman, and I consider my mouth to be smallish as well.</li>
            <li> The night guard stopped the clenching pain completely but caused the roof of mouth pain, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Look somewhere else like a professional dentist....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This brings me to really the only \\&quot;con\\</li>
            <li> TO MAKE SOFT</li>
            <li> If you do manage to get it to fit properly, which I believe is an impossibility, it is so uncomfortable you probably will not be able to sleep.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable, but I think I can trim it to fit my teeth.</li>
            <li> Spend the money &amp; get a professional one.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t deep enough to make a solid fit.</li>
            <li> This design was very inferior which resulted in it falling out of my mouth during the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> but these last much longer.</li>
            <li> After my professional night guard shattered, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300 out of pocket.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to alleviate some discomfort after grinding teeth at night.</li>
            <li> I microwaved it for 2 minutes and shaped it - WOW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought LOTS of these dental guards and this one has lasted the longest by far.</li>
            <li> I verified this with my dentist and ended up forking over $150 for a professional occlusal guard.</li>
            <li> They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li> (Seems that this product has been developed by an entrepreneurial dentist -- who&#x27;s been used to having an assistant around.)</li>
            <li> Personally, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this product.  </li>
            <li> That was the old &amp;#34;Original.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to read the directions a few times before you move ahead to boiling the guard and then placing it in mouth.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to find flaws with this as someone who paid for the professional dentist fitted one (way over $300) but so far I have not.</li>
            <li> soft guard</li>
            <li> If you grind your teeth, go to your dentist and spend the big bucks for a real one.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford to get a splint from the dentist, so I tried the $17 route and it is working so far.  </li>
            <li> To everyone&#x27;s surprise I really wasn&#x27;t a big mouth, just misunderstood.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be soft when it comes time to sleep.</li>
            <li> So much so that my upper teeth shifted and chewed into my tongue.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I tried to get the gel to soften but it took a few times and the guard still doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> I wore a dental retainer/nightguard when young and couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as professionally made guard from the dentist at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going with the professional night guard from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable and lasting quality.</li>
            <li> and now I have no trouble sleeping with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I must suggest someone who uses this instead of seeing a dentist at all, or where the pain never goes away, should see a dentist at least once to make sure bruxism/TMJ is the correct diagnosis ...</li>
            <li> i may need to just have it professionally fitted.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got an old package..</li>
            <li> but I like the soft bit feel.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re making the mold, try to get the outer edges of your teeth near the outer edges of the guard, so the soft squishy material that is being molded tends to go towards the roof of your mouth instead of between your gums and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Others have said it&#x27;s too soft and they chewed through it.</li>
            <li> When I was done, I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way that it&#x27;s going to come off unexpectedly</li>
            <li> Do not delay in replacing (as I did not replace until nearly 5 mo, and the headaches, etc.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about this product just remember it can only do so much.</li>
            <li> Not everyone has or wants a microwave, yet the instructions are ONLY for microwave use.  </li>
            <li> But then, it only cost 20% as much and didn&#x27;t require a couple of dental visits.</li>
            <li> And, so far it works...</li>
            <li> I definitely moved my jaw too much when molding it</li>
            <li> they do not fit comfortably and the pressure points on your gums cause ulcers/blisters.</li>
            <li> certainly more missing upper teeth</li>
            <li> I tried wearing it briefly, but I just couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Carefully and quickly lined the guard up with my teeth- paying particular attention to the front teeth- getting them as close to the front of the guard as possible, without going OVER the border of the guard.</li>
            <li> It also caused a weird itching and swelling in my gums and lips, so it may not be a good idea for those with latex allergies</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly thick so for even the most robust chewers out there</li>
            <li> which is nice but even after trying to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it out I still was sleeping with my mouth open because it was so thick.</li>
            <li> After trying a second time(another gentle boil) I molded it as much as I could and waited while biting and sucking in to create the vacuum.</li>
            <li> When I bit down until the gel was cool it just fell off.</li>
            <li> says that you can wait for it to cool down a bit, form it into the way it was when you got it, and try again.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> ended up having some real jaw issues for the first time like a month later, probably unrelated to the nightguard but likely related to the grinding/clenching.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip off and is not tight at all.</li>
            <li> And unlike the dentist ones, it&#x27;s soft, so it isn&#x27;t an irritant, and no sharp edges!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the main problem with the device is the soft plastic that sits next to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The size / mass of it simply would not accomadate my apparent large jaw frame.</li>
            <li> The first ones fit really well, but pushed my lips out a bit (definitely NOT attractive!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable or at least not annoying enough to wear</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other night guards work, but I am not crazy about this one.</li>
            <li> but if this saves one other person because it sticks out then its worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely used it due to the discomfort.  </li>
            <li> It sat too high near my back teeth and hurt my jaw.</li>
            <li> Sleeping with it felt a little strange at first, but I got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy but don&#x27;t mess up, you only get one time to mold it to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> In the small fine print it says DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE TMJ....???</li>
            <li> Then I just soak it in denture cleaner to clean every few days.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I have a small mouth, so it fits just fine.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try a fourth fitting, but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> The first time,there wasn&#x27;t enough material to mold around my teeth enough to have it stay in place.</li>
            <li> After decades of grinding my teeth, being lectured to by my dentist, and going through no less than four nightguards (two from the dentist and two over the counter)</li>
            <li> Mainly because it was on sale and the same price as online without the wait.</li>
            <li> Only issue on the first try was it not staying on his teeth with his mouth open</li>
            <li> There is no extra material in the front, so it is not uncomfortable on the inside of the upper lip</li>
            <li> I will be buying the classic instead of this model next time.</li>
            <li> and I have a small mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you are able to suck air thru your teeth during the molding/hardening process, you deserve a medal.&lt;br /&gt;Third, each morning after wearing for several nights</li>
            <li> I think I should have tried to line it up a little better, it sticks out of my mouth a bit causing dry mouth at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased mouth guards from my dentist which cost over $200 and also tried doityourself-like these which only cost me less than $20, I really can&#x27;t say that one is that much better than the other.  </li>
            <li> I have been a teeth grinder for several years, grinding down my eye teeth primarily.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a super hard grinder like me, I think this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little large in large in my mouth</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and will order it again if my current one needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete scam,even if you are a dentist I could almost guarantee no success on getting it done right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bulky in the mouth but soft enough to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is not very heavy</li>
            <li> #34;advanced comfort.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why am i not able to get it comfortable?  </li>
            <li> mouth is small and this guard fit</li>
            <li> really well i will buy as long as they make them.</li>
            <li> I can usually wear this guard all night comfortably.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be effective if it won&#x27;t stay in my mouth!</li>
            <li> I had no problem making the mold of my teeth and it fit perfectly in my small mouth.</li>
            <li> My back molars weren&#x27;t coming together normally.</li>
            <li> it forms a tight fit to the upper teeth.</li>
            <li> This is for people with very large mouths, in addition, it was difficult to form and heat even following the step by step directions more than once.</li>
            <li> Luckily I purchased 2 different brands and had no problem with the other brand.</li>
            <li> The satisfaction guarantee allows you to mail them your used guard and they send you back a new one in the correct size for you to remold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would just say, I have been using this mouthguard for over 5 years with multiple new purchases of this brand and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> New (current dentist) suggested I try this before re-molding for the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried it for several days, thinking that it was just my jaw getting used to the new mouth guard, but it never improved.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these for the last 5 years (got a new one cuz a pet destroyed it).</li>
            <li> but the fit was so bad I tried trimming some edges to make it better.</li>
            <li> It was quite easy to fit and seems much less irritating than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> It was very invasive and made my dry mouth even drier.</li>
            <li> I do however have a pretty small mouth and this fits really well</li>
            <li> I tried several variations of night guards, and they mostly worked shoddily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently noticed grinding my teeth, so I am trying a cheaper option than a real dental guard.</li>
            <li> somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I found a different mouth guard at Walmart that comes with a blue case that works much better.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Just make sure to following the direction properly while forming the mouthguard to your teeth, which isn&#x27;t too difficult but takes a quick read through of the instructions.</li>
            <li> I bought it, took the trouble to get it molded to fit, but used ONCE only.</li>
            <li> It cost twice as much as the Dentek ones I was buying (same price but only one in the box) but it has lasted 4-5 times longer.</li>
            <li> Had to remold it a few times to get it to fit properly.  </li>
            <li> The instructions seem more complicated than it really is.  </li>
            <li> The first night I used it,  I feel asleep within  a few minutes; just like normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, has a soft gel lining, and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> I did have to trim it down to be a little less bulky, but way more comfortable than my last nightguard.</li>
            <li> One major problem here.</li>
            <li> (does that mean I&#x27;m better at doing this than the actual dentist?!)</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad this mouthguard at least helps me!)</li>
            <li> I am a major night \\&quot;Clencher\\&quot; and often awake to sore jaws and tooth pain.</li>
            <li> I am a major jaw clencher and grinder, and needed a replacement for my $500 mouthguard after my dogs ate it.</li>
            <li> I want to keep all my original teeth like my grandmother who had all of them intact and lived past a hundred (lost count).</li>
            <li> you have previously used the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; Large, this newly redesigned product will not work for you.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time she has used a guard and found initially it made her mouth dry</li>
            <li> If it came in a small I might reconsider, but this was too comfortable due to large size.  </li>
            <li> When I fit it the second time I bit down normally and spent a lot of time conforming it to my teeth and the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I clench my teeth all the time; and it&#x27;s becoming a serious problem for me.</li>
            <li> This was relatively easy to fit (very similar to molding a mouth guard if you ever had to do that for sports), but I found the end result product to be a bit bulky and awkward to wear.  </li>
            <li> The first one I thought I may have not properly followed directions as it falls loose in my mouth and becomes a choking hazard.  </li>
            <li> It was large even after trimming it and it certainly did not fit snug enough to stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Typical, pay more &amp; get less.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting it to fit to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> too hard to fit in my mouth</li>
            <li> The lack of a front lip makes it hard to fit.</li>
            <li> It is ridiculously hard to fit.</li>
            <li> The fitting process was straight forward, had to do a refit due to not bitting down properly the first time, which wasn&#x27;t hard at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the other brands, you boil water and feel like you only have one chance to get it right.  </li>
            <li> Night Guard is a good product, but it is quiet hard to adjust to your mouth when you are under 5foot 5\\&quot; and have a narrow mouth in weight.</li>
            <li> It fit, but was pretty uncomfortable and I kept spitting it out at night.  </li>
            <li> But it was difficult to fit it the first time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if this is a con for the product or just a fit issue for me personally.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if this is a con for the product or just a fit issue for me personally.</li>
            <li> My old mouthguard was big and bulky.</li>
            <li> Once I noticed, I stopped and since I&#x27;m young, my teeth went back to how they were before.</li>
            <li> I think the big difference with this one is the two layers, with the soft layer being the one pressed up against your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have to trim the back of my mouth guards because of a sensitive crown.  </li>
            <li> This night guard works well enough as far as I know.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for just over 3 months now and I have barely even scratched the under-surface with my lower teeth.</li>
            <li> last bout of pain and tooth sensitivity had lasted nearly three months.</li>
            <li> (21 year old female)</li>
            <li> I even tried trimming the edges so that it wouldn&#x27;t go so far back in my mouth, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I am only replacing it to see if there is a difference between an 8 month old and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advice for you all: these soft ones only encourage your bruxism.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another in the near future, to keep just in case</li>
            <li> It is too big and my lips do not close completely when I have it in.</li>
            <li> There is way too much product left in the middle of your upper mouth.  </li>
            <li> kid is 6 years old, so I just trimmed off about 3/8 of an inch off the rear molar area on each side so it wouldn&#x27;t be too big.  </li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions carefully before you start the molding process, especially if this is the first time you&#x27;re doing it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt the internal part of your cheeks and allows you to breathe normally with your mouth open.</li>
            <li> Lame that I had to find out how to set this up on my own.  </li>
            <li> believe this is true, because even before he mentioned it, when I removed the guard in the morning, my jaw felt \\&quot;not right\\&quot; and when I bit down, I was biting kind of awkwardly too forward or backward.</li>
            <li> It was pretty worn down after two or three</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to mold, but the guard seems too wide for my mouth; the front also has a very low profile which makes it difficult to fit well.</li>
            <li> This is for upper teeth only I am going to try the new one on my lower teeth</li>
            <li> I still have some minor issues with part of my tongue and/or roof of my mouth suffering from getting dry, but I&#x27;m willing to consider that an idiosyncrasy of my mouth, not a defect of the product.</li>
            <li> Having used one made by a dentist, and &amp;#34;paid for it&amp;#34;  about $500, very nice, but very expensive when this does the same thing for grinders.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it takes a few minutes to get it right.</li>
            <li> only grinds a little or only when they&#x27;re awake (eg: while using a computer) or anyone who has a special shaped bite I guess.</li>
            <li> The device itself is a little bulky around the sides and far too large to be swallowed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first guard I don&#x27;t take out in the middle of the night due to uncomfort.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon shipped it quickly.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s your first time, it&#x27;s very hard to remember exactly what the product looked like when you took it out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Following the instructions carefully (boiling water for 50 seconds, cooling for 20 seconds, molding for 20 seconds, additonal molding, etc.), I found this product extremely difficult to mold into a comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li> I tried several times, and eventually, it did get enough shape to finally stay in my mouth in a semi-fitted fashion, although this required much time and work, with several reshapings.</li>
            <li> Also, I have an average sized mouth without any wisdom teeth and the back of the trays are barely long enough to fit all my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, It does a an extra hard plate under the soft mold-able part.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had a completely different one from another brand (Dentek) in the past and it was actually comfortable enough to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> Other OTC mouthguards have lasted me much longer.</li>
            <li> Too thick, causing significant jaw pain in the morning.</li>
            <li> This one so far is lasting much longer than any other brand I have tried!</li>
            <li> I must have tried at least 10 times to try to get a custom fit following the directions.  </li>
            <li> However, since I do have my wisdom teeth, I feel like the protection doesn&#x27;t go back far enough.</li>
            <li> Normallly my tongue rests on the back of my top front teeth, but the thickness behind my teeth wouldn&#x27;t let my tongue stretch out</li>
            <li> No trouble with it being too long (toward the back of my mouth), but it seems to be too thick (up and down) to stay on its own.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions to the letter -- even had someone hold a watch to count off the exact instructions down to the second.</li>
            <li> the first 3 nites my mouth was a little sore.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came up a little higher over my front teeth</li>
            <li> Does make my teeth feel a little funny in the morning</li>
            <li> The process of fitting this thing was really painful for my jaw muscles, and I&#x27;ve never managed to get it right.  </li>
            <li> Will try a 3rd time but even following directions to a T, hard to fit.</li>
            <li> It will clearly prevent you from grinding your teeth as long as you wear it every night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I trimmed back the plastic that clearly wasn&#x27;t doing anything, such as that flap at the back of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> It barely fits and does NOT stay in properly, I can&#x27;t sleep with it in cause</li>
            <li> I have one that&#x27;s noticeably crooked and the front edge of it barely fits into the tray, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d either be unable to fall asleep because it was irritating, I&#x27;d spit it out while I slept, or I&#x27;d wake up with very attractive giant puddles of drool on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I had issues the first few nights getting used to having it in my mouth and some mornings I have a momentary issue with gagging when I take it OUT of my mouth, but otherwise, no problems at all in terms of gagging.</li>
            <li> I had issues the first few nights getting used to having it in my mouth and some mornings I have a momentary issue with gagging when I take it OUT of my mouth, but otherwise, no problems at all in terms of gagging.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would have trouble sleeping with it in because it is pretty bulky</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to get a good impression of your teeth.</li>
            <li> A little complicated to get the molding right but an ok product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for many months but the wear and tear is minimal even though I am a serious grinder.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t bit down too much when forming.  </li>
            <li> I bought this nightguard since it was recommended to cut down on my snoring, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> Just boil water and bite down for your imprint and its ready.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it came out right.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t bite down too hard while you are fitting it</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to form to my mouth than the ones I have previously had.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as described and it does not fit properly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin and fits my very teeth well.</li>
            <li> This one holds good, and no more broken teeth.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago I purchased my first nightguard (this one) after learning I grind my teeth so badly at night that I fractured a filling, which then caused a new cavity to form under the original filling.</li>
            <li> Placed in boiling water few seconds then into my mouth to bite down and fit on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little large on the sides for my mouth</li>
            <li> I was able to eventually chew through it and decided that the few hundred dollars spent is not worth it, although I was told there is a stronger material they could have given me (which is something they should have offered to begin with.)</li>
            <li> The Den-Tek guard was slick which caused my jaw to move unnaturally left and right</li>
            <li> I was afraid of what it would feel like, having a piece of plastic in my mouth, and as I sit with it in, trying to get used to the sensation right now, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of material around the sides, so when you bite in, it really forms a tight grip.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I purchased this product once a couple years ago and it wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I did buy some Efferdent tablets and use them maybe once a week, but on a daily basis I wash it well when I first take it out and then at night when I put it back in, I soak it in Listerine Total Care for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> tried several times, made a whole mess of it.</li>
            <li> The system is a hard lower level (like the sole of a shoe) and slight outer frame (just tall enough to give it shape) that stands up to many months of grinding with no change.</li>
            <li> The second time I got it hot enough but found it difficult to get my fingers around it in the right spots</li>
            <li> ;, it&#x27;s still much less expensive than the hundreds it costs to have a similar product nicely delivered to you by a professional.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, when I tried to contact customer service my only option was to do so online, but when I attempted to use the online form to submit my questions and complaints the site made it impossible for me to effectively submit any meaningful information.</li>
            <li> This product is nearly impossible to get to fit right</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about spending so much for this night guard at a pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> First, unless I bought a child&#x27;s size, the thing is very small - it didn&#x27;t cover my last molars completely</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, this new \\&quot;one size fits all\\</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have proof of whether this is true, but I seriously think this thing will buy my mouth enough time to perhaps heal some of the damage.  </li>
            <li> The instruction procedure is very complex and precise.</li>
            <li> It does not get soft enough to push the thick sides up against your gumline for a tight fit.</li>
            <li> Once you fail for the first time, you cannot get it back to the original shape, and then you will for sure to fail in later tries.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much unusable, even after soaking it in a boiling water per instructions, the plastic is too hard and it will not bite down and adjust at all.</li>
            <li> By the second fitting, I was ready to throw in the towel and chalk this up to another bad purchase.  </li>
            <li> The directions aren&#x27;t so clear on this, but it&#x27;s like a basic mouthpiece you would use for athletics, with a harder bottom.</li>
            <li> Still a vacuum seal has not been possible.  </li>
            <li> Also, the reviewers were right who said it was too thick in the back</li>
            <li> This is an updated version of one I have chewed through or not liked due to fit or bulkiness.</li>
            <li> Fit is not good; loose and slips around.</li>
            <li> I was never able to achieve a snug tight fit.  </li>
            <li> It may work for you, I believe the reason it didn&#x27;t work for me is that my mouth is not wide but the teeth go back pretty far and this just wasn&#x27;t long enough to get all the way past those last back teeth and so never fit well.  </li>
            <li> After that I immediately inserted it back in my mouth, bit down hard, did lots of sucking and molding, and it stayed secure on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Needs to have small, medium large sizes for different size</li>
            <li> It is small at front while for back teeth, it is large.</li>
            <li> The size worked for me once I snipped a little bit of the ends off (though I had to bend it quite a bit to make it fit), but I also have a relatively small mouth.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not a perfect mouth guard (I had remold it twice to get a good fit), it&#x27;s a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s better than grinding my teeth down to nothing or finding another dentist who can make me one that would also be of questionable plastic and may or may not fit right and may or may not be covered by my insurance.</li>
            <li> but I was worried because after talking to many people the number one complaint with mouth guards is excessive night drooling and the bulky feel.</li>
            <li> There is not near enough material to cover my teeth at all, especially in the front.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet had my followup appointment with the dentist since wearing the guard so I can&#x27;t say what he thinks about it, but I do plan to take it with me when I have my next appointment to ask him to check the bite and see if he thinks the bite being a tiny bit off is going to be a problem in the long term.</li>
            <li> I have not yet had my followup appointment with the dentist since wearing the guard so I can&#x27;t say what he thinks about it, but I do plan to take it with me when I have my next appointment to ask him to check the bite and see if he thinks the bite being a tiny bit off is going to be a problem in the long term.</li>
            <li> The fairly hard bottom portion (and top portion, once formed) does what the dentist wants it to do which is to be fairly hard and not chewy but firm and grind preventing.</li>
            <li> Too large for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> Maybe my teeth are too large for this seemingly small guard.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and no matter how I mold this device, it is just too large.</li>
            <li> I have really bad Bruxism, so the material was great because it took a while to wear down (like two weeks), but I would spit it out in my sleep since it was so bulky.</li>
            <li> but my jaw feels shoved back with a strong force at an unsettling angle.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t have a full hard plastic front), but despite the other reviews I read, it fits well, and it stays in place all night.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been using a single box of them for over 2 years, just about to finally order a 2nd box now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two huge flaps on the inner part of the guard that press uncomfortably on the upper palate.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of different nighttime mouth guards at many different price points -They are all awkward feeling.</li>
            <li> Apparently, my mouth is much larger than the other reviewers&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The problem was, I could barely get my mouth closed around it.</li>
            <li> The softer plastic that you can mold does cover them, though I don&#x27;t think it will last as long this</li>
            <li> The test will be to see how long the guard will last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a bit to get used to it not completely sticking into your upper teeth, but i don&#x27;t know it could have been an error on my part.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last that long and every time I went to the dentist they changed my bite</li>
            <li> and I am now wondering if this product will last that long.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not great, 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The base is made of hard but slightly malleable material, while the top is coated with form fitting clear material which softens when heated.</li>
            <li> guard is soft but too bulky, even after trimming it down.</li>
            <li> This guard rests behind my upper teeth and does not protrude back on my palate, whereas the custom one my old dentist made me gagged me all the time because it protruded too far back on my upper palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This guard rests behind my upper teeth and does not protrude back on my palate, whereas the custom one my old dentist made me gagged me all the time because it protruded too far back on my upper palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the negative side, it was a bit harder to fit and does not conform to my teeth as well as the Dentek guards -- which are extremely pliable.</li>
            <li> No major problems or concerns.</li>
            <li> molding directions are slightly more complicated than other similar products.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long because I bite through the plastic within one month.</li>
            <li> I think the reason for good and bad reviews is the wide range of sizes of people&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product feels huge in my mouth, even after carefully following instructions.</li>
            <li> and I found that the direction to fit your front teeth as close to the end as possible did not work for me and made the guard uncomfortable and fall out at night.  </li>
            <li> She complains to me that her mouth is open at night and her lips are dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult getting the initial fit completed.</li>
            <li> The molding was way off once I was done and plastic spilled out on the sides further causing the guard to fit wrong.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s too hard and too thick and even with a large mouth and big straight teeth</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a positive or negative thing yet.</li>
            <li> Wow, What a mess.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous because the whole time I thought I was doing something wrong but as long as you follow the instructions</li>
            <li> It says it will send a new one if not satisfied to retry, but I&#x27;d rather just get my money back.</li>
            <li> Every morning, this mouthguard is still in the same place and never comes loose.</li>
            <li> I tried several other brands only to wake up with the guard in pieces in my mouth.</li>
            <li> this is soft, like a football guard on one side, harder plastic on the other.  </li>
            <li> but I really think I am gritting my teeth hard.</li>
            <li> Much comfier and easier to deal with than the hard hunk of plastic my dentist special-made for me.</li>
            <li> but when I went to actually wear it later that night it had obviously changed shape a little.</li>
            <li> Too bad, it would have been nice to save some money.</li>
            <li> and the extra material bunched on the outside, making it fit slightly awkward.</li>
            <li> I found the others were difficult to fit.</li>
            <li> and it was not to difficult to fit or boil.</li>
            <li> Sound product, slightly difficult to boil and adjust.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, fit was uncomfortable, but that may be a matter of personal expectations.  </li>
            <li> could* cure you of sleep apnea, and can stop your snoring completely (no guarantees or claims on this by the manufacturer).&lt;br /&gt;****************Update**************&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have a problem with it slipping out of my mouth, I constantly wake up during the night because of the awkwardness of it being too bulky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me a long time to get used to wearing it</li>
            <li> Might be user error, but it was a complete waste for me.</li>
            <li> so I had to dunk it back in the pot of water for 20-30 sec.</li>
            <li> Took several tries.</li>
            <li> Also it was too long in length, although you can trim it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unsolicited, btw... just passionate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few different night guards and avoided this one because it was more expensive.</li>
            <li> It will save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s gonna take me a long time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> * Absolutely NO concerns about this one splitting into two pieces, unlike prior brands.  </li>
            <li> showed it to my dentist, and he recommended against using &#x27;one for all&#x27; guards because they can misalign a bite if used for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I would wake up with sore front teeth as it felt like there had been pressure on them all night long.</li>
            <li> so excuse me if I do not write correctly&lt;br</li>
            <li> will not regret getting one of these as long as you follow the directions to the T and take your time without distractions.&lt;br /&gt;$425 or $18, hum?</li>
            <li> It is wide at the back teeth (wings).</li>
            <li> but found that they did not really provide enough coverage</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too long.</li>
            <li> I was told I was a grinder a long time ago</li>
            <li> A second attempt led to no improvement as it was still very loose and there was no chance it would stay in while I was asleep.</li>
            <li> Not great -- even after fitting it they did not stay in mouth for the whole night, rendering them useless.</li>
            <li> dentist had long recommended a mouth guard, offering one for $400.</li>
            <li> It seems that the material used is harder now and apears to be a ltitle smaller.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a little stiff at first</li>
            <li> It has additional hard surface material not only below the molars, but also curves up slightly into the roof of the mouth, so no more slipping after fitting.</li>
            <li> Plus the \\&quot;hard\\&quot; part wasn&#x27;t hard enough for me, I would have grinded right through that night guard, I had a profesional one for a few years</li>
            <li> It only covers about half of my back molars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on these things (I dream about eating chocolate cake and other desserts and wake up while</li>
            <li> Also, there seems to be less of it in general</li>
            <li> I had bought a Large size guard my first time around and after a few nights found it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very poor fit.  </li>
            <li> It is thick enough for the grinding and thin enough to fit in your mouth with out feeling like anything is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> so I had to re heat it a few times to get it down to the right thickness and also had to trim the sides because they were a little too long and made me feel like gagging.</li>
            <li> This brand has been a blessing, other ones have gotten chewed through in just several nights.</li>
            <li> the drug stores were generic names and I tried one other brand and now I know the difference as you would</li>
            <li> Better then the my dentist&#x27;s expensive one!</li>
            <li> (Haven&#x27;t had that issue with other similar products.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other night guards that I have picked up at Target or a drugstore and</li>
            <li> Other night guards I have tried always fall out of my mouth in the middle of the night</li>
            <li> It works as promised and will keep further damage to teeth, gums, etc due to the grinding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps this works on larger heads although I&#x27;m not exactly petite.</li>
            <li> Molding it gets easier with practice, but definitely do what the other reviewers said and suck on the piece while biting so the gelly stuff gets pulled up.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to follow the molding directs to the second, as advised elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Save your $20 to put towards the appointment, going to the dentist may be unpleasant but will be better in the long run, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> No jaw soreness, however my mouth is dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is basically what I expected, although I found it a bit difficult to fit.</li>
            <li> Because this product is made of a softer, gel-like material it doesn&#x27;t really do much to prevent clenching and actually made my jaw pain worse.  </li>
            <li> It fits well, although it&#x27;s not long enough for the hard plastic part to cover my farthest back teeth (and I don&#x27;t have any wisdom teeth either).</li>
            <li> A few months later I tried this product again (since it was the only one they sell at my local grocery store) and the same result occurred - too narrow.  </li>
            <li> Leaving me tired with a very sore mouth the entire day.</li>
            <li> This does not fit properly, even following their directions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was returned...did not live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> and it shows no signs of wear at all so it must be made out of pretty tough stuff.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, almost impossible to bite through and are easily customized.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time getting it to fit tight enough so it wouldn&#x27;t come loose when I&amp;#34;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> found this product on sale at Rite Aid for $36 down from $44 but paid just a tad over $20 with shipping on Amazon (new of course) and had it in just a few days.</li>
            <li> This guard is way to small for an adult.  </li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth or a sensitive gag reflex this is not the mouth guard for you.</li>
            <li> However, I found that this guard excessively rubs my gums and roof of mouth near my teeth.</li>
            <li> Even cutting it a bit narrower wouldn&#x27;t help, and my wife&#x27;s $400 nightguard (professionally made) isn&#x27;t really any smaller.</li>
            <li> The product is meant to last for about 3 months at a time on average.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> But be sure it isn&#x27;t just up against your front teeth, but also even on both sides of your mouth - it is pressing on my teeth - very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It was also too wide (not too long--</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the packaging doesn&#x27;t inform you what it should finally look like once properly molded to know if you did it right, and if you are unsure and use it, your teeth end up shifting slightly.</li>
            <li> You really have to be an expert to get it to just the right temperature before it shrivels up in a useless, hard space ball,</li>
            <li> The instructions do say to check with your dentist before using this if you have loose fillings, caps or unfilled</li>
            <li> The instructions do say to check with your dentist before using this if you have loose fillings, caps or unfilled</li>
            <li> It comes loose so does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever feel like its going to come loose unwanted and</li>
            <li> and it is still loose.</li>
            <li> so the night guard became a bit loose in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Two stars for them sending me a free coupon to buy another, but seriously, why change a product that worked so well, or at least, why not keep both versions?  </li>
            <li> Since my stove is not in my bathroom the 20 second count before I bit down on</li>
            <li> The problem is your teeth will shift regardless with constant chewing at night, but this may save you money on cracked and worn down molars.</li>
            <li> So essentially to sleep with it, my mouth would need to hang open, which is not how I usually sleep.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s half price compared to my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> It also has less material towards the back, so i didn&#x27;t need to make any cuts or adjustments to length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already saved so much money (not to mention my teeth) over the past few years.</li>
            <li> My last one fell out of my mouth during the night (it was a big waste of $27!</li>
            <li> Plus, you&#x27;ll be less likely to kill the dog after it chews up the cheaper version.</li>
            <li> I may be sleeping less deeply but from the indents on my tongue in the morning</li>
            <li> I have a pretty small mouth and it still seemed to be a bit small.</li>
            <li> Although I followed the instruction, I failed in my first and second attempt.</li>
            <li> If you get it wrong, your significant other will complain about your slurping sounds.</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear-cut and arrived quickly, but unfortunately wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> If you really have bad bruxism, consider skipping the cheapies and going to the dentist for the real thing, it might save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I didnt mold it quite right, but it is quite thick in the front of my teeth .</li>
            <li> You simply drop it in boiling water for a short time and then bit down on it for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> The plastic ones WILL NOT damage your teeth because enamel is a very hard material that will damage the plastic before the plastic does any real damage.</li>
            <li> My teeth are worn down and my K9s are flat so going without one isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to sleeping with this thing, but it&#x27;s no big deal, and I&#x27;m a fussy sleeper.  </li>
            <li> , an anti-snoring mouthpiece is something that is molded to your lower (and upper) jaw to bring it foreward a little bit and keep it there.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions and doing a little trimming resulted in a guard that fits well and does not make me gag.  </li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to, doesn&#x27;t hug my teeth as well because there just isn&#x27;t enough product to mold.</li>
            <li> I think I personally set mine a little to close to the front edge</li>
            <li> Wife siad it is a little to big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other night guards and all of them basically can apart after a month or less.  </li>
            <li> I folllowed the instructions as closely as possible, here is what happened;  I boiled the water for over a minute(rolling boil), when I put the guard in, channel side down, it floated!  </li>
            <li> Every time I have used this I woke up with my jaw tight and stiff and was in pain the entire next day.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ETA: when it comes to bruxis, take note if you are experiencing inexplicable gum erosion and need root canals for shattered teeth - one of my molars just lost a huge chunk.  </li>
            <li> did notice my jaw getting better when I used it, but the stupid thing fell out (or I yanked it out in the middle of the night)every night.</li>
            <li> and I am not confident about how long it will last given my luck with OTC nightguards.</li>
            <li> Just not sure why a small piece of rubber cost that much.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that my dog LOVES to find it and chew them up, so I&#x27;m now purchasing my 3rd one of these</li>
            <li> They offer a replacement if it does not fit, but the fit is so poor from the start that another one would not help!</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> closed</li>
            <li> My Husband has suffered severe migraines daily for a few months.</li>
            <li> It was much harder to form to my teeth than others I have tried.</li>

            <li> My mom was on the market to purchase a night-guard for a few months but she did not know which one to purchase, so I came on amazon to make my final decision!</li>
            <li> but it only takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Somehow, after two tries, it still won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few days to get used to it.</li>
            <li> It works as expected and with no issues.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll get the expected result.</li>
            <li> H recommended this product and it lasts me every few months or so with the proper care.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Now we&#x27;re looking at a few hundred dollars for the same piece.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different mouth guards over the years..</li>
            <li> Ended up being a total waste.  </li>
            <li> the device continually falls out during the night, I still grind my teeth all night, and I wake up to a wet drooly pillow.  </li>
            <li> but maybe it has to do with my teeth being not perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> No thanks..</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I had to refit it because I got it off center.</li>
            <li> I expected a mouth guard against snoring.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I found that the bonding a type of velcro no longer would hold the upper and lower gaurds together.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have found that I don&#x27;t grins through in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My headaches are minimal with it&#x27;s use and that&#x27;s all a migraine prone girl could ask for.</li>
            <li> Nightguard worked as I expected, used it and still in use,</li>
            <li> took 3 tries to get one to a point it would stay in place at night.  </li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve woken up in the middle of the night, I&#x27;ve found a comfy cushion that has stopped the pain from clenching my teeth.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, but worth the comfort.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, watched videos on YouTube, and spent over an hour trying.  </li>
            <li> Lifted the piece out with a fork, carefully, from the underside.  </li>
            <li> Because the product is guaranteed, my money was refunded with absolutely no argument.  </li>
            <li> After 5 tries, I gave up.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different products.</li>
            <li> The curve of this unit is narrow toward the back.</li>
            <li> Could never get this to stay on my teeth, finally just threw it out, wasted money for me.</li>
            <li> The information on this product was misleading in that it did not say it could not be used if you wore a dental partial plate.  </li>
            <li> Spent money for nothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even attempt remolding it, and the microwave instructions are so unnecessary and don&#x27;t work compared to their old simple instructions of boiling it.  </li>
            <li> All the teeth covered by the night guard will slowly sink into the gums and after awhile (2 years), only your back teeth will touch.</li>
            <li> Even worse is the mouth guard was far too big.  </li>
            <li> As I read the reviews of others, it seems as if there are two responses: either people loved it or hated it.</li>
            <li> The main danger in plastic guards is in accidentally swallowing broken pieces that may come loose while you are sleep-grinding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m possibly going to reheat it and see if I can adjust it, but right now it was a waste of money since it is too uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the process, but succeeded in molding it on the first try--the softening and molding process took less than three minutes total after the water reached the boiling point.</li>
            <li> recommend this over other mouth guards, but it will need to be molded to your standard or it&#x27;ll seem cheap and painful.</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that it&#x27;s a little short for my mouth and that I&#x27;m suspicious of the health effects of the soft rubber layer.</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that it&#x27;s a little short for my mouth and that I&#x27;m suspicious of the health effects of the soft rubber layer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to completely close your mouth at night with The Doctor&#x27;s, unlike some other brands.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking seriously of buying a second to have as a back up because it fits so well and didn&#x27;t bother me while I slept.</li>
            <li> I can usually get a year to two years out of one of these, and as hard as I bite down and chew in my sleep, that&#x27;s really saying something!</li>
            <li> , if i bite down hard on this thing or try to grind my teeth like my subconscious self will likely do while im asleep, the night guard  does protect my teeth</li>
            <li> and this simply doesn&#x27;t work, at least not for someone with average sized or larger teeth.  </li>
            <li> The gel oozes out in all of the wrong places and sets in awkward or uncomfortable positions and doesn&#x27;t create a good fit.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this product is way too small for an adult mouth, it doesn&#x27;t cover the rear few teeth.</li>
            <li> As long as I use this little baby my TMJ is under control.</li>
            <li> I tried a few times (boiling again) and couldn&#x27;t get a tight fit, so it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to mold, but the bottom, hard layer is rigid and uncomfortable, especially for a small mouth.</li>
            <li> It has only helped very little.  </li>
            <li> Obviously it feels like I&#x27;ve got something on my teeth, but there&#x27;s very little excess material in the front between the front of my teeth and my lips.  </li>
            <li> Previous products I have used did not fit properly and would sometimes fall out of my mouth , so I worried about choking while I was sleeping .  </li>
            <li> This soft guard is not good for those who clench their teeth.</li>
            <li> If you are considering this as a night guard I would advice considering other options.</li>
            <li> May just be that it&#x27;s a foreign object in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Obviously,from reading these other reviews,this mouthguard does not work for everyone&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Other guards have not done this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other things is the Doctor&#x27;s satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night guard for about a week - my dentist told me I needed to have one due to the wear patterns on my teeth</li>
            <li> to say that this mouth guard won&#x27;t work for other people, it just does not for me.</li>
            <li> I followed the instruction exactly as they were stated in booklet and the mouthguard failed to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I noticed it breaking into small pieces and finally splitting at the seam on one side.</li>
            <li> Unlike other night-guards this one does not slip out of your teeth when you are asleep.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, once I chew through this one. :/</li>
            <li> At first, it felt weird</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T HURT LIKE THOSE OTHER CHEAPER</li>
            <li> My dentist has been after me to get a night guard due to my severe bruxism (teeth grinding).</li>
            <li> When I go to the dentist, I have to use the children&#x27;s devices to have x-rays done due to gagging.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Other brands end up sliding around during the night, and it&#x27;s a wonder</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mouth guard because, after I molded it to my teeth, it had sharp edges that irritated my gums and the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> It was recommended that I use this due to teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> Due to this nightguard, I don&#x27;t wake up with a headache, sore jaws, or chipped teeth anymore.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt weird the first couple nights</li>
            <li> Only difference is you may have to trim it, if you have a small mouth like I do.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to get a fit that will last past an hour.  </li>
            <li> (even the tips from other people), but could not get it to stay or mold onto my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Doctor&#x27;s blows the other ones away.  </li>
            <li> With other brands, I was semi-concerned about choking at night because they would come off my teeth.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m a small person 5&#x27;2 petite female.</li>
            <li> athletic night guard from wal-mart that works EXTREMELY well.  </li>
            <li> Product may work for other people though</li>
            <li> just what I expected!</li>
            <li> my jaw ached and I had other areas of discomfort in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I think the rubbery surface gave my teeth an extra grip - instead of my teeth sliding over slick surfaces.</li>
            <li> Having had braces in the past I definitely don&#x27;t want to risk my teeth being moved.</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of other reviews on this night guard before deciding to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mouth guards</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth--dentists comment on it, and always prompt me to open wider when I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so I must have an issue that I am not aware of in my jaw.</li>
            <li> After trying two other night guards, I almost gave up.  </li>
            <li> Although, if you are an extreme clench-er you may need to have one made from your dentist or orthodontist.</li>
            <li> The boil and shape method is pretty lame.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper here than any other store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m revising my review after trying other mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> Switch to the other brands.</li>
            <li> not sure why this one is different</li>
            <li> This monstrosity was so thick I could barely close my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a little tough to get used to it, and sleep the whole night.</li>
            <li> I closed my mouth, bit down and sucked on it(what</li>
            <li> However, this is so uncomfortable and bulky that my cheeks actually bulged out slightly on the sides, due to the large width of this mouthguard, there is a hard edge to this guard that stays in a hard U shape, instead of conforming to a natural shape, it bows out a bit.</li>
            <li> Impossible to fit.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions precisely for molding this to my mouth, and still found it impossible to sleep in it.  </li>
            <li> Too simple and expensive for what it offers in terms of materials and application.</li>
            <li> This means that to ensure my back teeth get in the mold it basically wraps around behind my front teeth instead of having my front teeth rest in the actual guard.</li>
            <li> As for me, this is far to expensive to bother trying again, especially considering how sore it made me to begin with.</li>
            <li> Dog unfortunately has developed a taste for chewing these up, but I&#x27;ve gone back and re-bought these each time.</li>
            <li> I found that the guard was too large and thick for my mouth as I have a very small mouth.  </li>
            <li> Paid close to 500 for previous custom guard, which was uncomfortable and cracked within 3 months (I have pretty severe case of bruxism...)</li>
            <li> This is so big that it&#x27;s pretty impossible to sleep with it inside of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I woke up a few mornings with tight jaws and minor headaches and discovered I&#x27;ve been clenching my teeth during my sleep.</li>
            <li> It appears this brand is owned by a large corporation, and I found getting the correct information to get to the customer service area difficult.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s too large and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I will admit this one was a little harder to form</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would have given this less stars due to</li>
            <li> so it is much less bulky than any other night guard I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Yes, I ground my teeth so hard that I broke one of my back molars.  </li>
            <li> The bottom layer is a hard plastic like substance that protects your teeth from actually grinding.</li>
            <li> Bruxism is awful and I&#x27;ve already wasted too much money on these cheap mouth guards.</li>
            <li> I can say on at least two mornings I woke up and didn&#x27;t realize I still had the nightguard in until about 20 seconds later.  </li>
            <li> This was too bulky for my mouth, which is an average size, I think?</li>
            <li> The guard was big and clumsy.</li>
            <li> Much to my disappointment, the second one started to fall apart several months later.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was the instructions were not included in the package somehow.</li>
            <li> I used for about 10 days and decided not worth trying to get used to anymore.  </li>
            <li> The boiling process is no fun either.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> when).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that my first few nights with this on were REALLY uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My teeth are nasty when I wake up, I&#x27;m not sure this is good to use for long periods.</li>
            <li> I would wake up with a sore jaw far worse then when I don&#x27;t wear it</li>
            <li> thick, keeps mouth open while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have an old dentek and it broken after half a year of use.</li>
            <li> 50 seconds in boiling water with the channel side down...</li>
            <li> The rest is all down hill.</li>
            <li> As he put it, I had the option of wearing down my teeth or getting a bite guard to absorb the damage.  </li>
            <li> and it SHRINKS after it cools down.</li>
            <li> my teeth would wear down :</li>
            <li> and I will buy it again when it wears down (box says six months).</li>
            <li> i feel i&#x27;ve just thrown my money down the drain</li>
            <li> they do get worn down in about 4 months for me though.</li>
            <li> Bite down on what, my hand?</li>
            <li> There is nothing to hold onto; you cannot hold it and bite down, I don&#x27;t get how that&#x27;s supposed to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can tell you that the plastic material breaks down to almost uselessness after about 3 weeks of grinding.</li>
            <li> I discovered a gagging sensation when I laid down.</li>
            <li> If I tried to use it, I would have probably choked to death on it as it would have slipped out and down my throat.</li>
            <li> bit down</li>
            <li> Helpful if the mold is formed to your mouth in a lying down position.</li>
            <li> However, I grind so hard that I have almost ground through the soft layer of plastic and through the hard layer as well.</li>
            <li> some other way, this is waste of money.</li>
            <li> I feel I just wasted my money and hope to prevent other people from doing so.</li>
            <li> The resulting molded guard was too narrow and put pressure on my other teeth, which caused additional discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to use this as it just fell off my teeth loose in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The shape is odd too.</li>
            <li> but I still had them from a a previous box.</li>
            <li> : I had one made by my doctor for $500.00 and that one cracked in half.</li>
            <li> My jaw felt slightly out of alinement.</li>
            <li> That feeling lasted less than one minute.</li>
            <li> you are a snorer, this will make you snore less.  </li>
            <li> it was bulky (compared to previously used brands) and caused me to gag.</li>
            <li> Slightly bulky doesn&#x27;t always stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I had it in my mouth for half and hour.  </li>
            <li> So I stopped using it, after about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that this is an affordable solution for people without serious grinding problems or really crooked teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed in the past by many nightguards that fall apart or 2 pieces separate.</li>
            <li> The dog WILL eat it so as my dentist friend said, treat it like a bone and keep it well hidden from the dog.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, if you have a small mouth or have had issues with retainers in the past I would spend the extra money to get something that is a bit lower profile.</li>
            <li> I wound up throwing it out after less than one night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I even reformed the guard and tried again, this time boiling it for slightly longer, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> My tongue rested on a big hunk of useless plastic on the back of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> Another thing, there is a slight taste to the mouth guard.</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t snap in half.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a dentist made mouth guard broke on me after ~1 year or less of use.  </li>
            <li> Less headache, less pain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much less bulky than the one my dentist made for me.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to the closest shape of my teeth, it&#x27;s already formed a shaped  from my previous try</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the way my teeth feel ever so slightly &amp;#34;shifted&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can eat in my dreams, all night long, and it stays where it belongs and protects my hard working</li>
            <li> The trick is to bite down a little but suck in and use your tongue to spread the plastic on your roof of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Awkward at first, but easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> got this one and was really disappointed at the fit.</li>
            <li> they tend to get dirty first.</li>
            <li> Not true AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Both broke down within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would not hold tightly to my teeth as designed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bulky, tight, and I could never get it to work correctly.  </li>
            <li> Trying to get to the right customer service area was very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I had an NTI nightguard made for me by my dentist years ago that was a little too tight to wear</li>
            <li> There seems to be a lot of negative reviews with regards to this night guard not fitting properly, or that the night guard doesn&#x27;t help with snoring or sleep apnea.  </li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About four months in, however, I started finding little bits of plastic in my mouth in the morning.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time getting used to sleeping with this thing</li>
            <li> well (a little bulkier than the dentist ones though) and sticks to my to teeth</li>
            <li> I will keep it so that when my jaw flare&#x27;s again I can try it out for a little bit, but it wont be something I use all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to get it heated and molded correctly.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to get the molding correct</li>
            <li> &gt; A little bulky but that does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34;, so it&#x27;s not because of being small like some of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I have had the guard for a little over 3 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> used this mouth guard for a little over six months.</li>
            <li> I recommenf thid to a friend who grinds their teeth and or have teeth athat are a little rotton in the front.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> But a little pricey...</li>
            <li> my dentist has been wanting to charge me, I figured I had little to lose trying it.</li>
            <li> and it did take a little getting used to, but I can fall asleep with it in every night now.  </li>
            <li> I just rinse it and store it in a cup with antibacterial dish detergent and a little salt.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bar of very hard plastic in the middle of this thing.</li>
            <li> but I have been wearing them down and chipping them with all my teeth grinding!</li>
            <li> This specific model is VERY THICK compared to a custom mold from a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never really gets hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was uncomfortable and actually made me clench my teeth harder to keep it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a waste of your money.  </li>
            <li> Not comfortable.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> the one Rite-Aid sells (it fell apart in a few weeks).</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days I get pain in my jaw.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few days for fear I would get cavities.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time with the cheaper store brands.</li>
            <li> Another few nights</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> You might feel it&#x27;s difficult to wear it all night at the beginning if your are sensitive.</li>
            <li> got a few months out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t  wear it so it is a waste</li>
            <li> At this price, I don&#x27;t mind replacing the DIY version every few months for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Once I got it shape correctly, it fits really firm and I don&#x27;t taste anything like the GG.</li>
            <li> So wasted almost $300 on a custom made one.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a night guard for a few years now and it was time to replace mine</li>
            <li> But it is a waste of money if you are buying it to stop snoring</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> still think people giving this a poor review do not mold it properly.</li>
            <li> It fits firmly on your teeth and is comparable to a custom night-guard</li>
            <li> Well it did not fit my mouth correctly</li>
            <li> My dentist advised me to try a few \\&quot;over</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one...</li>
            <li> issue.for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy grinder</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> In the end the product never fit and it is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> $18 bucks wasted and Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money,</li>
            <li> I found that if I use it every night it seems to change my bite, so I use it a few nights per week.</li>
            <li> I went to the trouble to try them all.</li>
            <li> That was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably, but is annoying at night.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable, and the molding just creates and traps bacteria in your gums.</li>
            <li> this customer, it&#x27;s money wasted.</li>
            <li> Your MUST follow instructions to a tee when molding, still not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have just wasted $18.</li>
            <li> i feel like i&#x27;ve wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, it was trashed and I returned to this mouth guard.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it falling out at night.</li>
            <li> I heated it up and followed the instructions diligently because I once before got this product and had trouble with it</li>
            <li> I had a lapse for a few weeks</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on others.</li>
            <li> Wasted the $20 and just threw the piece of garbage in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time or money on this.  </li>
            <li> It was still firmly in place in the morning.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does not fit and stay in mouth.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few nights I no longer continually bite my cheek.</li>
            <li> This is not for TMJ or people with missing teeth.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, I had a dentist provide a made-to-order  mouth guard</li>
            <li> Chunky and messy.</li>
            <li> It does never fit the mouth as it is supposed to....</li>
            <li> It did not fit; it moved her teeth; repeat visits did not resolve anything</li>
            <li> but this one fits firmly and doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> , I KNOW that this night guard saved my teeth and my jaw from another round of gnashing.  </li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks now that I&#x27;ve been wearing this guard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to destroy my teeth prematurely</li>
            <li> but after a few nights she doesn&#x27;t even notice the sensation as she falls asleep.</li>
            <li> After they made a few improvements</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times thinking I had to get used to it....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> A few days ago I started using one of these.</li>
            <li> Giving this a 3, my wife had quite a bit of trouble getting this formed to her teeth...</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble sleeping with it either.  </li>
            <li> or you may run into trouble...</li>
            <li> I had a DenTek one for a while, but the guard separated from the sides after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy grinder</li>
            <li> few caveats/thoughts...</li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;ve worn it for several weeks and it doesn&#x27;t look any worse for the wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I toss it in denture cleaner during the day a few times a week.veral weeks</li>
            <li> , I toss it in denture cleaner during the day a few times a week.</li>
            <li> and I had to re-boil it a few times</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was too narrow for my molars.  </li>
            <li> You have to change them every couple of months, so growing jaws and missing teeth aren&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to say that, because I was really hopeful that this would allow me to avoid the big expense.  </li>
            <li> had to do some extra molding to the guard&#x27;s hard surface due to it irritating my front</li>
            <li> A few of them had really hard material in the front that seemed to serve no purpose other than causing my front teeth and gums discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had paid for a dentist-made $500 out-of-pocket one a few years ago (insurance doesn&#x27;t cover these usually), but it snapped in half when I was cleaning it....</li>
            <li> This thing is very frustrating and difficult to fit ....</li>
            <li> However, the nightguard is slightly too small.</li>
            <li> Alas, apparently I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> This product relies on a gel that molds to your mouth inside of a stiff rubber form.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use this product too long for fear that my tongue will deform, so I&#x27;m going to switch between different varieties of guards.  </li>
            <li> Why do we go to Dentists who insist on selling us dental guards for well over $250 where you have to go for imprints and takes weeks to get back and are usually very uncomfortable and last about a year.</li>
            <li> its a little thick and adjustment may take a while with slight difficulty but it works.</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth don&#x27;t waste ur money.</li>
            <li> My tongue usually holds that shape for a few hours after waking up.  </li>
            <li> If you have a narrow palate, or are a petite person, don&#x27;t waste your time on this!</li>
            <li> I must have ordered 4 mouth guards in the past few months, none of which helped me.</li>
            <li> Initially, I had shaped it too tightly to my teeth and found the suction/pressure uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and soft as compared to my expensive hard</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wake up w/ an aching jaw, scrapes on the sides of my mouth and a raw tongue.  </li>
            <li> Finally got rid of my annoying teeth grinding so that my girlfriend can now sleep next to me and doesn&#x27;t wake up halfway through the night and get extremely grouchy.  </li>
            <li> This one was way too firm, and the method to &amp;#34;custom fit&amp;#34; it is a potential for going wrong.</li>
            <li> The box I purchased online was at least half of what I would have paid at a pharmacy, so that was good!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable to use, I could not keep it in my mouth long enough to know if it worked</li>
            <li> Although you might get some minor stiffness in your jaw or tiny bit of teeth soreness from biting on the guard after you wake up, it&#x27;s nowhere near horrible like it was before.</li>
            <li> The ones you get from your dentist are made of a hard acrylic, so when you grind, your teeth will slide across the glassy surface with little friction.</li>
            <li> Just a little bulky which makes it hard to breath out of you mouth at night.</li>
            <li> The major issue I had with the other products is they have a lot of guard material (i.e., thickness) in front of your front teeth, making it impossible to close your mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instruction manual a little confusing - stated that it shouldn&#x27;t be used for night grinding, clenching or TMD?????</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit thick</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> It it too small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had the same result.  </li>
            <li> Beware if you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Instructions are vague regarding the series of events after the 20 second cooling off period.</li>
            <li> not entirely sure I didn&#x27;t ingest some plastic.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this thing has worked like a dream for the last five months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> I have small mouth</li>
            <li> After spending over $200 in the past on nightguards from my dentist, I would buy this in a heartbeat.  </li>
            <li> I can trim the section that would be past by molars.</li>
            <li> I usually grind all night.</li>
            <li> Although it was bulky for my small mouth, it served its purpose and lasted for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> The thing is small to begin with,</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth, go get the Walgreen&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> After owning the product I would have paid no more than $5for this product</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to conform to my small mouth.</li>
            <li> My mouth is small.</li>
            <li> I had to cut part of it, because I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I found that they are so thick in the molar area that it made my jaws hurt after just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Chance of not pulling it out during the night is small.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It might be because I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I chose this because it was advertised for small mouths.</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth this is not for you.</li>
            <li> After several months of horrible jaw pains thinking my teeth were infected, I discovered my clenching at night was really the problem!</li>
            <li> I felt that they lasted quite a while and even given the above problems, I felt that the weren&#x27;t completely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I would have saved my teeth all the wear and tear on them not to mention the wasted expense!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Teeth I was having issues with, are issues no more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not totally satisfied with the way it fits</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions 3 times, after that the night guard was still not fitting.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was me or the product</li>
            <li> No more pain/sensitivity in my jaw/back teeth when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to do that</li>
            <li> After wearing this model for 2 years now, it feels weird to sleep without it on the occasional night I forget to put it in.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not sure of that, but I do want to get another one as my teeth as moved</li>
            <li> I am 5ft 2in, small frame.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> No more noisy teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> This experience was one of the most horrible I have ever had to experience in my life.  </li>
            <li> I now realize that these were all signs of bruxis but my dentist did not mention that he noticed I was grinding my teeth until after the second expensive root canal.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> Over my lifetime, I have had several of the expensive custom mouthpieces from my dentists.  </li>
            <li> I bought the small one by mistake, but it turns out that *was*</li>
            <li> These are extremely difficult to mold to your teeth, even when following the instructions to a T.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to keep this bulky, mis-shaped and poorly sized thing in my mouth, I have to clench my teeth closed, causing aching jaw and negating the purpose of having it.</li>
            <li> This is small in size, so it isn&#x27;t bulky like my past mouth guards.</li>
            <li> No more grinding and clenching.</li>
            <li> It fits my small mouth.</li>
            <li> I can see where others who do not have small mouths don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Now I am looking a very expensive set of braces at almost 50 years old with no dental insurance.</li>
            <li> Anything that requires a &#x27;few nights&#x27; to get used to sleeping with is not good for your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Even when I pushed down so it was as thin as I could get it while sizing.  </li>
            <li> I suggest cutting a little at a time if it feels too long.  </li>
            <li> While ordering a new Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard, I noticed the product has received some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> no matter how hard I try because it doesn&#x27;t reach around the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was after I cracked one of my teeth from grinding against the hard plastic that it was made of.</li>
            <li> It hardly covered my teeth.</li>
            <li> Hard to stay asleep with this.  </li>
            <li> Bulky &amp; hard to sleep with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are hard to maneuver and hard to shape.  </li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;ll try the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version which appears to be all hard plastic, or if I&#x27;ll try another brand.</li>
            <li> I have an overbite and clinch really hard which I sleep</li>
            <li> The bottom of the piece is hard plastic that cannot be molded.</li>
            <li> hard to cut</li>
            <li> or you can damage it a bit by putting bit marks in the hard plastic even.  </li>
            <li> I know, how hard can it be to heat something and bite it.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard the others are hard and not pliable.</li>
            <li> If you have hard bruxism, GET THIS.</li>
            <li> need hard one for teeth not to move or press on spongy material.</li>
            <li> tried hard to get to like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> eating while I&#x27;m dreaming has been really hard on my teeth.</li>
            <li> i hardly even know i am wearing anything.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to close my mouth to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I am/have been a hard core teeth grinder.  </li>
            <li> and that makes it hard to sleep.</li>
            <li> however you can still clench which is just as hard on your gums &amp; jaw.</li>
            <li> My cheeks were puffed out and I had a hard time closing my mouth.</li>
            <li> hard to make mold...</li>
            <li> The night guard is still too hard to bit in my mouth.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> hard to form to your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to keep in my mouth overnight.</li>
            <li> Its like the rubber was too thick or too hard to mold.</li>
            <li> When I molded around my teeth completely, it felt really bad.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m trying to alleviate pain with a bad crown that I&#x27;ve been meaning to get fixed.  </li>
            <li> If you need a guard that bad, i advise you to get it professionally done at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried like 5 times and sorta gave up cause my jaw hasn&#x27;t been bothering me lately anyway.</li>
            <li> I returned it and was at least refunded.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this device, I have no more headaches caused by grinding my teeth and no more broken teeth.  </li>
            <li> At least this one was cheaper, and I may need it sometime</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been clinching my teeth while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Horrible fit.</li>
            <li> in a while, it needs to be dropped back into simmering water again, for the prescribed minute, then dunked in cold water (from the tap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money for a guard that , at least for me, just couldn&#x27;t mold to my mouth</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> The product is not even advertised towards people with sleeping conditions, so please ignore those negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Horrible fit and wouldn&#x27;t mould correctly.</li>
            <li> you can get web membranes applied to cover the eroded part of the gum line to at least spare yourself some pain.  </li>
            <li> who knows at least its protection.</li>
            <li> I had one years ago that lasted me for at least 2 years.  </li>
            <li> The instructions on how to fit it were awful</li>
            <li> After going to three different dentists searching for a solution to my child&#x27;s chronic night time teeth grinding, I was so desperate I bought this.  </li>
            <li> This night guard is extremely thick.</li>
            <li> Maybe even too thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and bulky in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit thick.  </li>
            <li> The sides were too thick and would not conform around my molars.  </li>
            <li> and that isnt so thick</li>
            <li> -- the bottom line is that it ended up unused and a real waste of money.</li>
            <li> I found these to be too thick.</li>
            <li> Guess the economy and the bottomline forced the switch.</li>
            <li> This nightguard is really thick and clunky.</li>
            <li> Really thick and bulky.  </li>
            <li> A real waste of money.</li>
            <li> Without those babies covered, there was a distinct amount of pressure that they took on during a night of bruxism, which led to a very painful outcome in the morning.</li>
            <li> and it was slightly uncomfortable as one of the inside edges had a small ridge that slightly rubbed against my tongue.  </li>
            <li> When they say use a mirror, they mean it.</li>
            <li> talk about a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> No more pain, popping, stuck jaws!</li>
            <li> No more headaches!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 22, so he said it might not have a terrible effect on my bite at this age, but he recommended against them in general, stating that the custom dentist guards are molded specifically not to interfere with the bite pattern/</li>
            <li> I pressed my teeth very hard, and part of the soft material has detached from the base leaving an edge that makes a little damage on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It should be labeled as SMALL / MEDIUM at the very least.</li>
            <li> I tried to sleep with it in last night and it was very uncomfortable because I was not used to it.</li>
            <li> This was so uncomfortable I tried trimming it down, and this did not help.</li>
            <li> They also would require some trimming, which would leave rough edges on the hard material, cutting into my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I find the trays too shallow.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a serious difference after I started using this night guard.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a serious grinder.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> But in the morning when I wake up, my teeth is a bit hurt and tense</li>
            <li> + dollars for at the dentist which was much to tight and uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It may seem a little issue but it makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> , it seems to me that trying to sleep with ANYTHING in your mouth is a little weird.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i grind my teeth so badly</li>
            <li> Back of the mouth guard dug into my mouth so badly so that I could not use it.  </li>
            <li> It is really bad product, low quality plastic, be careful!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this product is because my dentist recently told me I am badly grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep your mouth guard minty fresh without anything nasty growing on it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time going to the dentist and getting fitted for a bulky, expensive mouth guard.</li>
            <li> They said a custom night guard would be seriously expensive to make, but this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I hated them so much</li>
            <li> and it did not fit correctly and was quite uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was going through other brands like crazy</li>
            <li> Horrible!!&lt;br /&gt;Bulky &amp; hard to mold in teeth!</li>
            <li> It is so hard!</li>
            <li> however my mouth is small and I hated how i could barely breath</li>
            <li> The fit was terrible and extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are not clear, and the quality of the product is bad.</li>
            <li> The first brand I tried was horrible, so I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable in my small mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some cheaper guards from the drug store that were awful but this one is pretty close to the one from the dentist</li>
            <li> I imagine all night guards are awkward, and from what I have been told by others, this is much less so then others.</li>
            <li> This is freaking tough piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> I previously tried several nightguards, but this was worst nightguard for</li>
            <li> I can see that if you&#x27;re really tough on mouth guards you might go through this.</li>
            <li> It was very hard and made things even worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the dentist!</li>
            <li> I also like the softer rubbery material that this one is made of than the expensive hard stuff that the dentist one is made of.  </li>
            <li> I may actually choke to death because of this piece of crap device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It causes me to drool and even if I&#x27;m really tired</li>
            <li> I wore for a week and my mouth hurt worse than if I was grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> it was approximate.  </li>
            <li> One of the absolute worst products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> My jaw has started to get worse</li>
            <li> I still wake up with my jaw muscles tired though 0</li>
            <li> I literally just bought this and am not happy.</li>
            <li> i just stopped wearing them and just made my problems worse..</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;re in worse shape than you were before</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t forget to take my mouth guard on a trip or worse yet forget to repack it and bring it home.  </li>
            <li> it makes my jaw feel tired, keeps me awake, and when I do fall asleep</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grind my teeth as much as I clench them and wake up with a horrible headache because of it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it was bulky behind my front teeth.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look any worse for the wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fools that run this company knows that bigger fools like me &amp; you will buy this crap once, and the prey on us for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it rubs my tongue raw from the hardness of the base (and it&#x27;s not smooth underneath).  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the plastic is just to shallow and without fail</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the limited amount of hard material would usually mean they ended up mis-positioned in my mouth, leading to some tooth shifting overnight.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money and was unable to wear it as it is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The plastic feels very shallow and doesnt wraop around teeth</li>
            <li> Once in a while I&#x27;ll forget to use it, and I nearly always wake up with a nasty migraine after those nights.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate giving a poor review, but for snoring it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and hard</li>
            <li> byt fell apart in a few months :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and basically feel like it was money wasted.</li>
            <li> The hard bottom of this guard makes it impossible for me to chomp through in my sleep.</li>
            <li> but my jaw was hurting bad after the process was over because you have to bite so hard.</li>
            <li> it is useless.</li>
            <li> Difficult to make the tooth impression, and then did not work for me</li>
            <li> Weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these things on and off for years and they&#x27;re really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Bought a store brand and it was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was too bulky for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably not that the product itself is flawed.</li>
            <li> I guess I will be stuck with getting an expensive one from the dentist at some point.</li>
            <li> The instructions were vague.</li>
            <li> I tried this in place of an expensive one from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> This guard is useless to me or anyone else who has TMJ.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that something over the counter would work, but it wasn&#x27;t go to hurt to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this after losing my expensive custom one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Unable to mold to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one along with Grind Guard because I was skeptical how they work.</li>
            <li> When I took it out with a fork and put it on a plate that was waiting for it, I noticed that one side of the guard had yellowed, weird.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I bought the wrong product or the product changed.  </li>
            <li> It was weird</li>
            <li> It was just uncomfortable..</li>
            <li> But the night guard is so uncomfortable, I can&#x27;t stand to use it.</li>
            <li> Failed, failed, failed.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to imprint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is uncomfortable and useless in terms of achieving what it your goals.</li>
            <li> but, sadly, it did not.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> I had an expensive night guard from the dentist</li>
            <li> it was uncomfortable also.</li>
            <li> I broke my night guard that the dentist made me years ago &amp; since they are expensive</li>
            <li> this guard was Uncomfortable &amp; falls out during the night.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t, and there is nothing wrong with my mouth either.  </li>
            <li> Sorry if I spelled bruxism wrong - I&#x27;m still grappling with the issue.</li>
            <li> Cushion troubled, kept grinding/moving my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless for sleeping since I&#x27;ll probably choke on it.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this, before buying an expensive one from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I tried to cut some off the ends as the instructions suggest but it was still uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have always ground my teeth at night and could not afford an expensive night guard made by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Not happy!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong???</li>
            <li> Too difficult and time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to Oral B&#x27;s mouth guard and the experience was awful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found this product to be of no value.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY USELESS...</li>
            <li> they were bulky uncomfortable and irritated my gums..</li>
            <li> Instantly took my horrible jaw aches away and headaches too.</li>
            <li> Sorry I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> Unable to follow a 12 step program to stop grinding my teeth at night, my dentist recommended a mouth guard and some Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I say useless plastic?</li>
            <li> Scary what your teeth are going while you are sleeping.</li>
            <li> Found it to be uncomfortable to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li> 3 stars cause its just a mediocre night guard.  </li>
            <li> If you boil set this item ever so slightly wrong it is basically useless.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this over custom protector which would have been expensive and not covered by insurance.</li>
            <li> Instructions for how to use this product were complicated and had me intimidated.  </li>
            <li> And extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to close your mouth all the way</li>
            <li> It was really difficult for me to get used too.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;No need to boil&amp;#34; plastic version caused sores along the cheek and was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using it every night and do not feel uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Difficult to form .  </li>
            <li> but it is a tedious procedure.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this works like it should.  </li>
            <li> It may just be me, but it is too uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Like some others here, I had an expensive dental guard, made by my dentist, and I lost it.  </li>
            <li> It was so uncomfortable and bulky.</li>
            <li> It helped during my random grinding while studying.</li>
            <li> It felt uncomfortable in my mouth during the molding process.</li>
            <li> but the instructions say you can redo it if it goes wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years instead of the too-tight (expensive) permanent one my dentist made.</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s a bit weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.  </li>
            <li> I may end up going the custom route, this just feel too bulky and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a cracked, custom-made, expensive mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s sinisterly over priced.</li>
            <li> the mold is very very VERY thin there.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy to say the least.</li>
            <li> I hurt my jaw really bad one night, and sleeping made it worse.  </li>
            <li> I hate to have a leave a negative review</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be cumbersome and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have now spent 60.00 dollars and it is horrible and doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a rather nasty flavor, and an odd sort of uncomfortable numbing sensation after about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed something to fix my TMJ symptom and so I ordered one of these.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d choke on it at night</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll wake up choking on it when it falls</li>
            <li> I was afraid to sleep with it in my mouth for fear of choking.</li>
            <li> I ended up not using the product because I was afraid it would slip off in my sleep</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d be slobbering all night.</li>
            <li> To begin, the guard when I opened it looked dirty to me</li>
            <li> I wore it at night and it fits so awkwardly in my mouth</li>
            <li> If you are ABSOLUTELY desperate and need something to stop the grinding temporarily, this might work.</li>
            <li> It has no yucky taste (as afraid it might have that plastic taste, but it doesn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not worried about it being dangerous at all.</li>
            <li> and now I would be uncomfortable not using one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless!</li>
            <li> I was so mad.</li>
            <li> After having a very expensive custom night guard deteriorate after a year of grinding, I was hoping to find an over-the-counter product that would work acceptably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guard was very uncomfortable to me</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and it was very uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to get this to mold into shape.</li>
            <li> I would not by this product again because it was almost impossible to get it fitted in any way I could tolerate for night wear.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to sleep with this mouthguard in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> I have not chewed through one of these bad boys.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I did not even return it for a replacement . . .</li>
            <li> you have a bad gag reflex,</li>
            <li> you have a bad gag reflex,</li>
            <li> BADLY.</li>
            <li> My husband has a really bad grinding problem and his dentist has been telling him for sometime to get a mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I grind so bad, one night without could lead to lost teeth.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I would wake up with my mouth aching in pain.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth really badly at night and my jaw started clicking because of it</li>
            <li> This product is really bad.</li>
            <li> and I thought I had made a bad choice.</li>
            <li> and I woke up with a terrible headache from grinding on it while it was broken all night.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering that one but wound up wasting my money on this and got so frustrated I just dumped it in the trash after trying to wear it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it he has been now waking up without a painful mouth since using it.</li>
            <li> and it was painful.</li>
            <li> I was totally frustrated with this product.  </li>
            <li> However slightly painful to wear over-night.</li>
            <li> bought this to help with my teeth grinding and was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never got it. :(</li>
            <li> Regardless, I was vastly disappointed.</li>
            <li> but they have all been very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This stupid product has the plastic bottom, why do you need that?</li>
            <li> Some idiot probably burned himself and they don&#x27;t want a lawsuit so they had to make the product worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like i said, for some idiot who burned himself, now they have to do some whack microwave instructions.  </li>
            <li> Now I hate the nights if fall asleep with out it.</li>
            <li> I felt this was awkward and terrible.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago, and I hate it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is literally the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought on Amazon</li>
            <li> Ugh I hate to say it</li>
            <li> I still hate sleeping with something in my mouth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this night guard every night (I hate my gag reflex)</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not as annoying as some others.</li>
            <li> but I hate retainers.  </li>
            <li> This product is worthless.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, but I still find it annoying in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the process of having a custom guard made was very unpleasant for</li>
            <li> that may be bad for your business!</li>
            <li> I hated wearing it because my teeth would adjust over the night and in the morning, my front teeth would touch together</li>
            <li> a dentist guard (about 2 months) which cost me $70, and a night guard I bought at Target (~$15 - bulky, but held up - hated it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated this.  </li>
            <li> had very bad tooth pain dentist recommended this guard</li>
            <li> I bought this night guard because I have been having some very bad pain in my jaw area.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Miserable.</li>
            <li> This was awful.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It was awful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Terrible..</li>
            <li> I HATED it!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>

            <li> but this product is terrible.  </li>

            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> My migrain was horrible......</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst product ever.</li>
            <li> but it may just be the terrible job I did at molding it to my teeth since I was in a hurry.</li>
            <li> so awful.  </li>
            <li> So terrible.</li>
            <li> I woke up with horrible jaw pain</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s worn and looks nasty then replace.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this nightguard, Followed direction, turned out awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have Sleep Apnea and wear this to bed at night to prevent grinding. My dentist highly recommended this mouth piece.</li>
            <li> The concept is great. I  really need it for my bottom teeth, so that is what I took the impression of. The ideal guard would be soft on top and bottom with the hard piece in the middle. If anyone knows of this kind of produce, please let me know.</li>
            <li> Attempted fitting per instructions 3x. Would not hold tightly to my teeth as designed. Not satisfied. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd I have purchased in two weeks.  The first one I thought I may have not properly followed directions as it falls loose in my mouth and becomes a choking hazard.  The problem is there is no material in the front of the your incisors to mold into place.  The guard acts like a hinge holding in the back and falling forward into your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this 2nd one attempting to keep the guard far forward to attempt to get more material in front of my teeth with no results.  Same problem where the guard falls into mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a waste of your money.  Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> If you are considering this as a night guard I would advice considering other options. You cannot sleep with this guard in your mouth. It is too big and fat. Not comfortable. Also The molding does not work great. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke. I am glad it is not expensive. I don&#x27;t want to bother returning it. It needs to be customized otherwise it is useless. I may actually choke to death because of this piece of crap device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moulding? Are you kidding me? How many hours do I have to bite this thing for how many months everyday. This is freaking tough piece of plastic. It it too small. It will never be snug in my mouth no matter how hard I try because it doesn&#x27;t reach around the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel totally suckered by this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how crappy a product, 50% of the people would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Find some other way, this is waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all!</li>
            <li> I bought this specific dental protector based on recommendation from my dentist after seeing some chips in several of my teeth, presumed to be happening during sleep.  I followed the enclosed instructions exactly, and wasn&#x27;t able to get the protector to fit correctly - it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place, kept falling off my teeth when opening my mouth.  Per the instructions, I tried reshaping the gel back to original and going through the molding process a second time.  Unfortunately, I had the same result.  Then I called the manufacturer, per the instructions, and they mailed me a certificate for a free replacement, which arrived about a week later.  I cashed in the certificate for a replacement at a local store but haven&#x27;t tried fitting the replacement protector yet.  Fingers crossed it will somehow miraculously fit this time around.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to form to my mouth just right. I have not been able to fall asleep with it in my mouth. Miserable. May just be that it&#x27;s a foreign object in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of different nighttime mouth guards at many different price points -They are all awkward feeling. The key with this one is to be very, very careful during the fitting- be sure to follow the directions exactly as listed. I read through the instructions completely and then gathered all of my supplies while reading through the directions again.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and this simply doesn&#x27;t work, at least not for someone with average sized or larger teeth.  There is not near enough material to cover my teeth at all, especially in the front.  It falls right out.  I followed instructions to remold it and same thing - just not enough moldable plastic to cover my teeth.  Maybe it should come in different sizes?  Will be trying to get my money back.  Total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The easiest &amp; most comfortable guard to make.  Wearing it - it fits like a glove.  Doesn&#x27;t move around during the night &amp; can drink water without dislodging it.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this product is way too small for an adult mouth, it doesn&#x27;t cover the rear few teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband lost his custom nightguard made from a dentist for hundreds of $$$&#x27;s.  He then got this one and feels it works just as well.</li>
            <li> Difficult to make the tooth impression, and then did not work for me</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions.  Keeps my teeth from grinding and stays in place at night.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to either clean it more thoroughly than brushing every so often, or replace it over time- it is something you stick in your mouth every night, after all.</li>
            <li> I think I messed up the fit a little, since it grips in the back but slips off in the middle near my front teeth, but it seems to be doing okay. I can already feel some wear on it, so I dunno how long it&#x27;s gonna hold up, but it&#x27;s not nearly as uncomfortable as I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> My dentist actually recommended this to me.  I melted and remolded about three times, but I give up.  I put it in and it just doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  I find the trays too shallow.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try a fourth fitting, but I&#x27;m not sure.  What a waste of money.  I seem to clench my teeth at night, which causes sensitivity, that&#x27;s why the dentist recommended this.</li>
            <li> Weird but I love this thing! Very easy to fit to your mouth too! Seems to conform even better after you have worn it a while each night. I think it warms ups &amp; by morning you don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> Sure beats paying $400 at the dentist to get a night guard fitted. It is comfortable and durable. Gets grungy after 6 months but inexpensive enough to ditch and fit another.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these now and I have found them to be really helpful when trying to curb my teeth grinding. Now some nights if I fall asleep without it I don&#x27;t grind as much. I do however have a pretty small mouth and this fits really well so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with a larger jaw.</li>
            <li> It was easy to re-fit the mouth guard after I messed up on the first try. It is thinner than the one I&#x27;m used too but it&#x27;s easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> Excellent delivery time.  Will keep you posted. How effective. Night guards are!</li>
            <li> I still have my wisdom teeth (for the time being) but I have been wearing them down and chipping them with all my teeth grinding! The chips keep needing to be filled and then I keep chipping the fillings. It&#x27;s bad. I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay the $450 (discounted!) cost for a mouthguard from my dentist, though, so I&#x27;m back to using these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that they are super easy to customize and I think it&#x27;s actually a fun project so I don&#x27;t mind it. However, since I do have my wisdom teeth, I feel like the protection doesn&#x27;t go back far enough. I realize, though, that if it went back too much farther it would be uncomfortable for others, so I&#x27;m prepared to accept that sacrifice for the greater teeth-grinders&#x27; good. In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep using this brand, which is a bit sturdier than others I&#x27;ve tried, and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> The construction is sturdy. The base is made of hard but slightly malleable material, while the top is coated with form fitting clear material which softens when heated. After that, it snaps into place and doesn&#x27;t shift or fall off while sleeping. This is an excellent product! Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap store brands, like the one Rite-Aid sells (it fell apart in a few weeks). I have many porcelain crowns, so it&#x27;s essential that I wear a good nightguard to prevent severe damage to my teeth at night. Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have a small mouth. I&#x27;ve used these things on and off for years and they&#x27;re really uncomfortable. At this point, I&#x27;m going to bite the bullet (pun intended) and get a professionally-made one at the dentist&#x27;s. Bruxism is awful and I&#x27;ve already wasted too much money on these cheap mouth guards. If you really have bad bruxism, consider skipping the cheapies and going to the dentist for the real thing, it might save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t sleep for weeks. I desperately needed something to fix my TMJ symptom and so I ordered one of these. It came quickly and fitting it was a breeze. I can honestly say the this product has allowed me to sleep again by taking the pressure off my jaw and letting me relax the over stressed joint.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting it to fit to my teeth.  I read the instructions before fitting it and during fitting it, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  I tried the refitting procedure and just gave up.  I used it anyway, which just led to my jaw hurting more than it normally does when I wake up.</li>
            <li> This guard is way to small for an adult.  It&#x27;s probably more suitable for a young child.  The shape is odd too. It&#x27;s not round like a mouth is supposed to be, it&#x27;s more V shaped.</li>
            <li> My dentist made me two night guards totalling $450, both of which were shredded within weeks. This product is the most comfortable and natural mouth guard I have tried. I have twice tried Den-Tek which gave me TMJ on both attempts. The Den-Tek guard was slick which caused my jaw to move unnaturally left and right while grinding at night. The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard is not slick when moistened in your mouth. It is more bulky than Den-Tek, but I think that aids in the effectiveness. I rinse mine with mouthwash and at times soak it in peroxide. I have had many which have been replaced simply because they were old. I have not chewed through one of these bad boys.</li>
            <li> Doctor&#x27;s is the one to buy. Bought a store brand and it was uncomfortable. It doesn&#x27;t have the stovetop instructions anymore but I still had them from a a previous box. If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days I get pain in my jaw.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product after discovering that I (as well as many other people!) grind my teeth at night. She mentioned that it works for some people and not for others, so I gave it a try. The quality is really good and it seems very durable, but unfortunately it was too bulky for me. I went back to my dentist and ordered a custom nightguard, which I love. I can only say to give it a try because it may actually fit you and the price is great considering how expensive the custom ones are. But then, it&#x27;s all about how well you sleep at night with one of those on :)</li>
            <li> This night guard is extremely thick. Maybe even too thick. What I did was after I molded it I cut the gaurd so that it only covers four of my back teeth. That&#x27;s all you really need because the thickness is like a bumper where you can&#x27;t close your mouth or clench to grind. And it&#x27;s comfortable this way and it&#x27;s the first guard I don&#x27;t take out in the middle of the night due to uncomfort. But that&#x27;s only because I cut it. Otherwise I would have given this less stars due to it&#x27;s thickness it&#x27;s not that comfortable</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist said he needed this to relieve the stress his grinding causes.  I researched quite a bit on different ones and chose this one.  Got it, he followed the directions completely and it works great.  Doesn&#x27;t bother him, he got used to it easily in just a few nights.  Don&#x27;t know how well it will last, but the comfort it gives him is worth it.  I will definitely buy another one of these when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> It does not snap my teeth properly.  It reduced my sleep quality, then I quit using it.</li>
            <li> My wife has severe TMD and this was a necessity to minimize her bruxism.  It works very well and does it at a good price.  You can spend more, but I can imagine getting a better fit or simpler process for making \\&quot;personalized\\&quot; than what they do.  You simply drop it in boiling water for a short time and then bit down on it for a few seconds.  That&#x27;s it.  Easy.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a need.</li>
            <li> The process of fitting this thing was really painful for my jaw muscles, and I&#x27;ve never managed to get it right.  But in a way, that&#x27;s the nature of these things, so it&#x27;s probably not that the product itself is flawed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other night guards work, but I am not crazy about this one. My teeth are nasty when I wake up, I&#x27;m not sure this is good to use for long periods. I stopped using it after a few days for fear I would get cavities. Hopefully I&#x27;m not grinding too much in my sleep.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years. My dentist showed me the wear on my teeth and recommended I use a nightguard. It has without a doubt saved my teeth. In addition, it has improved the quality of my sleep and I no longer feel the pain associated with teeth grinding when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fitting is fairly straight forward and just takes about 10 minutes. After softening the nightguard in boiling water for 50 seconds, you place the nightguard in your mouth and let it form to your teeth. I rinse it before and after use. Each one lasts me about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried cheaper store brands but they have all been very disappointing. The material feels cheaper, thinner. They don&#x27;t last very long because I bite through the plastic within one month. The fit also doesn&#x27;t hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone that grinds their teeth - don&#x27;t waste your time with the cheaper store brands.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I found it easy to mold. I bought this because my insurance won&#x27;t cover a guard fitted by my dentist and I clench my teeth at night. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s fairly bulky and after molding when I tried to sleep with it I couldn&#x27;t close my lips around it fully... So essentially to sleep with it, my mouth would need to hang open, which is not how I usually sleep. I&#x27;m sure with time and a bunch of sleepless nights I could get used to it, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me to try. I just ordered a different guard that fits on my lower teeth instead and is supposed to be very low profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably good to note that I&#x27;m an adult female with a semi-narrow jaw line. That might be part of the issue.</li>
            <li> Molding it to my teeth was easy enough, and while it does seem to last about 6-8 months, paying $20 twice a year is a HECK of a lot cheaper than getting it through my dentist&#x27;s provide (which fits the same and costs over $400)</li>
            <li> The night guard is excellent.  I was able to create a perfect fit after a second try.  I can speak well with it, it&#x27;s slim and comfortable.  Love it. I ordered two more.  The only con is that the front is thinner than the rest of the coverage.  Other than that, as I said earlier great fit and comfortable.</li>
            <li> had very bad tooth pain dentist recommended this guard I&#x27;ve used it for 3 month&#x27;s no pain since. will not sleep with out it now...</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mouth guard.  Mine last about 5-6 months each.</li>
            <li> In the small fine print it says DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE TMJ....??? What? That should be written outside the box! Oh ok, I understand... that may be bad for your business! You want TMJ sufferers to buy this and then throw it away?</li>
            <li> I believe it is a good product for the price and all. It was easy to mold when boiled on the stove and then bit. Only problem is that I havent been able to fall asleep with it in. It causes me to drool and even if I&#x27;m really tired I just can&#x27;t sleep. I&#x27;ve tried like 5 times and sorta gave up cause my jaw hasn&#x27;t been bothering me lately anyway.</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth don&#x27;t waste ur money. It will not stay in and bulky material.</li>
            <li> I boiled mine for 2-3mins to make it easier to mold.  Its basically like a retainer / tooth guard with out having to pay buku bucks.  Be sure to use fingers to mold the product at the roof of the mouth and rear teeth for snug fit.</li>
            <li> I had to trim the ends a little to make it more comfortable, but once I did it worked great.</li>
            <li> Happiness at last! I clench my teeth at night when I&#x27;m stressed. My old mouthguard was big and bulky. I felt like boxer after 10 rounds. This one is sleek and slim. Easy to fit your mouth. You mold it to your teeth with your fingers while it&#x27;s warm so it fits perfectly. It only wraps around your top teeth but not your front ones. It&#x27;s barely noticeable but really does the job. Plus it&#x27;s half price compared to my local pharmacy. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years. I have been very happy with the original (now I know this is called \\&quot;Classic\\&quot;). This one is smaller, thinner, and doesn&#x27;t even cover my teeth all the way back. I am sure this is good for some people, also sure there are some like me who weren&#x27;t aware of the new model, so-be advised. This brand has been a blessing, other ones have gotten chewed through in just several nights. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I was told by my dentist that I needed a mouth guard while I sleep because I clench my teeth. My insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it, so I&#x27;d be looking at around $500 out of pocket. I then saw a commercial for this product and went straight out and bought it. While it&#x27;s not a perfect mouth guard (I had remold it twice to get a good fit), it&#x27;s a less expensive alternative. I don&#x27;t wake up with headaches anymore, which is also good!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, but I did not have a good result.  I had trouble with fitting it even though I followed the instructions EXACTLY.  Even after I fit it, it would not stay in my mouth at night..... I guess I will be stuck with getting an expensive one from the dentist at some point.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a T.In fact,I read the instructions several times BEFORE having my husband read them out loud, AS I was doing it,to make sure I was following them correctly and exactly. The first time,there wasn&#x27;t enough material to mold around my teeth enough to have it stay in place. After trying a second time(another gentle boil) I molded it as much as I could and waited while biting and sucking in to create the vacuum. It STILL would never stay in place.I might as well just pay my dentist $175 to make sure it fits correctly and to my teeth,as I could spend as much trying all of these other ones. What a huge disappointment. Obviously,from reading these other reviews,this mouthguard does not work for everyone&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much unusable, even after soaking it in a boiling water per instructions, the plastic is too hard and it will not bite down and adjust at all. I had to throw it away!</li>
            <li> This started out as a good product. I actually messed up two or three times and was still able to put it back in the water and re-mold it. Thank goodness. However, I grind so hard that I have almost ground through the soft layer of plastic and through the hard layer as well. Another few nights and I fear my teeth will once again be grinding against eachother. If you&#x27;re not a super hard grinder like me, I think this would be a good product for you. It will, however, not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I had one made by my doctor for $500.00 and that one cracked in half. This was after I cracked one of my teeth from grinding against the hard plastic that it was made of. This plastic is much softer and has more shock absorption, but I still ground right through it. Too bad.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I need to sleep with a hunk of plastic in my mouth to keep me from grinding my teeth, so she pinged my insurance company for $635.  Sure must be a nice hunk of plastic!  Insurance said no.  So she tells me that she really wants me to have one because I really need it, and is willing to sell it to me for her cost, around $350.  My turn to say no.  No way I&#x27;m paying that much for a hunk of plastic.  Could this sort of thing be why our medical insurance premiums are so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I bought one of these.  I carefully followed the fitting instructions found inside the box.  I&#x27;t less bulky and more comfortable than I had anticipated.  It took a little getting used to sleeping with this thing, but it&#x27;s no big deal, and I&#x27;m a fussy sleeper.  I can&#x27;t imagine how the expensive dentist-sourced unit could be significantly better.  In fact, I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing my DDS attempt to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> The instructions were vague. 50 seconds in boiling water with the channel side down...easy. 20 seconds channel side up to cool before you place in mouth...easy. The rest is all down hill. Instructions are vague regarding the series of events after the 20 second cooling off period. Place mouthpiece with front fingers (no time line)...do sucking motion with mouth closed (no timeline)...If doesn&#x27;t fit, repeat procedure with 20 seconds in boiling water...I did. Three times. Save your money. This product is a POS and a rip off.</li>
            <li> My Husband has suffered severe migraines daily for a few months. Even after a visiting to his Chiropractor, the next morning he&#x27;d have a headache. He figured he must be clenching his teeth, and asked me to get him a mouth guard to sleep in. The \\&quot;Advanced Comfort\\&quot; seemed like the best one, and an excellent price.  Easy instructions to boil in a small pot of water, cool, and fit into the mouth. After the first night he felt 100% migraine free, and hasn&#x27;t had one in over a week! I&#x27;m back to buy another for back-up. It is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Well, I just received this product and I fitted it immediately. I can tell you now that I haven&#x27;t got any experience with these things, I&#x27;m an informally diagnosed bruxer and I wanted something to try to put an end to the jaw pain. If you follow the instructions carefully, it really does make for a nice fit. I was afraid of what it would feel like, having a piece of plastic in my mouth, and as I sit with it in, trying to get used to the sensation right now, it&#x27;s not bad at all. My lips come together and my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel too out of order. It&#x27;s comfortable, and from what I understand, it&#x27;s a great deal cheaper than having to go to the dentist and have them make you a custom one. I say, by all means, DO try this product! You probably won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE - 11/30/11*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product CHANGES your bite (the way your teeth line up when you close them). This happened after about 3 nights of use. I have not been to a dentist or know anyone who uses these, so I didn&#x27;t know this would happen. Once I noticed, I stopped and since I&#x27;m young, my teeth went back to how they were before. From what I&#x27;ve read elsewhere, it happens with use of these things, even if it&#x27;s professionally made. From what I understand, even dentists don&#x27;t know or tell their patients this is a side effect. I just wanted to warn people. (I&#x27;ve been informed that potassium can help with bruxing if that&#x27;s your problem)</li>
            <li> Having been a grinder my entire life this night guard has been the easiest to form and is&lt;br /&gt;much smaller than the sports guards that are available. Perfect for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> After decades of grinding my teeth, being lectured to by my dentist, and going through no less than four nightguards (two from the dentist and two over the counter) I can say I have finally found one comfortable enough to actually sleep with through the night. And the funny thing is that I didn&#x27;t perform the forming process 100% correctly so the next Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard I buy will probably feel even more comfortable.  I can say on at least two mornings I woke up and didn&#x27;t realize I still had the nightguard in until about 20 seconds later.  I think the big difference with this one is the two layers, with the soft layer being the one pressed up against your teeth and gums. I think that&#x27;s the trick.  So, now, what&#x27;s great is that normally I wake up with my molars hurting and since wearing this nightguard, my teeth pain is gone. I don&#x27;t have proof of whether this is true, but I seriously think this thing will buy my mouth enough time to perhaps heal some of the damage.  I can only hope!</li>
            <li> I tried this in place of an expensive one from my dentist.  It fit, but was pretty uncomfortable and I kept spitting it out at night.  It also made my jaw sore afterwards because I would chew on it in my sleep.  Too bad, it would have been nice to save some money.</li>
            <li> This night guard works well.  It is a bit thicker than I&#x27;m used to, but maybe it will last longer.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> A++++SELLER WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN!!!!....5 STARS</li>
            <li> Prefer these types of guards to the slim ones. Just a hassle creating the custom fit mold sometimes.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold, comfortable to wear, easily cleaned with half a denture cleaner tab. Much cheaper than having one made by your dentist.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this again. It was much harder to form to my teeth than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Its good. Need to do lot of trimming before using. Feels bulky when you wear it opposed to the ones the doctors make. Anyways, not a bad product. It works.</li>
            <li> After three \\&quot;remelts\\&quot; I finally got it right. It molded to my teeth and it stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard is soft but too bulky, even after trimming it down. There&#x27;s a bar of very hard plastic in the middle of this thing. The guard soon began to irritate me. I removed it, thinking I only needed to get used to wearing it. My jaw felt slightly out of alinement. My back molars weren&#x27;t coming together normally. That feeling lasted less than one minute. I replaced the guard again and wore it for a while more, but it left me with the same sensation upon removing it. Other guards have not done this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I got out my magnifying glass and read the fine print on the side of the box. It states that this guard should not be wore by someone suffering TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint Disorder). Well, I have TMJ, which is the reason why I bought the mouth guard. People with TMJ need to protect themselves from grinding their teeth. It makes no sense to me why this product doesn&#x27;t come with a huge warning right on the front of the box. This guard is useless to me or anyone else who has TMJ. Maybe this is why the dentists charge big bucks to properly fit their TMJ patients with guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have TMJ, discuss this product with your dentist first. Yes, it is much cheaper than the dentist-made guard, but you may do your jaw more damage by using it. There&#x27;s a reason why Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard manufacturers warn us TMJ-ers not to use it. It&#x27;s a stinking disgrace that that warning isn&#x27;t more forthright and noticeable before purchase.</li>
            <li> meh~ if you have a smaller mouth it is just too big.</li>
            <li> I wish I could upload a picture, I got this with opened box, some hair inside the box.I can&#x27;t believe this..</li>
            <li> This company used to make an older version called the classic.  It fit much better, had a harder bottom, and you boiled it.  They changed out it was made and now it won&#x27;t fit my mouth at all. I used this brand for years, but now I can&#x27;t even mold it to my mouth.  I feel like I wasted my money. Two stars for them sending me a free coupon to buy another, but seriously, why change a product that worked so well, or at least, why not keep both versions?  This product is junk, currently sitting in my garbage.  Don&#x27;t even attempt remolding it, and the microwave instructions are so unnecessary and don&#x27;t work compared to their old simple instructions of boiling it.  Some idiot probably burned himself and they don&#x27;t want a lawsuit so they had to make the product worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU HAVE TO BOIL IT AND SUCK ON IT WHEN YOU FORM IT!!!!! The new instructions suck.. like i said, for some idiot who burned himself, now they have to do some whack microwave instructions.  Just boil it for 30 seconds and it works so much better!</li>
            <li> I got this on advice of a chronic migraine sufferer, who no longer gets migraines after using a biteguard.  This is the best biteguard I&#x27;ve found, after trying 5 different versions from different manufacturers.  Not everyone with chronic migraines gets them from grinding/ clenching their teeth, but I *do*.  I only get 10% of the migraines I used to get. Once in a while I&#x27;ll forget to use it, and I nearly always wake up with a nasty migraine after those nights.&lt;br /&gt;I am replacing this product after wearing it for 6 months.  For the tremendous abuse my jaws put this thing through, and the benefit I receive from it, I consider that fair use.&lt;br /&gt;You may have sore gums for a while when you start using it, all that pressure has to go somewhere!  Read the instructions carefully before molding it to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a snorer, this will make you snore less.  If you have &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; sleep apnea, try a double-biteguard (forms to top teeth *and* bottom teeth)--it *could* cure you of sleep apnea, and can stop your snoring completely (no guarantees or claims on this by the manufacturer).&lt;br /&gt;****************Update**************&lt;br /&gt; I bought a second guard (same item) and fit it to my lower teeth.  I sleep with an upper and lower now, and this works much better for me than the double-biteguard, which always leaves my gums swollen and hurting by morning.</li>
            <li> Great product. About 2 years ago I purchased my first nightguard (this one) after learning I grind my teeth so badly at night that I fractured a filling, which then caused a new cavity to form under the original filling. My dentist offered to fit me with a nightguard, but as a twenty-something there was no way i was going to spend hundreds of dollars on one.  This one is easy to use ( if you&#x27;ve ever had to boil and form a mouthguard for sports before, this works the same way), and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like im choking. As a teen my retainer would always fall out in the middle of the night and i&#x27;ve never had that problem with this product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i grind my teeth so badly I actually wear the guard out after 10 months or so, and promptly purchase another one of the same product.</li>
            <li> I have been a teeth grinder for several years, grinding down my eye teeth primarily.  I was hoping this product would help save my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed the instructions to a tee. Fit is not good; loose and slips around. Too thick, causing significant jaw pain in the morning. Will be shopping for another.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she seems to like it alot.  She says it had been helping with her teeth grinding at night and her headaches.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, very easy to fit. Love it!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to make this fit but it seemed to make mt teeth shift each time I used it. I will be looking for something different</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the Dr&#x27;s Night Guard I would have had to have several of my teeth replaced by now.</li>
            <li> Junk. Only good thing about it is the plastic case, which my grandson loves to play with,. Tossed the guard the first week. I should have listened to my dentist, who advised me against it. I guess I will pony up the money for a custom-made mouth guard. Don&#x27;t bother with this thing.</li>
            <li> Works but not as good as doctor prescribed</li>
            <li> I would give this 2.5 stars if I could. What I didn&#x27;t like about this. Once you prep to have it mold to your mouth and place it into your mouth the first time. The gel is pushed out and kind of spill over to the guard. This will leave extra molding plastic on the edge. It may seem a little issue but it makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear. Wished they put less gel inside to accommodate for the expansion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is cheap and works ok for my mouth. I like that it&#x27;s not too big.</li>
            <li> This product did not keep me from snoring.  It was fairly easy to get fitted.  The Nightguard was reasonably comfortable.  As usual, Amazon shipped it quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried molding this product twice per the instructions and it would not stay in my mouth. I was afraid I&#x27;d choke on it at night so had to return it. It hardly covered my teeth. I returned it and was at least refunded.</li>
            <li> This nightguard does not bother my mouth at all. I sleep all night without taking it off and even forget that i have it in the morning. I highly recommend this it!</li>
            <li> I bought this (by recommendation of my dentist) in lieu of the $650+ mold that my dentist would have had to make to alleviate my TMJ. It is the lowest profile molded mouth guard available, and much better priced than the dentist! I tried to fit it the first time, but I shifted my teeth forward a bit while fitting it and the extra material bunched on the outside, making it fit slightly awkward. So, I sent a message via their website and a second mouthpiece arrived at my door within the week with a kindly worded letter offering any assistance (short of someone coming to my house and putting it in my mouth for me, haha) that I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re-fitted it, and it&#x27;s amazing. Fits snug, isn&#x27;t bulky. And unlike the dentist ones, it&#x27;s soft, so it isn&#x27;t an irritant, and no sharp edges!</li>
            <li> My dogs ate my $650 mouth guard from the dentist two weeks after I got it.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much again so I tried a couple of mouth guards from Amazon.  The first brand I tried was horrible, so I ordered this one.  It is amazing: fits perfectly, doesn&#x27;t fall out, and is very comfortable.  I have a very small mouth and this is the perfect fit. It did take 2 tries to get the right fit and I found that the direction to fit your front teeth as close to the end as possible did not work for me and made the guard uncomfortable and fall out at night.  When I fit it the second time I bit down normally and spent a lot of time conforming it to my teeth and the roof of my mouth.  Now it feels as good as the one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> After having a very expensive custom night guard deteriorate after a year of grinding, I was hoping to find an over-the-counter product that would work acceptably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll speak first about problems encountered with similar products. I tried several variations of night guards, and they mostly worked shoddily. Many did not have enough material on the sides and wouldn&#x27;t grip my molars to keep the guard attached to my top teeth. They also would require some trimming, which would leave rough edges on the hard material, cutting into my cheeks. Worst of all, the limited amount of hard material would usually mean they ended up mis-positioned in my mouth, leading to some tooth shifting overnight. A few of them had really hard material in the front that seemed to serve no purpose other than causing my front teeth and gums discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all that hassle, his particular AC Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard really impressed me. It has plenty of material around the sides, so when you bite in, it really forms a tight grip. It has additional hard surface material not only below the molars, but also curves up slightly into the roof of the mouth, so no more slipping after fitting. It has very little getting in the way in the front, which is more comfortable. It also has less material towards the back, so i didn&#x27;t need to make any cuts or adjustments to length. It works pretty much as well as I could expect for an inexpensive, DIY solution.</li>
            <li> I had an NTI nightguard made for me by my dentist years ago that was a little too tight to wear so I tried this product as an alternative to help prevent me from grinding my teeth at night or clenching my jaw.  Because this product is made of a softer, gel-like material it doesn&#x27;t really do much to prevent clenching and actually made my jaw pain worse.  It&#x27;s design doesn&#x27;t prevent contact between the upper and lower teeth so it really isn&#x27;t a good product for clenching or grinding.  I went to my dentist and she was able to remold my original NTI so that I could wear it again and after only two nights with my NTI- I feel loads better.  Your jaw health is worth a visit to the dentist- don&#x27;t use this product, it will more than likely make your condition worse!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me or my mother. Once fitted (instructions are easy, I&#x27;ll give it up for that) it was bulky (compared to previously used brands) and caused me to gag. The fitting was never snug and would not stay in my mouth for very long once I fell asleep before falling out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and it didn&#x27;t ship on time.</li>
            <li> After a visit to the dentist, he strongly recommended that I get a mouth guard because I was grinding my teeth at night. He suggested that it would be very harmful to my teeth over time. The dentist said he could order me one for &amp;#62;$100, and it wouldn&#x27;t be covered by my insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he laughed and suggested this product. I was skeptical that something over the counter would work, but it wasn&#x27;t go to hurt to try. I got it quickly from Amazon, took a couple of minutes to read the instructions, and got ready to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it takes a few minutes to get it right. I boiled water in my microwave, put the blank NightGuard into the hot water, waited two minutes. Then I popped it in my mouth, used my fingers to push it around the teeth. Then let it cool. And it&#x27;s a perfect, nearly professional fit. It locks into the upper teeth, so no fear of falling out, so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big point. If you don&#x27;t get it right the first or fifth time, you can start over again, no need to throw it out and buy another one. I might be a bit weird, but I had fun forming it around my teeth. It will clearly prevent you from grinding your teeth as long as you wear it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make a recommendation. You don&#x27;t want to get this thing to get gross over time, so buy some anti-bacterial denture cleaner like Efferdent. It&#x27;ll keep your mouth guard minty fresh without anything nasty growing on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after losing my expensive custom one from the dentist. I followed the directions and fit it, not burning myself, and it was a perfect fit. The problem was, I could barely get my mouth closed around it. I&#x27;d either be unable to fall asleep because it was irritating, I&#x27;d spit it out while I slept, or I&#x27;d wake up with very attractive giant puddles of drool on my pillow. This just isn&#x27;t comfortable enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best night guard that you can purchase for yourself; without the hassle of scheduling a dental appointment to make a mold of your teeth, paying $100&#x27;s (even with dental insurance), and then having to wait an &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; number of days to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grinding your teeth...clenching...jaw popping out and snapping back in....I have experienced it all.  I have been told that sounds similar to a child violently striking a bow against a violin string come from my direction at night and I have also waken up with a severe headache and achy, sensitive teeth as a result of clenching my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard is NOT bulky and honestly, you can mold it to fit either the top OR bottom of your teeth; whichever is more comfortable for you.  For me, I was less likely to pull the night guard out while sleeping when I used it for the top teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as though you have a slab of concrete in your mouth; you can sleep with your mouth closed easily &amp; comfortably.  If the mold is too large for your mouth, snip off the ends with a pair of scissors and dip it in hot water to soften the edges.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve purchased four of five of these and I think they&#x27;re great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself am clincher. I woke up a few mornings with tight jaws and minor headaches and discovered I&#x27;ve been clenching my teeth during my sleep. I went to the dentist who said they could make a mold for me to chomp on while I sleep but it would cost me about $200+ since insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it. So I ordered this thing and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mold and each one has lasted me 6 months to a year, depending on stress level and midnight chompingness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other things is the Doctor&#x27;s satisfaction guarantee. I had bought a Large size guard my first time around and after a few nights found it uncomfortable. The satisfaction guarantee allows you to mail them your used guard and they send you back a new one in the correct size for you to remold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you suppose the dentists&#x27; provided me one for $100 and it lasted until now -which it wouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve already saved so much money (not to mention my teeth) over the past few years.</li>
            <li> This product was shown when you get on Amazon aan ask for snoring. It wasnt.We feel  like thay shouldnt put on that page.</li>
            <li> My husband grinds his teeth and has worn these night guards for many years now.  They fit nicely and seem to last a long time unlike other guards he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> This is too big for my mouth. I wore for a week and my mouth hurt worse than if I was grinding my teeth. When I &amp;#34;constructed&amp;#34; it, it kept jetting out where my wisdom teeth were, and caused pain in the back. I redid it a few times, but never got a comfortable result.</li>
            <li> Hard to stay asleep with this.  While I don&#x27;t have a problem with it slipping out of my mouth, I constantly wake up during the night because of the awkwardness of it being too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consulted a representative via telephone who said to try it two more times in boiled water to see if the fit would improve.  It has only helped very little.  They offer a money back guarantee so I will try to pursue that.  I think part of the issue is they no longer have sizes, just one-size-fits-all.  I think I will try to have a professional one made and bite the bullet on costs to have a more restful sleep.</li>
            <li> Followed directions but it still ended up bulky and hanging over teeth / gums. Also I have TMJ and just read it is not good for folks who suffer from TMJ, would have been great if that was spelled out clearly.</li>
            <li> This was too bulky for my mouth, which is an average size, I think? I have really bad Bruxism, so the material was great because it took a while to wear down (like two weeks), but I would spit it out in my sleep since it was so bulky.</li>
            <li> If you take a little time to learn the process and learn what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish, before you start boiling the water and melting the bite mold, this is a great product.  Having used one made by a dentist, and &amp;#34;paid for it&amp;#34;  about $500, very nice, but very expensive when this does the same thing for grinders.  Maybe it takes more than one try to &amp;#34;get it right&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s still much less expensive than the hundreds it costs to have a similar product nicely delivered to you by a professional.  If you have no experience in the process, it&#x27;s still possible to get a good result ... Follow the instructions, period.  Follow them closely and precisely.  I&#x27;ve had a high success rate and using it nightly, lasted about 3 months before feeling the need to replace it.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> This was awful. Bulky &amp; hard to sleep with.&lt;br /&gt;I found one that I like a lot it&#x27;s called&lt;br /&gt;DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit.</li>
            <li> I sleep with a night guard every night!  I go through them regularly. This one so far is lasting much longer than any other brand I have tried!</li>
            <li> The night guard worth great</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to that at pharmacy. However, it&#x27;s quite chunky. You might feel it&#x27;s difficult to wear it all night at the beginning if your are sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you grind your teeth and your dentist recommended a nightguard, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> Better than spending $300 at the dentist.  office. It&#x27;s soft, and I can sleep better using it than a one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Not bad, It does a an extra hard plate under the soft mold-able part.&lt;br /&gt;I got a few months out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to do some extra molding to the guard&#x27;s hard surface due to it irritating my front lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in All this guard provided more support and protection than the other (over the counter) ones I have tried</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth and even have woken to the sides of my tongue being sore and damaged from the grinding I do in my sleep. This mouth guard works perfect no grinding no sore tongue or grinding into the sides of my tongue. The price is amazing and works with my CPAP mask.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son.  It goes into his mouth but it is just too bulky for him.  He doesn&#x27;t  wear it so it is a waste</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t bit down too much when forming.  You don&#x27;t need to bottom out.  If you do, it will be touching you gums----you don&#x27;t want that.</li>
            <li> One major problem here. If you still have your wisdom teeth, and I do-This product will not cover those last teeth in the back. The problem? All the teeth covered by the night guard will slowly sink into the gums and after awhile (2 years), only your back teeth will touch. I wondered why my teeth were starting to grind when I ate so I went to a dentist. Doctor said all my teeth had shifted and that the only touching teeth were my wisdom teeth. Now I am looking a very expensive set of braces at almost 50 years old with no dental insurance. On a plus side-it did stop the grinding. Was it worth the trade off? $5000.00 says it was not. I really don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to pay for it.</li>
            <li> I have to trim the back of my mouth guards because of a sensitive crown.  So the last one I bought was thinner but I chewed through it...not entirely sure I didn&#x27;t ingest some plastic.  This one is tougher which is great, but I look a little like a football player at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard works very well. Once you fit it to your mouth it comfortable. Snoring runs in my family an my husband says this helps me a lot. We are both getting more sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Too large for my small mouth. After trying several retail brands, I think I need a guard custom made. Otherwise, it looked strong and very suitable for the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently noticed grinding my teeth, so I am trying a cheaper option than a real dental guard. This night guard works well enough as far as I know. It didn&#x27;t quite reach my last two teeth, but I guess it&#x27;s better too short than too long. You do have to boil it a little bit longer than the instructions say, but once you get it warm enough it creates a great fit. I would certainly recommend buying this as a cheaper option!</li>
            <li> I have been using this night guard for about a week - my dentist told me I needed to have one due to the wear patterns on my teeth but the cost would be around $300.  I don&#x27;t grind my teeth at night, I clench them while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited several months after my visit to buy this - by that time I had a little more stress in my life and I was waking up with headaches and pain in my jaw.  I knew I had to try something!  I decided to try a cheaper night guard to see if it even worked before spending so much money at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little large on the sides for my mouth but it fits.  You do have to do a lot of pressing on the guard while molding it to make sure you end up with a secure fit around your back teeth and the roof of your mouth.  I saw a lot of reviews about people losing this guard in the night and even waking up choking on it so I was hesitant the first night I used it.  Fortunately, I did a good job molding it because I woke up without any problems - it stays securely attached even if you open your mouth if you follow the molding procedures correctly.  Do not expect this to \\&quot;mold\\&quot; on its own if you just bite down on it - you have to do a lot of work with your hands to get a proper fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my headaches have not gone away completely but they are fading.  I&#x27;m glad I tried this, it&#x27;s made sleeping much more bearable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and bulky in my mouth.  I was hoping for a thinner product that would offer more comfort.  I found myself waking up throughout the night with discomfort in my jaw.</li>
            <li> fits good and easy to sleep with. my only complaint is the fact that I followed the directions to the T and got an amazing fit. but when I went to actually wear it later that night it had obviously changed shape a little. maybe it was the setting process, who knows.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but the product itself isn&#x27;t very good. It was easy enough to mold it using the hot water, but it really wasn&#x27;t very effective. It didn&#x27;t really stay in place. It would take some getting use to if it did work. It wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This stupid product has the plastic bottom, why do you need that? My old one, lost recently, was the cheaper Rite Aid Nite protector which only had the soft part and worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> These are hard to maneuver and hard to shape.  There seems to be too much material to work it correctly, and to make it stay in your mouth.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> The device is difficult to get it to fit securely and comfortably. The guard felt too big in my mouth. DenTek is much better.</li>
            <li> I got this night guard to replace a professionally-made one that no longer fit. I found it easy to make, following the directions, though it did take three times until I got it just right. Initially, I had shaped it too tightly to my teeth and found the suction/pressure uncomfortable. It worked great at night, no trouble breathing or closing my mouth (make sure you press front into front teeth slightly when forming it).</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money and was unable to wear it as it is very uncomfortable.  I have bought a different mouth guard ears ago and had no problems</li>
            <li> thats where it went! Unable to mold to my teeth. I understand now why it was so cheap,I do not reccommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable</li>
            <li> Well worth the price (and better than the $500 quoted from the dentist).  Works great.  Does discolor over time which the dentist says is normal.  Holds up to wear and tear.</li>
            <li> My dentist made me a night guard about a year ago for bruxism. I hated wearing it because my teeth would adjust over the night and in the morning, my front teeth would touch together but my back teeth wouldn&#x27;t! I don&#x27;t know if this was just one old dentist or if that&#x27;s normal, but I found it intolerable that I couldn&#x27;t chew my breakfast. After many adjustments, it finally got to the point where I could wear it regularly, and shortly after that, it broke one night in my mouth and I woke up with a terrible headache from grinding on it while it was broken all night. My family is full of dentists, but I live too far away for any of them to make me a night guard and get it adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard. I was skeptical, but this thing has worked like a dream for the last five months. My teeth feel fine in the morning (does that mean I&#x27;m better at doing this than the actual dentist?!) and I really miss it if I don&#x27;t wear it. It fits well, although it&#x27;s not long enough for the hard plastic part to cover my farthest back teeth (and I don&#x27;t have any wisdom teeth either). The softer plastic that you can mold does cover them, though I don&#x27;t think it will last as long this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About four months in, however, I started finding little bits of plastic in my mouth in the morning. The thing needs to be replaced. It makes me worry about BPAs and whatever the heck is in this plastic (I don&#x27;t know!) and whether or not it&#x27;s safe to chew on soft plastic every night for years on end. I guess it&#x27;s better than grinding my teeth down to nothing or finding another dentist who can make me one that would also be of questionable plastic and may or may not fit right and may or may not be covered by my insurance. At this price, I don&#x27;t mind replacing the DIY version every few months for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Though the instructions say that this is for your top teeth only, I made a bottom night guard. My dentist relatives suggest that these tend to be easier to get right, because if a top night guard doesn&#x27;t fit right, it starts moving around the bones in your head and has more potential to cause jaw problems and headaches. It works just fine on my bottom teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that it&#x27;s a little short for my mouth and that I&#x27;m suspicious of the health effects of the soft rubber layer. I&#x27;m not sure yet if I&#x27;ll replace my current one with the same one or if I&#x27;ll try the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version which appears to be all hard plastic, or if I&#x27;ll try another brand.right, because if a top night guard doesn&#x27;t fit right, it starts moving around the bones in your head and has more potential to cause jaw problems and headaches. It works just fine on my bottom teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that it&#x27;s a little short for my mouth and that I&#x27;m suspicious of the health effects of the soft rubber layer. I&#x27;m not sure yet if I&#x27;ll replace my current one with the same one or if I&#x27;ll try the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version which appears to be all hard plastic, or if I&#x27;ll try another brand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one along with Grind Guard because I was skeptical how they work. First night I tried the Grind Guard and could not close my mouth well. I have small mouth so I have to cut each end off before shaping them. The second night I tried this one. It&#x27;s much more comfortable than the first because the guard doesn&#x27;t go up that high. I could close my mouth as normal. Once I got it shape correctly, it fits really firm and I don&#x27;t taste anything like the GG. The con is this one is more expensive. I got it for $16 while GG costs $11.xx for pair.</li>
            <li> After spending over $200 in the past on nightguards from my dentist, I would buy this in a heartbeat.  Just as effective and you can replace them every 6 months which seems so much more sanitary</li>
            <li> almost lost a gold crown using this. if it had been ceramic, it would have needed to be replaced. I will not be using anymore</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter and it fits my mouth perfectly.  My dentist said it would be better to have one custom made so I had her make one and I actually prefer the Nightguard one.  So wasted almost $300 on a custom made one.  I wear the Nightguard not the one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the best night guard I have ever used. This is the only night guard I will ever buy. It doesn&#x27;t have material that goes over your front teeth so it is much less bulky than any other night guard I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very comfortable. It didn&#x27;t take me a long time to get used to wearing it and I&#x27;ve been using this brand for over 5 years now. You will eventually get used to it and now I don&#x27;t even like to sleep without it. I noticed a serious difference after I started using this night guard. Since it&#x27;s comfortable, I was likely to wear it more often in the beginning and I was able to get used to it much quicker. My jaw doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore at all.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time getting used to sleeping with this thing but it was fairly easy to mold and align well for a perfect tight fit. For best results use fingers to push molding for best shaping.</li>
            <li> I folllowed the instructions as closely as possible, here is what happened;  I boiled the water for over a minute(rolling boil), when I put the guard in, channel side down, it floated!  When I took it out with a fork and put it on a plate that was waiting for it, I noticed that one side of the guard had yellowed, weird.  Since my stove is not in my bathroom the 20 second count before I bit down on it was approximate.  I closed my mouth, bit down and sucked on it(what the sucking is supposed to do is beyond me), counted to thirty like the directions say, and then molded it with my fingers as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be sleeping with this piece of garbage in my mouth, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll wake up choking on it when it falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to your dentist and get a properly made mouth guard. I made an appointment right after trying this. If you are clenching and/or grinding your teeth you should get checked for whatever damage you&#x27;ve done so far anyway.  I&#x27;ve ground the point off an incisor (eye tooth), and I wonder what an x-ray will reveal because I&#x27;ve been clenching more than grinding.  Save your $20 to put towards the appointment, going to the dentist may be unpleasant but will be better in the long run, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 3 years and it works well. Easy to mold and get a good fit . Comfortable when sleeping</li>
            <li> I followed the fitting instructions precisely, but to no avail.  The fit was terrible and extremely uncomfortable.  A 2nd molding was not possible, despite what the manufacturer claims.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Still getting use to sleeping with it in but it has been a great help with grinding thus far</li>
            <li> I needed this because when I&#x27;m stressed I grind my teeth. It&#x27;s easy to use(the instructions are easy to read for how you mold it), and the case for it it great.</li>
            <li> The hard bottom of this guard makes it impossible for me to chomp through in my sleep. I tried several other brands only to wake up with the guard in pieces in my mouth. (Yes, I realize this isn&#x27;t normal. But I&#x27;m glad this mouthguard at least helps me!) I&#x27;d recommend spending the extra money on this one - It&#x27;ll last!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  I tried twice to mold it and it wouldn&#x27;t stay at the top of my mouth.  I am going to try to return it and get my money back.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to spring for the $500 for a custom-another case of getting what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fitting was easy and well documented. It does feel a little large in large in my mouth but it&#x27;s not really a bother most of the time.</li>
            <li> this NightGuard is too bulky for me.  Felt like a huge wad of gum in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I can never get this mouth guard to fit right. It does not form to my teeth very well. I think it&#x27;s because the plastic is just to shallow and without fail I always wake up with it on the bed somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I found a different mouth guard at Walmart that comes with a blue case that works much better.&lt;br /&gt;Not to say that this mouth guard won&#x27;t work for other people, it just does not for me.</li>
            <li> I have bruxism and my dentist told me I needed a night guard and then offered to make me one for upwards of $300. They said cheaper kinds wouldn&#x27;t be as comfortable. Well, this is really all the comfort I need. I probably have a smaller mouth and this fits comfortably. I might have done a better job during the molding process but really, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable, it stays in place all night, and I&#x27;m not worried about chewing through my teeth...literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to clean, I just brush it with my toothbrush/paste. I read a reco from a dentist to do that and mine has stayed in good shape after about a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one gets old, I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I bought the wrong product or the product changed.  I wanted something to stop snoring.  not for teeth guarding.&lt;br /&gt;the first time i got the right prodcut, the second I did not.</li>
            <li> I have used these bite guards for several years now. It&#x27;s easy to mold to my teeth by following the detailed directions included. This is the only guard I&#x27;ve used that stays in place perfectly all night. I found the others were difficult to fit. I like that I can trim the section that would be past by molars. Happy with this purchase. No problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through (chewed through) 3 mouth guards so far - including a sports guard (1 week) a dentist guard (about 2 months) which cost me $70, and a night guard I bought at Target (~$15 - bulky, but held up - hated it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This one fits my teeth well (a little bulkier than the dentist ones though) and sticks to my to teeth all night.&lt;br /&gt;-I love that I can close my mouth over it, which I could not do with the target one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for just over 3 months now and I have barely even scratched the under-surface with my lower teeth. I usually grind all night. I&#x27;ve had no jaw pain since using this. I&#x27;ll update if I ever end up chewing through it, but so far well well worth it and my wife agrees.</li>
            <li> I had to boil this several times before I was able to get a fit that worked. I almost gave up, but 4th time&#x27;s the charm! It now fits and seems effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using a night guard for a few years now and it was time to replace mine so I bought this product because the price was right. I cannot believe how bulky it is! I followed the directions exactly and considering that it wasn&#x27;t my first time molding a night guard, I didn&#x27;t expect to have any problems. When I was molding it I realized how bulky it was in my mouth. I tried to sleep with it in last night and it was very uncomfortable because I was not used to it. I went back on line today and paid the extra money for a Den Tec night guard which is more streamlined and lightweight. I am going to try and remold my Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard instead of throwing it out but I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  I followed the instructions exactly.  But it would not stay in place in my mouth.  I tried refitting according to the instructions and had the same results.</li>
            <li> I hurt my jaw really bad one night, and sleeping made it worse.  I bought this night guard and set it all up, followed the instructions which were very easy, and slept with it.  It was weird but I didn&#x27;t hurt my jaw and after a few days it healed up nicely.  I bought some efferdent tablets to clean it, and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The first three times I tried to fit it - it didn&#x27;t feel right. The third time, it fit like a charm. I have an overbite and clinch really hard which I sleep so this is adding some protection until I get some professional work done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others, it really is a much more affordable option than a dental guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Advice: Read the instructions carefully before you start the molding process, especially if this is the first time you&#x27;re doing it. I&#x27;d never used a dental guard before. I was skeptical about the process, but succeeded in molding it on the first try--the softening and molding process took less than three minutes total after the water reached the boiling point. The problem I had during the process was getting the dental protector to stay underwater during the boiling process. It wants to float. After molding it fits perfectly. It is comfortable, and did not slip out or move at all while I slept. I&#x27;m thinking seriously of buying a second to have as a back up because it fits so well and didn&#x27;t bother me while I slept. I was surprised to find how many of my co-workers use dental protectors. And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company. I&#x27;m just too cheap with my time and money to get one from my dentist. (My insurance does not cover dental protectors.)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat it for under $20!  I am pleasantly surprised that this mouth guard works!  It took several fittings and i had to re-heat it a few times but with a little effort it fits great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to wear one before but recently developed TMJ after a car accident. This seems to be helping. Easy to follow instructions.  I did have to trim it otherwise it was too big and extended passed my back molars.</li>
            <li> This really shouldn&#x27;t be considered an anti-snoring device AT ALL. I bought but didn&#x27;t actually try it because you can&#x27;t mold it to your bottom jaw so I couldn&#x27;t see how it could possibly be used as an anti-snoring mouthpiece.&lt;br /&gt;The way I understand it, an anti-snoring mouthpiece is something that is molded to your lower (and upper) jaw to bring it foreward a little bit and keep it there. On this piece, it only molds to the upper jaw. The bottom of the piece is hard plastic that cannot be molded. This probably works great for people that grind their teeth but I can&#x27;t see how it possibly helps you stop snoring when it does nothing to your bottom jaw.&lt;br /&gt;I blame myself for wasting my money on this, I somehow got the impression that it was an anti-snoring mouthpiece. Probably because it came up in a search for Anti-Snoring Mouthpiece!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it probably works great for stopping grinding teeth. But it is a waste of money if you are buying it to stop snoring</li>
            <li> I recently received this to help me out with grinding my teeth at night...It was just uncomfortable..and I know that it&#x27;s supposed to be like that but I just didn&#x27;t like it.. so in all honesty it&#x27;s just sitting in my room...the teeth grinding has subsided anyway, I was put on meds in which one of the side effects was that...doing better now though.</li>
            <li> Do not by this product! Followed the instructions 5x and finally gave up. You&#x27;re better off going to the dentist and have a mouth piece fitted to your mouth!</li>
            <li> I would not by this product again because it was almost impossible to get it fitted in any way I could tolerate for night wear.</li>
            <li> This product relies on a gel that molds to your mouth inside of a stiff rubber form. You heat the product and then place it in your mouth to mold it. The gel oozes out in all of the wrong places and sets in awkward or uncomfortable positions and doesn&#x27;t create a good fit. I watched a bunch of youtube tutorials and tried several times to get this thing to work, but it just didn&#x27;t fit my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to help with my teeth grinding and was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth all the time; and it&#x27;s becoming a serious problem for me. I was hoping to use this product at home to deter me from clenching and grinding my teeth. But the night guard is so uncomfortable, I can&#x27;t stand to use it. And I&#x27;ve molded it to my teeth so I can&#x27;t return it. It rubs and pinches the inside of my cheeks and creates a lot of pressure on my maxilla and causes an almost instant headache. Oh, and I start to drool profusely. I wish I could use it. It might be a personal problem but still wanted to give fair warning.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mold just follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Was worried it would fall out in the middle of the night but stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;Was waking up with a sore jaw everymorning prior to using Doctors night Guard. Now I hate the nights if fall asleep with out it. Great fit, no discomfort at first i kept messing with it but its more mentaly knowing i had it on but you get used to it and wont want to fall asleep with out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. The guard was big and clumsy. It didn&#x27;t fit my mouth even after trimming it down. It also won&#x27;t stay in unless your constantly biting it.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me even after having a replacement night guard was issued and also after six attempts to custom fit it. It was large even after trimming it and it certainly did not fit snug enough to stay in my mouth. I returned this item to Amazon and I still have not received a refund. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I followed the instruction exactly as they were stated in booklet and the mouthguard failed to stay in place. It was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product in my opinion.  I had a completely different one from another brand (Dentek) in the past and it was actually comfortable enough to sleep in.  I thought I was ordering that one but wound up wasting my money on this and got so frustrated I just dumped it in the trash after trying to wear it.  It is supposedly &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; but who has time to mail a piece of rubber all around?  I don&#x27;t.  Anyway, it&#x27;s too hard and too thick and even with a large mouth and big straight teeth I felt this was awkward and terrible.  Ugh!!  One of the absolute worst products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have fitted Night Guards before, but not this brand. I could not get this one to fit and hold on to my teeth. It was so bad that I did not even return it for a replacement . . . I threw it away,</li>
            <li> Very easy to mold (takes just a few moments) and seems to last about 1.5-2 months. I wouldn&#x27;t use it much more than that unless your grinding is quite modest. One big selling point is that they will send you a replacement if you can&#x27;t get it formed right (or screw up the process).</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very comfortable. I had a better mouth guard years ago, but it is no longer sold. This one was way too firm, and the method to &amp;#34;custom fit&amp;#34; it is a potential for going wrong. The chance of it melting the first or second time you try to custom fit it, is not worth the price, to me.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this first in 2011.  Although it was bulky for my small mouth, it served its purpose and lasted for a couple of years.  When the first one fell apart, I purchased another one to replace it.  Much to my disappointment, the second one started to fall apart several months later.  I noticed it breaking into small pieces and finally splitting at the seam on one side.</li>
            <li> I tried three times to get the guard to stay in place when my mouth was open as the instructions state indicates a proper fit.  Failed, failed, failed.  Maybe my teeth are too large for this seemingly small guard.  I feel I just wasted my money and hope to prevent other people from doing so.</li>
            <li> Slightly bulky doesn&#x27;t always stay in my mouth. Does the job for the price. Not ready for $500+ custom made one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> After reading just about every review, I went out to the drugstore and purchased this brand. Mainly because it was on sale and the same price as online without the wait. I have never worn a night guard before. I have always had a teeth grinding problem at night and recently it because severe to the point where my some of my teeth were chipping &#x3D;[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The molding of the product was super easy. Awkward at first, but easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after NIGHT ONE: My mouth feels a bit different, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a positive or negative thing yet. But I slept fine through the night. I&#x27;m super petite and was worried that the night guard would be too big, but it fit perfectly with little adjustments. I will come back to let all you consumers know what&#x27;s the deal with this product!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend, this says do not use for TMJ or for more than 3 months? Wish I had known this before I ordered. Decided to give it a try anyway, and caused way more jaw pain than I had without it.</li>
            <li> This mouse gard works great now my teeth are protected at night,no need for those high pricy one.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Ana V.</li>
            <li> the only thing positive I can say is that it came in on time. I did exactly as the instructions said &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t mold. So I boiled at pot of water and tried again...still nothing. Luckily I purchased 2 different brands and had no problem with the other brand. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
            <li> I started using these because my dentist said I was showing signs of grinding my teeth.  As he put it, I had the option of wearing down my teeth or getting a bite guard to absorb the damage.  Figuring plastic was easier to replace than enamel, I chose to get a bite guard.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years, if you fit it right, there aren&#x27;t any problems with it staying in place all night.  And, if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, you can heat it up and try again.</li>
            <li> The trick is to bite down a little but suck in and use your tongue to spread the plastic on your roof of your mouth. This will provide the best fitting mold.  After doing this my mold almost feels like it locks in. I have slept with it for over a month now and I have no issues with it moving or falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Bought Jan 31, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give my update after using this for a couple of months now.  The mold still holds well.  I rinse the guard every morning when I wake up with some hot water and put it in its case. By the way, the case it comes with is nice and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was grinding my teeth and my teeth were becoming sensitive.  I can&#x27;t say for 100% sure but it has subsided since I started using the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think people giving this a poor review do not mold it properly.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of night guard (boil) before and it worked great. I needed a replacement so I ordered this one. It does not get soft enough to push the thick sides up against your gumline for a tight fit. I tried a few times (boiling again) and couldn&#x27;t get a tight fit, so it&#x27;s useless. And it kept making me gag even after I trimmed off the excess.</li>
            <li> This nightguard is awesome it stays in place and is much cheaper than what I was going to pay at my dentists office.  I will definitely purchase another if need be.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get the fit right and get it to stay in my mouth. Might be user error, but it was a complete waste for me.</li>
            <li> I molded the guard according to the directions.  I am not sure it came out right.  I tried to use it.  I had it in my mouth for half and hour.  I couldn&#x27;t sleep with it in my mouth.  I kept drooling.  It was awful.  I don&#x27;t know how kids do it when they have braces, etc.  I never did so this was new to me.  I couldn&#x27;t sleep and I had to go work the next day, so I took it out of my mouth and haven&#x27;t tried it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago, and I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have remolded it about four times, and I just can&#x27;t get it right. The thing is small to begin with, (Like, it looks like it was made for a kid to use.) and it SHRINKS after it cools down. I mold it to fit, and have even tried to alter it to be bigger, but nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add some perspective, I am a smallish 20 year old woman, and I consider my mouth to be smallish as well. I really think that it would be perfect if they made a LARGER size.</li>
            <li> It works but didn&#x27;t mold quite right and falls out of my mouth while sleeping.  Tried to reheat but still doesn&#x27;t fit right.&lt;br /&gt;May have to try another brand and try again.</li>
            <li> I imagine all night guards are awkward, and from what I have been told by others, this is much less so then others. It is however super functional, easy to mold and really does help.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: 7/17/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** While ordering a new Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard, I noticed the product has received some bad reviews. I would just say, I have been using this mouthguard for over 5 years with multiple new purchases of this brand and have never had any problems. If you form the mouthguard properly to your teeth, it should suction into your mouth and fit snugly while sleeping. Every morning, this mouthguard is still in the same place and never comes loose. When I don&#x27;t wear this product, I wake up and feel I have been grinding my teeth. With this product, the problem gets solved. I recommend this product to anyone who grinds their teeth at night. Just make sure to following the direction properly while forming the mouthguard to your teeth, which isn&#x27;t too difficult but takes a quick read through of the instructions. Also, the mouthguard comes with a durable plastic case. Because this product has worked so well for me, I will keep a 5-star rating.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a great product. I&#x27;ve used this product for over three years, and I&#x27;ve never had any complaints. The molding process takes about 30 minutes, and then it gels comfortably and tight to your teeth. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive mouth guard that prevents grinding of the teeth at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this night guard because I have been having some very bad pain in my jaw area. I have severe TMJ, and recently it has escalated into inflamation in my joints. The dentist was going to make me a night guard for $300 but said that a store bought one would do just as well until I can save the money to get surgery (since lovely insurance doesnt cover hardly any of it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were pretty clear, although I didnt get a good tight fit the first time so I had to dunk it again in the hot water and start over. Once I got a good tight fit I started wearing it right away. Its of course not the most comfortable thing in the world but its not terrible. When I have it in, I tend to salivate more though and sometimes it feels like I am drowning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice my jaw getting better when I used it, but the stupid thing fell out (or I yanked it out in the middle of the night)every night. I would go to sleep with it in, and when I woke up it was gone. So I stopped using it, after about a month and a half. My jaw has started to get worse so I may try and use it again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked the product, and what it did for my jaw but the inconvenience of the way it felt and it coming out every night was too much for me. I will keep it so that when my jaw flare&#x27;s again I can try it out for a little bit, but it wont be something I use all the time.</li>
            <li> I suffered from morning headaches for years and never even knew that I was grinding and clenching my teeth until a dentist told me about it recently. He recommended a $300 nightguard which I wanted to avoid paying if possible so I thought I&#x27;d tried this nightguard first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The molding process went ok. Be sure to read the instructions and do as others here have suggested by constantly sucking in air after biting down and using your fingers to mold the nightguard all around your teeth. The nice thing is if you mess up the molding process beyond repair there&#x27;s a number you can call on the instruction booklet and they will send you a FREE replacement nightguard and also offer help on molding it if you require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get it molded perfectly the first time so I had to dunk it back in the pot of water for 20-30 sec. After that I immediately inserted it back in my mouth, bit down hard, did lots of sucking and molding, and it stayed secure on my teeth. It doesn&#x27;t slip off and is not tight at all. However, the nightguard is slightly too small. It only covers about half of my back molars. It still prevents the teeth from grinding so that&#x27;s not an issue, but it would be nice if it fully covered the molars so it feels complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never worn a guard before so it took me a couple nights to get used to it. The first night was kind of rough. I only got about 4-5 hours of sleep. Second night went better. After that it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the best part: headaches are pretty much gone. Before wearing a nightguard I&#x27;d be lucky going 2 nights in a row without waking up with a headache. Now I&#x27;ve been almost headache-free for weeks. It really does work. Although you might get some minor stiffness in your jaw or tiny bit of teeth soreness from biting on the guard after you wake up, it&#x27;s nowhere near horrible like it was before. You know, like when you open your eyes in the morning and the very first thing you do is groan from the head pain. That&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m worried about is if constantly wearing a nightguard will shift my teeth and make them crooked like some others here have said. I&#x27;ll have to ask my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re a grinder/clencher and plagued by morning headaches or jaw pain I wholeheartedly recommend giving this a try. The price is fairly cheap for the potential amount of relief it could bring!e head pain.

            <li> The night guard is very hard to get a good fit.  Needs to have small, medium large sizes for different size mouths.&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to cut</li>
            <li> My mom was on the market to purchase a night-guard for a few months but she did not know which one to purchase, so I came on amazon to make my final decision! Unlike other night-guards this one does not slip out of your teeth when you are asleep. It fits firmly on your teeth and is comparable to a custom night-guard you might spend extra $$$ for at your dentist. I recommend purchasing this on amazon which I found to have the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product feels huge in my mouth, even after carefully following instructions. Might fit people with larger choppers.</li>
            <li> I bought this once, and won&#x27;t buy it again. If you have a small mouth, go get the Walgreen&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> Ok product but not worth the money they are selling it for. After owning the product I would have paid no more than $5for this product</li>
            <li> Good product and works b</li>
            <li> I bought this night guard months ago. I&#x27;ve moved it around between the spice shelf, the counter, and the top of the microwave. I really think it worked best when I left it in the latter location.</li>
            <li> It works well as it stopped my gf from grinding her teeth. However, it is a big large and there is a gap. She complains to me that her mouth is open at night and her lips are dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love these! By far the best guards I&#x27;ve ever used. I have to boil them multiple times to get them to fit, but it does eventually fit. I highly recommend these. Also, one of my front teeth is a porcelain cap and it&#x27;s not affected at all by the mouth piece. I just have to cut it so that it doesn&#x27;t put pressure on it. I also have a tiny mouth.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this night guard, but I had a few problems:&lt;br /&gt;- It was difficult to imprint.&lt;br /&gt;- I never got it totally \\&quot;reformed\\&quot; when I tried to re-do my teeth imprint.&lt;br /&gt;- When I tried to sleep with it, I gagged and had to take it out after 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recycled it along with the box. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Good value and easy to use and fit to your moutn.  Helped with teeth grinding and I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; on snoring.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been recommending a custom night guard for 10 years, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay $375.  My grinding problem is not severe, so I tried a cheepie ($8)night guard which is really an athletic mouth guard, but it was too bulky.  This one is much thinner and stays locked in place like the professionally made ones. The one my dentist showed me was thinner yet, but this one is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a good fit the first try, but I can understand that many people would need two tries. Bottom line is that this is an affordable solution for people without serious grinding problems or really crooked teeth.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions pretty close but it still doesn&#x27;t fit that great. It stays in place for a second then falls off.</li>
            <li> hard for me to make a good mold</li>
            <li> Cheap but serves the purpose.  My wife grinds her teeth in her sleep.  This seems to work but she has woken up twice with it in the bed instead of in her mouth.  I don&#x27;t think that is a product problem, it is a big mouthed wife problem.  I am sure that their are slimmer and more comfortable one out there but she wanted to see if it was something she would be able to use.  I would go with a more slimline one if you know you can wear it and sleep.  We didn&#x27;t want to spend too much to find out she would not be able to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted to charge me $500 for a mouth piece to keep me from grinding my teeth at night.  This cost $17 and is probably more comfortable than the rigid plexiglass piece he makes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the instructions were not included in the package somehow. Was easy enough to find them online. The test will be to see how long the guard will last.</li>
            <li> It is easy to mold. I have been using it and it works fine. I wish that I molded it a little better because it hurts my mouth but I think that is my fault.</li>
            <li> Worked great. I used the boil method. Follow directions closely! Did re-heat on one side to get a better fit and it did fine.</li>
            <li> This works better and causes less jaw pain than my $800.00 dentist made device. I highly recommend this, but follow the directions for fitting it very carefully.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Just don&#x27;t bite down too hard while you are fitting it or you can damage it a bit by putting bit marks in the hard plastic even.  It&#x27;s much cheaper than the one my dentist sells, is more comfortable, and lasts about as long</li>
            <li> The inexpensive answer to the prayers of teeth-grinders everywhere. You may need to buy 2-3 per year, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than getting one fit by a money-hungry dentist.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable in my small mouth</li>
            <li> I picked this up after starting to have tooth sensitivity from grinding at night, per Dentist recommendation.  It molds easily, however I found that if you have a &amp;#34;larger head&amp;#34; than the average person, it will form to your teeth, but will not adjust to your mouth width without warping/twisting.  The resulting molded guard was too narrow and put pressure on my other teeth, which caused additional discomfort.  I switched to a different brand, which molded wider and resolved the issue.  A few months later I tried this product again (since it was the only one they sell at my local grocery store) and the same result occurred - too narrow.  This may be a great product for average size humans, but if you have an ogre head like I do, it may be too small/narrow.  One size does not always fit all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bulky and once it is fitted correctly it feels good in the mouth and protects my teeth from my clenching. But it was difficult to fit it the first time. Took several tries.</li>
            <li> It took me several years and several costly dental procedures to figure that out teeth grinding in my sleep was causing problems.  I&#x27;ve used several different night guards and The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard provides the best fit and is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve used.  I also had to call the Manufacturer direct once when I had a problem with the fitting, and they were very helpful, resolving the problem quickly.  And reasonable pricing on top of that.  Most of these mouth guards sell for a lot more at retail pharmacies.  And I still can not figure out why anyone would pay the exorbitant prices to have a custom fitted guard at the dentist&#x27;s office when this product works every bit as good!!!</li>
            <li> This was easy to use, I was nervous about the fit but it has worked well. I did have to trim it down to be a little less bulky, but way more comfortable than my last nightguard. Will definitely buy again, once I chew through this one. :/</li>
            <li> The night guard was actually recommended by my dental hygienist, so I was hoping it would work well to help relieve some pain I was having from clenching my teeth at night. It was easy to mold and fit nicely, however I have a very small mouth and the actual width of the tray could not be made narrower with molding. The night guard stopped the clenching pain completely but caused the roof of mouth pain, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard Advanced Comfort. I had forgotten my custom night gaurd at home and need something fast. Well it did not fit my mouth correctly and i keep haveing pieces of plastic in my mouth. would not reccommend.</li>
            <li> Not to say any are very comfortable, but this one is the most acceptable I&#x27;ve used. Easy enough to mold.</li>
            <li> I have one that was made by orthodontist and it was damage. I needed to find a new one very fast and I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is suuuper cheap, but I would love it better if it was longer. The one of the orthodontist it goes back to maybe second/third molar, this comes only until premolar.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!&lt;br /&gt;Bulky &amp; hard to mold in teeth! Look somewhere else like a professional dentist.... it&#x27;s a night guard for people that don&#x27;t need it every night.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been recommending a guard for my teeth for some time and one day I woke up and discovered one of my front teeth was chipped. For $150 he repaired it and told me it happened because of my grinding. I have sleep apnea and was really apprehensive about using one of these but it has worked just fine from the very first night and now I would be uncomfortable not using one!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;After I read the instructions I took my time molding it to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;In fact I re-heated it 3 times to get the perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;I even wear it arround the house so I notice when I am clenching my jaw.</li>
            <li> It was the product I needed.  The one I had was older and could not longer be used.  Arrived very quickly and am using it.  For the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, this new \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; design does not do as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have previously used the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; Large, this newly redesigned product will not work for you.  The new design is roughly half that of the classic large and it uses a fraction of the material of the classic large (which would cause the user to chew through the new design much faster)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the older \\&quot;classic\\&quot; large has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> For years, my dentist has been telling me I needed a bite guard and I kept putting it off, ignoring the pain in my molars each morning. When I heard about the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard and saw how reasonably priced it was, I decided to give it a shot.  I am SO glad that I did!  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and no longer have any molar pain when I wake up in the morning.  The other product reviews mentioning the importance of fitting the guard to the exact instructions were very helpful and I made sure to do exactly as noted.  I would highly recommend this product and will buy it again when the one I have wears out.</li>
            <li> I have used this device for years.  At first, it felt weird but after I got used to it, I can&#x27;t sleep without it anymore.  I have to go through the fitting process twice before I get the fit I want but it only takes a few minutes.  Since I have been using this device, I have no more headaches caused by grinding my teeth and no more broken teeth.  Yes, I ground my teeth so hard that I broke one of my back molars.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy.  I did a lot of research on Mouth Guards on here.  With this particular item you will heat up in hot water and form it to your teeth.  It&#x27;s really easy but don&#x27;t mess up, you only get one time to mold it to your teeth.  When you get it there will only be one mold, You can choose to mold it to your lower or upper set of teeth.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a night grinder.  My dentist advised me to try a few \\&quot;over the counter guards\\&quot; as that would be $200 - $300 dollars cheaper than the cost of a custom made guard from him.  This is the only one I have tried and see no need to look further.  Following the instructions and doing a little trimming resulted in a guard that fits well and does not make me gag.  To get it to mold correctly, one needs to follow the instructions.  Timing is critical so read the instructions several times so you don&#x27;t have to refer back to them when going through the fitting process.  I was able to get it to fit perfectly after the first try.  The first two nights I used it, I ended up removing it in the middle of the night when I woke up and it was slightly uncomfortable as one of the inside edges had a small ridge that slightly rubbed against my tongue.  I used a razor to shave that ridge off of the guard and have not had any problems since.  I am now sleeping with it through the night without issues.</li>
            <li> Not what it advertises to do. Too simple and expensive for what it offers in terms of materials and application.</li>
            <li> This is a good, cheap alternative to the super-expensive night bruxism guards that dentists sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits to your teeth just like a mouldable sports mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I think it might just be a mouldable sports mouthguard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend either this product or a mouldable sports mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s pretty comfortable to  wear as long as you fit it properly, and if you can&#x27;t fit it properly they have some kind of money back guarantee, but I&#x27;ve never had to use the guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I think it might also be specifically designed in such a way that it&#x27;s not likely to come off and choke you in your sleep, whereas a mouldable sports mouthguard probably doesn&#x27;t take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T like everyone suggested. I couldn&#x27;t get it to conform to my small mouth. My front teeth are crooked, maybe that&#x27;s why. Also it was too long in length, although you can trim it. I had high hopes for this product because most of the older reviews were good. However, none of the more recent (2015) reviews were. I usually check those first but didn&#x27;t this time around. Maybe I&#x27;ll meditate before going to bed to relieve the stress of my day. Hopefully, I won&#x27;t grind my teeth once I hit the pillow :-)</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING! MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS I HAVE TRIED. DOESN&#x27;T HURT LIKE THOSE OTHER CHEAPER ONCE I TRIED! BEST PRICE FOR THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> I used this product for awhile and is OK but not as nearly as comfortable as the custom fitted one I later got from my dentist. The best thing is the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one...it is uncomfortable and useless in terms of achieving what it your goals.</li>
            <li> The best of 3 types of nightguards i have tried. Stays in place well, seems durable ( two weeks use so far), and okay for speaking.</li>
            <li> Package arrived with a note, that the carton is ripped but the product is ok. Although that may be the case it did give me the feel of buying some liquidation leftovers. If I had intended to pass this item on or even sell it in my store, I would have an inferior product that I could not sell. The price I paid did not reflect it, nor did the seller state that there was a flaw in packaging.</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of a sports mouthguard and someone able to read directions, I feel as though the moulding of this Nightguard should be within my capabilities. Somehow, after two tries, it still won&#x27;t stay in place. No trouble with it being too long (toward the back of my mouth), but it seems to be too thick (up and down) to stay on its own. Ah well; someday I&#x27;ll splurge and get a dentist-created guard.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been after me to get a night guard due to my severe bruxism (teeth grinding). I had hoped that my teeth grinding would improve once I went on a CPAP to improve my sleep apnea but, sadly, it did not. I told my dentist I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a custom night guard again, because I&#x27;d done that many years ago and then gave up on wearing it within a year or so and all that money was wasted. Plus, the process of having a custom guard made was very unpleasant for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at several options for storebought night guards and finally decided on this one. The fitting instructions are quite good--thorough and easy to understand. You can either do the quick fit method using the microwave or use the traditional method using a saucepan on the stovetop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to follow the instructions to the letter AND to follow them very quickly to get a good fit, especially when the guard first comes out of the hot water and the bite channel is malleable. WHile I was very fortunate to get a good fit the first time, in terms of my bite, I did not feel that I was as successful at forming the OUTSIDE edge to conform to the outside of my teeth. Then again, I have a very small mouth, so the way mine turned out may just be as good as it&#x27;s going to get for a small-mouthed person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to really the only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I&#x27;ve encountered in using this product--that it only comes in a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; size. Still, despite the fact that the part of the guard OUTSIDE my teeth protrudes more than I&#x27;d like (or would be most comfortable), I still do like the night guard and wear it most nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night guard comes with a case to store it in, which is great. They recommend using Efferdent Anti-Bacterial Cleanser for cleaning the guard. I did buy some Efferdent tablets and use them maybe once a week, but on a daily basis I wash it well when I first take it out and then at night when I put it back in, I soak it in Listerine Total Care for a few minutes. The minty taste of the mouthwash helps me tolerate having the guard in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a bad gag reflex, as I do, you may have more issues than the average person in getting ajusted to this night guard. I had issues the first few nights getting used to having it in my mouth and some mornings I have a momentary issue with gagging when I take it OUT of my mouth, but otherwise, no problems at all in terms of gagging. This guard rests behind my upper teeth and does not protrude back on my palate, whereas the custom one my old dentist made me gagged me all the time because it protruded too far back on my upper palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my first crown done just before I got this guard. My dentist implored me to please start wearing a guard soon after the crown was put in so that I would not put so much pressure on it. The instructions do say to check with your dentist before using this if you have loose fillings, caps or unfilled cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing...and I&#x27;m not sure if this is a con for the product or just a fit issue for me personally. When I get up in the morning and take out the guard, my bite is off for maybe 10 minutes, and then everything falls back into place and I&#x27;m great the rest of the day. I have not yet had my followup appointment with the dentist since wearing the guard so I can&#x27;t say what he thinks about it, but I do plan to take it with me when I have my next appointment to ask him to check the bite and see if he thinks the bite being a tiny bit off is going to be a problem in the long term. If so, I&#x27;d do a refit on the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My dentist was at a business conference the day of my appointment but another dentist in the practice said it was no big deal that my bite is off for a short while when I wake up...it is more of a muscular issue than a teeth issue.for a few minutes.

            <li> I AM NOW WEARING MY FIRST  DOCTORS NIGHT GUARD FOR GRINDING TEETH. MY DENTIST TOLD ME TO GET IT SO I DID GET ONE. BUT  I WAS WARMING UP THE WEATER TO MAKE SOFT AND I ALMOST DROPPED THE BOWL ON THE FLOOR AND I BURNED MY LEFT THUMB .VERY BADLY. BUT IT DOES WORK REALLY WELL. AND STAYS IN PLACE. IN MY MOUTH. IT HAS HELPED MY TEETH ALL READY.</li>
            <li> The instructions make fitting this thing sound easy, it is anything but easy.  I had to heat mine up twice to get it to fit right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, now that it fits and I&#x27;ve been using it, I don&#x27;t wake up in the mornings with tension headaches any more.  My dentist tried to sell me some $200 teeth grinding mouthpiece, but this item works great.  I&#x27;m a heavy grinder and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it shows no signs of wear at all so it must be made out of pretty tough stuff.</li>
            <li> I know, how hard can it be to heat something and bite it. But be sure it isn&#x27;t just up against your front teeth, but also even on both sides of your mouth - it is pressing on my teeth - very uncomfortable. I&#x27;m possibly going to reheat it and see if I can adjust it, but right now it was a waste of money since it is too uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night for a couple months and it has held up well. I have been disappointed in the past by many nightguards that fall apart or 2 pieces separate. The fit of this nightguard is similar to others I have tried OTC meaning it is a bit bulky. I have never gotten a night guard from the dentist because the price is way too much and I am not confident about how long it will last given my luck with OTC nightguards.</li>
            <li> This is literally the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought on Amazon and I buy almost everything on Amazon. My father is a retired dentist and my mother is a dental assistant. Do NOT buy this product if you value your teeth.  The front lip of this appliance is absurdly narrow and if you don&#x27;t get it to fit perfectly, your bite will be off and it will screw up your mouth possibly causing TMJ. If you do manage to get it to fit properly, which I believe is an impossibility, it is so uncomfortable you probably will not be able to sleep. For those users out there giving this a positive review, you are deluding yourselves into thinking that this appliance is healthy for you. Anything that requires a &#x27;few nights&#x27; to get used to sleeping with is not good for your mouth.  I originally bought this as a spare for my professionally made night guard in case I lost it. Professionally made night guards are pricey, but there is a reason - they work, they fit and they will save your teeth!  Cheap night guards like this could end up costing you thousands in dental bills later. I would return it but the fit was so bad I tried trimming some edges to make it better. In the end the product never fit and it is now in the trash. $18 bucks wasted and Lesson learned. Shame on these charlatans for calling this &amp;#34;Dentist&#x27;s Brand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years for my bruxism. They only last about 6 months for me, but they&#x27;re easy to fit and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I did not know when I got older my teeth would wear down :(&lt;br /&gt;If you grind your teeth at night this is a must!!</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected. Had to reshape it several times and at the end it never fitted my teeth. Completely useless. Waist of time and money..</li>
            <li> I had an expensive night guard from the dentist but the dog chewed it up and I sure didn&#x27;t want to spend another several hundred to replace it. I&#x27;ve tried some cheaper guards from the drug store that were awful but this one is pretty close to the one from the dentist and I can recommend it. It&#x27;s a little bit thick so I had to re heat it a few times to get it down to the right thickness and also had to trim the sides because they were a little too long and made me feel like gagging. I don&#x27;t even realize its in my mouth at night which is a pretty good recommendation.</li>
            <li> That is what I need and price is right</li>
            <li> Love these night guards.  I almost feels like you are not wearing one, compared to the &amp;#34;football&amp;#34; ones you buy at Walmart.  Easy to prepare, and so comfortable.  I kept the first one for months and months, until I finally bit through it.  Guess jaw power is hefty.  I&#x27;ll keep ordering when needed, because the comfort is worth it.</li>
            <li> My mouth is small. When I go to the dentist, I have to use the children&#x27;s devices to have x-rays done due to gagging.&lt;br /&gt;This guard was too large for my mouth and sent it back with no response so far?</li>
            <li> very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> The guard was very uncomfortable to me and I couldn&#x27;t get used to wearing it at night. I wasted my money,</li>
            <li> A little too bulky for me, although it is more rigid than others so it lasts a bit longer.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper than going to the dentist to have a mouth guard made.  Molded well for my mouth and I am waking up w/out headaches for the first time in I don&#x27;t know how long.</li>
            <li> I got this because I clench my teeth at night, causing neck pain and headaches. It was easy to mold to my mouth. I found that if I use it every night it seems to change my bite, so I use it a few nights per week. It stays in place and is comfortable to sleep with. I use a tooth brush and some paste to clean it and occasionally use denture cleaner. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Could not get a comfortable fit.  Very bulky.  Couldn&#x27;t sleep with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since I got it. It does the trick. I have noticed a decrease in my jaw tension during the night and my partner stated that the grinding noises have all but vanished. It&#x27;s a little tricky to get it heated and molded correctly. But follow the directions and you should get it just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other night guards and all of them basically can apart after a month or less.  This product has lasted over 18 months and still going.  It fits well too.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Took several tries (reheating, and pressing back to the original shape) to get the fit right and to get it to stay in place without holding the guard in my mouth.</li>
            <li> great prices,everything at my finger tips. great delivery.dont change a thing. I recommend this proccess to everyone.thanks again!easy instructions. great fit.</li>
            <li> It help me to stop make sound while I sleep.  After I use this problem, my husband never hear any sound from my teeth.  It also help me to not hurt my jaw.</li>
            <li> As an at home use product, it is really easy. I like that they give microwave instructions and that they plan for an occasional reforming as needed. With a life on the go, I often don&#x27;t have access to anything but a hotel microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for my teeth grinding and it doesn&#x27;t feel like too large of an object to breath or anything.</li>
            <li> Works out how it should and mine lasted a full year so I feel like I got my&#x27;s money&#x27;s worth so I bought another, No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have wore a night guard for 20 years.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $500.00 for the plate from the dentist and this works just as well.</li>
            <li> Seem cheap compared to the hard mold I first got from the dentist but these seem to do the trick. The dog WILL eat it so as my dentist friend said, treat it like a bone and keep it well hidden from the dog.</li>
            <li> Other brands end up sliding around during the night, and it&#x27;s a wonder I didn&#x27;t swallow one of those! Some others are cheaper  but this is THE ONLY ONE that stays put and has protected my teeth through many years now. I&#x27;m pretty hard on these things (I dream about eating chocolate cake and other desserts and wake up while still chewing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month or two, you might want put the thing back in the boiling water/cold water (keep the box so you have the directions to refer to when you need to dunk this thing in the hot water again to re-seat it in against your teeth). Over time, if you are as enthusiastic a chewer as I am, your teeth start to make their way down through the cushion. But the thing can be plumped up again (much like fluffing your pillow) in the hot/cold water and putting in your mouth to re-mold the plastic to your teeth. I can usually get a year to two years out of one of these, and as hard as I bite down and chew in my sleep, that&#x27;s really saying something!</li>
            <li> I may have messed up the first shaping part - I&#x27;m not sure. I spit it out more often than some others I have tried. Overall good for the grinding issue though!</li>
            <li> This was a cinch to fit, although the instructions make it seem complex at first. It is extremely comfortable, very secure, and the first mouthguard that I can wear all night without finding it tossed across the room. This includes my $250 custom one from the dentist!</li>
            <li> Finally got rid of my annoying teeth grinding so that my girlfriend can now sleep next to me and doesn&#x27;t wake up halfway through the night and get extremely grouchy.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and the fit is perfect. If you don&#x27;t get the bite quite right on the first try, you can even re-do it. Love this thing</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to get used to this night guard, but I have not been able to do it.  When following the directions it is very simple to mold and fits well and comfortably.  However, the guard is fairly large and I just can&#x27;t sleep with it in because of that.  I either cannot fall asleep because it bugs me or I do fall asleep and end up throwing it across the room in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you have a small mouth or have had issues with retainers in the past I would spend the extra money to get something that is a bit lower profile.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I didnt mold it quite right, but it is quite thick in the front of my teeth . I would like to try to remold it up higher in the front in the hopes of thinning it out. It does help with the jaw pain though, and my migraines are seeming to decrease since using it. I still wake up with my jaw muscles tired though 0 but I really think I am gritting my teeth hard.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable, but I think I can trim it to fit my teeth. I don&#x27;t really use it. My last one fell out of my mouth during the night (it was a big waste of $27! That was the sale price.) it was uncomfortable also. Anyway, then the dog chewed it up. At least this one was cheaper, and I may need it sometime, I have a tooth implant and am supposed to use one to prevent grinding.</li>
            <li> Male reviewer.  I am more of a clencher, so did not need a hard molded guard.  this is soft, like a football guard on one side, harder plastic on the other.  it is a bit thick.  i took the other poster&#x27;s advice and molded it to my bottom teeth, and it feels more secure that way.  My DMD stated a new soft guard would have been $450 and not covered by insurance...</li>
            <li> OK, my dentist says &amp;#34;get one because you are grinding you teeth as you sleep.&amp;#34;. i.e.. I&#x27;m wearing out my teeth! Yes, this does work based on many months of use.  2nd benefit: My wife says that it eliminates my snoring. (but, I don&#x27;t really snore!) She won&#x27;t go to sleep with me until I put it in my mouth.  It&#x27;s also quite comfortable. It only takes a few days to get used to it. I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a good fit with this product.  It seems like it was big and I felt like I was going to gag.  I was afraid to sleep with it in my mouth for fear of choking.</li>
            <li> the first 3 nites my mouth was a little sore.  I thought it may have had to do with the length so I trimmed both ends. After that it definitely did work effectively with clenching.  I don&#x27;t grind my teeth so I cannot comment on that, but definitely adds cushion to any clenching.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I&#x27;ve been using this mouth guard​ for years.</li>
            <li> Does not stay in place at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try to save money.  But it was bulky and I ended up getting a night guard from my dentist.  The one from my dentist fits much better and was worth the money.  I wish I would have just gone to my dentist sooner.</li>
            <li> I broke my night guard that the dentist made me years ago &amp; since they are expensive I thought I&#x27;d try this devise.  It is NOTHING like you get from a dentist.  It&#x27;s bulky &amp; my mouth doesn&#x27;t close right because of it&#x27;s bulk.  Spend the money &amp; get a professional one.</li>
            <li> Guard was too big and bulky for my mouth. Could not fall asleep with it in and it hurts my teeth. Maybe this would be better if different sizes were available, one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult getting the initial fit completed. At this point after wearing it for a while the fit isn&#x27;t too good and I have some difficulty keeping it seated during the night. It has fallen out several times. It could be that the initial fit was faulty on my part.</li>
            <li> This night guard is a perfect fit and it is easy to use. Comes with all the needed instructions. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is the best night guard that I have tried so far. You get the most bang for your buck. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time going to the dentist and getting fitted for a bulky, expensive mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I went to the trouble to try them all. I had to cut part of it, because I have a small mouth. excellent product.</li>
            <li> For the second time my dog chewed up my dentist made protector.....they wanted 825.00 to replace. Thought I would try this product.&lt;br /&gt;Hey this is gonna work just fine.....and at approx. 18.00...I&#x27;ll take it. Fairly easy to fit. I wish it came up a little higher over my front teeth but it does work. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to the custom dentist made for 825.00</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable. it does come with a case. Was very careful with the instructions; however, it doesn&#x27;t replace a true mouthguard supplied by a dentist.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t waste $300 on the custom one from my dentist. This one works great! I know it is cushioning my grinding because I no longer have morning headaches. It was a little tricky to get the molding correct but thankfully you can re do it until you get it perfect.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit, just a simple boil and bite like any sports mouth guard. It&#x27;s comfortable, has a soft gel lining, and isn&#x27;t too thick. Doesn&#x27;t fall out while I&#x27;m sleeping, either. Much comfier and easier to deal with than the hard hunk of plastic my dentist special-made for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Terrible..this guard was Uncomfortable &amp; falls out during the night. The only good thing was that it&#x27;s easy to mold</li>
            <li> One star because it wasn&#x27;t for me, but also because it didn&#x27;t work for the person I bought it for! She still sleeps like she&#x27;s chomping on Fritos.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to form properly. Should have stayed with the 1st fit even though it wasn&#x27;t quite right. Because when I tried to redo it got all messed up and doesn&#x27;t form at all. That was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> They said a custom night guard would be seriously expensive to make, but this was a waste of money. It isn&#x27;t deep enough to make a solid fit. I tried it one night and threw it out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mold your teeth for this product.  My main concern before using this product if I was going to be able to sleep comfortably.  Since day one I have slept like a baby when using this product.  I can not think of any cons while using this product.</li>
            <li> The old saying is you pay cheap and you get cheap.  This design was very inferior which resulted in it falling out of my mouth during the middle of the night.  I did not call the company back for a replacement.  I paid money initially with the intention of it working.  It didn&#x27;t, and there is nothing wrong with my mouth either.  This is not recommended.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this. It keeps me from grinding my teeth at night.&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice: Make sure you have it exactly where you want it because once you make your imprint, it&#x27;s there to stay.</li>
            <li> this nightguard is saving me alot of money. its a little thick and adjustment may take a while with slight difficulty but it works. so far i dont feel any pain with my custom fit.</li>
            <li> I have had TMJ issues for a number of years and tried many solutions. I have even had a number of occlusion plates made at the dentist,which I have begun to chew through on the first night! This one is WAY better than those. It is tricky to fit, and I think I could have done a better job on that, but it still doesn&#x27;t come loose, and I haven&#x27;t even begun to chew through it after a couple of weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last bout of pain and tooth sensitivity had lasted nearly three months. I couldn&#x27;t eat on one side of my mouth at all. After a week or two of wearing this, I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel!</li>
            <li> These are the most comfortable night guards I&#x27;ve purchased. My dentist recommended I mold it then cut off the back 2 teeth on each side. It&#x27;s the perfect size to stop me from grinding and not be so annoyed during the night that I spit it out. I was going through other brands like crazy but these last much longer.</li>
            <li> Too big for my mouth, did not form to my teeth, kept falling off, boiled it 2 times. Waste of money. Go to your dentist and have them create a custom one for you, that is what I am doing.</li>
            <li> I needed a dental protector.  There was some difficulty fitting it forward enough.  It seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> I am Fire Fighter, Married, Mom of 4... I have a lot on my plate so you can understand that stress is in my life. Lately, I have been clinching my teeth while I sleep. Leaving me tired with a very sore mouth the entire day. I went to the dentist and had a night guard fitted for me. I HATED it! It was very hard and made things even worse. I really like this night guard because it has some give. The fitting is not 100% perfect but it is a huge improvement from not having anything.</li>
            <li> My husband has a really bad grinding problem and his dentist has been telling him for sometime to get a mouth guard. I bought on that you use for sport and that didnt work at all. Compared to the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard the others are hard and not pliable. The Doc&#x27;s nightguard was easy to fit and you can refit it, which is a plus. I would recommend to anyone!! And the price was right!</li>
            <li> Sorry if I spelled bruxism wrong - I&#x27;m still grappling with the issue. I have it. May have lost a tooth to it. Dentist said if I didn&#x27;t get a custom mouth-guard I&#x27;d lose more. Paid close to 500 for previous custom guard, which was uncomfortable and cracked within 3 months (I have pretty severe case of bruxism...) New (current dentist) suggested I try this before re-molding for the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; one. I tried it - had to search, btw, could NOT find in wal-mart/Pharmore/rite-aid etc - but amazon saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One easy boil/mold later, and I had an easy-to-wear &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; piece. As I am grappling with age/gum disease, I was concerned, so I brought the molded piece to the dentist AND the periodontist - both said I had done well, and it was a great fit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left my original at myrtle beach a month ago ( was a year old). When I got home, I panicked - I grind so bad, one night without could lead to lost teeth. I picked up an &amp;#34;equivalent&amp;#34; at rite-aid the day i got home. That guard - well, the fitting is the same - boil and bite. However - it split - soft upper molded part from harder plasticy &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; part - within 3 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just molded my second, and have 3 more or order just in case. If you have hard bruxism, GET THIS. Me, my dentist, and my perio  agree it&#x27;s worth it. If only i had gotten it before i cracked a tooth and lost it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsolicited, btw... just passionate.</li>
            <li> This nightguard works well!  Easy to adjust to my bite.  It was a little stiff at first but I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this several times.  Very easy to use and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Impossible to fit. Tried several times, exactly according to instructions. Every time I try to fit the inside of the teeth, the outside edge pops loose - and vice versa. I&#x27;ve removed it, reheated it, tried squeezing the guard together with my fingers to make a smaller fit, and it just won&#x27;t go. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  After warming and rewarming the plastic about 3 times, it finally molded, but would not hold on to the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I discarded it.</li>
            <li> I bought it, took the trouble to get it molded to fit, but used ONCE only. Cushion troubled, kept grinding/moving my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I need hard one for teeth not to move or press on spongy material.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t fit right. Tried a second time to soften and refit, didn&#x27;t work. The gel seemed like it wasn&#x27;t deep enough to cover my teeth. When I bit down until the gel was cool it just fell off.</li>
            <li> this mouth guard was very comfortable byt fell apart in a few months :( i used my other one foe more than a year before it started falling apart.</li>
            <li> I have an old dentek and it broken after half a year of use. This one is still going strong after 6 months!</li>
            <li> My dentist says that over the counter night guards can sometimes do more damage than good. After my professional night guard shattered, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300 out of pocket. So far it seems to alleviate some discomfort after grinding teeth at night.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mouth guard because, after I molded it to my teeth, it had sharp edges that irritated my gums and the inside of my mouth. I ended up trimming the edges, but that resulted in a raggedy gum line. The guard did prevent me from grinding my teeth, but I never could get the gum line smooth enough for long-lasting comfort.</li>
            <li> sturdy bit guard I am glad I purchased this one,some of what I was considering @ the drug stores were generic names and I tried one other brand and now I know the difference as you would so I say  this one is for you, so go for It!</li>
            <li> I really like the fit and function of this sleeping mouth guard. I have a real problem with grinding my teeth while sleeping. And this guard really helps me at a tremendously lower price than getting one from a dentist.</li>
            <li> I believe the concept is great and I&#x27;d like to be able to use them.  I found that they are so thick in the molar area that it made my jaws hurt after just a few minutes.  In all fairness, I have significant TMJ and need to use a custom made guard to avoid problems.  I had hoped to save some money.</li>
            <li> I really like this one. It looks like what i wanted. I recommend for this good product. Don&#x27;t miss it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to mold/fit. Just not sure why a small piece of rubber cost that much.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an mouth guard to replace the $400 one that I bought from the dentist that was getting worn out.  This is a great alternative.  My husband and I both wear night guards and tried several options available at CVS.  None of the other ones would fit securely on our teeth.  If you follow the (easy) directions, you&#x27;ll mold the mouth guard to fit securely on your teeth to where they won&#x27;t fall off if you open your mouth.  I also like the softer rubbery material that this one is made of than the expensive hard stuff that the dentist one is made of.  Plus at this price, I can afford to replace it more often than the dentist version.  My husband and I have used this brand for several years now and it works just as well as the dentist version did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried store brand night guards but these are by far the best. They don&#x27;t last forever, but they are comfortable and easy to mold.</li>
            <li> My daughter molded it and had no problems. It&#x27;s not too big, and fits well. (21 year old female) It was quick and easy to fit, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Took numerous attempts to get a decent fit and after that, it still didn&#x27;t fit. It was uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> It was recommended that I use this due to teeth grinding. It was very easy to mold before I used it for the first time. It fits comfortably, but is annoying at night. I tend to sleep more with my mouth open as a result of using it. It works as expected and with no issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years.  Due to this nightguard, I don&#x27;t wake up with a headache, sore jaws, or chipped teeth anymore.  The cost is extremely reasonable for what the product achieves.</li>
            <li> Feels like it fits right, but won&#x27;t stay on my teeth. Absolutely useless for sleeping since I&#x27;ll probably choke on it.</li>
            <li> I have Bruxism so I bought this and it works great. It also prevent snoring. Very comfortable and I have no time falling asleep. I went ahead and subscribed to receive another one every 4 months. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon after seeing the same thing at my local pharmacy for double the price. I thought I would try this, before buying an expensive one from my dentist. Total waste of money. First off, it took 3 times before I could get the fit right. When I finally got the fit right, it&#x27;s still not very comfortable. I&#x27;m not going to totally fault the night guard for that, I can&#x27;t imagine anything that fits over my teeth would be comfortable all night long. Now the problem I&#x27;m having is it falling out at night. It fit&#x27;s fine when I go to bed, but loosens up as I sleep, then falls completely out of my mouth. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Back of the mouth guard dug into my mouth so badly so that I could not use it.  It also changed my teeth, so it felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t positioning normally.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used two night guards fitted by dentists, and have tried one ordered online before. None of them have been both a good fit and not bulky, let alone inexpensive! This Doctor&#x27;s night guard was easy to mold, it only took one try, and it has a really good grip on my teeth, did not shift even the tiniest bit overnight. I was worried it would slip, because there is no plastic at the front of your teeth, but I can&#x27;t even take it off with my tongue, I have to use my fingers to remove it from my molars. I highly recommend this product, so glad I found it and I will buy it again when it wears down (box says six months).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It&#x27;s soft, easy to mold yourself and at night its easy to forget its in your mouth.  You can even answer the phone while wearing it and not talk like you have a mouth full of food.&lt;br /&gt;Yet, I still wake up in the middle of the night because I&#x27;m grinding and clenching my teeth/jaw. I still have pain in my teeth.  After 5 months of usage even my dentist noticed I&#x27;m grinding at night!  Boo!  So I&#x27;m guessing this product is for light grinders looking to avoid gum recession not heavy grinders doing damage control</li>
            <li> I chewed thru my mouth guard in about two weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough support. It&#x27;s not sturdy enough. Other OTC mouthguards have lasted me much longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my dentist told me it looked like I gind my teeth in my sleep. I followed the instructions on molding it to my teeth but it would not stay in place after heating it up several times and tryinng to get it to conform to my teeth. In addition, it was way to bulky to leave in your mouth and try and sleep. I tried to cut some off the ends as the instructions suggest but it was still uncomfortable. I wound up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> The best night guard in my opinion for the $.</li>
            <li> Husband tried this out and it did not fit/mold properly to his mouth ended up not using it</li>
            <li> Working very well, fits comfortably within my mouth, and stays in place overnight. If you have any experience with retainers or headgear, that kinda thing - this shouldn&#x27;t keep you from sleeping. I bought a second one so I had one molded with and without my retainer in, depending on my situation. Just follow the instructions *exactly*, use a stopwatch even. And you&#x27;ll get the expected result.</li>
            <li> The best nightguard! Better then the my dentist&#x27;s expensive one!</li>
            <li> bought three of these, none of them worked. didn&#x27;t fit at all. even after remolding it 3 or 4 times, which takes forever.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable, and the molding just creates and traps bacteria in your gums. Not for me, Had to throw them out.</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth or a sensitive gag reflex this is not the mouth guard for you. It is very large, and even after boiling it and shaping it to my teeth, I felt that it didn&#x27;t fit me. I even tried trimming the edges so that it wouldn&#x27;t go so far back in my mouth, it didn&#x27;t work. I wound up throwing it out after less than one night&#x27;s sleep. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I literally just bought this and am not happy. I&#x27;m on my fifth attempt at fitting it and it still will not hold tight in my mouth. I&#x27;m tempted to just go buy a cheap mouth guard instead. Stay away!!</li>
            <li> I somehow lost my mouth guard from the dentist so have been relying on the DIY kits. Got a 2-pack from CVS and it was fine but really flimsy. Both broke down within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this one and was really disappointed at the fit. I reshaped it a couple and times and nothing. I was about to throw it out when I remembered the instructions were a bit different. I microwaved it for 2 minutes and shaped it - WOW. Should&#x27;ve read those earlier! Sounds very pedestrian but like another reviewer says - follow the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this thing is super comfortable and allows me to close my mouth. No slip and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s trying to realign my teeth. I don&#x27;t know how durable it will be yet, but I&#x27;m inclined to say I would rebuyif needed. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When I lost my insurance and my ex&#x27;s dogs ate my $400 night guard I had for about 4 years I had to go OTC because I grind terribly at night. I&#x27;ve been through a few different night guards and avoided this one because it was more expensive. It&#x27;s more expensive because it lasts. The one I have now has lasted 8 months and I am only replacing it to see if there is a difference between an 8 month old and a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly - and maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had some experience fitting the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use anything else. I love this night guard! It&#x27;s so much better than having headaches and shots of pain up the side of my head. Grrrrrr</li>
            <li> This nightguard was easy to mold and they fit very well. My teeth felt weird the first couple nights but I think it was just a matter of getting used to it. It works well to protect my teeth when I grind at night.</li>
            <li> The best fit so far for a small adult mouth. Ends had to be trimmed a bit. But far superior than many others tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought LOTS of these dental guards and this one has lasted the longest by far. It cost twice as much as the Dentek ones I was buying (same price but only one in the box) but it has lasted 4-5 times longer. So far, it is a much better value. It stills seems a bit overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it does cost a fraction of what the dentist charges, and it does work so it is worth it. On the negative side, it was a bit harder to fit and does not conform to my teeth as well as the Dentek guards -- which are extremely pliable. If you are very picky and sensitive about the fit, you may need to work a little harder to get it to feel right. But if you need a guard that is solid and a good value then I&#x27;d recommend these.</li>
            <li> This product can be tricky. Make sure read the instructions very well before starting the process. This is a great OTC product.</li>
            <li> This works very well..  It really helps curb my snoring habits.  I found that it was very easy to prep and use.</li>
            <li> Was easy to fit as advertised but final apparatus is very bulky. Chance of not pulling it out during the night is small. I actually sanded the excess on a belt sander and it is better. Casting of teeth impression was easy and did work as advertised, but it is a mouthful. Maybe some wouldn&#x27;t mind though.</li>
            <li> you must totally immerse the guard in the water by holding it submerged with the slotted spoon.  If you don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t get warm enough.  otherwise instructions were superb.</li>
            <li> Too squishy, which I think encouraged me to grind even more. I verified this with my dentist and ended up forking over $150 for a professional occlusal guard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my child who grinds teeth at night, it was way too big.</li>
            <li> We bought locally before I realized it was 15 dollars cheaper on Amazon.  Wife got this after having issues with biting her cheeks and tongue in her sleep and possibly grinding her teeth.  Instructions are good and tell you step by step what to do but it did take 3 to 4 times to get a perfect fit for her teeth.  It fit well for her mouth except for the front teeth a bit and this isn’t as perfect fit as going to the dentist.  She found that using your fingers to press the guard right after the hot water to get a better fit.  This is the first time she has used a guard and found initially it made her mouth dry but after she got used to it, it was comfortable and she was able to sleep with it all night.  She indicated that she was able to fully close her mouth and didn’t drool with it in.  She indicated she is amazed at how comfortable this is in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars</li>
            <li> The first over the counter night brace that did the job like a professionionaly fitted night brace.&lt;br /&gt;Glad that not to have paid dental office for the same.</li>
            <li> Wife tells me I snore more with it. Really dries mouth out. Will not be using it anymore sets on shelf</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while as a nighttime bruxism guard. They are soft and durable. I&#x27;ve never ground through one.. they tend to get dirty first. I wish they extended a bit farther over the back molars (I don&#x27;t have a very big mouth). It seems to be thick enough to keep them from touching, but I would feel better about some added length.. It would be easy to trim if required.</li>
            <li> The guard does not get soft enough to fit in my mouth.  I have not been able to use it.</li>
            <li> I have recently started grinding my teeth more due to an infection under one of my molars in my jaw. This nightguard is great; comfortable and made out of a sturdy material. What I really like about it is that you boil it and it fits to your own teeth, so it is unique to you. I would buy it over and over again if I needed to. Then I just soak it in denture cleaner to clean every few days.</li>
            <li> As good as the guard provided by your dentist. Only difference is you may have to trim it, if you have a small mouth like I do. I highly recommend this night guard.</li>
            <li> I have always ground my teeth at night and could not afford an expensive night guard made by my dentist. When I searched  Amazon.com I was impressed with the reviews for this product.  Instructions for sizing were easy to follow and the fit is great.  Previous products I have used did not fit properly and would sometimes fall out of my mouth , so I worried about choking while I was sleeping .  I would certainly recommend you try this product, it really does work.</li>
            <li> The instruction procedure is very complex and precise. It will work if you have an assistant to exactly time each step, and press everything just right. (Seems that this product has been developed by an entrepreneurial dentist -- who&#x27;s been used to having an assistant around.) And thus, it appears you must be skilled to simultaneously and precisely manipulate, adjust, press, position, hold, squeeze, suck, ect.. . Alas, apparently I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m just an engineer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried once. Horrible fit. Melted again, remolded. Not so good either. This thing is very frustrating and difficult to fit .... Perhaps if I knew a friendly dental assistant would be able to mold it to my mouth. But I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried hard to get to like it. After all, the reviews are good. Perhaps I&#x27;m the problem, and not the guard. So even though the fit is poor, I have used it for 3 nights, but that&#x27;s enough... But I salivate like a hound in a 100-deg heat when sleeping. (Can you actually drown in your own saliva? Gross!). It&#x27;s hard to fall asleep. To the company&#x27;s credit, they offer free replacement if you call them and tell them you are not satisfied with the first (practice) mold. But it&#x27;s just too much hassle. I don&#x27;t have time for that. I give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it would help immensely! if there was a how-to instructional video on fitting the guard posted on the company site. Well-made videos work better than long instructions. So I googled everywhere, and tried to find it, but failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this customer, it&#x27;s money wasted. I don&#x27;t care for refund or replacement. It is time to move on and try another product.</li>
            <li> this is a great mouth guard, and molded fine to my mouth.  It is BPA free, and you don&#x27;t have to spend $200 on a mouthguard - you can buy this</li>
            <li> This is a good night guard.  Got a good fit on the first try.  But be sure to shop around because often sellers like wmart have comparable products for nearly half the price.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but too bulky.  Makes me snore more, so the hubby tells me.  And drool!  I used for about 10 days and decided not worth trying to get used to anymore.  Your MUST follow instructions to a tee when molding, still not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever. My husband had tried it about a year and didn&#x27;t like it but my dentist recommended I get one to try for myself. I have just wasted $18. Not happy!!!</li>
            <li> Works great,, much cheaper then the one dentist wanted to make me ! $400</li>
            <li> too big for my mouth!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to fit right, after 4 times I just gave up</li>
            <li> Very difficult to get a fit that will last past an hour.  I&#x27;ve not been able to do so.  I&#x27;ll keep trying and post when I get a good fit.</li>
            <li> Self-fit mouth guard to protect your teeth from bruxism. Simple fit process is the same as the one use for sports guards.  This guard is much lighter and smaller than a sports guard so it easy to sleep with it in over night.</li>
            <li> Great delivery...product as expected</li>
            <li> Cool way to save your teeth!</li>
            <li> It works after a few tries at fitting to your mouth; not a substitute for your dentists efforts but a good temporary appliance if you need an extra or forgot to bring your regular one on vacation, as I did. Be sure to soften it in very hot boiling water before fitting it. Directions are good and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit quite as well as the ones that my dentist makes, but it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper.  Definitely keeps me from waking up with sore teeth.</li>
            <li> Still trying to get get customer service on line to ask for help or a replacement.  I tried 3x to shape but cannot get it to where it doesn&#x27;t move in mouth.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong???</li>
            <li> good am use any night very good help me a lot with am sleep good to use this good for me</li>
            <li> I read the warning, and figured that it was just a &amp;#34;cover your a**&amp;#34; disclaimer. I was mistaken. It fits perfectly, and when i woke up in the morning my teeth didn&#x27;t hurt (hence the 3 stars). However, my jaw hurt more than ever, and it continued to click and pop throughout the day. I tried it for several days, thinking that it was just my jaw getting used to the new mouth guard, but it never improved.</li>
            <li> This was relatively easy to fit (very similar to molding a mouth guard if you ever had to do that for sports), but I found the end result product to be a bit bulky and awkward to wear.  It fit nicely after the molding process, but just wasn&#x27;t as comfortable as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  I really wanted to love this product and because of the reviews was encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions EXACTLY (even the tips from other people), but could not get it to stay or mold onto my teeth. The sides were too thick and would not conform around my molars.  Its like the rubber was too thick or too hard to mold. I left a good amount of space to conform around my front teeth, but it was not enough to fully cover (and I don&#x27;t have an oddly giant mouth or anything) so it would not stay in place.  I could imagine waking up choking on it.  I am disappointed and basically feel like it was money wasted.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work at all.</li>
            <li> Great mouth guard. Make sure you follow the directions in order to get a good mold.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was experiencing jaw pain from clenching my teeth at night.  I fit these the way I was supposed to, they stay in my mouth like they say they should, but I cannot sleep when I have it in because it&#x27;s so bulky.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve gone through two of them and although i have followed the directions, i can&#x27;t get it to fit right.  also, the corners of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;base keep poking me in the sides of my mouth.  how am i supposed to get it to fit right?  i wish i&#x27;d never bought this product.  i&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thought by following the directions, it would work.  how do i remold it to where it&#x27;s comfortable?  it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;advanced comfort.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why am i not able to get it comfortable?  it rubs my tongue raw from the hardness of the base (and it&#x27;s not smooth underneath).  so,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wake up w/ an aching jaw, scrapes on the sides of my mouth and a raw tongue.  please help!  i&#x27;m not buying any more of these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;things unless or until i can get the ones i have to work right.  i feel like i&#x27;ve wasted my money.  i bought it on the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommendation of my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, i&#x27;ve tried to submit this review via their customer service &amp;#34;contact us&amp;#34; page and it would not submit.  i want this company to respond to my feedback!  i need help with this.  i feel i&#x27;ve just thrown my money down the drain and i want it back.</li>
            <li> FYI- I am a dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night guard will work well for you if you don&#x27;t have TMJ issues and don&#x27;t grind your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for my husband because he won&#x27;t get an impression for a guard from my office. He doesn&#x27;t clench or grind his teeth, but I have caught him &#x27;chomping&#x27; in his sleep, which was causing his teeth to fracture. This guard works well for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you grind your teeth, I highly recommend your get one made from your dentist- even if your insurance doesn&#x27;t cover. It will save you money in the long run. The ones you get from your dentist are made of a hard acrylic, so when you grind, your teeth will slide across the glassy surface with little friction. With this doctor&#x27;s night guard or similar guards, your teeth WILL NOT slide. They get stuck in the rubber and cause tension in the jaw. This could lead to jaw pain &amp; even more TMJ issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ben using the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; night guard for years with nary a problem. This &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; guard is awful. The primary difference is that it contains less material which is supposed to be better. Perhaps it&#x27;s better for their bottom line, but not so much for me. I tried fitting it three times without being able to obtain a proper fit.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Could not get it to fit into mouth.  Tried several times.  Waste of money! Wish I could return it but I do not have the packaging.</li>
            <li> my biggest problem with having a night guard is that i drool. a lot. but as for the product itself, it&#x27;s good. i have no complaints.</li>
            <li> $200 at the dentist or do it yourself. No brainer.</li>
            <li> Too difficult and time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> The fitting process was simple. The night guard is very comfortable. I will never have another custom made night guard after trying the Doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> very easy to shape with the instructions. i&#x27;ve remolded twice and it seems fine. they do get worn down in about 4 months for me though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my mouth in a way that was comfortable to sleep. A portion hung off my back molars, and I was hoping for something that would allow my teeth to slide more as I slept to relieve the torque that can occur with teeth clenching.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it he has been now waking up without a painful mouth since using it. Fitting it was fairly easy although it did take us a second attempt. We didn&#x27;t follow the instructions of reshaping it and starting all over. Only issue on the first try was it not staying on his teeth with his mouth open so we just sat it in hot water for 2 minutes, put it back in place, and then he pushed it tighter to his teeth. It worked without us having to deform the guard back to its original shape.</li>
            <li> This product works so well to protect teeth from nighttime grinding. It is comfortable to wear. It may take a couple of times to get the fitting right but don&amp;#34;t give up. The results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to shape the mouthpiece to my fitting and it did not work so well. It might be because I have a small mouth. It did not shape well enough to be tight fitting. It comes loose so does not stay in place. I will try again.</li>
            <li> Night guard that has so flex</li>
            <li> Better because its much cheaper and still does a good job. The fairly hard bottom portion (and top portion, once formed) does what the dentist wants it to do which is to be fairly hard and not chewy but firm and grind preventing. Actually this fits better than the one I paid $350+ dollars for at the dentist which was much to tight and uncomfortable to wear. I am very happy with this product and can stand to have it in my mouth while sleeping!</li>
            <li> These are the best on the market.  Amazon has them so much cheaper (at $16) than $35 at CVS!  The system is a hard lower level (like the sole of a shoe) and slight outer frame (just tall enough to give it shape) that stands up to many months of grinding with no change. The inner part is thicker and taller after fitting as it oozes up and around to shape to fit your teeth and a bit of gum.  The end fit leaves your front teeth mostly exposed in front, so your upper lip lies comfortably flat.  Also, the spacing between your jaws is enough to relax your jaw muscles but not enough to feel awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip:  Follow the instructions exactly, and read them in advance.  Also, be sure not to let the mouthguard touch anything but your fingers when it is sticky and melty inside, or the inner goo will stick and stretch.</li>
            <li> Someone once told me that whenever I slept, it sounded like I was chewing on ice cubes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all stopped once I bought the Night Guard. I&#x27;ve tried a few others and this one is really strong, and lasts pretty long!</li>
            <li> Personally, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this product.  I&#x27;ve used athletic mouth guards over my lifetime and am quite familiar with how to mold them.  The instructions with this product are similar.  I followed the instructions to the second.  Still a vacuum seal has not been possible.  I&#x27;ve tried three times.  Their customer service said to call them back if it didn&#x27;t work.  Note:  Trying to get to the right customer service area was very difficult.  It appears this brand is owned by a large corporation, and I found getting the correct information to get to the customer service area difficult.</li>
            <li> As promised and works well-helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have problems clenching my teeth while sleeping and work really well</li>
            <li> As a professional dental hygienist I&#x27;m very impressed with the way these specific guards are made.  They&#x27;re the only OTC night guards we recommend at our office because they are the closest we&#x27;ve found to a custom fit lab made appliance.  If finances are an issue, I recommend this as a alternative.</li>
            <li> I dream of eating chocolate cake at night and when awakened suddenly, I&#x27;m still chewing and wondering where my cake went!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eating while I&#x27;m dreaming has been really hard on my teeth. So for years now, I&#x27;ve depended on this night guard company. The first ones fit really well, but pushed my lips out a bit (definitely NOT attractive!).  That was the old &amp;#34;Original.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does the job, yet is much thinner in front. If you follow the directions, it will form an impression of your teeth. I can eat in my dreams, all night long, and it stays where it belongs and protects my hard working teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while, it needs to be dropped back into simmering water again, for the prescribed minute, then dunked in cold water (from the tap is fine) and then popped back into your mouth. This re-expands the cushion and keeps it comfortable.</li>
            <li> Falls right out no matter how well you do it. Don&#x27;t believe these 5-star lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already purchased one, just throw it away. Don&#x27;t even bother opening the box.</li>
            <li> It does not mold to the mouth easily. It&#x27;s a lot of money for a guard that , at least for me, just couldn&#x27;t mold to my mouth no matter how many times I tried (which I did 5 times).</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep and this has been going on for many years. This product really helped me to save my teeth! I had to mold it twice before I can get a good fit. Very easy to use if you follow the instruction closely. Been using it for many months but the wear and tear is minimal even though I am a serious grinder.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, good price, new condition. thanks</li>
            <li> It molded as advertised. I chose this because it was advertised for small mouths. However it&#x27;s too large and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is so big that it&#x27;s pretty impossible to sleep with it inside of the mouth. I guess it&#x27;s gonna take me a long time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Works great - saved me $800, which my dentist wanted to replace my old night guard.  It&#x27;s important to read the directions a few times before you move ahead to boiling the guard and then placing it in mouth.  It&#x27;s comfortable to wear - all in all, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable to use, I could not keep it in my mouth long enough to know if it worked</li>
            <li> Dec 2014 - I&#x27;ve tried a few nighttime mouth guard brands before, most notably the Dentek Pro Sleep Easy Dental Guard.  The Doctor&#x27;s blows the other ones away.  I&#x27;ve had this pair for four months as of this review, and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* I find that it&#x27;s a much better fit vs. prior nighttime mouth guards.  It properly covers more of the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;* With other brands, I was semi-concerned about choking at night because they would come off my teeth.  NEVER a problem with The Doctor&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;* The fitting process is better and easier for The Doctor&#x27;s.  With the other brands, you boil water and feel like you only have one chance to get it right.  I fit The Doctor&#x27;s twice, with no issues, to get the best fit.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s comfortable at night!&lt;br /&gt;* Pretty sturdy case&lt;br /&gt;* Absolutely NO concerns about this one splitting into two pieces, unlike prior brands.  Solid as a rock.&lt;br /&gt;* I took it into my dentist and she OK&#x27;d it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to completely close your mouth at night with The Doctor&#x27;s, unlike some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;* It requires daily Efferdent treatments to clean it up.  Prior mouth guards you could get a away with a quick toothbrush scrubbing of the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing seeing the bite marks I make in this thing.  Makes me glad I&#x27;m wearing it!  Overall, great product.  I came here today to purchase a backup one for when (if?) my first breaks down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/28/2015:  Same pair, still going strong!</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth this is not for you.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, my dentist diagnosed me with bruxism. It was so bad that I would wake up with my mouth aching in pain. H recommended this product and it lasts me every few months or so with the proper care. As I read the reviews of others, it seems as if there are two responses: either people loved it or hated it. To me, it depended on the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using this specific mouth guard for two years. No major problems or concerns. I recently switched to Oral B&#x27;s mouth guard and the experience was awful. It was fairly tiny in comparison and had no sense of leach, even when molded. After a few days, it was trashed and I returned to this mouth guard. During the application process, for the first time apparently, I molded all the way around my mouth using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this, even though the instructions say otherwise. Just bite and mold the front. It won&#x27;t leach onto your teeth as strong but if you are grinding your teeth, it will stay in. I&#x27;ve never had an experience where I would wake up and it would be out of my mouth. When I molded around my teeth completely, it felt really bad. I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep as easy and I&#x27;d wake up hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this over other mouth guards, but it will need to be molded to your standard or it&#x27;ll seem cheap and painful.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than my last one by same company . Took a little getting used to, doesn&#x27;t hug my teeth as well because there just isn&#x27;t enough product to mold. And I&#x27;m a small person 5&#x27;2 petite female.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It is  is so  big that I wake up every morning to fin!d I have spit it out in my sleep and I must go searching for it. I followed the directions exactly and don&#x27;t understand why it feels so bulky. It sticks out and I can&#x27;t close my mouth, which is probably why I spit it out in my sleep</li>
            <li> I bought one of these things from cvs for way more than it is on amazon because i was starting to realize how much i grind my teeth at night.  I boiled it right and got a good fit, great, I wore it the first night and thought ok this is pretty neat. Laying in bed the first night i thought:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Wow, if i bite down hard on this thing or try to grind my teeth like my subconscious self will likely do while im asleep, the night guard  does protect my teeth but my jaw feels shoved back with a strong force at an unsettling angle. Almost like it could do a lot more damage to my jaw than my teeth could do on their own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it for 1 week and stopped because I became more convinced that the flat bottom of it is damaging/going to damage my jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having some real jaw issues for the first time like a month later, probably unrelated to the nightguard but likely related to the grinding/clenching. I decided i had to get somethign that would stop me and protect me from grinding / clenching.  The solution was a 7 dollar &amp;#34;Brain-pad&amp;#34; athletic night guard from wal-mart that works EXTREMELY well.  It has&lt;br /&gt;BOTH&lt;br /&gt;THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM IN ONE FASTENED TOGETHER CREATING A PERFECT SUPPORT FOR YOU TOP AND BOTTOM TEETH AND THEREFORE YOUR JAW WHILE YOU TRY TO CLENCH.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the caps but if this saves one other person because it sticks out then its worth it.  I talked to a dentist later and he said the same thing, he reccomended he make me one (which he&#x27;ll be doing as soon as I get my cavities filled) and said in the meantime the next best thing is an athletic nightguard that features a top and bottom guard fastened together.&lt;br /&gt;check out brain-pad&#x27;s they work great and are cheap.</li>
            <li> It is really bad product, low quality plastic, be careful!&lt;br /&gt;I suggest for AMAZON.com delete this product from portofolio.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheat of customer ,</li>
            <li> I have used mouth guard for several years, purchased from local drug store, custom made from a dentist but this is THE worst product I used my teeth hurts more if I wear this product overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to finally find a mouth guard that stays in my mouth all night and that isnt so thick it throws my jaw off. I gave it 5 stars for these reasons as I kept biting through thinner guards that were easy on the jaw and spitting out thicker ones in my sleep. I do wish the bottom of the guard were a bit softer and maybe had the hard surface under a softer layer like the top part of it is.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth is small and this guard fit well which was a surprise.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find flaws with this as someone who paid for the professional dentist fitted one (way over $300) but so far I have not. The fitting process was straight forward, had to do a refit due to not bitting down properly the first time, which wasn&#x27;t hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really can&#x27;t go in much more detail other than that, it feels pretty good quality, the fit has stayed exact for over two weeks, definitely worth it if you grind your teeth, or have jaw pain, or possibly both like me. Big difference in the morning and sleeping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now suffering from jaw pain that&#x27;s closer to my neck and under my ear.  I just can&#x27;t wear this anymore, it causes so much pain.  Everyone is different, so there&#x27;s no way of knowing until you give it a try.  Good luck!  Grinding and clenching is terrible...I wish there was a cure.</li>
            <li> Much better than Plackers brand. Took me a couple times to get the mold correct (yes you can re-mold). I use it on my bottom jaw.&lt;br /&gt; It seems to seat OK and floats around a little BUT it&#x27;s still in my mouth in the morning so I can&#x27;t possibly grind. That&#x27;s what counts.&lt;br /&gt; A little bulky but that does not bother me. No jaw soreness, however my mouth is dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions precisely for molding this to my mouth, and still found it impossible to sleep in it.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34;, so it&#x27;s not because of being small like some of the other reviewers.  It feels bulky and intrusive.  Honestly, I found the Plackers Grind No More dental night protector to work far better, far more comfortably.  And I&#x27;ve been using a single box of them for over 2 years, just about to finally order a 2nd box now.</li>
            <li> This product works to prevent my husband from grinding his teeth at night. Much less expensive than the dentist! He has used it every night for years now.</li>
            <li> This product is so durable. I used to buy the drug store generics, and they would get ruined by 2 months max. 2 months + later and they don&#x27;t appear phased at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit to get used to it not completely sticking into your upper teeth, but i don&#x27;t know it could have been an error on my part.</li>
            <li> Way too bulky. My husband tried to re-form it several times to get it to fit. It ended up fitting but was still way too bulky. He ended up removing it in his sleep every time he used it. It went in the trash after the first week.</li>
            <li> It was so bulky I couldn&#x27;t even swallow or breath normally without having to take it out.  I couldn&#x27;t stand to have it in my mouth for a whole night. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t need a huge review. It&#x27;s a mouthpiece to guard your teeth if you are grinding. It does a great job if you mold it right.</li>
            <li> This is basically what I expected, although I found it a bit difficult to fit. It took me two tries, and then I ultimately just realized it was as good as I was going to get it because essentially my bite is much longer than than the guard. This means that to ensure my back teeth get in the mold it basically wraps around behind my front teeth instead of having my front teeth rest in the actual guard. I wish this wasn&#x27;t the case but it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance that I can tell, just the comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it falling out at night. I was worried that I would have trouble sleeping with it in because it is pretty bulky but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and don&#x27;t walk up with headaches and face pain if I remember to put this in.</li>
            <li> Got this because my dentist said I was grinding at night. It was easy enough to mold (so many reviews scared me about the molding process)- just follow the directions and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed it to my dentist, and he recommended against using &#x27;one for all&#x27; guards because they can misalign a bite if used for long periods of time. I&#x27;m only 22, so he said it might not have a terrible effect on my bite at this age, but he recommended against them in general, stating that the custom dentist guards are molded specifically not to interfere with the bite pattern/alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is true, because even before he mentioned it, when I removed the guard in the morning, my jaw felt \\&quot;not right\\&quot; and when I bit down, I was biting kind of awkwardly too forward or backward. The guard obviously holds your jaw open a bit all night, so it&#x27;s a bit disorienting when you wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just putting the info out there for you...(I know the dentist guard is a lot of--too much-- $$$!)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a quick and inexpensive alternative to a professional bite guard provided by my dentist. Unfortunately, I found this product to be of no value. The molding process was difficult and did not produce a secure and comfortable fit. Further, because of the bulkiness of the material, the guard just would not stay on. I tried it for a couple of weeks, and invariably woke up to find that the guard had dislodged and was on my pillow rather than on my teeth. To make matters worse, when I tried to contact customer service my only option was to do so online, but when I attempted to use the online form to submit my questions and complaints the site made it impossible for me to effectively submit any meaningful information. This was an all-around unsatisfying purchase.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a night time mouth guard made by the dentist because I grind my teeth.  It cost $25.  Now we&#x27;re looking at a few hundred dollars for the same piece.  This was recommended as a cheaper alternative.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to form to my mouth than the ones I have previously had.  It does very good guarding my teeth at night.  It also feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Ugh I hate to say it but this product is terrible.  I heated it up and followed the instructions diligently because I once before got this product and had trouble with it so I made sure I did everything right.  Fit but it seems as if it isn&#x27;t comfortable... can&#x27;t close my mouth really but I drool anyway so oh well. Im sure it will do the trick for the time being but I would not purchase again. Been looking forward to this product for a while just to try it again because I could tell ive been grinding my teeth and waking up with some pressure. Not even too excited to use it again. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> After several months of horrible jaw pains thinking my teeth were infected, I discovered my clenching at night was really the problem! This doctors night guard is the one recomended by my dentist pretty easy to form and works great!</li>
            <li> I have gone through many nightgaurds. This is an updated version of one I have chewed through or not liked due to fit or bulkiness. The newest version is less bulky, a tad longer in the back which is good for me since I have a lot of teeth and it doesn&#x27;t require you to boil water. You just need to microwave water in a mug. Now I&#x27;m a serious grinder. I know this isn&#x27;t gonna last me probably more than a year. However, I can&#x27;t afford the amount of money the dentist charges for a legit night gaurd. So, of all the drugstore options this is the one I choose every time I inevitably chew threw them. My teeth are worn down and my K9s are flat so going without one isn&#x27;t an option. I had a lapse for a few weeks and it was painful. I just can&#x27;t do it like I did when I was younger. I wish I had of had this when I was a kid! My teeth would have a lot more edges on them.</li>
            <li> Not easy to form to teeth, better off buying one that does not require fitting to mouth.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of cushioning for the gums, which is nice, but ultimately it results in a much bulkier mouthguard than the Oral B professional slim fit nighttime dental guard, which I prefer (not available on Amazon at this time). If padding/softness is more important to you than bulkiness, you&#x27;ll probably prefer this one. Both are high-quality and work just as well as the $300 ones the dentist would like to sell you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this at amazon. Its too big and would not adhere to my teeth. IN THE TRASH. I am on amazon looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> I got this as a temp solution for a prototype semi-hard occlusal guard that my dentist made me, that I totally destroyed last week in my sleep, until I could go back to the dentist to see what else he suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to mold this guard after multiple attempts with varying water temperatures; there is no possible way to ever get water get hot enough in a microwave to mold this guard. 3 minutes &#x3D; what temperature? &amp;#34;3 minutes in the microwave&amp;#34; means absolutely nothing instructional wise, since there are 500, 600, 700, 800, and 1000+ watt microwaves, and each one&#x27;s time will vary. What should be said is: &amp;#34;using a candy thermometer, check to make sure the water temperature is between x and x degrees.&amp;#34; This way, we know how hot the water should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it was, it hurt me to try and mold this. How are you supposed to &amp;#34;bite down&amp;#34; and mold it? Bite down on what, my hand? There is nothing to hold onto; you cannot hold it and bite down, I don&#x27;t get how that&#x27;s supposed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for you all: these soft ones only encourage your bruxism. The plastic ones WILL NOT damage your teeth because enamel is a very hard material that will damage the plastic before the plastic does any real damage. The main danger in plastic guards is in accidentally swallowing broken pieces that may come loose while you are sleep-grinding. For now, I will stick to my lower-teeth Sleep RIte soft guard I got originally- it kinda makes my front gums sore, and can fall out if I turn over, but it was cheaper and more effective than this one was and didn&#x27;t require any molding.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can say anything positive about this product! I followed the directions to the letter and I could not get this mouthpiece to form to my mouth! It was like the plastic hadn&#x27;t softened enough to allow it to be malleable. I even reformed the guard and tried again, this time boiling it for slightly longer, but to no avail. Avoid this product!</li>
            <li> I resized this twice, and still have a not so perfect fit.  This is really a glorified mouthguard.  I used to play footballl, and this feels no better quality than my old mouthguards, except that it is much more slim.  It does get the job done, though, and has definitely reduced my teeth sensitivity caused by grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this thing falling out and it was not to difficult to fit or boil. The biggest problem is that it felt like the mold never kept its shape and it felt like it was pushing in on my teeth. I would wake up with sore front teeth as it felt like there had been pressure on them all night long. As well the material is pretty soft and within two or three nights my teeth would begin to wear away cuts in the plastic which would then in turn cut my gums and I would wake up with sore gums. There is a newer version of this product that uses blue plastic which I have found is more durable and has less problems with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest positive about this product is the durability. I felt that they lasted quite a while and even given the above problems, I felt that the weren&#x27;t completely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t mold it to my teeth! It&#x27;s useless!</li>
            <li> TOTALLY USELESS... DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Never got it to form to my mouth per the instructions.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS THING. If you grind your teeth, go to your dentist and spend the big bucks for a real one. I hate to say that, because I was really hopeful that this would allow me to avoid the big expense.  It sucks. I followed the instructions and tried 3 times. It just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter on the advise of her PA.  We placed the mouth guard in hot water to soften so she could mold it in her mouth.  My daughter not only uses the guard at night, she sometimes slides it in during the day if she is stressed to keep from clinching her teeth.  I would highly recommend this guard.  It&#x27;s easy to use and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Makes back of jaw hurt by morning.</li>
            <li> This the fifth one I have purchases they work really well i will buy as long as they make them.</li>
            <li> I can usually wear this guard all night comfortably. But where your tongue lays the guard drops off, which results in your tongue squishing into that \\&quot;valley\\&quot;. My tongue usually holds that shape for a few hours after waking up.  I&#x27;m afraid to use this product too long for fear that my tongue will deform, so I&#x27;m going to switch between different varieties of guards.  Everything in moderation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the positive reviews.  Following the instructions carefully (boiling water for 50 seconds, cooling for 20 seconds, molding for 20 seconds, additonal molding, etc.), I found this product extremely difficult to mold into a comfortable fit.  I made three attempts at molding it to fit my teeth but still could not get quite what I would call a fit that anyone could reasonably get used to .  Others seem to like this product, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different mouth guards over the years.. One I even had customed made by the dentist for 200.00.  They were all horrible and felt like I had my mouth stuffed. they were bulky uncomfortable and irritated my gums.. I hated them so much i just stopped wearing them and just made my problems worse.. I just bought the Doctor&#x27;s nightguard and i can&#x27;t believe how great this is! It molded to my teeth perfectly after following the directions.. It is so thin and comfortable i hardly even know i am wearing anything.  I can even talk with it in my mouth.  I wish i had this one years ago I would have saved my teeth all the wear and tear on them not to mention the wasted expense!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I had a night guard from my dentist years ago ($500) and  I just could not sleep with it.  Ended up being a total waste.  Out of desperation I tried this one &amp; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I was now more determined to try to sleep with this, or that this one is softer than the dentists one, but I was able to fall asleep.  The first night it felt too bulky &amp; I woke up with a headache.  I  then took a knife &amp; whittled down the excess plastic at the back which made it considerably more comfortable.  I was able to fall asleep again &amp; woke up with a bit of relief in my jaw.  I still hate sleeping with something in my mouth but since I probably have to, I&#x27;m happy I found this product!  Definitely worth trying for around $20.</li>
            <li> Would be perfect except for the fact it is too narrow to fit either my top or bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and soft as compared to my expensive hard guard.&lt;br /&gt;Instruction manual a little confusing - stated that it shouldn&#x27;t be used for night grinding, clenching or TMD?????</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a mouth anti-grinding guard, so I may have problems with the device that anyone who already uses such device may no longer experience.  So my rating is 3-star because of my experience with this product and my perceived problems using it.  After following instructions, I got the device to fit pretty well.  However, I found that this guard excessively rubs my gums and roof of mouth near my teeth. So my gums get swollen and irritated. It also causes me to drool all night when I&#x27;m asleep. I can tell you that the plastic material breaks down to almost uselessness after about 3 weeks of grinding. This causes the guard to loosen up and fall from my mouth.  I have had the guard for a little over 3 weeks now.  Last night was the final straw... the device continually falls out during the night, I still grind my teeth all night, and I wake up to a wet drooly pillow.  I cannot see paying out another 20+ dollars for another such experience.  I will either try another brand or go see a dentist for a solution.</li>
            <li> I have tried 7 other brands over the past decade and nothing comes close to this easy to mold, easy to use and easy to keep (in its storage box). It is very durable and much better and a hell of a lot cheaper than the one my dentist made for me when I first needed to wear these guards at night. Don&#x27;t waste money on others.</li>
            <li> This was a bit too big for my mouth so I did have to cut it a bit to make it more comfortably fitting.  Had to remold it a few times to get it to fit properly.  I just followed the directions very closely.  If you mess up, it&#x27;s easy to try and redo again.  I don&#x27;t use this night guard every night (I hate my gag reflex) but I try to use it at night when my jaw is hurting from clenching and grinding throughout the day.  The nights I DO use it, it has helped by relieving some pain.  I admit, I haven&#x27;t used it two nights in a row, and I&#x27;m sure if I did that, it would relieve most if not all of my jaw pain.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the one that cost me $250 from my dentist! Easy to shape to your own mouth, takes less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The reason I give it 2 stars instead of just one is that it works as promised--if done right it forms a tight fit to the upper teeth. However, about 2 seconds after putting it in my mouth I started gagging; hardly a good way to get a good night&#x27;s sleep. Even cutting it a bit narrower wouldn&#x27;t help, and my wife&#x27;s $400 nightguard (professionally made) isn&#x27;t really any smaller. I&#x27;m glad to have made this discovery for so little money! It might work for others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> It took two times for me to fit it correctly - not a big deal. This one fits snugly more than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The roblem with them all is that that they can throw your bite off a bit because it holds your jaw open all night. This product has defintiely kept me from grinding thru the night. Teeth I was having issues with, are issues no more. I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for $20 instead of paying $500 for a dentist mouth guard.  Instantly took my horrible jaw aches away and headaches too.</li>
            <li> I clench my jaw at night and it has led to TMJ.  I cannot afford to get a splint from the dentist, so I tried the $17 route and it is working so far.  Only complaint is that my dog LOVES to find it and chew them up, so I&#x27;m now purchasing my 3rd one of these--it comes with a holder so I should really use it I guess.</li>
            <li> I was totally frustrated with this product.  I read the instructions through a couple of times and gathered everything I needed to make sure I could follow the steps and get the timing right.  Despite my best efforts, I could not get it to mold correctly around my teeth.  I am a pretty handy person, I do all sorts of crafts, stained glass, pottery, sewing, needle work, so I am adept at using my hands and fingers to create.  But there was no amount of effort I could use to make this mold properly.  The instructions say if you are unsuccessful the first time, you can put it back in the hot water, reheat it and wait for it to cool and shape it back to the original shape with your fingers.  NO, you cannot!  It is permanently set once you have bitten into it and you cannot reshape it.  I hate to have a leave a negative review but this is my experience.  Others may be satisfied with it.  Sorry I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed. I didn&#x27;t spend $800 on a custom mold from the dentist, but I have something that fits just as well! I didn&#x27;t quite get the fit I wanted the first time I set it, but just reheated in a mug and fine-tuned it. Perfect!</li>
            <li> It doesnt fit well. I even heated it 2 times and cannot get it to fit my mouth. The plastic feels very shallow and doesnt wraop around teeth well. It feels like it will fall out.</li>
            <li> Buy one of these every 9-12 months or so. Very comfortable, easy to get that custom fit at home. I don&#x27;t understand why these are $30 to $45 at the local drugstore and so inexpensive here, but I know where I&#x27;m spending my money...</li>
            <li> Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard Advanced Comfort instructions indicate that if you have one or certainly more missing upper teeth you&#x27;re going to have problems getting the product to stay put on the roof of your mouth which I did. In addition, the excess saliva issue was overwhelming since I&#x27;m more prone to salivating than the average person (according to my dentist and orthodontist). The boiling process is no fun either. The bottom line is I purchased the [[ASIN:B003WL42JY Sleepright Dura Comfort NO BOIL Dental Night Guard]] which I have used before and it is far easier to use, causes far less salivation and does the primary job of preventing me from grinding my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Unable to follow a 12 step program to stop grinding my teeth at night, my dentist recommended a mouth guard and some Sensodyne. Having worn a mouth guard 40 some years ago, I discovered they really haven&#x27;t improved much on the boil in water/ form in you mouth type guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried using this this for sleeping, it was another story. To everyone&#x27;s surprise I really wasn&#x27;t a big mouth, just misunderstood. I discovered a gagging sensation when I laid down. Apparently these weren&#x27;t designed for straight men. My tongue rested on a big hunk of useless plastic on the back of my front teeth. Oh what to do as I had just blown my $20 Walmart gift card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I say useless plastic? Hmmm. I broke out the sharp, nearly clean adult scissors and trimmed this beast. I lopped off a hunk on each end that covered my rear tooth. Then I trimmed back the plastic that clearly wasn&#x27;t doing anything, such as that flap at the back of my front teeth. Once I had this guard fully circumcised, I tested it out. I WAS able to sleep with it without feeling like I was choking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be honest I did wake up one morning with the guard loose and I was chewing on it. I was dreaming I was eating broccoli.</li>
            <li> I was told by my endodontist that I needed a mouth guard at nite because I was clenching my jaw and damaging teeth.  I was to see my regular dentist for a custom made one.  Knowing that would be more than I wanted to pay I tried this over the counter guard first.  I was surprised and pleased at how easy it was to \\&quot;boil and bite\\&quot; to custom fit it.  It&#x27;s a little bulky in the mouth but soft enough to be comfortable.  I adjusted to using it very quickly, in a matter of days.  I would recommend trying this one before paying for a custom one.</li>
            <li> I molded this product as directed, but had issues getting it to fit well.  Even worse is the mouth guard was far too big.  I tried wearing it briefly, but I just couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than a few minutes.  I have a regular night guard that I was trying to replace b/c it is ancient.  However, I have gone back to the old one because the fit is so much better.  To be honest, I want to return it, but do not know their policy.  If it came in a small I might reconsider, but this was too comfortable due to large size.  I don&#x27;t know who it would fit as I consider myself an average size in general.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  Followed the instructions to the letter.  Very poor fit.  Will not be using it because of the poor fit.  Wasted the $20 and just threw the piece of garbage in the trash.  Don&#x27;t waste time or money on this.  Guess I&#x27;ll be going to the dentist for a proper mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time getting it to fit tight enough so it wouldn&#x27;t come loose when I&amp;#34;m sleeping.  I&#x27;m still not totally satisfied with the way it fits but maybe it has to do with my teeth being not perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase.  Does a great job.  Scary what your teeth are going while you are sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have tried to fit the guard four times and it will not stay in my mouth. They offer a replacement if it does not fit, but the fit is so poor from the start that another one would not help! Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Took me a couple of attempts to set it up.  Found it to be uncomfortable to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li> Very good, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I must have tried at least 10 times to try to get a custom fit following the directions.  I was never able to achieve a snug tight fit.  I ended up not using the product because I was afraid it would slip off in my sleep and I would choke on it.  Does NOT work as advertised!</li>
            <li> Boiled it and fit it to my mouth.  It fits well and stays in place.  Just a little bulky which makes it hard to breath out of you mouth at night.</li>
            <li> I am writing from Spain so excuse me if I do not write correctly&lt;br /&gt;The first time I adapted the mouthguard to my mouth I made a mistake, so I had to do it again, on this second occasion I pressed my teeth very hard, and part of the soft material has detached from the base leaving an edge that makes a little damage on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;I guess next time I&#x27;ll do better and the product will fit into my mouth completely fine.</li>
            <li> A little complicated to get the molding right but an ok product. Hasnt fallen out in the middle of the night, but I have ended up taking it out because I stay somewhat awake knowing that its there. LOL For the price, you should try it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions 3 times, after that the night guard was still not fitting.  For larger mouths.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good price as an alternative to custom made dental guard that costs hundreds.  Works well to protect teeth from bruxism (tooth grinding during sleep)</li>
            <li> 3 stars cause its just a mediocre night guard.  Not sure if it was me or the product but i cant sleep with this. I ended up trashing it.</li>
            <li> This was really big for my mouth. It was hard to close my mouth to go to sleep. I tried it for 3 nights and every morning I woke up my back teeth hurt I think from the guard being fit onto my teeth too tight. I was still waking up with a headache and back teeth pain. It was easy to custom fit, but it is too tight. Trying the disposable ones next. This is for upper teeth only I am going to try the new one on my lower teeth</li>
            <li> Best grinding protection you can buy at this price. Durable and confortable, very good fit.</li>
            <li> I have to rate The Doctor&#x27;s  NightGuard a 2, because it doesn&#x27;t protect my four wisdom teeth from the effects of grinding. When I wear it in my upper teeth, it only covers teeth #2 through #15.  The claim of &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; is bogus. This mouth guard doesn&#x27;t fit all! A realistic thing would be to cover all the teeth, including the wisdom teeth!</li>
            <li> It looks great&lt;br /&gt;It came on time.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned the product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to keep my teeth from grinding for several months.  Very sturdy. Boiling then form the guard on my teeth was not difficult.  And considering my dentist wants $300 to make a guard, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart for $20+ tax thinking it was better than a $5 one. Not true AT ALL. You&#x27;d be better off with a sports mouth guard. The size / mass of it simply would not accomadate my apparent large jaw frame. If I tried to use it, I would have probably choked to death on it as it would have slipped out and down my throat. Even if it had fit properly, it&#x27;s so thin and there&#x27;s barely any &#x27;body&#x27; to it, it wouldn&#x27;t have lasted long. $20 in the garbage. It should be labeled as SMALL / MEDIUM at the very least. It comes with a Guaranteed Fit and they will send you another one... that won&#x27;t fit? No thanks.. but they&#x27;re welcome to send me my $20 back. I even kept the receipt.</li>
            <li> Was not able to get a good fit. I purchased this nightguard numerous times, and have been satisfied with them. This newer one is much shallower and does not suction to your teeth as the old ones did. They do not stay in the mouth as well either. The sides billow out a bit and do not conform to your teeth and mouth. I&#x27;m think of trying the athletic mouth guards which are cheaper and do conform to the teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist informed me that I have been grinding my teeth at night. He also wanted to charge me $350 for a custom bite guard. Ummm. No thanks. I immediately did an internet search and found this. You can&#x27;t beat the price with a stick. I followed the instructions to the letter and while still soft, I spent a minute or so pushing it up around my teeth with my fingers for a better fit. When they say use a mirror, they mean it. It was really necessary to see where the bite guard was vis a vis my front teeth to insure proper placement. I wonder if the reviewers who are having issues with fit, didn&#x27;t follow the instructions properly and/or didn&#x27;t use a mirror? Mine fits perfectly and stays in place no problem. Like anything, it might take a little getting used to, but I have to admit it is way more comfortable than I could have ever imagined. After the first night of wearing it, I fully anticipated that I would pull it out in my sleep and find it on the floor. It was still firmly in place in the morning. I can&#x27;t imagine what I would have gotten from my dentist would have been a substantial improvement on this!</li>
            <li> This is for people with very large mouths, in addition, it was difficult to form and heat even following the step by step directions more than once.</li>
            <li> I think it is much more comfortable and cheaper than the expensive one the Dentist sold me.  Would definately recomend this over the what the dentist sells.</li>
            <li> While this is my third time to purchase, this is an absolutely wonderful product and does the job as it is designed to do. Will most likely be signing up for auto shipping as I&#x27;m very satisfied with each purchase.</li>
            <li> Wow, What a mess.  I did not get the hot-water timing thing down good because the final product was a flabby piece of plastic.  I will have my Doc make me one.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended generic nightguard as an alternative to clinic made ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product comfortable to use, easy to mold (if you follow the instructions) and strong enough for the job.</li>
            <li> Unless you are some sort of space wizard genius you are not going to fit this thing properly. I tried remolding it over and over and it just never wanted to fit right (always kept fitting loose). Might as well just save up for the real thing, as if this thing doesn&#x27;t fit right you will injure your jaw and then you&#x27;re in worse shape than you were before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for over a year now, and it&#x27;s still good, but starting to deteriorate from my regular grinding and clenching in my sleep. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than a custom mouth guard and so I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t fit like a glove. It allows you to mould it to your teeth and for the most part, it&#x27;s pretty easy. The best part is it&#x27;s a lot cheaper here than it is at the drugstore so why not?</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be soft when it comes time to sleep. It&#x27;s something I have to get used to but way better than grinding my teeth. I did notice the next morning no jaw pain or sore teeth. Another thing, there is a slight taste to the mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Not too bulky, but I had to try twice to get the fit.  (Haven&#x27;t had that issue with other similar products.)  Comfortable to wear.  These work much better for me than the flimsy type that has a flexible front.  The latter are comfortable, but don&#x27;t get the job done and I wake with a sore mouth.  This nightguard is much better for me.</li>
            <li> I bought two.  I heated them per the instructions. There was no jell left to make an impression. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this nightguard since it was recommended to cut down on my snoring, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  The instructions were clear-cut and arrived quickly, but unfortunately wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions for fitting and it stays in by itself, and helps with my severe jaw-clenching at night. No more pain/sensitivity in my jaw/back teeth when I wake up. Very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Works well. Fits really well.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a lot of negative reviews with regards to this night guard not fitting properly, or that the night guard doesn&#x27;t help with snoring or sleep apnea.  First off, this night guard is meant to be used by individuals who grind their teeth only.  This guard is not meant to be used for individuals with sleeping conditions like snoring or sleep apnea.  The product is not even advertised towards people with sleeping conditions, so please ignore those negative reviews.  Also, as for the fitting, you have to follow the directions exactly.  If you do not follow each step properly, the night guard will not work as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my own personal experience with this night guard, I followed the directions as instructed, and I was able to fit the night guard perfectly.  It does take a little getting used to, but once you get used to using it, you will sleep comfortably.  The product is meant to last for about 3 months at a time on average.  Considering you can usually find this on Amazon for under $20, it is a good deal and well worth it to protect your teeth from the damage of night grinding.</li>
            <li> Nothing compared to getting a real night guard fitted by the dentist. I tried a few others and feel like I would choke on them in my sleep since they aren&#x27;t secure, or comfortable.</li>
            <li> This soft guard is not good for those who clench their teeth. The softness encourages increased clenching, thus worsening the problem.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Tried pushing my teeth out. Quit after 2 days.</li>
            <li> Its not bulky like other ones and not super thin like its the perfect size and its super easy to mold to your own teeth!</li>
            <li> To keep it simple, I purchased this at a local Walmart, so I have no experience with the sellers or resellers in question. However, I personally regret using this product. In addition to this product making my jaw rather sore after just one night, I fear I may have had a reaction to the plastic after molding it. I noticed a rather nasty flavor, and an odd sort of uncomfortable numbing sensation after about 6 hours. I promptly removed the piece, rinsed my mouth, and have not noticed the symptoms since so I can only presume something about the plastic didn&#x27;t like me or being softened in hot water. If you notice any kind of discomfort or some odd sensations while using this, I&#x27;d sincerely question the product and potentially inquire with your dentist or the company if you should even be using this one. As for me, this is far to expensive to bother trying again, especially considering how sore it made me to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these because I suffer from bruxism,  grinding my teeth.  I used to have the dentist make them but they didn&#x27;t last that long and every time I went to the dentist they changed my bite and I had to get a new one.  The price was staggering.  I now have paid for these night guards.  They last about 6 months and the price is right so I can change them as often as needed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this item when I first started using it, and I&#x27;m still not entirely sold. If you boil set this item ever so slightly wrong it is basically useless. I think I personally set mine a little to close to the front edge and I think my front teeth hang off the edge. It has however relieved some of the jaw pain that I was experiencing each morning from my night grinding, and that has made it worth it.</li>
            <li> The only brand my husband will use. Sleeps with it every night. Best price i have found.</li>
            <li> too hard to fit in my mouth</li>
            <li> Sound product, slightly difficult to boil and adjust. You have to make sure the plastic part is in fully boiling hot water. Also it quite cumbersome to mold it. The result is good though, I have been using mine for 2 months now without any problems, it stays well and prevents grinding.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Did have to re-boil it 4 times to get the bite right but once I did, it was perfect. That is, until my dog decided to break open the provided case and shred it.</li>
            <li> Does not fit and stay in mouth.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to form correctly. I ended up buying a different brand that worked perfectly</li>
            <li> For a person with Trigeminal Neuralgia is a cheap option, and a good option, but is better no wait to late with the problem for get one of this.</li>
            <li> I actually used this for my lower teeth - I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to do that but I did it because I have acid reflux while I&#x27;m sleeping sometimes. I love this mouth guard and it was really easy to mold!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I always spit night guards out, not this one, it works great and doesn&#x27;t take over your mouth!</li>
            <li> So much better than paying the $400 my dentist wanted for a custom night guard.  After wearing this model for 2 years now, it feels weird to sleep without it on the occasional night I forget to put it in.  Perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 9 years ago to keep packed in my travel kit so I wouldn&#x27;t forget to take my mouth guard on a trip or worse yet forget to repack it and bring it home.  But, shortly after I decided to retire my $425 dentist fitted rigid plastic night guard that no longer fit as good and the plastic too rigid for my grinding.&lt;br /&gt;After these 9 years I am finally beginning to wear this one out.  Well, I&#x27;m not sure of that, but I do want to get another one as my teeth as moved and I just want to mould a new one to fit.&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret getting one of these as long as you follow the directions to the T and take your time without distractions.&lt;br /&gt;$425 or $18, hum?</li>
            <li> much too bulky to be comfortable; it made me gag.</li>
            <li> It fits well, works well, and doesn&#x27;t fall out during the night. Also it&#x27;s not as annoying as some others.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this mouth guard. It does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do - protect your teeth from nighttime grinding. The size worked for me once I snipped a little bit of the ends off (though I had to bend it quite a bit to make it fit), but I also have a relatively small mouth. The rubbery texture however seemed to encourage my teeth grinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mouth guard for a little over six months. It was pretty worn down after two or three but I didn&#x27;t have the spare cash to replace it. I only now replaced it with the grindguardn night guard (which I&#x27;ve read many positive reviews about - if you&#x27;re able to spend a little extra, I would recommend looking into it), because I accidentally left it out of it&#x27;s case for a few hours and my dogs chewed it to shreds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a cheap night guard, this little guy does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still snoring.  sigh...  I was really hoping for this to work but there are multiple causes for snoring and I just think people need to see what works for them.  Product may work for other people though so I am putting 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The newer versions of this don&#x27;t have the excess which covers the roof of your mouth. I like that. Also, I like that it has low profile at the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tricky to mold; most guards have a groove in the front to position between your front teeth - this doesn&#x27;t. I had to refit it because I got it off center. I have gone through a lot of guards. This is the 1st one that instructed me to put the guard into boiling water. Also, it is still hot after you have waited the instructed 20 seconds. It is wide at the back teeth (wings). I am 5ft 2in, small frame. It rubs on my inner cheek. I might refit a 3rd time to see if I can smooth it out at the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Dentek is a brand which I use a lot. If you haven&#x27;t tried them, they make several styles.</li>
            <li> I wear a nightguard most nights for teeth grinding. I had paid for a dentist-made $500 out-of-pocket one a few years ago (insurance doesn&#x27;t cover these usually), but it snapped in half when I was cleaning it....seriously. I was so mad. So now I&#x27;m back to using these temporary guards. If you haven&#x27;t used one in 3-4 years, try it again: they&#x27;re slimmer and don&#x27;t feel like a football teeth guard anymore. They last me about a year, and at this price it&#x27;ll take many many years before I reach $500. And they don&#x27;t snap in half.</li>
            <li> just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Good product you might have to remold it a couple of times to get a comfortable fit good price compared to drug store prices</li>
            <li> I expected a mouth guard against snoring. This is not it!  I want my money back as I did not use this item.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this over custom protector which would have been expensive and not covered by insurance. I was skeptical about being able to get a good custom fit and more so about being able sleep with this. The custom fitting process is well described and easy to follow (similar to the dozens of mouth guards I&#x27;ve fit my sons with for football). The fitting process takes less than 10 minutes and once complete, the protector goes in and stays in place nicely. After about a week of use, haven&#x27;t had any problem sleeping with it in or having is pop out in the night. Now if it helps with my bruxism as my dentist hopes, all will be well.</li>
            <li> This nightguard is amazing! I forgot the ones I made with my dentist back in my country and bought these just for a momentary replacement. However, I&#x27;ll definitely use it even when I get back home. It is easy to mold into your teeth and very comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t hurt the internal part of your cheeks and allows you to breathe normally with your mouth open.</li>
            <li> This was way too big for my mouth and I could never get it to fit comfortably. Instead of helping with my clenching, after using it for a couple of days my jaw ached and I had other areas of discomfort in my mouth. I stopped using it after about a week.</li>
            <li> Horrible! We followed the directions exactly and it just kept falling out of my husbands mouth. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found these on Amazon! I used to pay $35 at the local Duane Reade! When I saw them for $16 a piece on Amazon I grabbed two. I clench my teeth really badly at night and my jaw started clicking because of it so I absolutely need these to cushion my teeth when I sleep. Be very precise when you shape these to fit your teeth, make sure the front two teeth are at the very edge and after you bite down and suck in use your fingers to further mold the sides. I had one that I didn&#x27;t fit well and it was very uncomfortable... it started yellowing after about six months so I got this new one and fit it so much better! Thank you Amazon for the great price!</li>
            <li> Horrible fit and wouldn&#x27;t mould correctly.</li>
            <li> This might be a great product for someone with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bite but, because I have a mild underbite, with this guard I ended up grinding on my front teeth. When it got to the point where my front teeth started to hurt I realized I needed to switch guards. I went with a Sleep Right guard that has a small band on the front portion of the teeth (doesn&#x27;t wrap all the way around all the teeth - just on the molars) and that worked great.</li>
            <li> Instructions for how to use this product were complicated and had me intimidated.  I finally did it and am satisfied with the fit and the fact that it prevents teeth grinding.  After using this product for a few nights I no longer continually bite my cheek.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item without reading the fine print.  I am/have been a hard core teeth grinder.  This is not for TMJ or people with missing teeth.  I tried to make this work but after fitting it several times, I would wake up in the morning thinking my teeth were going to fall out.  I think the rubbery surface gave my teeth an extra grip - instead of my teeth sliding over slick surfaces.</li>
            <li> I am a major night \\&quot;Clencher\\&quot; and often awake to sore jaws and tooth pain. I&#x27;ve used several other night guards that I have picked up at Target or a drugstore and so far, this is my favorite. It was quite easy to fit and seems much less irritating than others I have tried. Also, there seems to be less of it in general so it is more comfortable, in my opinion. I haven&#x27;t found it to fall out or have any problems really. I would definitely buy this again (and likely will when the current one starts to wear).</li>
            <li> Eh. You get what you pay for. It barely fits and does NOT stay in properly, I can&#x27;t sleep with it in cause it&#x27;s particularly choke-on-able and even though I followed the instructions to the absolute letter, even though I tried it 3 times in about 30 minutes (which it clearly states you can do by re-boiling and re-molding if the first fit isn&#x27;t great) it STILL doesnt fit properly. I have a fairly regular bite with no gaps and I&#x27;ve never had braces. I would recommend it for someone who hasn&#x27;t much money. only grinds a little or only when they&#x27;re awake (eg: while using a computer) or anyone who has a special shaped bite I guess. Not bad, not great, 3 stars.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I found that the bonding a type of velcro no longer would hold the upper and lower gaurds together. Therefore defeating its purpose when sleeping.</li>
            <li> i have used tons of similar ones, even had the 900 doctor one and this is just as good, save your money and follow the directions, you will love this, takes a few nights to break it in but its good</li>
            <li> It might of worked, had it fit. I heated it and remolded it over and over, but it just couldn&#x27;t cover my wisdom teeth in the back. Without those babies covered, there was a distinct amount of pressure that they took on during a night of bruxism, which led to a very painful outcome in the morning. I don&#x27;t know what else to do  but cave into the dentist&#x27;s 500$ plastic guard.</li>
            <li> I have central and obstructive sleep apnea. I am told sleep apnea patients grind their teeth when sleeping and that, for me, resulted in chips in my teeth.  My dentist recommended this product and I have been using it for three weeks.  The only possible concern may be its longevity.  I am signed up for a replacement every three months and I am now wondering if this product will last that long.</li>
            <li> When we followed the instructions to mold it for my husband&#x27;s mouth, it did not work and had to be returned.</li>
            <li> Did not stop the snoring and it&#x27;s not that great for grinding teeth. My migrain was horrible...... I would like a softer mouth piece.</li>
            <li> it prevents my teeth from looking more rotten at the bottom front. I recommenf thid to a friend who grinds their teeth and or have teeth athat are a little rotton in the front.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be cumbersome and uncomfortable. So easy to custom fit.  No more noisy teeth grinding. My teeth are safe and my destist approves.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased this dental guard thinking it was the same as my existing one.  It was similar, but definitely wasn&#x27;t the same.  It&#x27;s easy to mold, but the guard seems too wide for my mouth; the front also has a very low profile which makes it difficult to fit well. It took a couple  nights before I could sleep though the night with it in and when I did I woke up with a lot of irritation from it--on my tongue of all places.  It doesn&#x27;t have a good enough fit for me to keep wearing and it actually felt like my teeth were being pushed. Having had braces in the past I definitely don&#x27;t want to risk my teeth being moved. Now my jaw hurts and I have to search for something new.  This product may work better for someone with a wider mouth.</li>
            <li> Despite following the directions very carefully, I could not get a good fit. They promptly returned my money. I have a smallish mouth and perhaps a one-fits-all product is not for me.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided it was worth a try for the money.  Followed the directions and after a week of use I couldn&#x27;t be happier and to think my dentist wanted me to have one made for about $600!  I know it may not work for everyone but you won&#x27;t know unless you try.</li>
            <li> The lack of a front lip makes it hard to fit. It&#x27;s too bulky as compared to the one you get in the dentists office and thinner too I bit through it on first night.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the use of this product altered my bite over a protracted period of use.  So much so that my upper teeth shifted and chewed into my tongue. This experience was one of the most horrible I have ever had to experience in my life.  In my opinion the rigidity of this night guard is like having corrective braces except they cause an alteration to the bite that is detrimental.  It also reminds me of the process of Invisalog except it is not being done by a dentist who knows how to realign your teeth.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one before getting a custom one from my dentist.  It&#x27;s too bulky, tight, and I could never get it to work correctly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I know that your dentist mouth guard is much more expensive but the cost can always be negotiated and you will get a custom fit product and most dentist will adjust them as many times are necessary.</li>
            <li> very very good I recommend</li>
            <li> you may have to remold it as many suggested. you just have to reheat and then after fitting to your teeth, take it out and squeeze the side a little to make it fit more snug.</li>
            <li> Works great but needs to be replaced often. The plastic is not very heavy so it wears out quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Fits so nice and very easy to use!!!!! I will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Too big</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I was very careful to follow the molding directs to the second, as advised elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son.  He said that it causes him to salivate a lot and that makes it hard to sleep.</li>
            <li> I must have a tricky mouth to find a dental guard for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions as precisely as I could, but just couldn&#x27;t get this to work out. The end product was still too bulky for my mouth. I kept waking up with dry mouth due to me not being able to close my mouth all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other issues I&#x27;ve experienced is aching teeth and they now feel off in alignment. I can no longer bite down comfortably even when I&#x27;ve removed the dental guard. It&#x27;s saddening to not know if this issue will correct itself over time. I&#x27;ve always had a perfect bite until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose there&#x27;s still the possibility of user-error, but I stand by my review. I followed directions precisely and even bought a second one thinking I didn&#x27;t mold the plastic enough around my teeth. It was still problematic.</li>
            <li> Nice fit. Comfortable to wear at night. Does exactly what it is intended to do. Prevent night time clenching and teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I like that I could mold it myself.  It was easy to mold and fits my mouth without falling out.  I feel like it is a bit &#x27;gummy&#x27; and squishy, which can cause more problems with clenching, however I feel it has helped relax my jaw.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it came up when I searched \\&quot;stop snoring.\\&quot; Well, it doesn&#x27;t work for that purpose. May be fine for other needs. I hate giving a poor review, but for snoring it was a waste of money. And extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product. The mouth guard is so big and I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth. It is so hard!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, everything I had hoped for.  A few years ago, I had a dentist provide a made-to-order  mouth guard and it did not fit correctly and was quite uncomfortable.  It cost $300 and I rarely used it due to the discomfort.  The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced is easily and quickly fitted exactly to my mouth, directions are clear and concise, and I am able to use it every night without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> Would not stay in mouth.. Tried several times, kept falling out.</li>
            <li> I personally could not wear this.</li>
            <li> My Dentist told me, this is the best guard on the market, without him making one. This really must be heated in hot water for a good fit, it took me two tries and I got a good fit. This is not made for sports, it tells you that. Simple directions but, must be heated longer. It works and for the price, $19.00 from Amazon vs. $300.00 from the dentist, it works for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, mold, fit.  With proper maintenance I used one for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this over getting sold at the dentist.  Plus, you&#x27;ll be less likely to kill the dog after it chews up the cheaper version.</li>
            <li> The directions aren&#x27;t so clear on this, but it&#x27;s like a basic mouthpiece you would use for athletics, with a harder bottom. The price here is about half of what you find at Walmart, so for that it is great.</li>
            <li> I tried to get the gel to soften but it took a few times and the guard still doesn&#x27;t fit well. Chunky and messy.</li>
            <li> This product is really bad. It does not do at all what it is suppose to. This is the second one I had, both had the same issue: break and get holes. It does never fit the mouth as it is supposed to....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst product ever.</li>
            <li> After molding and remolding, this night guard is quite large and uncomfortale. This is the first I&#x27;ve tried, but couldn&#x27;t imagine having to wear each night. It&#x27;s easy to mold, but the bottom, hard layer is rigid and uncomfortable, especially for a small mouth. It&#x27;s difficult to close your mouth all the way and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d be slobbering all night. It says it will send a new one if not satisfied to retry, but I&#x27;d rather just get my money back.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night which causes severe neck and head aches upon waking and this was the cheap alternative to getting a professional mouth guard made. The directions are simple and easy to follow. Unfortunately I purchased this product once a couple years ago and it wasn&#x27;t very comfortable. It sat too high near my back teeth and hurt my jaw. I decided to try it again and made sure to clench extremely hard while it was in the molding phase. The product now feels a lot better and keeps me from clenching my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lost now but I loved it... how much for another one?</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the one from the dentist&#x27;s office (well over $450.00), so this was a nice alternative.  I will be purchasing another in the near future, to keep just in case I lose the current one I have. All in all, a great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband. they didn&#x27;t stay in and didn&#x27;t stop his snoring at all. don&#x27;t bother buying</li>
            <li> I am a major jaw clencher and grinder, and needed a replacement for my $500 mouthguard after my dogs ate it. This nightguard is NOT the answer. It is difficult to fit, and a non-professional fit affects your jaw position causing pain and additional grinding. It is better to go without a guard than to use this one. It also caused a weird itching and swelling in my gums and lips, so it may not be a good idea for those with latex allergies (although I don&#x27;t know if it has latex in it?).</li>
            <li> This mouth guard is too thick/big. The same problem I have with every mouth guard I have tried. I just want something between my teeth so I don&#x27;t grind them when I sleep. It is too big and my lips do not close completely when I have it in. So feels very unnatural and also makes me drool. I guess I just have to continue searching for a mouth guard that is thinner.</li>
            <li> I can go through mouth guards like It&#x27;s my job. This is the only one I have found that I don&#x27;t grins through in a few weeks. Great alternative for someone like myself who cannot afford one made by a professional. Fits great and very comfy. Directions are clear and easy to follow to mold to mouth.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions, but didn&#x27;t fit very well.  It is better than spending $500 for a dentist to do the job more accurately.  Now, it just sits in the container that it came with.</li>
            <li> I have severe TMJ to the point that I could no longer eat without clicking, pain and dislocation of my jaw, right side. My dentist suggested I try the Doctor&#x27;s Night guard but I was worried because after talking to many people the number one complaint with mouth guards is excessive night drooling and the bulky feel. After following the instructions, I was able to mold the mouth guard to my teeth and use it, without the night drooling. Initially, it felt big but after the first night, the palate part of the guard molded to the shape of the roof of my mouth. Well, it&#x27;s been four weeks, using it every night, I have no pain, no clicking and eating has been a joy. This mouth guard has given me back my life. The good news was Amazon has the guard at half the price. CVS charges $35.00 for one. So if you have TMJ use this guard. I almost went for surgery on my jaw!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee</li>
            <li> We used a $500 night guard from the dentist for our daughter. It did not fit; it moved her teeth; repeat visits did not resolve anything -- the bottom line is that it ended up unused and a real waste of money. For $25, you get the same product. Drop it in boiling water; let cool; insert to mold and wear. It fell out the first night (getting used to it), but after that, no problem. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do (protects against nighttime grinding) and it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but I hate retainers.  I wore a dental retainer/nightguard when young and couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth.  Maybe things have changed in the dental world and they make the outrageously expensive ones better now, i don&#x27;t know.  But I am very thankful to whomever made this because I have no dental insurance and it stays in my mouth at night.  Really great that you can mold it to your teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t stick to my mouth though at night, it ends up in the middle of my teeth, but in any case its effective and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This was fine for the first 5-6 days, but the form became loose and allowed for movement, which rendered the unit ineffective. Definitely not intended to last more than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Caused a lot of jaw pain/dislocation. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice.  I have now spent 60.00 dollars and it is horrible and doesn&#x27;t work.  I feel totally ripped off. I&#x27;ve tried twice to complain on their own website and it goes to a blank screen.  It&#x27;s a scam and a rip off and has no customer service backup at all.  Very unhappy to say the least.</li>
            <li> I found these to be too thick. It was really difficult for me to get used too. I stumbled upon the Oral B brand of night guard and found theres to be smaller and a bit easier to set and quicker to set up then the Doctor&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I purchased a large Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard and it fit perfectly.  This &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; is inaccurate, it looks like it&#x27;s for a child when compared to the large one (same brand) that was purchased before.  Typical, pay more &amp; get less.</li>
            <li> The best mouthguards out there, and I&#x27;ve tried a few. Can easily last a good year if not longer for me, and I grind my teeth hard. Dog unfortunately has developed a taste for chewing these up, but I&#x27;ve gone back and re-bought these each time.</li>
            <li> Other night guards I have tried always fall out of my mouth in the middle of the night but this one fits firmly and doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Admitedly, I have not tried that many semi-permanent guard, but the reasons I like this one are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is no extra material in the front, so it is not uncomfortable on the inside of the upper lip&lt;br /&gt;- The isntructions are very detailed and accurate&lt;br /&gt;- I LOVE that the bottom of the guard is of a harder material, so there is not molding taking place underneath. Thad had been a problem with one I had used previously&lt;br /&gt;- It fits well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the temporary tiny ones from \\&quot;Plackers\\&quot; but found that they did not really provide enough coverage and I still had contact with some of the teeth. For temporary use, these might be fine. But I like the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s\\&quot; one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004TD23W2 Plackers Mouth Guard Grind Night]]</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and effective in stopping me from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product. Better than spending $600 for a bite guard from the dentist. I can buy about 30 of these for that price and they do the same thing. Just need to get the fit right, but the company guarantees that so there is no risk if you mess it up.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Maybe for some people, they work okay, but I had difficulty getting them fitted for my teeth after&lt;br /&gt;following the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, fit was uncomfortable, but that may be a matter of personal expectations.  Overall product seemed to be well made.</li>
            <li> i followed the directions to the t. those night guards do not work!  i returned them.</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s custom made night guard costs $660.  I decided to try this before I spend the big bucks. This one is a fraction of the cost and works great.  It took me about 10 minutes to follow the instructions and get it fitted.  It fits snug and never falls off at night.  I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, and you are suppose to replace it after it starts to show cracks anyway. Great and inexpensive product, easy to use.  Does not have any chemical or latex smell at all.</li>
            <li> Works as well as professionally made guard from the dentist at a fraction of the price.  I keep this one in my travel bag and use the dentist one at home.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to mold this mouthpiece... but I just couldn&#x27;t ever keep it in throughout the night.  It seemed like I always managed to spit it out within an hour of falling asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the directions, you can mold this into a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> By the second fitting, I was ready to throw in the towel and chalk this up to another bad purchase.  The third time when the indents did not disappear, I just placed it back in my mouth and this time it did not make me gag and I could lay my head back without a problem.  I may be sleeping less deeply but from the indents on my tongue in the morning, I KNOW that this night guard saved my teeth and my jaw from another round of gnashing.  *Sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: when it comes to bruxis, take note if you are experiencing inexplicable gum erosion and need root canals for shattered teeth - one of my molars just lost a huge chunk.  I now realize that these were all signs of bruxis but my dentist did not mention that he noticed I was grinding my teeth until after the second expensive root canal.  He said there was nothing he could do for my gum erosion but that eventually I would need more root canals - you can get web membranes applied to cover the eroded part of the gum line to at least spare yourself some pain.  The next dentist did not want to do anything either except offer a custom nightguard.  What is going on with people these days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA2:  I just purchased my second and third ones - I mangled the first one and I hope I didn&#x27;t swallow some of the bits because where does it go when I practically devour this thing in my sleep.  I am going to try and double up.  I&#x27;ve seen toothless people and I don&#x27;t want to be one.  I want to keep all my original teeth like my grandmother who had all of them intact and lived past a hundred (lost count).</li>
            <li> after molding it for the second attempt, and biting it strong for a minute, the thinner part (the corner of the mouth guard) broke and already got a hole. it didnt fit well at all anyway but it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of other reviews on this night guard before deciding to purchase it. I honestly did not have any trouble fitting the mouth guard like some other reviewers commented. I followed the instructions EXACTLY, and the fit was just right. Maybe other reviewers just did their own thing and didn&#x27;t follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has definitely helped with my night grinding. I used to wake up and continue to clench my jaw and grind my teeth during the morning, probably because I had been doing it all night. Now I wake up and notice that I&#x27;m not clenching or grinding while I&#x27;m awake. Does make my teeth feel a little funny in the morning, that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars. That feeling goes away during the day though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks now that I&#x27;ve been wearing this guard. It is still holding up fairly well and doing its job. Sure beats the $800 estimate my dentist have me for a night guard that does the same thing. Great product and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when there&#x27;s too much stress in work. I grind my teeth in sleep. I don&#x27;t want to destroy my teeth prematurely so I bought this one and it definitely helped solve my problem. It did not stop the grinding but it protects my teeth.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get a really good fit. Sleeping with it felt a little strange at first, but I got used to it quickly. A good value.</li>
            <li> This works great but I struggle to sleep and it is often on my pillow when I wake up in the morning. My dentist recommended I get it as I was grinding my teeth but I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be effective if it won&#x27;t stay in my mouth!</li>
            <li> Works well, using it often prevents me from waking up to migraines because of grinding my teeth all night.</li>
            <li> too big, doesn&#x27;t mold well</li>
            <li> It is very good quality. It is every bit as good as the one I had made at the dentist, and the price was so much better.</li>
            <li> To begin, the guard when I opened it looked dirty to me so I cleaned it really well before I did anything with it. When shaping the products to fit my teeth, I followed the directions and the product did lock onto my teeth- but my jaw was hurting bad after the process was over because you have to bite so hard. I wore it at night and it fits so awkwardly in my mouth it makes my jaw feel tired, keeps me awake, and when I do fall asleep I spit it out during some point of the night.  There are others out there that fit and work much better for me than this one.</li>
            <li> Had a custom guard and it gradually became worn around edges then dropped onto tile floor and broke into 2 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;I got this to try and love it. Placed in boiling water few seconds then into my mouth to bite down and fit on my bottom teeth. I will purchase again when I need another.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this product is because my dentist recently told me I am badly grinding my teeth. He wanted to charge me 400 dollars (!!!) for a night guard. I kindly rejected that and one of the assistants told me to order this product and that it was the same thing...well she was right! This saved 380 dollars and a trip to the dentist! It molded and fit perfectly on the first try. I was very nervous because the whole time I thought I was doing something wrong but as long as you follow the instructions exactly that it comes with I don&#x27;t believe you should have any issues. The guard has a gel layer that molds to the top row of your teeth and stays there no matter what. That keeps you from accidentally swallowing it or having to wear one on the bottom. The bottom layer is a hard plastic like substance that protects your teeth from actually grinding. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable or at least not annoying enough to wear I can&#x27;t sleep. I really don&#x27;t mind it! It comes with a case to store it in that has vents to prevent mold growth. I also should mention I have a glued on retainer on the back of all my teeth because I use to have braces. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this guard and I would absolutely recommend this to any of my friends!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work, but it does.  It takes a little getting used to.  After a few weeks, it has gotten more comfortable</li>
            <li> The box I purchased online was at least half of what I would have paid at a pharmacy, so that was good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boiling process that you have to go through, however, I didn&#x27;t get quite right at first.&lt;br /&gt;I bit down but couldn&#x27;t mold the material up to the top of my teeth/gum line in the front.&lt;br /&gt;The product says that you can wait for it to cool down a bit, form it into the way it was when you got it, and try again.&lt;br /&gt;-- if it&#x27;s your first time, it&#x27;s very hard to remember exactly what the product looked like when you took it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several times, made a whole mess of it. I ended up going to the pharmacy to buy one that didn&#x27;t require boiling.</li>
            <li> My wife tried a plastic slim design before she got this one. The &amp;#34;No need to boil&amp;#34; plastic version caused sores along the cheek and was uncomfortable. This Night Guard fits her perfectly since it&#x27;s her teeth making the mold and it doesn&#x27;t cause much discomfort. Like a mouthguard, she has her front lips pushed out as it fits around her teeth but after a few nights she doesn&#x27;t even notice the sensation as she falls asleep.</li>
            <li> Use this as my bite guard when I&#x27;m sleeping instead of buying a $300+ bite guard from the dentist. The process to&lt;br /&gt;mold it seems simple and does what it is supposed to. Does feel a bit big in the mouth but it may just be the terrible job I did at molding it to my teeth since I was in a hurry. Will order anther one in the future and take my time with it.</li>
            <li> It helps so you don&#x27;t grind your teeth however you can still clench which is just as hard on your gums &amp; jaw.</li>
            <li> Works as stated just wondering if i grind more with this thing in.. ehh who knows at least its protection.</li>
            <li> I used to get my bruxism nightguards from the dentist for $750 each. For twelve year I&#x27;ve been using store bought nightguards. As I recall, this brand and others used to include two nightguards. Guess the economy and the bottomline forced the switch. It is small at front while for back teeth, it is large. But it works well and one always change the shape using hot water.</li>
            <li> Too big for my mouth. No smaller size.</li>
            <li> I have TMJ problems and this is the only product that has worked for me.  I have tried other mouth guards but nothing has worked like this.</li>
            <li> I tried other mouth guards, but this one is by far the best.  Follow the directions for fitting.  It&#x27;s expensive but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these for the last 5 years (got a new one cuz a pet destroyed it). They last a long time, almost impossible to bite through and are easily customized. I had to cut mine like a J cuz of the shape of my teeth/mouth, it was easy to do. Oh, and the dentist charged $110.00, and I bit through that one in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> so awful.  I hated this.  i did everything the directions said,. however my mouth is small and I hated how i could barely breath</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had night bruxism for about 15 years. My first attempt to remedy this was by getting a custom made night guard from the dentist. I was able to eventually chew through it and decided that the few hundred dollars spent is not worth it, although I was told there is a stronger material they could have given me (which is something they should have offered to begin with.) I find Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard to be comparable to the more expensive custom fitted ones at the dentist office. The problem is your teeth will shift regardless with constant chewing at night, but this may save you money on cracked and worn down molars. I can&#x27;t comment on the fit since it appears to be a one size fits all and it works fine for me. There is a portion on the end that you can cut off it&#x27;s too long. It&#x27;s made to fit the upper teeth for those who are unaware of this malady. I say give this one a try since Amazon&#x27;s price is around 10 bucks cheaper than others.</li>
            <li> Amazon definitely has the best price on this.  I was told I was a grinder a long time ago and since insurance doesnt pay for a night guard I tried this.  (I did buy my first two from the dentist.. about $350 each.)  After they made a few improvements these are now Great!  THey last  a long time and fit great.  I save a ton of money and will continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t mold to my teeth. Waste of money. No wonder the real thing costs over $300! Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. I have a small mouth--dentists comment on it, and always prompt me to open wider when I can&#x27;t. I think if you also have this issue, you might want to steer clear of this product. It was much too wide and fit poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t close enough to my teeth in the front; my lips had to extend out and over it in order to close. I felt like a camel, but I could have dealt with that. It was also too wide (not too long--I didn&#x27;t feel the need to trim the length). Uncomfortably so. My cheeks were puffed out and I had a hard time closing my mouth. Basically, I had to clamp my jaw shut (defeating the purpose, for sure) in order to keep from drooling on myself and to keep it from falling out, which it did the first night I used it. There wasn&#x27;t enough height to keep it nestled on to my top teeth, even though I know I couldn&#x27;t have gotten a much closer fit from the inner, malleable material. The second and final night I used it, I woke up in pain with the feeling that my front teeth were being pushed backwards and were going to fall out of my gums. It was legitimate discomfort, not just a dream, though. I&#x27;m a rational person and I can&#x27;t even make myself try it again.</li>
            <li> I was able to follow the instructions for fitting easily enough, but it&#x27;s just too uncomfortable to wear. I&#x27;m going to save my money and get a custom one from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many a nightguard, and this one is the easiest to form, and the most comfortable when wearing! My headaches are minimal with it&#x27;s use and that&#x27;s all a migraine prone girl could ask for. ;)</li>
            <li> really hard to get it to fit to your teeth and then be able to sleep with it.</li>
            <li> I have not had any success in the 3 times I have tried to shape this to fit my mouth. I have a small mouth and no matter how I mold this device, it is just too large. I will never use it so I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost me much.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for those of you who grind your teeth at night.  The instructions are easy, but ensure you follow them step-by-step.  One missed step will ruin the shaping of this guard.  It is definitely easy and I highly recommend.  Amazon has it cheaper than WalMart, last I checked.</li>
            <li> I followed the procedure for molding exactly and it did not work. A second attempt led to no improvement as it was still very loose and there was no chance it would stay in while I was asleep. I bought [[ASIN:B008YEMVSI DenTek Professional Fit Dental Guard Maximum Protection For Nighttime Teeth Grinding (Bruxism) With 1-year Protection Guarantee]] instead and was able to mold this easily. It fits well and remains in place overnight.</li>
            <li> Nightguard worked as I expected, used it and still in use, just great cost is little high&lt;br /&gt;The package is too fancy should have two or three in one such package for the&lt;br /&gt;money or slightly more.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I spent hundred of dollars on fancy smancy guards. All of them had their problems.&lt;br /&gt;this one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is much better than the original in two ways. The plastic is thicker and thinner where it needs to be as opposed to the original that had uniform thickness. It also alleviates the front rim on the top where I would grind the most and it stopped me from having bleeding gums and teeth that were moving.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of guards out there, this is the only one that worked for me. It is relatively affordable so I recommend getting  2 sizes and 2 units. As others have noted it is not quite easy to fit, so you will most likely ruin the first one learning. And I got a large and it was huge, so medium actually worked best for me. I am 6 foot and 250lbs with a fairly large mouth.</li>
            <li> Every time I have used this I woke up with my jaw tight and stiff and was in pain the entire next day. I used it a few times thinking I had to get used to it....NO. So terrible. The idea might be good but only a certain part of the guard is moldable to your mouth. I have a pretty small mouth and it still seemed to be a bit small. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> For ten years I used a night guard, for which I had paid my dentist $400. A few days ago I started using one of these. It is as good or better. But whether it will hold up 10+ years is anybody&#x27;s guess.</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of nightguard before even though my dentist always recommended that I did. This is actually the first nightguard I ordered after reading all the reviews. The delivery was very fast. I followed the instruction step by step on how to make one that fits exactly onto your teeth and the night guard turned out to a perfect fit. Now I&#x27;m using it every night and do not feel uncomfortable at all. I would highly recommend this product and will order it again if my current one needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Giving this a 3, my wife had quite a bit of trouble getting this formed to her teeth...took 3 tries to get one to a point it would stay in place at night.  We&#x27;ve tried another one from Amazon that comes with a plastic tray to aid in fitting it to ones mouth and that one has been far easier to get working though it has had its problems as well.  Time will tell how this holds up now that it fits properly.</li>
            <li> inexpensive and effective. essential if you grind your teeth at night. recommend.</li>
            <li> My initial review said this:  after 3 tries of molding this, I could not get it to fit.  It seems from the reviews that it works great for some people &amp; doesn&#x27;t work for other people.  Caveat emptor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I went back to the product after a few days &amp; found out that w/the heat of my mouth - it molded in &amp; fit fine.  It has done wonders for my problems overall.  I took it to my dentist today &amp; he said it was the best OTC night guard he&#x27;s seen.  The hygenist also said it was very similar to a custom one.  They are content to let me use this one instead of getting a custom one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do think that some videos of how to fit the product would be extremely helpful.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t throw it out after it didn&#x27;t seem to work at first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grind my teeth as much as I clench them and wake up with a horrible headache because of it. These are super comfortable, not noticeable while sleeping and just big enough to make me not clench my teeth in the night. The few times I&#x27;ve woken up in the middle of the night, I&#x27;ve found a comfy cushion that has stopped the pain from clenching my teeth. This product was super easy to mold correctly and produces a great \\&quot;seal\\&quot; to my teeth. I don&#x27;t ever feel like its going to come loose unwanted and its just big enough to not worry about swallowing it if it were to come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product on sale at Rite Aid for $36 down from $44 but paid just a tad over $20 with shipping on Amazon (new of course) and had it in just a few days. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a night guard for my bruxism from TMJ. I gave this product a try and it works great. My teeth are no longer grinding at night and my jaw feels a little bit better in the morning. This saves me thousands of dollars on crown replacements and root canals, not to mention just plain keeping my own teeth. I also had to cut it down a little more and use a lighter to soften hard areas, but it works great.</li>
            <li> This one is great. Better than the old model, as it&#x27;s thinner. The front has been redesigned also and is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Could have used better instructions; had to repeat sizing procedure.  End result seemed iffy, but it works .  Priced appropriately.</li>
            <li> I have bought this nightgaurd before and i love it. i not only clench my jaw at night i also grind. i cannot sleep without it now.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to get the right fit and used the guard for one night.  I woke up with horrible jaw pain so I must have an issue that I am not aware of in my jaw.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I clench my teeth at night and I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on one from the dentist.  This nightguard is really thick and clunky. My jaw hurt for the entire day after wearing it overnight.  A friend hygentist told me to stop using it immediately.  I ended up going with the professional night guard from the dentist.  It was expensive, but worth the comfort.</li>
            <li> Did not bond to my teeth.  Difficult to form .  Unsatisfactory for my needs.  Wanted it to deduce snoring.  May try to reform it but it is a tedious procedure.</li>
            <li> Reasonable and lasting quality. Developing it was not too much of a problem, however I did have to reheat it once or twice. However slightly painful to wear over-night.</li>
            <li> After trying two other night guards, I almost gave up.  My dentist recommended this.  Way less bulky, and far more comfortable.</li>
            <li> You really have to be an expert to get it to just the right temperature before it shrivels up in a useless, hard space ball,</li>
            <li> talk about a waste of money!! doesnt mold easy &amp; even then wont fit well, especially with the front teeth..I had always used Dentek &amp; it is great but my store didnt have it so thought would try this one, all its good for is the trash, is a piece of junk!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete scam,even if you are a dentist I could almost guarantee no success on getting it done right.People in congress should try it and would see it&#x27;s a ponzi scheme.You better off giving The Doctor&#x27;s Guard company $20.00 dlls and forget about it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I clench my teeth when I sleep and my dentist said I should get one. Its way to big for my mouth and doesn&#x27;t fit well at all. I would wake up with a sore jaw far worse then when I don&#x27;t wear it</li>
            <li> Unbelievably low price for a great product.  I got it at first try and it fit comfortably the first night.  I think the reason for good and bad reviews is the wide range of sizes of people&#x27;s mouth.  This product may be great for some but not so great for others.  This product only cost $17, instead of paying your dentist $600, why not try it?</li>
            <li> I found this product easy to use and very effective. However, it is bulkier than custom fit night guard so ultimately I still prefer a custom fit night guard but this is a great product for the price point.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this works like it should.  It stays in place and kind of &#x27;sticks&#x27; to my upper teeth like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Good instructions on how to fit it, and they say you can get another one free if you screw up the process of heating it up and fitting it...</li>
            <li> good mouth guard ...But a little pricey...</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It fits my mouth well so it does not fall&lt;br /&gt;out and gets lost.</li>
            <li> It was stated that this product was used to help alleviated SNORING! When it arrived the package states it is used to protect teeth. To help eliminate night time teeth grinding. Will ask for my money back!!!</li>
            <li> These are great, just great! I have a small mouth and I grind my teeth while I sleep, this is the perfect solution! It molds perfectly to my mouth and lasts for months as long as you keep it clean.</li>
            <li> it works its new came quick  e. i am using words to take up spacee. i am using words to take up space</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to the T and am still not very satisfied with the fit. It may just be me, but it is too uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a snore guard not grinding guard.  This shouldn&#x27;t be categorized with snoring appliances. I saw doctors nightguard and was instantly hooked cause this is something I was willing to try to help stop my snoring.  But it is not made for what I wanted and now have to send it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a dentist made mouth guard broke on me after ~1 year or less of use.  That was ~$500.  This device molds correctly to your teeth and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble sleeping with it either.  I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try since it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost and achieves the same goal.  You do have to follow the directions perfectly or you may run into trouble...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nightguard for about a year now. It&#x27;s fairly thick so for even the most robust chewers out there I imagine it should last a while. The reason I got this over-the-counter product is because I asked my dentist how much it would be for a custom one. He told me $400. That is simply way more than I would be willing to spend, especially for something that is made for wear and tear (and which I will have to replace who knows when).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that my first few nights with this on were REALLY uncomfortable. This thing is huge and I wasn&#x27;t used to a big piece of plastic in my mouth. I think I got used to it in about a week though and now I have no trouble sleeping with it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary: cheap, sturdy alternative to a custom nightguard, but obviously it&#x27;s not as thin and comfortable as a custom fit one. I&#x27;m happy with it though.</li>
            <li> Over my lifetime, I have had several of the expensive custom mouthpieces from my dentists.  When the TMJ pain starts up again years later, the custom jobs won&#x27;t fit as my teeth have drifted a bit or a new crown won&#x27;t fit (if I can find the custom job in the first place).  This item is adjustable and comes with it&#x27;s own little case. I bought the small one by mistake, but it turns out that *was* my jaw size (otherwise I&#x27;m a large person).  It does not &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; out, even though I snore and mouth-breathe at night.  It does not custom fit my teeth, but still does just as good a job as the ones from the dentists.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one, as I lost the first one recently during air travel, and I bought it because the first was working so well.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I must suggest someone who uses this instead of seeing a dentist at all, or where the pain never goes away, should see a dentist at least once to make sure bruxism/TMJ is the correct diagnosis ...</li>
            <li> These are extremely difficult to mold to your teeth, even when following the instructions to a T. Unfortunately the packaging doesn&#x27;t inform you what it should finally look like once properly molded to know if you did it right, and if you are unsure and use it, your teeth end up shifting slightly. Which is what happened to me and i had to go to the dentist to get it fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Better off just paying the extra and getting custom fit ones from your dentist. Less headache, less pain.</li>
            <li> last one lasted forever, great price, easy fit, comfortable, simple</li>
            <li> Fantastic item so easy to use</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product.  My dog ate my $300 bite guard and I tried to use this to save some money.  It is ridiculously hard to fit. I followed the directions, watched videos on YouTube, and spent over an hour trying.  It never happened.  I got it close enough that I was confident I wouldn&#x27;t choke on it in the middle of the night, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. If you are ABSOLUTELY desperate and need something to stop the grinding temporarily, this might work. If you&#x27;re looking for a real solution, go to the dentist and get fitted. I bought another $300 and threw this thing away.</li>
            <li> I like this product! It has helped me with my jaw pain a great deal. Although, if you are an extreme clench-er you may need to have one made from your dentist or orthodontist. These will not last.</li>
            <li> I love this!  Like some others here, I had an expensive dental guard, made by my dentist, and I lost it.  i was not super excited about paying another 300 bucks for another one- so I tried this.  It&#x27;s amazing.  For me, it&#x27;s more comfortable than the one my dentist made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly.  Heated the water for 3 minutes.  Submerged the guard for 2 minutes (timed with a stopwatch function).  Lifted the piece out with a fork, carefully, from the underside.  Placed it on a plate to cool for 20 seconds.  Carefully and quickly lined the guard up with my teeth- paying particular attention to the front teeth- getting them as close to the front of the guard as possible, without going OVER the border of the guard. It fits like a glove.  It really could not be better.  it&#x27;s much less bulky than the one my dentist made for me.  Obviously it feels like I&#x27;ve got something on my teeth, but there&#x27;s very little excess material in the front between the front of my teeth and my lips.  My tongue is comfortable.  It has no yucky taste (as afraid it might have that plastic taste, but it doesn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan.  I&#x27;ll buy this again.  In fact, I think I want some spares on hand, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the storage case.  It&#x27;s nicely made, and will last.  It&#x27;s nicer than the one my dentist gave me (which makes you wonder, &amp;#34;WHY does a dental mouthpiece cost so much?&amp;#34;).  The informative insert suggests you clean your guard with Efferdent- to kill germs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is my favorite.  I had a DenTek one for a while, but the guard separated from the sides after a few weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried generic, store brand ones, and have the same problem.  This product just feels solid... it fits better &amp; more easily than other brands, and I notice it less.  It feels durable--I had one years ago that lasted me for at least 2 years.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement for one made by my dentist. It was very difficult to get this to mold into shape.I tried several times, and eventually, it did get enough shape to finally stay in my mouth in a semi-fitted fashion, although this required much time and work, with several reshapings. However, this is so uncomfortable and bulky that my cheeks actually bulged out slightly on the sides, due to the large width of this mouthguard, there is a hard edge to this guard that stays in a hard U shape, instead of conforming to a natural shape, it bows out a bit. This was so uncomfortable I tried trimming it down, and this did not help. If you have a narrow palate, or are a petite person, don&#x27;t waste your time on this! It was so uncomfortable and bulky. It was impossible to sleep with this mouthguard in.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement of the DenTek Custom Comfort Dental Guard which falls off after they &amp;#34;improved it&amp;#34; by putting slits all over it.  This one holds good, and no more broken teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good. Met the expectations. Easy to fit.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a little tough to get used to it, and sleep the whole night.</li>
            <li> Just too small for a good fit for me. I will be buying the classic instead of this model next time.</li>
            <li> WHY SPWND $500.00 TO HAVE A NIGHT GUARD MADE BY YOUR DENTIST, WHEN THIS WILL DO EXACTLY THE SAME JOB ?</li>
            <li> It is simple to customize the fit. Worked great. It helped during my random grinding while studying. Durable and even works at night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clencher during the night so this has helped save my teeth even though I have had several gumline erosin fillings. This is the best on the market--I wear it every night with out fail.</li>
            <li> I previously tried several nightguards, but this was worst nightguard for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just too bulky for me. I couldn&#x27;t even breathe comfortably with this nightgard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this nightguard is for people who have big mouth.</li>
            <li> It is easy to mold and comfortable.  I have nothing else to compare it with but it seems to be doing the job now.  The dentist wants me to wear a night guard and to have one made professionly his cost was $400.</li>
            <li> The guard is mold-able which is nice but even after trying to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it out I still was sleeping with my mouth open because it was so thick. I was waking up in the middle of the night to take it out and then would start clenching my jaw again. May have to try a doctor created guard.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a $500 night guard so I looked around and found this product for $18.  I liked it so much that my dentist asked me to let him see it because-- in his opinion, it had to be inferior!  But, IMO, this product was absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I do like this nightguard, it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of a dentists and is softer and more comfortable in the mouth,they say they don&#x27;t last as long so i bought two more on sale. I highly recommend this nightguard for overnight grinders.</li>
            <li> Works very well! I boiled it rather than putting it I&#x27;m hot water. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This is a very good alternative to paying 500 bucks for a dentist made mouth guard. I have been using this brand for 5 years now, I cannot go without it. Also, the added benefit is, you can change it every couple mouths, and it will not smell yucky after prolonged usage. When its not 500 bucks, its easier to just throw out.</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li> My package was lost, or something. I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but how should I know? I never got it. :(</li>
            <li> I almost want to suggest getting two of these.  One to practice with and one to actually use.  I had to remold it three times it get it just right.  I do feel that it settles a bit after the mold stiffens.  I made the final mold in the morning and it kin of stayed in place.  But that night it actually was a lot more snug.  I don&#x27;t know if they meant to do that.  Anyway it is saving my teeth.  I didn&#x27;t just get it for the grinding but I&#x27;m trying to alleviate pain with a bad crown that I&#x27;ve been meaning to get fixed.  It&#x27;s worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I have been using these guards for about a year and they are great, I have mastered the fitting process and all I can say is they do what they are supposed to. No more pain, popping, stuck jaws!</li>
            <li> I have had professional night guards and crappy &amp;#34;2 for 1&amp;#34;s bought at CVS, and this night guard has been great. I&#x27;ve been using it almost every night for over a year and can feel my teethe not being so sore in the morning with my grinding. It does need to be cleaned regularly or else starts to get a little ripe (no surprise there), but for the money the quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Good quality materials.  Good thing you can mold and remold since I didn&#x27;t get quite the fight fit the first few times.  Works best if your teeth are pretty straight.  I have one that&#x27;s noticeably crooked and the front edge of it barely fits into the tray, so the mold is very very VERY thin there.  Also, I have an average sized mouth without any wisdom teeth and the back of the trays are barely long enough to fit all my teeth.  My GF who works in a dental office had free custom ones made for me ... these definitely won&#x27;t fit as tight as custom one&#x27;s made at a dentist office which sit right up to my gum-line, but they&#x27;re good enough especially given the tremendous cost savings!</li>
            <li> I found that the guard was too large and thick for my mouth as I have a very small mouth.  I called the 800 number on the package.  Because the product is guaranteed, my money was refunded with absolutely no argument.  I was extremely satisfied with the refund policy even though the product was not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great substitute until you can get a new one.  But it is not as comfortable as the custom job my dentist makes from a mold of my teeth.  But yes, in a pinch, this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> Wife siad it is a little to big</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. The molding was way off once I was done and plastic spilled out on the sides further causing the guard to fit wrong. i may need to just have it professionally fitted. It would have been great to have two for a redo. Second try may have been better.</li>
            <li> I was able to get an adequate fit on the first try, despite the detailed instructions being unclear and almost self-contradictory.  The maker would be well-advised to include a time-line of the heating, cooling, sucking, and pressing steps needed to achieve a good fit.  However, their web site is pitifully primitive and seems to have no means for contacting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the main problem with the device is the soft plastic that sits next to your teeth.  This allows you to fit the device yourself, yes, but it also means that there is a pleasantly chewy object in your mouth all night.  Rather than protecting my teeth from my bruxing, it let me chewing all night in my sleep, waking up each morning with a blinding headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks.</li>
            <li> Worked well, will save my teeth!!</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare to. It was delivered on time, was much cheaper than professional nightguards, but from another side it does not fit my jaw perfectly. So, its&#x27; very uncomfortabel to sleep; I cannot fall asleep with it in my mouth. I prefer to sleep without it even though that I need a nightguard since I am grinding my teeth when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Used it for a while, but just can&#x27;t get used to it...</li>
            <li> This night guard is very tricky to mold. The instructions are not clear, and the quality of the product is bad. Once you fail for the first time, you cannot get it back to the original shape, and then you will for sure to fail in later tries.</li>
            <li> If you look at the cover, it would appear that this is a mouth guard that just fits around the teeth without covering the palate, like what you&#x27;d get at the Dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two huge flaps on the inner part of the guard that press uncomfortably on the upper palate. As someone who has worn retainers for braces and night guards prepared by my dentist, I know how mouth guards are supposed to fit. This does not fit properly, even following their directions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was uncomfortable and actually made me clench my teeth harder to keep it in my mouth. The dentist had suggested one for teeth clenching, but my insurance stopped paying for occlusive night guards and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $450 out of pocket for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to keep this bulky, mis-shaped and poorly sized thing in my mouth, I have to clench my teeth closed, causing aching jaw and negating the purpose of having it. If my mouth opens (like most people does when they&#x27;re sleeping), it falls out or gets out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a well designed mouth guard and the photo on the front is not how the product itself actually looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as described and it does not fit properly.  I also tried many times to refit and it doesn&#x27;t re-mold.  Complete waste of money! Should&#x27;ve put this 20 bucks towards a custom fitting at the dentist.  Buy nice or buy twice!</li>
            <li> I recently started grinding my teeth/clenching at night (stress, I&#x27;m sure of it) and decided to get one of these sexy mouth guards I have heard so much about. The directions were easy to follow and the process was pretty simple, worked just fine without the wooden stick FYI. I think I should have tried to line it up a little better, it sticks out of my mouth a bit causing dry mouth at night. I tried to reshape it following the directions but it didn&#x27;t make a huge difference. My teeth do feel weird in the morning because it doesn&#x27;t reach to my back molars, but I feel much better with it than without, all things considered. I would certainly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I never got this to fit right.  I Followed the instructions exactly and it is still loose.</li>
            <li> guard was easy to fit and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I found the instructions very helpful, but also found that I was happy that I followed them carefully. This is small in size, so it isn&#x27;t bulky like my past mouth guards. I also find that this stays in place on my upper teeth and doesn&#x27;t flop around in my mouth. This is relatively comfortable, and has been an overall great product, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I first thought this product wouldn&#x27;t work. It felt uncomfortable in my mouth during the molding process. But I decided to give it a try and it felt fine at night. I&#x27;m a heavy grinder so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. Also, I used on my lower teeth as others have suggested and seemed to be a good idea.</li>
            <li> hard to make mold...&lt;br /&gt;followed instructions and almost burned my tongue...&lt;br /&gt;not even using it...</li>
            <li> After 5 tries, I gave up. I could not get it pliable enough to adhere around my back teeth. Maybe I got an old package..</li>
            <li> Although I followed the instruction, I failed in my first and second attempt. The night guard is still too hard to bit in my mouth. When it comes to the closest shape of my teeth, it&#x27;s already formed a shaped  from my previous try so the night guard became a bit loose in my mouth. What I can suggest is you should soak the night guard in the hot water until it feels sticky on its side, not just following the time on the instruction. That way you can bite the night guard easier. Overall it still feels comfortable in my mouth when I sleep. But in the morning when I wake up, my teeth is a bit hurt and tense, I want to know is it possible to feel that way?</li>
            <li> The boil and shape method is pretty lame. My mouthpiece ended up getting totally out of shape. It&#x27;s still functional, but it&#x27;s misshapen. My box didn&#x27;t come with any instructions. I had to read online what to do.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and hard</li>
            <li> Used to Grind my teeth. NOT ANYMORE! :) I CAN SLEEP! Amazing what this night guard can do.</li>
            <li> This is my third &amp;#34;Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard and I love them. They last about six months and beat spending over $100matm the dentist office.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a couple of nights, but took it out both times before I fell asleep. I noticed that it was bulky behind my front teeth. My tongue had nowhere to go. Normallly my tongue rests on the back of my top front teeth, but the thickness behind my teeth wouldn&#x27;t let my tongue stretch out enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed that It made me produce more saliva in my mouth as if my mouth thought I had food in it.</li>
            <li> Have tried several similar products , all for same use, and this one is, by far, the best</li>
            <li> First, unless I bought a child&#x27;s size, the thing is very small - it didn&#x27;t cover my last molars completely and I have a small mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you are able to suck air thru your teeth during the molding/hardening process, you deserve a medal.&lt;br /&gt;Third, each morning after wearing for several nights, the sides eventually turned into wings jutting into my cheeks and didn&#x27;t even touch my teeth any more.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to put it in the case one morning, just left it next to the bathroom sink ... I&#x27;d like to thank my cat for playing hockey with it. It is no where to be found, and I can order a different guard that might actually work out.  Love ya Jaxie!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re likely here because your dentist recommended this to you. It works as promised and will keep further damage to teeth, gums, etc due to the grinding.&lt;br /&gt;I have not needed to redo the fitting procedure but the instructions say you can redo it if it goes wrong. You may be nervous at first when it comes to fitting, just follow instructions and it will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember how many years I kept my first one, but it was quite a few. Given the current price it&#x27;s probably a good idea to replace with a new one more frequently. If it&#x27;s worn and looks nasty then replace. I also have a spare in my backpack in case I&#x27;m staying overnight somewhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother. She never used it because it was not intended to help with snoring.  While searching Amazon, she put in \\&quot;snoring aids\\&quot; into the search engine and this item comes up.  It is my own fault for not reading the fine print, but I made an assumption when it popped up in the snore-aid catagory when my mother sent the link to me. I ordered it without double checking it.  Hope this helps others not to make the same mistake</li>
            <li> Not great -- even after fitting it they did not stay in mouth for the whole night, rendering them useless. Went to dentist and got a molding made there instead.</li>
            <li> These mouthguards work the best for me, after trying at least three other brands. They need a lot of trimming to be comfortable, but once they are done, they last awhile. I have started buying two or three at a time and doing all the trimming at once. Only have to do it about once a year that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked great for a month so far, and hasn&#x27;t worn out at all. It&#x27;s not hard plastic like the one&#x27;s you can get custom made from the dentist but I like the soft bit feel.</li>
            <li> I had no problem making the mold of my teeth and it fit perfectly in my small mouth. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my jaw-clenching problems are solved! No more headaches!</li>
            <li> Like most people buying this product, I was looking for a night guard after my dentist said I grind my teeth and quoted me $500 for a custom fit one. I tried a few different products. The major issue I had with the other products is they have a lot of guard material (i.e., thickness) in front of your front teeth, making it impossible to close your mouth. I couldn&#x27;t get comfortable with my mouth propped open all night. This is the best solution I&#x27;ve found for an \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; solution because it doesn&#x27;t have any bulk in the front of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few caveats/thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The molding directions are slightly more complicated than other similar products. I expect this is because the mold is more important and trickier due to the lack of bulk of the guard. It&#x27;s still not bad...read the directions several times before you make your mold. During the process, just stay focused and go through the steps as directed. I&#x27;m pleased with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re making the mold, try to get the outer edges of your teeth near the outer edges of the guard, so the soft squishy material that is being molded tends to go towards the roof of your mouth instead of between your gums and cheeks. This isn&#x27;t a big deal either way, but it&#x27;s the one thing I&#x27;m going to try to do differently if I purchase a second one. The reason I mention it is the extra \\&quot;mold\\&quot; material that is placed on the roof of your mouth while you \\&quot;suck/vacuum/bite\\&quot; in the process makes the guard fit really well and is comfortable. One of my sides is more like this than the other...and the one that&#x27;s less ideal has a little more bulk than I&#x27;d prefer between my cheek and gum that bugs me just a little if I sleep on that side (I like really small profile mouth pieces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m a low level \\&quot;grinder\\&quot; on my teeth. Others have said it&#x27;s too soft and they chewed through it. I can see that if you&#x27;re really tough on mouth guards you might go through this. For me, I&#x27;ve worn it for several weeks and it doesn&#x27;t look any worse for the wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep it clean and sanitary, I toss it in denture cleaner during the day a few times a week.veral weeks and it doesn&#x27;t look any worse for the wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep it clean and sanitary, I toss it in denture cleaner during the day a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Tried it the first night, don&#x27;t think I got set right for my teeth.  Tried fitting again.  2nd night, I tried it again, but couldn&#x27;t sleep well.  3rd night, well, I needed sleep and I haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> The best of this kind</li>
            <li> Until buying this night guard, I couldn&#x27;t find any that actually fit my mouth. (My teeth, actually.) Apparently, my mouth is much larger than the other reviewers&#x27;. It *is* a pain to have to boil it and try to mold it to my teeth, but I&#x27;ve only once had to re-boil it. Fortunately, these tend to last me six months or so, so I can live with some twice-yearly annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if it were cheaper...</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and precise and the fit is excellent. I had some extra practice with these, as my dog thought it was the world&#x27;s best chew toy. Two tips can help a lot in getting a good fit- to make sure the front edge of the guard is as close as possible to the teeth, and to push up hard with your thumbs, as the provided illustration suggests, on the back in order to ensure a good fit that doesn&#x27;t either push out your front lip or keep your mouth agape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist had long recommended a mouth guard, offering one for $400. His receptionist recommended this, and I&#x27;m right grateful.</li>
            <li> it took me a couple of tries but it works fine. I won&#x27;t spend 500 bucks with the dentist again.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to mold.  The instructions seem more complicated than it really is.  But it wasn&#x27;t a perfect fit for my mouth.  Not bad for an over the counter product though...</li>
            <li> This nightguard really helped me to stop grinding my teeth while I sleep.  It was easy to mold and even easier to clean.</li>
            <li> This has been really helpful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and my regular headaches have stopped.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem fitting it. Keep in mind that it is a temporary product; it will wear out after a couple months, but for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this product. I bought a similar product some years ago, when I started grinding my teeth at night. This one is significantly more comfortable. I still think the design could be improved a bit, but it&#x27;s already better than it was. I am able to use it every night and not wake up feeling like I need to throw up. I find this quite acceptable.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s instructions need to be followed to the second or else the mold will not work. I tried several times to get it correct and ended up just throwing it away because of frustration.</li>
            <li> Definitely more comfortable and unobtrusive than most mouthgaurds I&#x27;ve used. For the price, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Does the job &amp; very comfortable</li>
            <li> Good product. A lot cheaper here than any other store.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to buying these from the dentist. These are cheap and work just as well or better. No more grinding and clenching. As long as I use this little baby my TMJ is under control.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this and it has helped a lot with the grinding. Great purchase for anyone with that problem.</li>
            <li> The thing was easy to soften, but I found the guard itself to be too large to fit in and stay in my mouth at night. it comes out several millimeters on the outside of my teeth and i cant close my lips around it. Perhaps this works on larger heads although I&#x27;m not exactly petite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years instead of the too-tight (expensive) permanent one my dentist made. These work and they&#x27;re durable if you soak them in denture cleaning tablets during they day. I know, it&#x27;s a bit weird and it took me a while to figure it out, but it&#x27;s the trick to keeping them clean.</li>
            <li> this is a great product i use it every night, and am really glad i got it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but still bulky.</li>
            <li> Considering that this dental guard is a tiny fraction of the $600 my dentist has been wanting to charge me, I figured I had little to lose trying it. My first thought however upon opening the box was &amp;#34;How is that going to fit my mouth?&amp;#34; It didn&#x27;t come anywhere close to fitting properly &amp; I wondered if the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; really was going to apply here... So if there was ever one time I was going to RTFM, this was it. The instructions go to great length &amp; frequently repeat to follow the steps to the letter. I read the steps through a couple more times to make sure &amp; got everything set up to mold it to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was rewarded by my attention to detail. When I was done, I was pleasantly surprised how well it fit me after going through the process. No discomfort when I have it on yet it securely attaches onto my upper teeth. There&#x27;s no way that it&#x27;s going to come off unexpectedly &amp; it fits like the proverbial glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first time sleeping with a dental guard, I felt like it took a couple of weeks for me to get used to it throughout the night. I still have some minor issues with part of my tongue and/or roof of my mouth suffering from getting dry, but I&#x27;m willing to consider that an idiosyncrasy of my mouth, not a defect of the product. However, without question, while the dental guard doesn&#x27;t cover all of my upper teeth (the back couple of molars on each side are exposed), it&#x27;s not possible to get my back teeth to grind together with the guard on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider this a successful &amp; dramatically cheaper alternative to the product that a dentist would make for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouth guard for grinding teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one from my dentist for $350 and it&lt;br /&gt;never fit right. This is inexpensive, comfortable &amp; it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase:)</li>
            <li> This keeps my teeth in tact and it doesn&#x27;t bother me during the night at all. Best I&#x27;ve found for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well.  This isn&#x27;t the first one I&#x27;ve used.  I wore the others out over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.  I did my best to follow the instructions but it just doesn&#x27;t stay locked in.  This product is worthless.  You will have just as much luck with an athletic mouth guard.  I can&#x27;t believe the drug stores sell this garbage for $30 plus dollars.  If you need a guard that bad, i advise you to get it professionally done at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m revising my review after trying other mouth guards.  This one is the best because it&#x27;s the most minimal.  Not a perfect shape but much better than the sports mouthguards.</li>
            <li> hard to form to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;very thick, keeps mouth open while sleeping.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t expect this to hold up as well as it has. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year, and it&#x27;s still in very good shape. The style took a bit of getting used to (it doesn&#x27;t have a full hard plastic front), but despite the other reviews I read, it fits well, and it stays in place all night. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this nightguard, Followed direction, turned out awful.  Just a waist of money.  What a rip off. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I had used the Doctor&#x27;s band night guard before but needed a replacement. I will admit this one was a little harder to form and I had to re-boil it a few times but I eventually got it to fit perfectly. It&#x27;s thinner that older models so it&#x27;s nice to wear at night and I can sure feel a difference in my jaw if I don&#x27;t wear it for a night or two.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  It seems that the material used is harder now and apears to be a ltitle smaller.  While fitting, I noticed it didnt have as much material to mold to my outer and inside of my teerh.  It fits OK but it&#x27;s not as comfortable. I tried to refit it twice.  I&#x27;m hoping it will get more comfortable as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> But not as comfortable as professionally created night guards by dentists, tho the price is not that much high. so...</li>
            <li> When my dentist told me that I needed a night guard and it was going to cost $500, I decided to research what the fuss was all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspected that there had to be a cheaper (much cheaper) version that worked like my old high school football teeth guards: boil and bite into it for a good fit. Of course, that&#x27;s what this Nightguard is– you boil it, bite into it, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and asked my dentist what the difference between his $500 version and this $17 guard is. His reply– comfort. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it seems to me that trying to sleep with ANYTHING in your mouth is a little weird. I have to say that I am completely comfortable with this $17 piece of plastic. It&#x27;s pretty thin and fits my very teeth well. I honestly can&#x27;t imagine that a moulded guard would make that much of a difference at all. I sleep better knowing that I didn&#x27;t spend $500 for a piece of plastic! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit, good product, holds up!</li>
            <li> I need it to include my front teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t really.  It never really gets hard.  It&#x27;s too big --makes me gag.  There is way too much product left in the middle of your upper mouth.  There is no way to keep this in place in your mouth.  I can&#x27;t imagine what would happen if you could actually manage to keep it in your mouth and fall asleep.  You would wake up choking on it. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many of these to prevent my grinding problem because I didn&#x27;t trust the $600 dentist one. I&#x27;ve been really happy with the product... IF you get the fit right. I have a 50% success rating and retrying isn&#x27;t the same. But when you do get it right, you won&#x27;t sleep the same without it. If you get it wrong, your significant other will complain about your slurping sounds. Still, I like the mix of soft fit with a tougher bottom and switching out every 6 months as they recommend is working well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mouth guards for sleeping, and this is by far the best. Very easy to fit, stays in place, very comfortable, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Really thick and bulky.  Hard to keep in my mouth overnight.</li>
            <li> It was returned...did not live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> Easy to shape and trim. Comfortable. Can&#x27;t sleep without it now. Even my dentist was happy that I started using it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in the mouth after forming it. Rubbed against my cheek and gums during the night. Couldn&#x27;t trim it very well to form</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all.  The instructions on how to fit it were awful and I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Favorite guard and cheaper then in store!</li>
            <li> I love these night guards. They stay in comfortably. Easy to form. Last a long time even though I am a pretty strong grinder at night.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I still find it annoying in my mouth.  I&#x27;ve had to redo the fitting twice to get it right despite following the instructions to the letter.  I also feel, and I can&#x27;t verify this, as though I clench tighter during the night and wake up with a headache.  I also don&#x27;t like the way my teeth feel ever so slightly &amp;#34;shifted&amp;#34; once I&#x27;ve taken it out.  I may end up going the custom route, this just feel too bulky and uncomfortable.  However, it does do the job....</li>
            <li> Got it instead of the NTI recommended by my dentist (it would have cost over $1K), so far so good. Do not delay in replacing (as I did not replace until nearly 5 mo, and the headaches, etc. I had had already come back). Molding it gets easier with practice, but definitely do what the other reviewers said and suck on the piece while biting so the gelly stuff gets pulled up.</li>
            <li> This is my third.  I love them so much, although I have to keep re-purchasing because I somehow lose them.  Make sure to soak after each use with a denture tablet to keep fresh. It fits my small mouth.</li>
            <li> This was a hopeful purchase as I tried this over $12,000 in dental work. Looks like the dentist is going to get a new car. I never could get it hot enough that it formed a really good bond on the top teeth. I used it for a while but it caused a sore mouth a couple of times and I quit. If you are thinking about this product just remember it can only do so much. The $500 ones the dentist makes are probably better. Your choice and good luck.</li>
            <li> Eh this is OK as a temporary stop-gap.  This specific model is VERY THICK compared to a custom mold from a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this as soon as a was able to visit a Dentist for a proper night guard.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be a good fit for me.  I think immersing it in boiling water would have made a better fit, but the instructions didn&#x27;t mcall for that.  It was too narrow for my molars.  I found a much better solution here on Amazon.  Go by reviews and you will find it.</li>
            <li> No instructions for stove top!  Really?!?  Not everyone has or wants a microwave, yet the instructions are ONLY for microwave use.  Lame that I had to find out how to set this up on my own.  They used to include stove top instructions-- big screw up to remove them.  Switch to the other brands.</li>
            <li> Good product: fit and comfort pretty good. Not quite up there with the custom one from the dentist that this was intended to replace, hence only 4 stars. But then, it only cost 20% as much and didn&#x27;t require a couple of dental visits. And it is good enough, I grind my teeth less at night and my jaw is no longer sore when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this thing because i don&#x27;t like sleeping with rubber in my mouth but my dentist says I need to. That being said, it&#x27;s an easy-to-use item and it does the job well</li>
            <li> I use this every night to protect my teeth from grinding. Working great to reduce tooth sensitivity and pain!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basically part Velicoraptor because I normally chew through my night guards- not sure why this one is different but it&#x27;s held us to my grinding and chewing.</li>
            <li> The curve of this unit is narrow toward the back. If your mouth is narrow then I suppose it will fit ok but if not it will pull itself off. There are no side or front channels to hold it in place if that happens so if your back teeth are a bit farther apart than this is made for it will not stay in place.</li>
            <li> The tech at my dentist&#x27;s office recommended this to me so I could save money over the one they make in my dentist&#x27;s office which costs 3 to 400$.  I tried this, remade it per the instructions a number of times, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  It may work for you, I believe the reason it didn&#x27;t work for me is that my mouth is not wide but the teeth go back pretty far and this just wasn&#x27;t long enough to get all the way past those last back teeth and so never fit well.  If you do try it, note that you can reheat and reshape, so keep trying, maybe it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a cracked, custom-made, expensive mouth guard. I guess I was expecting too much compared with a custom guard. Regardless, I was vastly disappointed. I followed instructions to the letter -- even had someone hold a watch to count off the exact instructions down to the second. The thing won&#x27;t fit securely in my mouth -- falls out despite doing the boiling and fitting and molding precisely as per instructions. Quite frankly -- and I&#x27;m not being facetious or melodramatic -- I&#x27;d recommend that anyone thinking about buying this should first try a $2 mouth guard like high-school football players use. I really can&#x27;t see much difference in fit and feel.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brand specifically to prevent me from grinding my teeth in my sleep.  They key here seems to be in the initial molding process.  The first time I don&#x27;t think I got it hot enough so it didn&#x27;t really mold well around my teeth.  The second time I got it hot enough but found it difficult to get my fingers around it in the right spots (I have a big mouth I guess :P) and it still wasn&#x27;t quite right.  The third time I got it right though and it feels as comfortable as possible and stays in place.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it did take a little getting used to, but I can fall asleep with it in every night now.  If I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom I tend to take it out, falling back asleep with it in at that point feels a little disruptive, but I assume that&#x27;s still better than nothing, and way better than spending hundreds of dollars at the dentist for something custom made.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about spending so much for this night guard at a pharmacy.  But after reading all reviews for the 3 they pharmacy had, I decided on the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard Advance.  This thing works great!  I have been using it for about a week temporarily while my second  NTI is being created at the lab.  Yes, I clench/grind heavily, so for this Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard Advance to work is amazing to me!  A little note, make sure you do not cut too much off.  I suggest cutting a little at a time if it feels too long.  Also, cut at an angle so the mouth guard is at a nice \\&quot;slope\\&quot; shape instead straight, rough cut off.  File with a nail file if necessary.</li>
            <li> After my dog ate my $300 guard from the dentist, I decided to try off the shelf models.  This one works really well and the fit is great.  I would give it 5 stars except that the fitting process can be tricky and I normally have to do it twice before I get it right.</li>
            <li> Could never get this to stay on my teeth, finally just threw it out, wasted money for me.</li>
            <li> I tried to fit it to my mouth and it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t fit well enought that it wouldn&#x27;t fall out when I opened my mouth. I returned it. Plus the \\&quot;hard\\&quot; part wasn&#x27;t hard enough for me, I would have grinded right through that night guard, I had a profesional one for a few years and I ruined that one. I will likely just end up spending the money and geting another one from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Night Guard is a good product, but it is quiet hard to adjust to your mouth when you are under 5foot 5\\&quot; and have a narrow mouth in weight. But My Wife says that the very first night that I almost stopped snoring, ( I never Snore), and My jaw muscles are starting to feel better in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for your guard..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack</li>
            <li> The information on this product was misleading in that it did not say it could not be used if you wore a dental partial plate.  Therefore, I could not use it at all.  Spent money for nothing.</li>
            <li> Why do we go to Dentists who insist on selling us dental guards for well over $250 where you have to go for imprints and takes weeks to get back and are usually very uncomfortable and last about a year. What a scam.  The Doctors Nightguard is super affordable, you set it up in 5 minutes and it is so comfortable, no problem falling asleep. Great product, save yourselves hundreds of dollars making Dentists rich.&lt;br /&gt;They say on the product that it should be good for 6 months but mine is wearing really well. In any case the low cost and comfort are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Cant believe this doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I have used at least five other brands and this is the best by far. Lasts about a year of nightly use for me and I am a clencher/grinder. Just make sure to follow directions carefully. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This product is nearly impossible to get to fit right and them it feels like you&#x27;ve put a mouth ful of hardware in you face. Not to mention it&#x27;s sinisterly over priced.</li>
            <li> Run, don&#x27;t walk, away from this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might as well go to Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods or Sports Authority to buy a football mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fools that run this company knows that bigger fools like me &amp; you will buy this crap once, and the prey on us for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RUN, Forrest, RUN!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who click his teeth at night. Since he has been using this mouth guard, he has not been clicking his teeth nor cracking his jaw in the morning.  Helpful if the mold is formed to your mouth in a lying down position. Also easy to reform the mold multiple times if mistakes are made. Recommend replacement every 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the great product. You shipped it fast and it is so easy to use. Just boil water and bite down for your imprint and its ready. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> A great fit and so easy to use to protect my teeth from grinding my teeth during my sleep.  Dentists charge an arm and a leg to fit the mouth guard professionally.  I&#x27;ve purchased mouth guards from my dentist which cost over $200 and also tried doityourself-like these which only cost me less than $20, I really can&#x27;t say that one is that much better than the other.  Insurance or not I&#x27;d suggest people to try these.  They work just as well as the ones the dentist offer and 10times cheaper!</li>
            <li> Good product. Works as described. The fit was not perfect but good for the cost versus custom made night guard.</li>
            <li> After going to three different dentists searching for a solution to my child&#x27;s chronic night time teeth grinding, I was so desperate I bought this.  There wasn&#x27;t one dentist who would make a bite guard for a child because &amp;#34;their mouths are changing so fast.&amp;#34;  Of course, that makes sense.  But, that&#x27;s exactly why these are so great.  You have to change them every couple of months, so growing jaws and missing teeth aren&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kid is 6 years old, so I just trimmed off about 3/8 of an inch off the rear molar area on each side so it wouldn&#x27;t be too big.  We had to heat it up about three times to get the ideal fit, but I think it will go faster next time.  For us, the most important part was shaping the material up onto the roof of the mouth, which provides more suction holding power.  So far, it rarely has fallen out at night, and all the grinding has stopped.  The material is a soft plastic that is easily trimmed with a warm kitchen knife.  The device itself is a little bulky around the sides and far too large to be swallowed.  I&#x27;m not worried about it being dangerous at all.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. I lost the first one.. And, so far it works... For the money, it is the right product.. Something else may come along soon, but for now, it is good.</li>
            <li> I must have ordered 4 mouth guards in the past few months, none of which helped me. If you&#x27;re a night grinder, this is the perfect solution! Stays in place all night, and is not difficult to mold.</li>
            <li> Will try a 3rd time but even following directions to a T, hard to fit. Really want to make it work</li>
            <li> Ive never tried one of these before so as my first one I would say its a good one. I definitely moved my jaw too much when molding it so I suggest just use the pressure of your jaw. Dont move back and forth. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Delicious! Works well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it seems like a well made durable product.</li>
            <li> I love how this comes with easy directions and it works so easy and is a perfect fit for my mouth. This is more durable than the ones you buy at the dentist for hundreds of dollars. It is thick enough for the grinding and thin enough to fit in your mouth with out feeling like anything is in your mouth. So comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to get a good impression of your teeth. I didn&#x27;t even end up using the product.  It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had one of the big, bulky mouth guards for teeth-grinding while I sleep. This is much smaller and more comfortable. Out of the box it looks ridiculously tiny and I thought I had made a bad choice. However, it &amp;#34;sized&amp;#34; into my mouth great and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I have also given a review for this item also. Had ordered it for by cousin who has Sleep Apnea. She did not like it at all, I had to return it. Was never opened.</li>
            <li> I spent about an hour sizing and resizing this and never got a good fit.  It wouldn&#x27;t stay on my teeth, and was too thick/big for my mouth.  I bought this to use while my normal night guard was sent out for repairs as I get a headache when I don&#x27;t wear it.  I was never able to use this as it just fell off my teeth loose in my mouth.  Also, the reviewers were right who said it was too thick in the back it hurts your jaw.  Even when I pushed down so it was as thin as I could get it while sizing.  If you need a night guard, I recommend just finding a way to get a professional one, there is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I lost the grinding guard I had gotten from my dentist years ago and it was going to be $350 to replace it.  I decided to try this one first.  Thankfully, I have a small mouth, so it fits just fine.  I can see where others who do not have small mouths don&#x27;t like it.  It&#x27;s definitely not one size fits all. Followed the directions exactly and the fit is good.  Sleeping with a guard is still not fun, but this one is just as good as the dentist&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to the guards that can be purchased at Wal-Mart or Target for $30 and wear out after 1-3 months. This one is made of much thicker material and has lasted over 3 months thus far. For this reason, it deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con is that it is a bit bulky and needs to be trimmed down to fit. However, for the price and quality this is not that much of an issue.</li>
            <li> This monstrosity was so thick I could barely close my mouth. It was very invasive and made my dry mouth even drier. A real waste of money. Everyone should try Plackers- which is a real,lightweight, disposable, guard to help prevent grinding and clenching. You can use it till it falls apart. This is my first one and I&#x27;m on my eighth day. I just rinse it and store it in a cup with antibacterial dish detergent and a little salt.You can get a 10 pack for around $15. My 10 pack may last me six months! Theres no reason to throw it away if its not torn. Its really the closest thing to not having anything in your mouth. I can even drink from a glass. Try it! You&#x27;ll love it! Its just a very simple basic piece of lightweight plastic, designed to be comfortable and prevent grinding and clenching.The first night I used it,  I feel asleep within  a few minutes; just like normal.</li>
            <li> do not buy these. they do not fit comfortably and the pressure points on your gums cause ulcers/blisters. do not buy</li>
            <li> I feel that I was deceived with this product. I bought it for my husband, because I searched \\&quot;STOP SNORING DEVICES\\&quot; and this product was there, so I bought it. When I got it, there was nothing on the box for snoring. It is to stop grinding teeth at night. I won&#x27;t use it!</li>
