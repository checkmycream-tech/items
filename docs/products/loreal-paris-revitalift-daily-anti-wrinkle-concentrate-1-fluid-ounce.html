            <li>Good product at a great price.</li>

            <li>The order arrived quickly and in good shape, the anti wrinkle cream is the best...</li>
            <li>smells nice, guess its too soon to tell if it works, but it smells good and feels good, and I think it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>After using this product for about and year and loving it</li>
            <li>Am thrilled it&#x27;s here</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will order another one to see if the longer I use it the better my complexion will look :)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better than this one.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how the sample could be better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice tube for using, and real nice moisturizer for specific areas</li>
            <li>It just a cream like the others nothing had change more by me.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift</li>
            <li>SO FAR - SO GOOD!  </li>
            <li>but it certainly seems to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the wrinkles in  my neck, lines between my brows, and wrinkles around my mouth were becoming noticeably deeper, making me look my age.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without pulling on the skin, and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Product as described, fair price, well packed, fast delivery</li>
            <li>L&#x27;OREAL ADVANCED REVITALIFT WRINKLE CONCENTRATE was a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>So please don&#x27;t expect any wrinkles to be filled.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, it feels light on your face.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have so much faith in this that I bought more than one tube</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, but i&#x27;m just trying to prevent them. :)</li>
            <li>I much prefer the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collogen Winkle Filler, as it&#x27;s thicker than this product, and I think it works better than this one.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff but haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally.  </li>
            <li>I have used several products which cost much more; this one works better than any of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At 56 I can say that I&#x27;ve been lucky.  </li>
            <li>While using it my skin felt soft, smooth and toned, but it really did nothing spectacular for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and love the convenience of getting it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>My skin has improved but I need a little more time to give a honest review.</li>
            <li>I inherited good genes and did not really have to worry much about my skin until after menopause.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Contains retinol which is very very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product along with Advanced Revitalift Complete Day Cream for over two years.  </li>
            <li>It contains polycaprolactone which is the exact material I am using to make plastic flashlight prototypes.</li>
            <li>I actually have seen more pop up.  </li>
            <li>Product was watery and smelled funny.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that putting raw plastic on your face can be good for it long-term.</li>
            <li>This product really does not do anything.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like real L&#x27;Oreal product(product itself  and out side tube).</li>
            <li>Thanks LOreal and thanks to Amazon and their vendors.</li>
            <li>I put my moisturizer on top of it and it seems to take less moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I believe this product works, if applied everyday, with a good facial skin regimen.</li>
            <li>My age spot is lighter, pores appear to be smaller and a more even toned look overall.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Loreal Revitalift products and they work as well or better than more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li>Daily anti-Wrinkle Concentrate very much.  </li>
            <li>I started using as my 76 year old skin was &amp;#34;starting&amp;#34; to show my age.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Whenever I apply it, the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are less noticeable, but by the end of the day, when I take off my makeup, the lines appear to be the same as before.</li>
            <li>This is the best, least expensive day lotion on the market - not greasy,and help fot anti-wrinkle around the eye.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t possibly go wrong with LOreal products; I&#x27;ve used them for years and will continue to use them until anything better for the price comes along!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle improvement with the fine lines and tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>dont know why they quit making it, but as long as i can order it from this very professional company, Yipee!</li>
            <li>After using this for 2 weeks I could see an improvement and after a couple months the wrinkles were barely visible, as they are today.  </li>

            <li> old and a little over a year ago</li>
            <li> and I am trying to use ONLY this product to see if it works as well as the other three combined.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days</li>
            <li> am not happy because I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple other brands that said they would take your wrinkles away, but they didn&#x27;t work as well for me as this from L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> It works immediately, but needs to be applied everyday for the long term effect.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible habit of pushing my eyebrows together when I talk and over the years I&#x27;ve developed some deep lines right there.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample that I had received with some other product and it did work a little</li>
            <li> I only use this specifically on my wrinkles and use a less expensive basic anti-wrinkle cream from a jar on the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years (in rotation with a few others).  </li>
            <li> I totally waste my money.</li>
            <li> Normally I use it in winter time because of cold weather.</li>
            <li> Harsh, Harsh!</li>
            <li> - I was searching for raw plastic for a design project - and</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after using it faithfully for approximately two months, I have seen no real change.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product has been doing its job or if my genes have provided me with skin that is not too bad for a 78 year old woman.</li>
            <li> lasts me at least 3 months, maybe longer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but this is worst L&#x27;Oreal product I have ever purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product along with Advanced Revitalift Complete Day Cream for over two years.  I started using as my 76 year old skin was &amp;#34;starting&amp;#34; to show my age.  I don&#x27;t know if this product has been doing its job or if my genes have provided me with skin that is not too bad for a 78 year old woman.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;OREAL ADVANCED REVITALIFT WRINKLE CONCENTRATE was a pleasure to use. It is silky in texture and smells fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after using it faithfully for approximately two months, I have seen no real change. While using it my skin felt soft, smooth and toned, but it really did nothing spectacular for wrinkles. Perhaps fine lines were reduced but that would be the very best I could offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well-priced so that anyone can give it a try and it is a nice softening lotion, but do not be too disappointed if the same face looks back at you in the mirror even after using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year.  I have found very good results with it.  It took about 3 months to see the difference in my lines under my eyes.  I am still using it.  Haven&#x27;t found anything better than this one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally.  Great price and delivery time.</li>
            <li> This is the best, least expensive day lotion on the market - not greasy,and help fot anti-wrinkle around the eye.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wrinkle cream for over a year.  I am 66 yrs. old and a little over a year ago I noticed the wrinkles in  my neck, lines between my brows, and wrinkles around my mouth were becoming noticeably deeper, making me look my age.  I started searching the face cream aisles and internet for something.    I tried a couple other brands that said they would take your wrinkles away, but they didn&#x27;t work as well for me as this from L&#x27;Oreal.  After using this for 2 weeks I could see an improvement and after a couple months the wrinkles were barely visible, as they are today.  I only use this specifically on my wrinkles and use a less expensive basic anti-wrinkle cream from a jar on the rest of my face.  My son has even commented about what a young-looking neck I have for my age--I had NEVER mentioned to him that I was worried about my \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot; neck and started using anything for it.  I have been told by others that I don&#x27;t look my age and I give the credit to this product for diminishing greatly the wrinkles I had.   I have so much faith in this that I bought more than one tube so I always have it on hand - 1 tube lasts me at least 3 months, maybe longer.  You don&#x27;t need to put a lot on and I just place it in the creases.</li>
            <li> I have been using this L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift every day for over a month and there is NO difference on my wrinkles.  I had tried a sample that I had received with some other product and it did work a little so I decided to buy this larger size, but I see no difference using this.  Don&#x27;t know how the sample could be better.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product really does not do anything. So please don&#x27;t expect any wrinkles to be filled. It goes on nice and smooth and makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved but I need a little more time to give a honest review. I&#x27;ll  finish the tube and get back to ya.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years (in rotation with a few others).  It goes on smoothly without pulling on the skin, and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...fast shipping</li>
            <li> One of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. So far, I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle improvement with the fine lines and tone of my skin. It works immediately, but needs to be applied everyday for the long term effect. Whenever I apply it, the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are less noticeable, but by the end of the day, when I take off my makeup, the lines appear to be the same as before. I believe this product works, if applied everyday, with a good facial skin regimen.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  Will continie to purchase</li>
            <li> Product as described, fair price, well packed, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I was using three different types of creams for my face.  One with retinol, one with sunscreen, one with DMAE.  I bought this about a month ago and I am trying to use ONLY this product to see if it works as well as the other three combined.  SO FAR - SO GOOD!  My age spot is lighter, pores appear to be smaller and a more even toned look overall.  I am very pleased and will order another one to see if the longer I use it the better my complexion will look :)</li>
            <li> Turned 60, but don&#x27;t want to look it so trying to moisturize the wrinkles away. It&#x27;s a nice tube for using, and real nice moisturizer for specific areas</li>
            <li> My mom has this stuff and seems to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - I was searching for raw plastic for a design project - and what do you know this product came up! It contains polycaprolactone which is the exact material I am using to make plastic flashlight prototypes. I can&#x27;t imagine that putting raw plastic on your face can be good for it long-term. Use with caution.</li>
            <li> I have used several products which cost much more; this one works better than any of them.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bargain.</li>
            <li> At 56 I can say that I&#x27;ve been lucky.  I inherited good genes and did not really have to worry much about my skin until after menopause.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly wrinkles began showing up.&lt;br /&gt;Like all women I have experimented.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have seen deeper wrinkles and thought this would work well.&lt;br /&gt;After a month I&#x27;ve seen no improvement.  I actually have seen more pop up.  this simply does nothing for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy because I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about and year and loving it I could no longer find it in stores. Am thrilled it&#x27;s here and the results continue to be the saw.</li>
            <li> I will never switch to another brand, I used to try Olay and Neutrogena and Rock, nothing compare to Loreal face care. It is not greasy, it feels light on your face. I think you see difference on your face after you use it. Normally I use it in winter time because of cold weather.</li>
            <li> It just a cream like the others nothing had change more by me. I do not know if I will use it again</li>
            <li> Contains retinol which is very very drying to the skin. Harsh, Harsh! Alot of marketing for us to believe differently!</li>
            <li> I have a terrible habit of pushing my eyebrows together when I talk and over the years I&#x27;ve developed some deep lines right there. This product does a great job of smoothing them. They don&#x27;t go away completely, but they are much less noticeable. I was very disappointed when my local drug store stop carrying it, and was delighted to find it on Amazon (and it was cheaper on Amazon!). Great product! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Daily anti-Wrinkle Concentrate very much.  When I use it, I could see the difference in 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t see them in the store, I hope L&#x27;Oreal still make this product.  I want to buy 10 of them to save and use but I worry it will be expired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days but it certainly seems to be a good product.  Goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  I put my moisturizer on top of it and it seems to take less moisturizer.  And, it&#x27;s a very good price.</li>
            <li> smells nice, guess its too soon to tell if it works, but it smells good and feels good, and I think it seems to be working. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, but i&#x27;m just trying to prevent them. :)</li>
            <li> This is not what I accepted. I have been using L&#x27;Oreal for 15 years.  I am a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal products but this is worst L&#x27;Oreal product I have ever purchase. Product was watery and smelled funny. It doesn&#x27;t look like real L&#x27;Oreal product(product itself  and out side tube). I totally waste my money. If I could I would give  0 star.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t possibly go wrong with LOreal products; I&#x27;ve used them for years and will continue to use them until anything better for the price comes along! Thanks LOreal and thanks to Amazon and their vendors.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collogen Winkle Filler, as it&#x27;s thicker than this product, and I think it works better than this one.</li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years with complete satisfaction.I would recommend it to anyone needing a product of this nature.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love the convenience of getting it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Loreal Revitalift products and they work as well or better than more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly and in good shape, the anti wrinkle cream is the best...dont know why they quit making it, but as long as i can order it from this very professional company, Yipee!</li>
