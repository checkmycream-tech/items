    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the product . I use it about three times a week or every other day.</li>
            <li> This hair oil/serum absorbs into my scalp quickly. Unlike some other castor oils ( that can weigh your hair down ) this one is lightweight. It smells great. My hair is not shedding with this product. And my hair usually sheds like crazy! So this is a HUGE accomplishment for me :)</li>
            <li> Nice lubricant. Spreads well on hair and scalp, a little goes a long way. I love this line of products. Everything does what it says it will. My ends look healthy and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and does its job! My hair was a lot less dry after about a week of it&#x27;s using it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I find that this product line is over priced on amazon. I buy this for 7.99 at CVS. This serum makes hair very soft and it Smells delicious and its very gentle.</li>
            <li> Good stuff .. I only apply it to my hair cause its a little to heavy for my scalp and causes mild itching. My hair strands love it, but for my scalp I will stick with my organic coconut oil &amp;cold pressed castor oil only. I will buy this oil again though. I get it at Target for a better price.</li>
            <li> I used for a hot oil treatment. I&#x27;m not sure if I would use this daily as it may weigh down hair. The top does make it easier to line scalp only though. The smell is unique: a mixture of Play Doh, cotton candy and baby powder. A very soft scent but does linger. It absorbed very quickly into scalp. Cheaper at drug store as well.</li>
            <li> Bought for girlfriend who is black and she uses almost every night and says her hair is significantly healthier. Also this has lasted her over two months already and still got plenty left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Looooooove the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this  product !  Ordering another one</li>
            <li> I got the worst haircut of my life and desperately needed something to grow my hair out. I read about scalp massages for growth and used this. My hairdresser basically completely buzzed off the sides of my hair to the point where I looked bald, but within a week of using this (along with vitamins and good nutrition) for scalp massages the hair completely filled in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that it helped with some sores on my scalp and healed them completely. This product has a noticeable smell (like vanilla, almond, peru balsam) which I happen to like, but it works well so the smell shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in whether or not you use this product. If you want soft, strong, fast-growing hair and a healthy scalp definitely use this! Also you can get this cheaper elsewhere.. I got this at Ulta half off in a bogo deal.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Very light oil which can be used almost daily on the scalp.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for the size, but it arrived on time and it smells great. PERFECT FOR DRY SCALP/HAIR, IF YOU ALREADY HAVE GREASY HAIR DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OIL. I have very dry scalp, especially in the winter time and I found this as the perfect product because it moisturizes the scalp and leaves the hair feeling soft. I actually bought the whole line of Shea Moisture with JBCO and it was WELL WORTH IT. My hair dresser even fell in love with it especially the masque. Just the smell alone will have you falling in love with this product. I highly recommend this product due to its natural/organic ingredients (NO PARABENS, NO SULFATES, NO MINERAL OIL) and the excellent results. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It does help hair grow and smells great too</li>
            <li> In terms of effectiveness is does smooth cuticles, however, on my very thick, curly, porous hair it did not penetrate well at all.  The smell was also very offensive to me.  It has a &amp;#34;candy&amp;#34; like smell that does not go away.  I&#x27;ve decided to use this as  weekly deep oil treatment applied to a wet scalp.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! My hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell</li>
            <li> leaves my hairy feeling very oily, even when i wash it out</li>
            <li> I love the hair products and natural oils!!  All of my purchases arrived on time however, my Sansa MP3 player arrived in a used box, which made me question was this product new.  The on/ off button doesn&#x27;t function properly. I will not recommend this player to anyone😟</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t started using it yet.  Everything in this line carries the same fragrance to compliment each other.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product and fell in love with it so i purchased it right away. Leaves hair feeling smooth and healthy</li>
            <li> I had been using jamaican black castor oil for a few weeks, but the smell was horrendous.  So when I saw this product, I was skeptical, but I had to try it.  I love it.  It does wonders for my hair.  It feels so soft and healthy.  But beware, it is heavily scented.  That could be a problems for some, but fortunately, not for me. I think this serum smells absolutely *heavenly*.  I love smelling it on myself during the day.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
