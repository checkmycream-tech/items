            <li>Excellent, thanks for do a great costumer service !!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a wonderful thing to feel good while looking Good:-)</li>
            <li>It is great for the special occasions when you want to look your best.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyoune wanting to look good for an occasion.  </li>
            <li>All in all a good shopping experience.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product and found that it worked realy good for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the day.  </li>
            <li>The tapes work wonderfully and are comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>On (3-26-2012) I need to add some good news,  I went to my hair dresser and she used a concealer on the tape</li>
            <li>Takes away a good 15yrs off my face.</li>
            <li>good before you put the tapes on.</li>
            <li>But if the cord slips after about 10 minutes, what good is it?</li>
            <li>They just make me feel so good &amp; look good.</li>
            <li>, My husband is going to wonder why after all these years I&#x27;m still looking good</li>
            <li>Does what is advertised and fairly comfotable, but was a bit tricky to learn how to apply correctly when all alone.</li>
            <li>This product works as advertised, but there is a fair amount of effort required to install and conceal the tapes on ones face.</li>
            <li>be fair</li>
            <li>The surgery didn&#x27;t life as good as with these.  </li>
            <li>They made good of MY mistake..and that was actually good business on their part.  </li>
            <li>but i am not telling any of my friends they all keep saying how good</li>
            <li>for night out or day when you want to look good ..</li>
            <li>Usually, a good improvement can be obtained if you concentrate your efforts at the cheekbones.</li>
            <li>so you can get a good idea of where to place the tapes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because my sister&#x27;s friend used it and loved the difference it made.</li>
            <li>but when you do, you will get good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for light wear.</li>
            <li>I received the product on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>This is truly a remarkable product - sort of like a magical transformation for a 24-hour period!  </li>
            <li>excellent product ,stays in place, just followed the directions exactly for great results.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for the special occasion, just not permanent.</li>
            <li>but lol you have to really work with it, to get best results.</li>
            <li>Best product out there - LOVE LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>People kept telling me how good I looked (I need to order more as I was testing to see if they truly worked!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I cannot tell you how over the top happy I am.</li>
            <li>Great product, wish it came with a couple more of the elastic bands though.</li>
            <li>the cord was a better quality, these could work great.</li>
            <li>It does have some lifting effects and I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>lol you will get better sticking power if you do.</li>
            <li>Sure a facelift looks great if you imagine it and put your fingers to your face and lift the way the model is in the picture...</li>
            <li>Again I am very very pleased</li>
            <li>I would love to know who makes the tape because it is great on the skin</li>
            <li>All in all an excellent shopping experience, very fast delivery</li>
            <li>Customer service was awesome also &amp; very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It takes some trial and error to find best placement but the package does advise to try without using the tape first</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You will love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>The usage is better than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li>I will continue using them, they are the greatest alternative to surgery or botox, very affordable too!</li>
            <li>I love my secretlift!</li>
            <li>Great, easy to use, have used them for years.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is every woman&#x27;s easy answer to looking great without surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was excellent, I received these items more quickly than when I ordered goods from my own country.   </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Well, to my surprise, the result was amazing.  </li>
            <li>So amazing, in fact that I cancelled my appointment with the surgeon.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I do not understand the reviews that say this project is effective.</li>
            <li>but i made the mistake of buying them because there are so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product because you can adjust the lifting.</li>
            <li>awesome and really work</li>
            <li>Face does not work to good but love neck one.  </li>
            <li>They are nice to have for that boost of confidence.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I just can&#x27;t imagine how that could happen.</li>
            <li>This is a good alternative to surgery a non-painful way to look and feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li>Really, give these a try, you will be very impressed.  </li>
            <li>This really is the best company!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Practice really does make perfect.</li>
            <li>Also, if its a warm day and you perspire, the tapes will tend to slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I then use a warm hair dryer while rubbing the tape</li>
            <li>I never got it to work, probably my own problem</li>
            <li>I am totally thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>The tapes smooth out that area very nicely.  </li>
            <li>,  Wothout those Lifts, I truly felt I might as well just turn around and go home, so great was my dependence on the significant appearance-booster of the Lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great work very well defiantly take 5 years away quickly from my under eye area Love This product!!!!</li>
            <li>but it would be great for a special event.</li>
            <li>Works great for a special events.</li>
            <li>I use it for a special occasion when I&#x27;m going out and want to look great.</li>
            <li>So if u wear your hair close and around your face they are a good idea for a special day!</li>
            <li>That allows me to wear the elastic under my hair, where it&#x27;s a great deal more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This is a great concept for a quick fix-</li>
            <li>I think this is great for a quick photo for friends who haven&#x27;t seen you in a while.  </li>
            <li>Its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Works more effectively on jowls.</li>
            <li>Since many had great to good results with this product, I really couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it.  </li>
            <li>Great fun.</li>
            <li>Not as easy as it looks!</li>
            <li>Truly easy to use and takes years off!  </li>
            <li>Makes your wrinkles very fine and unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I feel so much more confident and peppy when I go out.</li>
            <li>First let me start off by saying the concept is great</li>
            <li>what we do to stay pretty lol</li>
            <li>GREAT customer service, I send an email asking a question and they respond fast!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too good to be true...</li>
            <li>I found them very comfortable and not noticable to anyone.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very comfortable, and I wear them every day.</li>
            <li>Held very securely</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and literally undetectable.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product out of curiosity, mostly because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>This is fine for every day kind of use when I don&#x27;t feel like anyone would be scrutinizing</li>
            <li>And they are HUGE!</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I will order more of the face tapes.</li>
            <li>and  I tried many time.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It does have some lifting effects and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>make sure you scrape the hair in front of the ears</li>
            <li>My youngest son 17yrs said from the top of the stairs</li>
            <li>i ordered two orders and i am not a paid sponsor , just a woman looking to feel better about herself and with Confidenence now.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>but I put makeup on top of them and it makes abig difference.  </li>
            <li>I love these tapes, they take 10 years off my sagging face.  </li>
            <li>(like over night) I have been using them for more than a year with NO PROBLEMS, but beware of the wind</li>
            <li>I have ordered five sets (I think) of these now and will keep purchasing until I need something more invasive.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fakey looking for me - seems like it just makes me look more rested and refreshed which is what I was looking for anyway.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully and I looked so much younger.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s got to be a better way.</li>
            <li>I might even report item this product to the better business bureau.</li>
            <li>Better than cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li>Be sure there is no oil on the skin where you will be placing the tapes to be sure they adhere well...</li>
            <li>Bought this mostly as a gag gift.</li>
            <li>Hilarious.</li>

            <li>If it would lift up my \\&quot;grandmother&#x27;s jowls\\&quot; that have started to appear, it would be fantastic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why some reviewers had so many problems with this product.  </li>

            <li>I get so many comments, \\&quot;have you changed your hair, working out?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>so I was able to cover the tapes.  </li>
            <li>It sure made a difference in my photos - took years off of me.</li>
            <li>You will glad that you did, and of course, without the surgical expense!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only one practice run, I was more than happy with the performance of the lift!  </li>
            <li>be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li>so I think I need to find a better solution (any</li>
            <li>Love the ladies (</li>
            <li>Okay, gluing your face up, saw this on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li>that was stressing me out and making more wrinkles</li>
            <li>These do a much better job.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this, but I&#x27;m way more self consious of who can notice this on me.  </li>
            <li>I ordered them and when they arrived, they were nothing more than pieces of tape.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many anti-aging skin products with no results.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure when I order if it what I wanted</li>
            <li>I was sure this item was a hoak</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly pleased with my inexpensive face lift.</li>
            <li>However, I have been able to figure out a way to use them for my chin and neck.  </li>
            <li>It does lift the cheeks and I was able to hide the tabs with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but once you have it give one more confidence to go out in the world.</li>
            <li>i love these</li>
            <li>make sure you wipe where u are going to stick tapes with alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product over a year now and love it.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OKAY.</li>
            <li>MORE</li>
            <li>love the idea, on me you could not see anything, and it did lift my neck and make a difference, but it caused blistering even though they are supposed to be hypoallergenic, which I assumed meant like surgical tape.</li>
            <li>maybe you will have better luck then</li>
            <li>I would love to know and maybe try again.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>it is even better.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using these !</li>
            <li>and there are many many uses I can think of for it.  </li>
            <li>The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts!</li>
            <li>In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li>This ensures all-day adhesionGreat product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li>Who says that Sexy has to be 25, I&#x27;m 65 and holding.</li>
            <li>It disappeared like magic.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product</li>
            <li>so I need to cut more layers in my hair to start using the face lift application where it goes on top of your head...</li>
            <li>It does hurt to remove the tapes when you&#x27;re done, but surgery would hurt more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool to feel more competitive at work and attractive for special events or even for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I really does wonders!!!!</li>
            <li>Very disepointed !!!!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li>This product is nice for a special event or a photo shoot.  </li>
            <li>This will also give you a pretty good idea of what a mini face lift will do for you.</li>
            <li>This is my first time writing a review ever, but I feel good about sharing my experience with &amp;#</li>
            <li>Works best with medium or long hair so you can pull the hair forward and cover any tell-tale signs.  </li>
            <li>you, God for this amazing little, wonderful creation.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Although skeptical at first I honestly have to say this is one of the best and cheapest solutions I&#x27;ve found for looking great!</li>
            <li>I got really excited about it too!</li>
            <li>it is a great product we use it for live performances  face enhancement in class.</li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more of this incredible product.</li>
            <li>By the way, I use the lifts more than once, just make sure you clean the area of all makeup, oils, face cream etc.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from cleaning the skin real good, to using alcohol on my skin to make sure it was clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say except that the neck and face lifts are fantastic, I don&#x27;t need to go under the knife now</li>
            <li>Wow, does this product work great.  </li>
            <li>I put alcohol on the area for the tape to make sure my skin was free of oils and that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>However, it works, the wrinkles, most importantly sagging goes away.</li>
            <li>Your friends and family will be amazed at how young you look, and won&#x27;t have a clue (lol).  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe what i was seeing my face transformed  right in front of my own eyes....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today was my first day of wearing them and so far I love them !!!</li>
            <li>That is a true testimony that they do, indeed, work!  </li>
            <li>Would like to return it for a full refund!</li>
            <li>The tapes are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>wow,this is so amazing,results are great,so easy to apply,and the tape holds,i will never be without it,simple</li>
            <li>the video showed how to use the product in a way easy to understand.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use for me.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li>You can easily see the adhesive tape that is placed in front of the ears</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE....</li>
            <li>Easy to use and greta results.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Be sure you clean area</li>
            <li>it took seconds as easy as putting on a head band.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s easy as applying a band-aid (although I goof once in a while).</li>
            <li>Breaks easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>THE TAPES WERE ABOUT AS STRONG AND, STICKY, AS SCOTCH TAPE.....</li>
            <li>The adhesive tapes are strong and hold all day.</li>
            <li>better then nothing right!</li>
            <li>This product reassures me that I do not need to spend mega bucks right now Just had $1,000.00 worth of fillers in marionette lines around mouth and some in cheeks (need more) which  helped me tremendously, but with the addition of the tapes, my face looks truly sensational..</li>
            <li>so it lifts just fine for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and the elastic bands got tangled</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comfortable &amp; lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Had no problem with the tape, cleaned the area with alcohol and it sticks just fine.</li>
            <li>The tapes work fine.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is amazing, I love it</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it makes a HUGE difference in how my neck looks.</li>
            <li>and I wanted the light.  </li>
            <li>Bumy face look younger but with these tapesit looks great now</li>
            <li>I use the light color and have strawberry blond hair and you can&#x27;t see a thing.  </li>
            <li>There are times when I am tired or make up just doesn&#x27;t cut it, and when I wear these, everyone tells me how great I look, and I feel better knowing I look good....</li>
            <li>I had my doubts and they were confirmed upon using (or trying to use this product).  </li>
            <li>Could  be useful if  better made.</li>
            <li>This did wonders for me at a recent holiday party, people said I looked great</li>
            <li>They are fun trying to see howmuch better you can look.</li>
            <li>So happy I finally found them.</li>
            <li>they are comfortable, don&#x27;t even know you have them on.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place all day, they are not visible to others and once I got used to them, they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Also they are comfortable; they just feel like your wearing a headband.  </li>
            <li>and it is secure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a crossdreser and it really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>I use the neck lift tapes and I greatly recommend the product, is practically invisible, you just have to know how to place it properly; takes some practice</li>
            <li>It is fantastic for me.  </li>
            <li>The comments are &amp;#34;You look fantastic what are you using, &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t  know</li>
            <li>this whole exercise was a good laugh at myself for falling for this one.</li>
            <li>It always feel so good to hear the many compliments on how much younger I look for my age.</li>
            <li>My hairstyle completely covers the tapes, but my skin is so fair, the tape just seems disappears into my skin anyway.</li>
            <li>Works really well, however the side adhesive is abit on the big side, It would be perfect if the adhesive was skin colour .</li>
            <li>and that is actually good enough to make me feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you want to look amazing without having to go under the knive.</li>
            <li>If you have hot flashes and get warm, they pop right off your skin.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s worth it)!</li>
            <li>But when all is said and done it is a straightforward item.</li>
            <li>First time I used them they stayed on most of the day...</li>
            <li>Duct tape would probably work better (and now comes in designer colors  ;-)</li>
            <li>These are great if you have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>u have to make sure you use alcohol pads on skin first.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>A great way to hide those wrinkles if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li>What fun!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, inexpensive, and fun.  </li>
            <li>Wow am so happy thanks to this company and amazon for putting it out there.</li>
            <li>used baby wipes to thoriughly clean the areas where the tapes were to stick</li>
            <li>just clean that area</li>
            <li>Sticks to your skin with tape that won&#x27;t stick no matter how clean your skin is.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, that truly delivers the look of a more firm and toned neck.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t stick, I used a cotton ball to clean the neck area</li>
            <li>NOT the darn things would not stick to my clean skin (by my ears)  </li>
            <li>Clean off the area of skin where the tape will go with alcohol...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, super affordable and gives me the look I want.  </li>
            <li>other thing I noticed is that the company has excellent customer service; they respond right away to inquiries and once when the elastic band broke, they sent a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>had one fly loose in a grocery store....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable to wear, and does exactly what it says--</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub the tape as long as the directions say, and you&#x27;ll love this product too!</li>
            <li>Works OK in certain situations depending on the hairstyle</li>
            <li>Be prepared to have plenty of back-ups in your purse if you are out for a special occasion because you will need them.</li>
            <li>I will use it again for shorter periods, like special events.</li>
            <li>Whenever I have a special occasion, I put this on.</li>
            <li>I am flipping out right now!</li>
            <li>Right!</li>
            <li>A little tricky the first time, but practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li>I use to use them when I would go to a special event, but now I love them so much,</li>
            <li>Only good for indoor special occasions.  </li>
            <li>far as the effect, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>many thanks</li>
            <li>I bought these for my mom, who is 60+ and has recently lost a good bit of weight.</li>
            <li>GOT A FULL REFUND FROM SELLER.</li>
            <li>It makes ME feel better about myself, I don&#x27;t really care about others.</li>
            <li>Also, you cannot see anything... and honestly if when the wind is blowing and some young, whipper snapper says anything about these to me...</li>
            <li>This item is phenomenal, it really works.  </li>
            <li>True statement</li>
            <li>Nothing it advertises about it is true.</li>
            <li>Good and simple idea</li>
            <li>As for using the tapes as a full face lift, its not something that I have done.</li>
            <li>I found myself lifting my skin on my face daily as I look in a mirror and always wished I could look that good again.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of a face lift, save yourself from all the pain and suffering and try the instant face and neck lift, you will be amazed, my friends and family think that I look really good and years younger too, believe me it is a fantastic buy and so amazing</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t work, no major investment lost, and if they do, the results can be startlingly good.</li>
            <li>if I was lucky.</li>
            <li>Product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It was  a worthy effort.</li>
            <li>always looking for the next best thing to look younger.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I was home.</li>
            <li>I expected better ease of use along with some kind of result.  </li>
            <li>About 6-7 hours if you aren&#x27;t being super hot/sweaty before any slippage occures..</li>
            <li>it realy does work, it might take couple of times to get the hang of where to stick the tapes, the best one is the neck one, i have short hair at the back  and the lenght just cover the elastic..</li>
            <li>Instant Face Lift is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>And I use it every day :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and oh make sure to order</li>
            <li>very satisfied with INSTANT FACE AND NECK TAPES, THEREFORE, WOULD SUGGEST TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.</li>
            <li>Just used the neck one for the very first time today</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product several times and have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have reordered this product several times now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to do it the easy way without surgery</li>
            <li>Its so easy and fast..</li>
            <li>first so the tape is on a super clean surface.</li>
            <li>I would ask them why they were asking, and they would just look at me and say, \\&quot;I am not sure, but you really look great today\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>Probably was meant more for someone that doesn&#x27;t have that much of a problem in the first place.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product!!</li>
            <li>The company was very helpful, in fact they sent me a free set of cords when I asked if I could purchase them seperately.    </li>
            <li>but with my straight, smooth hair&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they are worth every penny..</li>
            <li>I have found that the secret lift works as it claims to work, giving a surprising and amazing result.  </li>
            <li>IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>Crack a smile</li>
            <li>Nice to look in a mirror and see the face I had a decade ago and not my grandma looking back at me!</li>
            <li>Get many compliments on how young I look (I&#x27;m 63).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these are worth every cent</li>
            <li>it worth it</li>
            <li>Get your Tapes and Smile the years</li>
            <li>It is nice for an instant, though.</li>
            <li>Make sure the area to be taped and your fingers are clear of all oils, etc before taping.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I was concerned about my inherited  laugh lines and jowels appearance.  </li>
            <li>some good as well as the not so good ....and said y not its not tht expensive ......</li>
            <li>on you makeup because you will see a difference and your smile will reflect the way you feel.  </li>
            <li>The neck tape came off alot, especially if I got warm.</li>
            <li>Under where the tape had been there were now water filled blisters on both sides, and in one spot the tape ripped the skin off the top of one of them leaving me with an open wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it when I want to look extra nice.  </li>
            <li>It is really worth it, though.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They were an unmitigated success.</li>
            <li>It is maybe worth $0.20, cause</li>
            <li>but when I did I look up and said Thank you lord because let me tell you this little amazing product does exactly like it shows on the videos easy to put on, The tape sticks very well and may the truth be spoken if I can give more stars than</li>
            <li>They might take a bit getting used to (I got used to them right away) but to look \\&quot;uplifted\\&quot; again, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>I get the  medical tape at Wall Greens and it is very cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Gently clean the area with olive oil and then warm soapy water and a terry cloth rag at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth</li>
            <li>Hot flashes and sweating causes the tape to come undone quickly.</li>
            <li>Positioning the tape was also not a problem, I was lucky to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li>make sure you clean then area properly with alcohol cleanser</li>
            <li>Does feel good on face but other than that nothing</li>
            <li>I exerciise and try to eat right, keep my weight in check, but my genes dictated that my lower face would \\&quot;jowl\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>May take a couple times to get it right.</li>
            <li>but when I called them they mailed me the correct color right away, gratis.</li>
            <li>Maybe they did not use them right?</li>
            <li>I applied the tape right in front of my ears and lift.</li>
            <li>I am over the moon right now.</li>
            <li>exactly right</li>
            <li>Right now I am beside myself</li>
            <li>a set positioned right the string kept sliding in my hair and looked ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Absolutely must clean all areas, including hands, of oils.  </li>
            <li>The tapes are simple to apply and the great thing is the same kind of tape is used for both neck and face, the skin needs to be clean and dry before you apply the tapes</li>
            <li>I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance?</li>
            <li>Also, it is hard to hide the tape around the ears, but again, for a quick, deceitful photo, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I try to hide them as far back as I can, but they really are more effective the closer to the side of your face as you can put them.  </li>
            <li>For anything more, they&#x27;re more trouble than what they&#x27;re worth.</li>
            <li>Great for a few hours!</li>
            <li>The few times I contacted CosmeSearch, their Customer Service was impeccable.</li>
            <li>I am now going to experiment and leave it on to see just how long the sticky pads will stay stuck to my face to give me confidence when I go out as I don&#x27;t want them pinging off when my face gets warm.   </li>
            <li>So for me, I love this little gadget and will keep on using until I just can&#x27;t pick my face up anymore :-)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very sure about this product at first, but I was curious.  </li>
            <li>The directions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>this is truly a amazing product they will pull your eyes up like it says a instant face lift highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure the area where you are applying the tapes is clean and dry, otherwise the tapes will not stick.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t that comfortable for all day, but OK for special occasions of a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to clean and dry area first, I use alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I simply place the tapes right in front of my ears, hook it on top, style my hair</li>
            <li>If you take your time and read the instructions properly then it is very effective and lasts throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>The product is very very inexpensive, fully guaranteed and returnable?</li>
            <li>really substitutes for a surgical procedure that costs plenty and really, why go through all that drama??!!</li>
            <li>But it actually works, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!)</li>
            <li>DermaGen Anti-wrinkle patches have visibly reduced my fine lines and I have experienced smoother, softer skin after only a few applications.</li>
            <li>I liked this item; it works good for a special event or a day where you might look extra tired.</li>
            <li>Hey - maybe ya&#x27;ll simply figured it out better than I could.</li>
            <li>BUT--I watched the Youtube \\&quot;how to\\&quot; before using, and did EXACTLY as recommended.</li>
            <li>This REALLY works on &amp;#34;uncreping&amp;#34; my neck!  </li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It took 20 years off my face within 5 minutes and as a first time buyer, i had no difficulties</li>
            <li>The tapes are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The face ones lift cheeks and jawline and if placed higher lift eyes.</li>
            <li>The tapes are pretty transparent on me</li>
            <li>Cannot be compared and the price is just reasonable!</li>
            <li>was very embarassing!</li>
            <li>You want the face to be lifted the exact same direction the muscle did when it was more toned.  </li>
            <li>I want to be able to use it again, but I could never use it again the next day.</li>
            <li>The crows feet went away and my eyebrows looked higher.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I always first cleanse the area with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>I told them the first thing I did</li>
            <li>I tried it the first day, and never used it again.</li>
            <li>exactly what area you are trying to lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recomend using a moisturizer first  </li>
            <li>First of all, I do like the face lift tapes</li>
            <li>I first thought this was funny</li>
            <li>so I put the tape up higher and the barb was sticking between my face and ear.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I buy for second time :-)</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I saw a difference and a lift.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with your product, younger appearance in seconds.</li>
            <li>Seriously they are wonderful, the only issue is the tapes when you try to take them off, use baby oil or a moisturizer as they do stick like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starbun..</li>
            <li>all I can say is try the product if you want to look about 10 years younger in a safe way</li>
            <li>The first pad went on</li>
            <li>The tape does not stick and you are able to see it if u have short hair.</li>
            <li>Ladies, I am 63 and no one ever guesses my age and its really due to this fabulous company and product!!  </li>
            <li>I was getting married and wanted to lift my sagging neck.  </li>
            <li>ok for a short time.  </li>
            <li>Ok guys, two hours later, numbereous attemts  </li>
            <li>I had to learn how to use them correctly, but once I was able to utilize properly, I am convinced that these tapes do wonders for the spirit.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to tease your hair in the back to hide the rubber band it comes with.</li>
            <li>As a female who has always taken care to wear sunscreen, eat healthy, not smoke, ect</li>
            <li>(I cleaned with alcohol first);</li>
            <li>Tape is very flimsy!  </li>
            <li>Tape doesn&#x27;t stick very well!  </li>
            <li>THe longer the tape is on the more my skin itches and becomes puffy and red and itchy afterwards and even while its on.  </li>
            <li>Would be much better on short haired people that can brush their hair over the tape and have their hair not move out of place.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li>When I first heard of this product I thought &amp;#34;really?&amp;#34; But decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li>If you order the bands from the company be aware that the neck band and the face bands are two seperate products.</li>
            <li>She can now look younger for her birthday party and feel better about herself.</li>
            <li>Depending on where you need the most lift, you will have to part your hair around the back of your head (a horizontal part) to allow space for the elastic.  </li>
            <li>Practice lifting your cheeks towards your temples first</li>
            <li>Love you instant face</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>The results are exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday &amp; can&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li>after 2 emails  they satisfied my request and replaced the bands with blonde ones.</li>
            <li>Love the product and have purchased from CosmeSearch numerous times.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quick fix ( ladies fifty plus), use to go to weddings, family reunions, high school, college reunions.  </li>
            <li>Cosemesearch company was very patient and kind and did respond to every single message I sent them .  </li>
            <li>If I wash my face, and apply these tapes, they will stay on all day, and I have to GENTLY pull them off at night, or they will rip my skin right off.</li>
            <li>The instructions state clearly to remove all makeup in front of your ears, clean the area</li>
            <li>I can see a difference, but it&#x27;s definitely subtle (which is great for a $15 product -</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, and want to use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to get the perfect placement</li>
            <li>they do work, but it took over a week for my neck to heal,left marks like love bites only very painful.to</li>
            <li>I love this product this is truly a middle class woman facelift ( can&#x27;t afford the real thing)</li>
            <li>Sometimes the tapes show, but I am not concerned, since the positive &amp;#34;out way&amp;#34; the negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, the model used in the video didn&#x27;t look like she needed much of a lift.</li>
            <li>To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>The tapes went on easily, stuck tight and the luckily I got the placement right the first time.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get it right the first time you have to use two new patches.</li>
            <li>They say it&#x27;s best to \\&quot;hide them under a wig\\&quot; but you&#x27;d seriously have to shave your head and wear a wig on your pulled back baldness to make these things work.</li>
            <li>I only use the Face lift tape they are so easy to use</li>
            <li>I reall like the results, easy enough to put on .</li>
            <li>The concept is simple and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>certainly help.  </li>
            <li>(but then I am a woman of a certain age, and I&#x27;ve lost 100 pounds</li>
            <li>I will certainly order again</li>
            <li>I will try it one more time when these blisters heal with the barbs on the outside and also I will not clean the oil from that area first as I don&#x27;t have oily skin and maybe that will be better.</li>
            <li>The seller was super fast and professional.</li>
            <li>It looked fine but simply doesn&#x27;t have the stickyness needed to hold in place.</li>
            <li>The neck lift works fine as it pulls the skin back and holds.</li>
            <li>They definitely pull fine lines from my chin and neck lines.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing what a little adhesive and a couple of elastic string can do.  </li>
            <li>The product REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>untill I really need it.</li>
            <li>Really cleanse the skin with non oily toner before applying tape.</li>
            <li>It will NOT get rid of wrinkles though, so really just expect a lifted look.</li>
            <li>this product really works.</li>
            <li>WAS VERY HOPEFUL...</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think a rubber band could work, but once I stuck the tapes on and hid the rubber bands under my hair...</li>
            <li>No Kidding, I absolutely cannot go anywhere without out them.</li>
            <li>It really depends on your skin coloring, hair type and style and</li>
            <li>and this works very well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am 40I don&#x27;t need too much lift</li>
            <li>they absolutely lifted my confidence too.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>course the price is reasonable, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product as the elastics were broken and couldn&#x27;t us them at all.  </li>
            <li>It will lift your face but it is very difficulty to hide the adhesive lifts</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to adhesive and the fixture used did not react with me at all - a real plus.</li>
            <li>It is very shuttle</li>
            <li>This face lifting kit really works well.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it do what it says it does, but it is comfortable as well.  </li>
            <li>They are very discreet, and will keep it&#x27;s hold all night.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again.</li>
            <li>Even if they would they are still very visable.</li>
            <li>Elastic bands to secure tape in place broke instantly.</li>
            <li>Ready for an evening event?  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>For now old age is gone and it&#x27;s fun to look 40 when I am 50.</li>
            <li>My mom really likes this product.</li>
            <li>As I said before you got to really work with it.</li>
            <li>This face lifting kit really works well for me.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions are appreciated.</li>
            <li>The stickers come undone which could be very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>these work great for a temporary lift on days when I am tired or haven&#x27;t gotten the rest required.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real joke.</li>
            <li>Treat yourself to a young, fresh face.</li>
            <li>These tapes and bands are fantastic, I look and feel years younger.</li>
            <li>Very unnatural.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It really does take 10 years off me.</li>
            <li>And yes the filler works really well too, but that is aother story.</li>
            <li>Very unnoticeable</li>
            <li>the person that took my re-order was very nice&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>very help...</li>
            <li>You cannot really see the tape because they are transparent.  </li>
            <li>( the only color that was available through Amazon when I ordered).  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, it stays on well</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying the Pro Instant Lift once it beomes available again.</li>
            <li>ony thing is for this to really work, you CAN see the plastic  adhesive tabs.  </li>
            <li>, the problem is that it does not fix very well for enought period of time during the day</li>
            <li>The tapes held very well, although there is a woman on YouTube demonstrating how to put them on which was very informative, but she said to wear the barbs(the things that hook on to the tape) on the inside of the tape, the instructions don&#x27;t tell you what side they should be on.</li>
            <li>really ?</li>
            <li>It REALLY works for me.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>the stickers are very noticeable no matter how you try to cover them.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really is a mini face lift and</li>
            <li>Their shipping time is extremely fast and I appreciate that factor.</li>
            <li>I live in Maryland where summers are hot and very humid so the toughest test has yet to happen  </li>
            <li>I will recommend it to everyone I know that is interested im somethings as instant quick a painless</li>
            <li>I had no trouble getting the tape to stick right in front of my ears</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment</li>
            <li>but I was able to grab it and rip it off the other side before it was noticed.</li>
            <li>It lifted more on one side than the other</li>
            <li>It is pretty comfortable, actually more so than the thin elastic Cosme Search elastic neck band which often cuts into my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think these tapes are amazing in so many different ways, especially because they are hidden when wearing them.  </li>
            <li>worked great the first time i tried it...really made a difference - but was sad when i had to take them off.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, you have to follow the instructions and you definitely need medium to long hair in the front of you</li>
            <li>I use the lift tapes everyday and I find them very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and then some for special occasions, or to wear out in public.</li>
            <li>I had only intended to use them for special occasions</li>
            <li>Of course, you can apply the miracle tabs with the bands each morning in very little time and the results are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stick as well as I had hoped, it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to wear for long periods.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m too far gone and need the real thing - surgery!</li>
            <li>My final opinion on these are: If you are only using them for a night out and you aren&#x27;t going to be sweating much, they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not paid to say these things, but it&#x27;s true, the Instant Face and Eye Lift is a life changer!!!</li>
            <li>I was truly and placently surprised to see that it works exactly how it says.  </li>
            <li>I applied it correctly the FIRST TIME surprisingly and the results were so dramatic it put a lil lump in my throat.</li>
            <li>The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Instant Face Lift Tapes for several years now and absolutely love the difference they make.  </li>
            <li>Which makes me look older than my years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 and always thought I  looked a lot older.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman.  </li>
            <li>My main concern is underside my chin area, with the sagging.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use the neck lift, but I have been meaning to try the rest of the product.  </li>
            <li>I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Thinking about it, the price is high for some tape and rubber bands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend CosmeSearch and their products.</li>
            <li>Obviously, they don&#x27;t work for everyone, hence the one star reviews, but I would certainly recommend trying them if you are interested in a quick fix to look a bit younger and fresher.</li>
            <li>To feel more confident you could add a few bobby pins with hair spray to ensure all is hidden.</li>
            <li>I wish the elastic bands were a little more invisible but you can&#x27;t have everything.  </li>
            <li>This product works extremely well and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It works extremely well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>sticks very well lasting all day as long as you clean the oil off your face first.  </li>
            <li>(it just does so much for my morale to look in the mirror and see the me of 10 years ago)I went directly to the site and ordered the refill tapes.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol to clean your skin and then let it dry a few minutes before you stick it on.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t need to clean my face with alcohol because I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed and surprised how much they worked.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting a mini face lift for a few years now, but have mot been able to save the $$ to do so.</li>
            <li>This was a waste of money and mostly time.these never stay in place longer than&lt;br /&gt;1minute</li>
            <li>The remarks I received were few, but the looks and the thoughts were many.  </li>
            <li>I was interacting with them normally</li>
            <li>Like many others I read a few of the reviews 1st....</li>
            <li>The secret lift is good for The Nasolabial folds.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get grandma out of my face in less than five minutes!</li>
            <li>It seemed like such a great idea, but the adhesive was not strong enough to hold the bands in place.</li>
            <li>and I dont have to go back to see my doctor for botox right now.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m wearing a strip of medical tape to hold up my neck and jaw line.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pull it really tight just enough for a nice lift</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found this wonderful little secret...</li>
            <li>I live in a windy city, so i try not to go out on those days.  </li>
            <li>but I can live with them and these also do not help with wrinkles</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Now I have to order a new band.</li>
            <li>So, live and learn, always trust your instincts</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the slight tightening of my jowl line which was really bothering me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use for a few hours not a whole day.</li>
            <li>Very surprised how well this product performed.  </li>
            <li>would imagine sweatingwill cause the tape to loosen, since I live in the south I will report back and update on what happens as the hot humid weather kicks in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, but after a while it may start hurting and can actually peel off some skin if you keep it on for too long.</li>
            <li>When you order this, there is no way to order the color, light or dark.  </li>
            <li>The direct site is charging me $1.88 to ship via US mail!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty simple and does what it says it will do-</li>
            <li>For those who have had unsatisfactory results I would suggest trying the tapes in slightly different positions, higher or lower, in front of the ear and maybe adjusting the placement of your hook at your hair&#x27;s crown.  </li>
            <li>at first I thought it was a joke and another money scam, but further investigation led me to the video and at that point I had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>To get the strongest hold, you must wipe the area with alcohol first, and position the tape as close to your ear as possible.</li>
            <li>Since the order this past time was through Amazon, (because they had a better deal)</li>
            <li>the product was completely different like from the first time I order. ....</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I would because when they said facelift without surgery wow!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these since  7 months ago, when I tried them as a last ditch effort in preparing for my first wedding at the age of 40.  </li>
            <li>I had big welts by ears the first time.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who is interested in looking younger but cannot afford cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I only use it for the neck area.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and if placed correctly a little foundation will cover the tapes.  </li>
            <li>They are not the most comfortable, again, not sure if it is because I havent completly figured it out yet, but they do seem to last a long time and make a difference in the appearance of sagging neck and jowels.</li>
            <li>I recoemmend setting aside one set of tapes to \\&quot;play around with\\&quot; in terms of placement, especially if you want to look especially well for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I wear them almost everyday, and they are so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Before I started using them, I really didn&#x27;t feel like going to social events with my skin sagging.</li>
            <li>My first couple of tries with the tape I really thought it was not going to work</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it begins to hurt around my ears after many hours</li>
            <li>I actually wear the secret lift near my eyes and amazingly it lifts my jaw area as well!</li>
            <li>This really is a very clever discreet solution that punches well above</li>
            <li>Everyone wants less wrinkles, right?  </li>
            <li>But you really need to work on positioning the tape in the right place to make it less visible.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always trying to make sure that my hair by my ears is covering the tape which is extremly hard to do on windy days.  </li>
            <li>- I will SPRAY the clear tab with Gray Away tinted spray and that will camoflauge the clear adhesive.</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants to have get botox or plastic surgery but can&#x27;t afford it, I promise the Instant Face and Neck Tape Lift Tapes work...</li>
            <li>I just received my order and I immediately put them on and WOW...</li>
            <li>but since there isn&#x27;t.... I would not waste my money on these again.....:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and no my face is not on the floor</li>
            <li>My mouth would look contorted if I pulled back to much.</li>
            <li>This product will change you whole look, however do not attempt to wear in the summer months outside.  </li>
            <li>I would send it back but it would cost to much.</li>
            <li>I feel like my old self with these.</li>
            <li>It really does make you feel years younger than you look....</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a facelift without spending thousands of dollars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about my turkey neck inherited from my dad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve contacted the company directly and they told me unless the tapes are returned in the mail that they cannot replace them.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>A must  have for when you skin feels saggy and old.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference it made.</li>
            <li>You can scoff,make jokes,make sarcastic remarks, diss and try to discourage others all you want too...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money .</li>
            <li>I must start saving money to get this fixed by a doctor</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this method works to freshen up your look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>All in all, as the old saying goes....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give some to my mom (84 years old).  </li>
            <li>pulled of the white -- now sticky and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>OMG I look like my old self and  </li>
            <li>and it even help me to feel like my old self ....</li>
            <li>wow mommy ur workout is working</li>
            <li>YOU THANK YOU for this product I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed of how old I had gotten at the young age of 40 ........</li>
            <li>As an EXTREMELY busy actress and model (imdb.me/eileenprudhont)</li>
            <li>This  product is a joke as far as Im concerned.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such fast shipping.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li>But even before my fillers kicked in completely, I wore the elastic at temple level and the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You absolutely cannot use this with short hair.  </li>
            <li>I would advise this for people with fairly thick hai, or those who creatively style theor hair to cover the band.  </li>
            <li>hours later and after going thru 6 pieces of the tape, I finally found the right placement for the tape and</li>
            <li>This is pretty much tape with a hair elastic cut in half.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product to any man or woman looking to not ONLY LOOK YOUNG, FEEL YOUNG</li>
            <li>The INSTANT FACE AND NECK LIFT TAPES are easily applied and you can adjust the lift with just a slight pull.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really done wonders for raising my droopy outer eyelids and flat cheeks.</li>
            <li>Clean skin and a few moments</li>
            <li>My older son is a classical pianist and we often perform together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the top lift bands and they tighten my jawline, and neck;  just within a few minutes!  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s an easy fix (I would just hold the taped area and pull a little on the elastic and twist the barb the opposite way).</li>
            <li>I position my tapes quite high up, well above the tragus of the ear and spend time massaging tapes to mould comfortably.then rearrange the hair over the ears.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but low expectations.</li>
            <li>I read many of the negative reviews, and most of them complained about the tapes not sticking properly.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it hides the tapes but as long as you dont wear a ponytail, you should be fine with hair as short as shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I used to wear them for special occasions, now i wear them everyday.  </li>
            <li>(dare not) &amp;#34;do not leave home without them.&amp;#34;  I have been using them for so long, no one really knows how I look without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small piece of elastic for the neck just isn&#x27;t long enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>The facelift one will pull the skin tighter to smooth out the \\&quot;parens\\&quot; around the mouth, but after a while, the band starts to hurt, because you need to pull it tight enough to pull the skin.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t  believe the amount of money people spend on facial surgeries to get the same result as this product produces.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering this the 2nd time because they really work....but lost the biggest rope &amp; never got the 3rd one like it</li>
            <li>Instructions were confusing enough, but then trying to apply them...not able to do period.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, the only complaint I can come up with is that it doesnt like many hours of sweaty activity along with naturaly oily skin.  </li>
            <li>, I did not tell them the second thing I did(wearing the secret lift); they will have to figure that one out on their own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li>Yes, when you use your fingers to pull your face back, you look incredibly young!</li>
            <li>, I had Zero trouble putting the tape and bands on the very first time.</li>
            <li>Also i had to put little clips over the top cord so it wouldn&#x27;t show when the wind blew or in case some other hair-raising thing happened&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it slips, it pulls by the ear causing major pain.</li>
            <li>well  with major improvement until I watched videos and saw my mistakes.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little practice, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a subtle but fresh appearance.</li>
            <li>The main problem is, is that there is not enough elastic cords in the pack, one face lift cord is simply not enough compared with all the pads that are included</li>
            <li>so I hope this company will put their extra cord packs on Amazon (I know they sell them) for us to purchase at the same time as the main pack.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s incredibly cheapy and stupid.  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions and tried several times, but could not escape what seems to be the sheer physics of it: the tapes hold okay, but one slender point of contact with the skin on each side of the face, is incapable of lifting the entire area in a way which is useful or vaguely natural-looking.     </li>
            <li>My hair totally covers the clear tape.  </li>
            <li>For the price I was surprised by how well it actually works.</li>
            <li>I just got my instant face tapes in the mail today I have had them on for 5 hours so far</li>
            <li>With my second purchase of this product I was shopping with my thirty something son and ran into an old friend.</li>
            <li>I have spent much money on lifting/firming cremes, tightening serums, etc.</li>
            <li>purchased these direct from CosmeSearch only because in the ad on Amazon I could not find an option for choice of color.</li>
            <li>I can give a critical opinion with concise words than a bunch of words.</li>
            <li>first thing I must say my product arrived just in time sooner than I expected, Now back to OH</li>
            <li>The next day, I had hot pink marks where the pads  and my skin had been.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most of the poor reviews, for me the tape did stick.</li>
            <li>They are kind of difficult to see</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughters wedding, it took several attempts to get it right, but once I got the hang of it, this is a cheap facelift, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>The negative report must have come from the original lift.</li>
            <li>and I set them pretty tight, but I swab the area where I&#x27;m going to place them with alcohol</li>
            <li>The tapes held tight the first time I applied and rubbed them as directed.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using these for photographs, job interviews, and social events.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, the adhesive turns your skin red and mine left a sore and then scabbed.</li>
            <li>and I wear the tapes to work, to social events, etc.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and recently received compliments from friends coworkers and strangers and can only attribute this to the face lift tapes</li>
            <li>The video also tells you it may take a little practice to get it exactly how you want it.</li>
            <li>It was not really difficult to place, you have to play a little once or twice to get it positioned the way you like it.</li>
            <li>, I know with it on, I look as good (if not better) as my younger family members and friends who are all at least five-ten years younger than me.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a new set of bands through the company BUT was unaware that face bands meant only 1/2 of the entire set...that portion for the upper face.  </li>
            <li>The tapes were simple to use and I finally got rid of the sagging chicken neck, fun and easy.</li>
            <li>&quot; My pastor is very observant and during the sermon, he kept looking directly at me</li>
            <li>Now that I have the routine down, it takes about 3 minutes to get everything into place and ready to go.</li>
            <li>The adhesive on the tape is very, very strong, and I have never had them fail, even in the heat of the deep South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I was skeptical of buying this product because of some of the negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Got new one and stretch it carefully.  </li>
            <li>only difficulty I seem to be having is the elastics tend to slip down toward the base of my skull - I get the best results with them placed a little higher up.</li>
            <li>Not good with thin hair, otherwise works great</li>
            <li>I recently went to a conference where my picture was taken and posted on social media</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first, but I saw this in a magazine and thought about it some more, before finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>the bands are not long enough causing the stickers to come off.</li>
            <li>She is self conscious about some of the \\&quot;loose skin\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The tapes stuck really well for me and the ones for the face I even cut in half as they were too big.</li>
            <li>It took me quite a little time to really apply the tabs in the correct position.  </li>
            <li>You need to play around with placement a little bit to ensure that the tape doesn&#x27;t show and lifts the area where needed, but you can absolutely delay surgery and fillers.</li>
            <li>getting the elastic in place under my hair was a little trickier - I needed a couple of attempts to figure out how much hair to lift up and how to style it over the elastics without displacing them.</li>
            <li>It was a little strange feeling at first after I got the bands secured, but you acclimate to the feeling in about an hour and do not notice it.</li>
            <li>They are hard to remove and I would fresh ones daily.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Excellent, thanks for do a great costumer service !!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a wonderful thing to feel good while looking Good:-)</li>
            <li> It is great for the special occasions when you want to look your best.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyoune wanting to look good for an occasion.  </li>
            <li> All in all a good shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product and found that it worked realy good for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for the day.  </li>
            <li> The tapes work wonderfully and are comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> On (3-26-2012) I need to add some good news,  I went to my hair dresser and she used a concealer on the tape</li>
            <li> Takes away a good 15yrs off my face.</li>
            <li> good before you put the tapes on.</li>
            <li> But if the cord slips after about 10 minutes, what good is it?</li>
            <li> They just make me feel so good &amp; look good.</li>
            <li> , My husband is going to wonder why after all these years I&#x27;m still looking good</li>
            <li> Does what is advertised and fairly comfotable, but was a bit tricky to learn how to apply correctly when all alone.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised, but there is a fair amount of effort required to install and conceal the tapes on ones face.</li>
            <li> be fair</li>
            <li> The surgery didn&#x27;t life as good as with these.  </li>
            <li> They made good of MY mistake..and that was actually good business on their part.  </li>
            <li> but i am not telling any of my friends they all keep saying how good</li>
            <li> for night out or day when you want to look good ..</li>
            <li> Usually, a good improvement can be obtained if you concentrate your efforts at the cheekbones.</li>
            <li> so you can get a good idea of where to place the tapes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my sister&#x27;s friend used it and loved the difference it made.</li>
            <li> but when you do, you will get good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for light wear.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> This is truly a remarkable product - sort of like a magical transformation for a 24-hour period!  </li>
            <li> excellent product ,stays in place, just followed the directions exactly for great results.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for the special occasion, just not permanent.</li>
            <li> but lol you have to really work with it, to get best results.</li>
            <li> Best product out there - LOVE LOVE them.  </li>
            <li> People kept telling me how good I looked (I need to order more as I was testing to see if they truly worked!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I cannot tell you how over the top happy I am.</li>
            <li> Great product, wish it came with a couple more of the elastic bands though.</li>
            <li> the cord was a better quality, these could work great.</li>
            <li> It does have some lifting effects and I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> lol you will get better sticking power if you do.</li>
            <li> Sure a facelift looks great if you imagine it and put your fingers to your face and lift the way the model is in the picture...</li>
            <li> Again I am very very pleased</li>
            <li> I would love to know who makes the tape because it is great on the skin</li>
            <li> All in all an excellent shopping experience, very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Customer service was awesome also &amp; very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> It takes some trial and error to find best placement but the package does advise to try without using the tape first</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You will love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> The usage is better than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> I will continue using them, they are the greatest alternative to surgery or botox, very affordable too!</li>
            <li> I love my secretlift!</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use, have used them for years.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is every woman&#x27;s easy answer to looking great without surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery was excellent, I received these items more quickly than when I ordered goods from my own country.   </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Well, to my surprise, the result was amazing.  </li>
            <li> So amazing, in fact that I cancelled my appointment with the surgeon.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I do not understand the reviews that say this project is effective.</li>
            <li> but i made the mistake of buying them because there are so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because you can adjust the lifting.</li>
            <li> awesome and really work</li>
            <li> Face does not work to good but love neck one.  </li>
            <li> They are nice to have for that boost of confidence.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I just can&#x27;t imagine how that could happen.</li>
            <li> This is a good alternative to surgery a non-painful way to look and feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li> Really, give these a try, you will be very impressed.  </li>
            <li> This really is the best company!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Practice really does make perfect.</li>
            <li> Also, if its a warm day and you perspire, the tapes will tend to slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I then use a warm hair dryer while rubbing the tape</li>
            <li> I never got it to work, probably my own problem</li>
            <li> I am totally thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> The tapes smooth out that area very nicely.  </li>
            <li> ,  Wothout those Lifts, I truly felt I might as well just turn around and go home, so great was my dependence on the significant appearance-booster of the Lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great work very well defiantly take 5 years away quickly from my under eye area Love This product!!!!</li>
            <li> but it would be great for a special event.</li>
            <li> Works great for a special events.</li>
            <li> I use it for a special occasion when I&#x27;m going out and want to look great.</li>
            <li> So if u wear your hair close and around your face they are a good idea for a special day!</li>
            <li> That allows me to wear the elastic under my hair, where it&#x27;s a great deal more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is a great concept for a quick fix-</li>
            <li> I think this is great for a quick photo for friends who haven&#x27;t seen you in a while.  </li>
            <li> Its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Works more effectively on jowls.</li>
            <li> Since many had great to good results with this product, I really couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it.  </li>
            <li> Great fun.</li>
            <li> Not as easy as it looks!</li>
            <li> Truly easy to use and takes years off!  </li>
            <li> Makes your wrinkles very fine and unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I feel so much more confident and peppy when I go out.</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying the concept is great</li>
            <li> what we do to stay pretty lol</li>
            <li> GREAT customer service, I send an email asking a question and they respond fast!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too good to be true...</li>
            <li> I found them very comfortable and not noticable to anyone.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very comfortable, and I wear them every day.</li>
            <li> Held very securely</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and literally undetectable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product out of curiosity, mostly because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This is fine for every day kind of use when I don&#x27;t feel like anyone would be scrutinizing</li>
            <li> And they are HUGE!</li>
            <li> I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I will order more of the face tapes.</li>
            <li> and  I tried many time.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It does have some lifting effects and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> make sure you scrape the hair in front of the ears</li>
            <li> My youngest son 17yrs said from the top of the stairs</li>
            <li> i ordered two orders and i am not a paid sponsor , just a woman looking to feel better about herself and with Confidenence now.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> but I put makeup on top of them and it makes abig difference.  </li>
            <li> I love these tapes, they take 10 years off my sagging face.  </li>
            <li> (like over night) I have been using them for more than a year with NO PROBLEMS, but beware of the wind</li>
            <li> I have ordered five sets (I think) of these now and will keep purchasing until I need something more invasive.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t fakey looking for me - seems like it just makes me look more rested and refreshed which is what I was looking for anyway.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully and I looked so much younger.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s got to be a better way.</li>
            <li> I might even report item this product to the better business bureau.</li>
            <li> Better than cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li> Be sure there is no oil on the skin where you will be placing the tapes to be sure they adhere well...</li>
            <li> Bought this mostly as a gag gift.</li>
            <li> Hilarious.</li>
            <li> I like, Love, what I had order,some things need time to work still.</li>
            <li> then I tied the bands on top of my head</li>
            <li> but I dont have many of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> Love them Love them Love them</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love using it when I go to parties where people haven&#x27;t seen me in a while.  </li>
            <li> but it works like magic.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product made my wedding a memorable experience.</li>
            <li> have recommended this to friends and they love it to.</li>
            <li> maybe with alittle more practice I can fix I t around the ears.</li>
            <li> Be sure to cleanse your application site with rubbing alcohol as it helps the tape to adhere better.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> use it for wedding and events, makes your pictures look so much better.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>

            <li> I am wanting to be able to look in the mirror and not have to go.... &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You look years younger; of course this is vanity at its best.  </li>
            <li> like I am, this is the best alternative beside facial exercises.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I feel so much better about my appearance.</li>

            <li> I get so many comments, \\&quot;have you changed your hair, working out?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> so I was able to cover the tapes.  </li>
            <li> It sure made a difference in my photos - took years off of me.</li>
            <li> You will glad that you did, and of course, without the surgical expense!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> that was stressing me out and making more wrinkles</li>
            <li> These do a much better job.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of this, but I&#x27;m way more self consious of who can notice this on me.  </li>
            <li> I ordered them and when they arrived, they were nothing more than pieces of tape.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-aging skin products with no results.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure when I order if it what I wanted</li>
            <li> I was sure this item was a hoak</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly pleased with my inexpensive face lift.</li>
            <li> However, I have been able to figure out a way to use them for my chin and neck.  </li>
            <li> It does lift the cheeks and I was able to hide the tabs with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but once you have it give one more confidence to go out in the world.</li>
            <li> i love these</li>
            <li> make sure you wipe where u are going to stick tapes with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over a year now and love it.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY.</li>
            <li> MORE</li>
            <li> love the idea, on me you could not see anything, and it did lift my neck and make a difference, but it caused blistering even though they are supposed to be hypoallergenic, which I assumed meant like surgical tape.</li>
            <li> maybe you will have better luck then</li>
            <li> I would love to know and maybe try again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> it is even better.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these !</li>
            <li> and there are many many uses I can think of for it.  </li>
            <li> The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts!</li>
            <li> In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li> This ensures all-day adhesionGreat product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li> Who says that Sexy has to be 25, I&#x27;m 65 and holding.</li>
            <li> It disappeared like magic.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product</li>
            <li> so I need to cut more layers in my hair to start using the face lift application where it goes on top of your head...</li>
            <li> It does hurt to remove the tapes when you&#x27;re done, but surgery would hurt more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool to feel more competitive at work and attractive for special events or even for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I really does wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disepointed !!!!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li> This product is nice for a special event or a photo shoot.  </li>
            <li> This will also give you a pretty good idea of what a mini face lift will do for you.</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing a review ever, but I feel good about sharing my experience with &amp;#</li>
            <li> Works best with medium or long hair so you can pull the hair forward and cover any tell-tale signs.  </li>
            <li> you, God for this amazing little, wonderful creation.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Although skeptical at first I honestly have to say this is one of the best and cheapest solutions I&#x27;ve found for looking great!</li>
            <li> I got really excited about it too!</li>
            <li> it is a great product we use it for live performances  face enhancement in class.</li>
            <li> I will be back to buy more of this incredible product.</li>
            <li> By the way, I use the lifts more than once, just make sure you clean the area of all makeup, oils, face cream etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from cleaning the skin real good, to using alcohol on my skin to make sure it was clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say except that the neck and face lifts are fantastic, I don&#x27;t need to go under the knife now</li>
            <li> Wow, does this product work great.  </li>
            <li> I put alcohol on the area for the tape to make sure my skin was free of oils and that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> However, it works, the wrinkles, most importantly sagging goes away.</li>
            <li> Your friends and family will be amazed at how young you look, and won&#x27;t have a clue (lol).  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe what i was seeing my face transformed  right in front of my own eyes....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today was my first day of wearing them and so far I love them !!!</li>
            <li> That is a true testimony that they do, indeed, work!  </li>
            <li> Would like to return it for a full refund!</li>
            <li> The tapes are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> wow,this is so amazing,results are great,so easy to apply,and the tape holds,i will never be without it,simple</li>
            <li> the video showed how to use the product in a way easy to understand.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use for me.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li> You can easily see the adhesive tape that is placed in front of the ears</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE....</li>
            <li> Easy to use and greta results.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Be sure you clean area</li>
            <li> it took seconds as easy as putting on a head band.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s easy as applying a band-aid (although I goof once in a while).</li>
            <li> Breaks easy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> THE TAPES WERE ABOUT AS STRONG AND, STICKY, AS SCOTCH TAPE.....</li>
            <li> The adhesive tapes are strong and hold all day.</li>
            <li> better then nothing right!</li>
            <li> This product reassures me that I do not need to spend mega bucks right now Just had $1,000.00 worth of fillers in marionette lines around mouth and some in cheeks (need more) which  helped me tremendously, but with the addition of the tapes, my face looks truly sensational..</li>
            <li> so it lifts just fine for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and the elastic bands got tangled</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable &amp; lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> Had no problem with the tape, cleaned the area with alcohol and it sticks just fine.</li>
            <li> The tapes work fine.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is amazing, I love it</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it makes a HUGE difference in how my neck looks.</li>
            <li> and I wanted the light.  </li>
            <li> Bumy face look younger but with these tapesit looks great now</li>
            <li> I use the light color and have strawberry blond hair and you can&#x27;t see a thing.  </li>
            <li> There are times when I am tired or make up just doesn&#x27;t cut it, and when I wear these, everyone tells me how great I look, and I feel better knowing I look good....</li>
            <li> I had my doubts and they were confirmed upon using (or trying to use this product).  </li>
            <li> Could  be useful if  better made.</li>
            <li> This did wonders for me at a recent holiday party, people said I looked great</li>
            <li> They are fun trying to see howmuch better you can look.</li>
            <li> So happy I finally found them.</li>
            <li> they are comfortable, don&#x27;t even know you have them on.  </li>
            <li> They stay in place all day, they are not visible to others and once I got used to them, they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Also they are comfortable; they just feel like your wearing a headband.  </li>
            <li> and it is secure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a crossdreser and it really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> I use the neck lift tapes and I greatly recommend the product, is practically invisible, you just have to know how to place it properly; takes some practice</li>
            <li> It is fantastic for me.  </li>
            <li> The comments are &amp;#34;You look fantastic what are you using, &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t  know</li>
            <li> this whole exercise was a good laugh at myself for falling for this one.</li>
            <li> It always feel so good to hear the many compliments on how much younger I look for my age.</li>
            <li> My hairstyle completely covers the tapes, but my skin is so fair, the tape just seems disappears into my skin anyway.</li>
            <li> Works really well, however the side adhesive is abit on the big side, It would be perfect if the adhesive was skin colour .</li>
            <li> and that is actually good enough to make me feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you want to look amazing without having to go under the knive.</li>
            <li> If you have hot flashes and get warm, they pop right off your skin.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s worth it)!</li>
            <li> But when all is said and done it is a straightforward item.</li>
            <li> First time I used them they stayed on most of the day...</li>
            <li> Duct tape would probably work better (and now comes in designer colors  ;-)</li>
            <li> These are great if you have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> u have to make sure you use alcohol pads on skin first.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> A great way to hide those wrinkles if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li> What fun!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy, inexpensive, and fun.  </li>
            <li> Wow am so happy thanks to this company and amazon for putting it out there.</li>
            <li> used baby wipes to thoriughly clean the areas where the tapes were to stick</li>
            <li> just clean that area</li>
            <li> Sticks to your skin with tape that won&#x27;t stick no matter how clean your skin is.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, that truly delivers the look of a more firm and toned neck.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t stick, I used a cotton ball to clean the neck area</li>
            <li> NOT the darn things would not stick to my clean skin (by my ears)  </li>
            <li> Clean off the area of skin where the tape will go with alcohol...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy, super affordable and gives me the look I want.  </li>
            <li> other thing I noticed is that the company has excellent customer service; they respond right away to inquiries and once when the elastic band broke, they sent a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> had one fly loose in a grocery store....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable to wear, and does exactly what it says--</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub the tape as long as the directions say, and you&#x27;ll love this product too!</li>
            <li> Works OK in certain situations depending on the hairstyle</li>
            <li> Be prepared to have plenty of back-ups in your purse if you are out for a special occasion because you will need them.</li>
            <li> I will use it again for shorter periods, like special events.</li>
            <li> Whenever I have a special occasion, I put this on.</li>
            <li> I am flipping out right now!</li>
            <li> Right!</li>
            <li> A little tricky the first time, but practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li> I use to use them when I would go to a special event, but now I love them so much,</li>
            <li> Only good for indoor special occasions.  </li>
            <li> far as the effect, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> many thanks</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom, who is 60+ and has recently lost a good bit of weight.</li>
            <li> GOT A FULL REFUND FROM SELLER.</li>
            <li> It makes ME feel better about myself, I don&#x27;t really care about others.</li>
            <li> Also, you cannot see anything... and honestly if when the wind is blowing and some young, whipper snapper says anything about these to me...</li>
            <li> This item is phenomenal, it really works.  </li>
            <li> True statement</li>
            <li> Nothing it advertises about it is true.</li>
            <li> Good and simple idea</li>
            <li> As for using the tapes as a full face lift, its not something that I have done.</li>
            <li> I found myself lifting my skin on my face daily as I look in a mirror and always wished I could look that good again.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of a face lift, save yourself from all the pain and suffering and try the instant face and neck lift, you will be amazed, my friends and family think that I look really good and years younger too, believe me it is a fantastic buy and so amazing</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t work, no major investment lost, and if they do, the results can be startlingly good.</li>
            <li> if I was lucky.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It was  a worthy effort.</li>
            <li> always looking for the next best thing to look younger.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I was home.</li>
            <li> I expected better ease of use along with some kind of result.  </li>
            <li> About 6-7 hours if you aren&#x27;t being super hot/sweaty before any slippage occures..</li>
            <li> it realy does work, it might take couple of times to get the hang of where to stick the tapes, the best one is the neck one, i have short hair at the back  and the lenght just cover the elastic..</li>
            <li> Instant Face Lift is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> And I use it every day :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and oh make sure to order</li>
            <li> very satisfied with INSTANT FACE AND NECK TAPES, THEREFORE, WOULD SUGGEST TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.</li>
            <li> Just used the neck one for the very first time today</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times and have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have reordered this product several times now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants to do it the easy way without surgery</li>
            <li> Its so easy and fast..</li>
            <li> first so the tape is on a super clean surface.</li>
            <li> I would ask them why they were asking, and they would just look at me and say, \\&quot;I am not sure, but you really look great today\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li> Probably was meant more for someone that doesn&#x27;t have that much of a problem in the first place.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product!!</li>
            <li> The company was very helpful, in fact they sent me a free set of cords when I asked if I could purchase them seperately.    </li>
            <li> but with my straight, smooth hair&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they are worth every penny..</li>
            <li> I have found that the secret lift works as it claims to work, giving a surprising and amazing result.  </li>
            <li> IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> Crack a smile</li>
            <li> Nice to look in a mirror and see the face I had a decade ago and not my grandma looking back at me!</li>
            <li> Get many compliments on how young I look (I&#x27;m 63).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these are worth every cent</li>
            <li> it worth it</li>
            <li> Get your Tapes and Smile the years</li>
            <li> It is nice for an instant, though.</li>
            <li> Make sure the area to be taped and your fingers are clear of all oils, etc before taping.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I was concerned about my inherited  laugh lines and jowels appearance.  </li>
            <li> some good as well as the not so good ....and said y not its not tht expensive ......</li>
            <li> on you makeup because you will see a difference and your smile will reflect the way you feel.  </li>
            <li> The neck tape came off alot, especially if I got warm.</li>
            <li> Under where the tape had been there were now water filled blisters on both sides, and in one spot the tape ripped the skin off the top of one of them leaving me with an open wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it when I want to look extra nice.  </li>
            <li> It is really worth it, though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They were an unmitigated success.</li>
            <li> It is maybe worth $0.20, cause</li>
            <li> but when I did I look up and said Thank you lord because let me tell you this little amazing product does exactly like it shows on the videos easy to put on, The tape sticks very well and may the truth be spoken if I can give more stars than</li>
            <li> They might take a bit getting used to (I got used to them right away) but to look \\&quot;uplifted\\&quot; again, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I get the  medical tape at Wall Greens and it is very cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Gently clean the area with olive oil and then warm soapy water and a terry cloth rag at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth</li>
            <li> Hot flashes and sweating causes the tape to come undone quickly.</li>
            <li> Positioning the tape was also not a problem, I was lucky to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> make sure you clean then area properly with alcohol cleanser</li>
            <li> Does feel good on face but other than that nothing</li>
            <li> I exerciise and try to eat right, keep my weight in check, but my genes dictated that my lower face would \\&quot;jowl\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> May take a couple times to get it right.</li>
            <li> but when I called them they mailed me the correct color right away, gratis.</li>
            <li> Maybe they did not use them right?</li>
            <li> I applied the tape right in front of my ears and lift.</li>
            <li> I am over the moon right now.</li>
            <li> exactly right</li>
            <li> Right now I am beside myself</li>
            <li> a set positioned right the string kept sliding in my hair and looked ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Absolutely must clean all areas, including hands, of oils.  </li>
            <li> The tapes are simple to apply and the great thing is the same kind of tape is used for both neck and face, the skin needs to be clean and dry before you apply the tapes</li>
            <li> I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance?</li>
            <li> Also, it is hard to hide the tape around the ears, but again, for a quick, deceitful photo, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I try to hide them as far back as I can, but they really are more effective the closer to the side of your face as you can put them.  </li>
            <li> For anything more, they&#x27;re more trouble than what they&#x27;re worth.</li>
            <li> Great for a few hours!</li>
            <li> The few times I contacted CosmeSearch, their Customer Service was impeccable.</li>
            <li> I am now going to experiment and leave it on to see just how long the sticky pads will stay stuck to my face to give me confidence when I go out as I don&#x27;t want them pinging off when my face gets warm.   </li>
            <li> So for me, I love this little gadget and will keep on using until I just can&#x27;t pick my face up anymore :-)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very sure about this product at first, but I was curious.  </li>
            <li> The directions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> this is truly a amazing product they will pull your eyes up like it says a instant face lift highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> You just have to make sure the area where you are applying the tapes is clean and dry, otherwise the tapes will not stick.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t that comfortable for all day, but OK for special occasions of a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to clean and dry area first, I use alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I simply place the tapes right in front of my ears, hook it on top, style my hair</li>
            <li> If you take your time and read the instructions properly then it is very effective and lasts throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> The product is very very inexpensive, fully guaranteed and returnable?</li>
            <li> really substitutes for a surgical procedure that costs plenty and really, why go through all that drama??!!</li>
            <li> But it actually works, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!)</li>
            <li> DermaGen Anti-wrinkle patches have visibly reduced my fine lines and I have experienced smoother, softer skin after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> I liked this item; it works good for a special event or a day where you might look extra tired.</li>
            <li> Hey - maybe ya&#x27;ll simply figured it out better than I could.</li>
            <li> BUT--I watched the Youtube \\&quot;how to\\&quot; before using, and did EXACTLY as recommended.</li>
            <li> This REALLY works on &amp;#34;uncreping&amp;#34; my neck!  </li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> It took 20 years off my face within 5 minutes and as a first time buyer, i had no difficulties</li>
            <li> The tapes are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The face ones lift cheeks and jawline and if placed higher lift eyes.</li>
            <li> The tapes are pretty transparent on me</li>
            <li> Cannot be compared and the price is just reasonable!</li>
            <li> was very embarassing!</li>
            <li> You want the face to be lifted the exact same direction the muscle did when it was more toned.  </li>
            <li> I want to be able to use it again, but I could never use it again the next day.</li>
            <li> The crows feet went away and my eyebrows looked higher.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I always first cleanse the area with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I told them the first thing I did</li>
            <li> I tried it the first day, and never used it again.</li>
            <li> exactly what area you are trying to lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recomend using a moisturizer first  </li>
            <li> First of all, I do like the face lift tapes</li>
            <li> I first thought this was funny</li>
            <li> so I put the tape up higher and the barb was sticking between my face and ear.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I buy for second time :-)</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I saw a difference and a lift.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with your product, younger appearance in seconds.</li>
            <li> Seriously they are wonderful, the only issue is the tapes when you try to take them off, use baby oil or a moisturizer as they do stick like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starbun..</li>
            <li> all I can say is try the product if you want to look about 10 years younger in a safe way</li>
            <li> The first pad went on</li>
            <li> The tape does not stick and you are able to see it if u have short hair.</li>
            <li> Ladies, I am 63 and no one ever guesses my age and its really due to this fabulous company and product!!  </li>
            <li> I was getting married and wanted to lift my sagging neck.  </li>
            <li> ok for a short time.  </li>
            <li> Ok guys, two hours later, numbereous attemts  </li>
            <li> I had to learn how to use them correctly, but once I was able to utilize properly, I am convinced that these tapes do wonders for the spirit.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to tease your hair in the back to hide the rubber band it comes with.</li>
            <li> As a female who has always taken care to wear sunscreen, eat healthy, not smoke, ect</li>
            <li> (I cleaned with alcohol first);</li>
            <li> Tape is very flimsy!  </li>
            <li> Tape doesn&#x27;t stick very well!  </li>
            <li> THe longer the tape is on the more my skin itches and becomes puffy and red and itchy afterwards and even while its on.  </li>
            <li> Would be much better on short haired people that can brush their hair over the tape and have their hair not move out of place.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> When I first heard of this product I thought &amp;#34;really?&amp;#34; But decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> If you order the bands from the company be aware that the neck band and the face bands are two seperate products.</li>
            <li> She can now look younger for her birthday party and feel better about herself.</li>
            <li> Depending on where you need the most lift, you will have to part your hair around the back of your head (a horizontal part) to allow space for the elastic.  </li>
            <li> Practice lifting your cheeks towards your temples first</li>
            <li> Love you instant face</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> (hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> The results are exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday &amp; can&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li> after 2 emails  they satisfied my request and replaced the bands with blonde ones.</li>
            <li> Love the product and have purchased from CosmeSearch numerous times.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quick fix ( ladies fifty plus), use to go to weddings, family reunions, high school, college reunions.  </li>
            <li> Cosemesearch company was very patient and kind and did respond to every single message I sent them .  </li>
            <li> If I wash my face, and apply these tapes, they will stay on all day, and I have to GENTLY pull them off at night, or they will rip my skin right off.</li>
            <li> The instructions state clearly to remove all makeup in front of your ears, clean the area</li>
            <li> I can see a difference, but it&#x27;s definitely subtle (which is great for a $15 product -</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, and want to use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the perfect placement</li>
            <li> they do work, but it took over a week for my neck to heal,left marks like love bites only very painful.to</li>
            <li> I love this product this is truly a middle class woman facelift ( can&#x27;t afford the real thing)</li>
            <li> Sometimes the tapes show, but I am not concerned, since the positive &amp;#34;out way&amp;#34; the negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, the model used in the video didn&#x27;t look like she needed much of a lift.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> The tapes went on easily, stuck tight and the luckily I got the placement right the first time.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it right the first time you have to use two new patches.</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s best to \\&quot;hide them under a wig\\&quot; but you&#x27;d seriously have to shave your head and wear a wig on your pulled back baldness to make these things work.</li>
            <li> I only use the Face lift tape they are so easy to use</li>
            <li> I reall like the results, easy enough to put on .</li>
            <li> The concept is simple and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> certainly help.  </li>
            <li> (but then I am a woman of a certain age, and I&#x27;ve lost 100 pounds</li>
            <li> I will certainly order again</li>
            <li> I will try it one more time when these blisters heal with the barbs on the outside and also I will not clean the oil from that area first as I don&#x27;t have oily skin and maybe that will be better.</li>
            <li> The seller was super fast and professional.</li>
            <li> It looked fine but simply doesn&#x27;t have the stickyness needed to hold in place.</li>
            <li> The neck lift works fine as it pulls the skin back and holds.</li>
            <li> They definitely pull fine lines from my chin and neck lines.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing what a little adhesive and a couple of elastic string can do.  </li>
            <li> The product REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> untill I really need it.</li>
            <li> Really cleanse the skin with non oily toner before applying tape.</li>
            <li> It will NOT get rid of wrinkles though, so really just expect a lifted look.</li>
            <li> this product really works.</li>
            <li> WAS VERY HOPEFUL...</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think a rubber band could work, but once I stuck the tapes on and hid the rubber bands under my hair...</li>
            <li> No Kidding, I absolutely cannot go anywhere without out them.</li>
            <li> It really depends on your skin coloring, hair type and style and</li>
            <li> and this works very well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am 40I don&#x27;t need too much lift</li>
            <li> they absolutely lifted my confidence too.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> course the price is reasonable, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product as the elastics were broken and couldn&#x27;t us them at all.  </li>
            <li> It will lift your face but it is very difficulty to hide the adhesive lifts</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to adhesive and the fixture used did not react with me at all - a real plus.</li>
            <li> It is very shuttle</li>
            <li> This face lifting kit really works well.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it do what it says it does, but it is comfortable as well.  </li>
            <li> They are very discreet, and will keep it&#x27;s hold all night.</li>
            <li> Thanks Again.</li>
            <li> Even if they would they are still very visable.</li>
            <li> Elastic bands to secure tape in place broke instantly.</li>
            <li> Ready for an evening event?  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> For now old age is gone and it&#x27;s fun to look 40 when I am 50.</li>
            <li> My mom really likes this product.</li>
            <li> As I said before you got to really work with it.</li>
            <li> This face lifting kit really works well for me.</li>
            <li> Any suggestions are appreciated.</li>
            <li> The stickers come undone which could be very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> these work great for a temporary lift on days when I am tired or haven&#x27;t gotten the rest required.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real joke.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to a young, fresh face.</li>
            <li> These tapes and bands are fantastic, I look and feel years younger.</li>
            <li> Very unnatural.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It really does take 10 years off me.</li>
            <li> And yes the filler works really well too, but that is aother story.</li>
            <li> Very unnoticeable</li>
            <li> the person that took my re-order was very nice&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> very help...</li>
            <li> You cannot really see the tape because they are transparent.  </li>
            <li> ( the only color that was available through Amazon when I ordered).  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, it stays on well</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying the Pro Instant Lift once it beomes available again.</li>
            <li> ony thing is for this to really work, you CAN see the plastic  adhesive tabs.  </li>
            <li> , the problem is that it does not fix very well for enought period of time during the day</li>
            <li> The tapes held very well, although there is a woman on YouTube demonstrating how to put them on which was very informative, but she said to wear the barbs(the things that hook on to the tape) on the inside of the tape, the instructions don&#x27;t tell you what side they should be on.</li>
            <li> really ?</li>
            <li> It REALLY works for me.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> the stickers are very noticeable no matter how you try to cover them.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really is a mini face lift and</li>
            <li> Their shipping time is extremely fast and I appreciate that factor.</li>
            <li> I live in Maryland where summers are hot and very humid so the toughest test has yet to happen  </li>
            <li> I will recommend it to everyone I know that is interested im somethings as instant quick a painless</li>
            <li> I had no trouble getting the tape to stick right in front of my ears</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment</li>
            <li> but I was able to grab it and rip it off the other side before it was noticed.</li>
            <li> It lifted more on one side than the other</li>
            <li> It is pretty comfortable, actually more so than the thin elastic Cosme Search elastic neck band which often cuts into my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think these tapes are amazing in so many different ways, especially because they are hidden when wearing them.  </li>
            <li> worked great the first time i tried it...really made a difference - but was sad when i had to take them off.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, you have to follow the instructions and you definitely need medium to long hair in the front of you</li>
            <li> I use the lift tapes everyday and I find them very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and then some for special occasions, or to wear out in public.</li>
            <li> I had only intended to use them for special occasions</li>
            <li> Of course, you can apply the miracle tabs with the bands each morning in very little time and the results are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stick as well as I had hoped, it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to wear for long periods.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too far gone and need the real thing - surgery!</li>
            <li> My final opinion on these are: If you are only using them for a night out and you aren&#x27;t going to be sweating much, they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not paid to say these things, but it&#x27;s true, the Instant Face and Eye Lift is a life changer!!!</li>
            <li> I was truly and placently surprised to see that it works exactly how it says.  </li>
            <li> I applied it correctly the FIRST TIME surprisingly and the results were so dramatic it put a lil lump in my throat.</li>
            <li> The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Instant Face Lift Tapes for several years now and absolutely love the difference they make.  </li>
            <li> Which makes me look older than my years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and always thought I  looked a lot older.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman.  </li>
            <li> My main concern is underside my chin area, with the sagging.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use the neck lift, but I have been meaning to try the rest of the product.  </li>
            <li> I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thinking about it, the price is high for some tape and rubber bands.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend CosmeSearch and their products.</li>
            <li> Obviously, they don&#x27;t work for everyone, hence the one star reviews, but I would certainly recommend trying them if you are interested in a quick fix to look a bit younger and fresher.</li>
            <li> To feel more confident you could add a few bobby pins with hair spray to ensure all is hidden.</li>
            <li> I wish the elastic bands were a little more invisible but you can&#x27;t have everything.  </li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> sticks very well lasting all day as long as you clean the oil off your face first.  </li>
            <li> (it just does so much for my morale to look in the mirror and see the me of 10 years ago)I went directly to the site and ordered the refill tapes.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol to clean your skin and then let it dry a few minutes before you stick it on.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t need to clean my face with alcohol because I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed and surprised how much they worked.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting a mini face lift for a few years now, but have mot been able to save the $$ to do so.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and mostly time.these never stay in place longer than&lt;br /&gt;1minute</li>
            <li> The remarks I received were few, but the looks and the thoughts were many.  </li>
            <li> I was interacting with them normally</li>
            <li> Like many others I read a few of the reviews 1st....</li>
            <li> The secret lift is good for The Nasolabial folds.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get grandma out of my face in less than five minutes!</li>
            <li> It seemed like such a great idea, but the adhesive was not strong enough to hold the bands in place.</li>
            <li> and I dont have to go back to see my doctor for botox right now.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m wearing a strip of medical tape to hold up my neck and jaw line.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pull it really tight just enough for a nice lift</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this wonderful little secret...</li>
            <li> I live in a windy city, so i try not to go out on those days.  </li>
            <li> but I can live with them and these also do not help with wrinkles</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Now I have to order a new band.</li>
            <li> So, live and learn, always trust your instincts</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the slight tightening of my jowl line which was really bothering me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use for a few hours not a whole day.</li>
            <li> Very surprised how well this product performed.  </li>
            <li> would imagine sweatingwill cause the tape to loosen, since I live in the south I will report back and update on what happens as the hot humid weather kicks in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, but after a while it may start hurting and can actually peel off some skin if you keep it on for too long.</li>
            <li> When you order this, there is no way to order the color, light or dark.  </li>
            <li> The direct site is charging me $1.88 to ship via US mail!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty simple and does what it says it will do-</li>
            <li> For those who have had unsatisfactory results I would suggest trying the tapes in slightly different positions, higher or lower, in front of the ear and maybe adjusting the placement of your hook at your hair&#x27;s crown.  </li>
            <li> at first I thought it was a joke and another money scam, but further investigation led me to the video and at that point I had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> To get the strongest hold, you must wipe the area with alcohol first, and position the tape as close to your ear as possible.</li>
            <li> Since the order this past time was through Amazon, (because they had a better deal)</li>
            <li> the product was completely different like from the first time I order. ....</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I would because when they said facelift without surgery wow!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since  7 months ago, when I tried them as a last ditch effort in preparing for my first wedding at the age of 40.  </li>
            <li> I had big welts by ears the first time.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who is interested in looking younger but cannot afford cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I only use it for the neck area.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and if placed correctly a little foundation will cover the tapes.  </li>
            <li> They are not the most comfortable, again, not sure if it is because I havent completly figured it out yet, but they do seem to last a long time and make a difference in the appearance of sagging neck and jowels.</li>
            <li> I recoemmend setting aside one set of tapes to \\&quot;play around with\\&quot; in terms of placement, especially if you want to look especially well for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I wear them almost everyday, and they are so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Before I started using them, I really didn&#x27;t feel like going to social events with my skin sagging.</li>
            <li> My first couple of tries with the tape I really thought it was not going to work</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it begins to hurt around my ears after many hours</li>
            <li> I actually wear the secret lift near my eyes and amazingly it lifts my jaw area as well!</li>
            <li> This really is a very clever discreet solution that punches well above</li>
            <li> Everyone wants less wrinkles, right?  </li>
            <li> But you really need to work on positioning the tape in the right place to make it less visible.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always trying to make sure that my hair by my ears is covering the tape which is extremly hard to do on windy days.  </li>
            <li> - I will SPRAY the clear tab with Gray Away tinted spray and that will camoflauge the clear adhesive.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants to have get botox or plastic surgery but can&#x27;t afford it, I promise the Instant Face and Neck Tape Lift Tapes work...</li>
            <li> I just received my order and I immediately put them on and WOW...</li>
            <li> but since there isn&#x27;t.... I would not waste my money on these again.....:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and no my face is not on the floor</li>
            <li> My mouth would look contorted if I pulled back to much.</li>
            <li> This product will change you whole look, however do not attempt to wear in the summer months outside.  </li>
            <li> I would send it back but it would cost to much.</li>
            <li> I feel like my old self with these.</li>
            <li> It really does make you feel years younger than you look....</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a facelift without spending thousands of dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about my turkey neck inherited from my dad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve contacted the company directly and they told me unless the tapes are returned in the mail that they cannot replace them.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> A must  have for when you skin feels saggy and old.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference it made.</li>
            <li> You can scoff,make jokes,make sarcastic remarks, diss and try to discourage others all you want too...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money .</li>
            <li> I must start saving money to get this fixed by a doctor</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this method works to freshen up your look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> All in all, as the old saying goes....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give some to my mom (84 years old).  </li>
            <li> pulled of the white -- now sticky and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> OMG I look like my old self and  </li>
            <li> and it even help me to feel like my old self ....</li>
            <li> wow mommy ur workout is working</li>
            <li> YOU THANK YOU for this product I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed of how old I had gotten at the young age of 40 ........</li>
            <li> As an EXTREMELY busy actress and model (imdb.me/eileenprudhont)</li>
            <li> This  product is a joke as far as Im concerned.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such fast shipping.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li> But even before my fillers kicked in completely, I wore the elastic at temple level and the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You absolutely cannot use this with short hair.  </li>
            <li> I would advise this for people with fairly thick hai, or those who creatively style theor hair to cover the band.  </li>
            <li> hours later and after going thru 6 pieces of the tape, I finally found the right placement for the tape and</li>
            <li> This is pretty much tape with a hair elastic cut in half.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product to any man or woman looking to not ONLY LOOK YOUNG, FEEL YOUNG</li>
            <li> The INSTANT FACE AND NECK LIFT TAPES are easily applied and you can adjust the lift with just a slight pull.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really done wonders for raising my droopy outer eyelids and flat cheeks.</li>
            <li> Clean skin and a few moments</li>
            <li> My older son is a classical pianist and we often perform together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the top lift bands and they tighten my jawline, and neck;  just within a few minutes!  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s an easy fix (I would just hold the taped area and pull a little on the elastic and twist the barb the opposite way).</li>
            <li> I position my tapes quite high up, well above the tragus of the ear and spend time massaging tapes to mould comfortably.then rearrange the hair over the ears.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but low expectations.</li>
            <li> I read many of the negative reviews, and most of them complained about the tapes not sticking properly.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it hides the tapes but as long as you dont wear a ponytail, you should be fine with hair as short as shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I used to wear them for special occasions, now i wear them everyday.  </li>
            <li> (dare not) &amp;#34;do not leave home without them.&amp;#34;  I have been using them for so long, no one really knows how I look without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small piece of elastic for the neck just isn&#x27;t long enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> The facelift one will pull the skin tighter to smooth out the \\&quot;parens\\&quot; around the mouth, but after a while, the band starts to hurt, because you need to pull it tight enough to pull the skin.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t  believe the amount of money people spend on facial surgeries to get the same result as this product produces.  </li>
            <li> I am ordering this the 2nd time because they really work....but lost the biggest rope &amp; never got the 3rd one like it</li>
            <li> Instructions were confusing enough, but then trying to apply them...not able to do period.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, the only complaint I can come up with is that it doesnt like many hours of sweaty activity along with naturaly oily skin.  </li>
            <li> , I did not tell them the second thing I did(wearing the secret lift); they will have to figure that one out on their own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li> Yes, when you use your fingers to pull your face back, you look incredibly young!</li>
            <li> , I had Zero trouble putting the tape and bands on the very first time.</li>
            <li> Also i had to put little clips over the top cord so it wouldn&#x27;t show when the wind blew or in case some other hair-raising thing happened&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it slips, it pulls by the ear causing major pain.</li>
            <li> well  with major improvement until I watched videos and saw my mistakes.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a subtle but fresh appearance.</li>
            <li> The main problem is, is that there is not enough elastic cords in the pack, one face lift cord is simply not enough compared with all the pads that are included</li>
            <li> so I hope this company will put their extra cord packs on Amazon (I know they sell them) for us to purchase at the same time as the main pack.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s incredibly cheapy and stupid.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions and tried several times, but could not escape what seems to be the sheer physics of it: the tapes hold okay, but one slender point of contact with the skin on each side of the face, is incapable of lifting the entire area in a way which is useful or vaguely natural-looking.     </li>
            <li> My hair totally covers the clear tape.  </li>
            <li> For the price I was surprised by how well it actually works.</li>
            <li> I just got my instant face tapes in the mail today I have had them on for 5 hours so far</li>
            <li> With my second purchase of this product I was shopping with my thirty something son and ran into an old friend.</li>
            <li> I have spent much money on lifting/firming cremes, tightening serums, etc.</li>
            <li> purchased these direct from CosmeSearch only because in the ad on Amazon I could not find an option for choice of color.</li>
            <li> I can give a critical opinion with concise words than a bunch of words.</li>
            <li> first thing I must say my product arrived just in time sooner than I expected, Now back to OH</li>
            <li> The next day, I had hot pink marks where the pads  and my skin had been.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most of the poor reviews, for me the tape did stick.</li>
            <li> They are kind of difficult to see</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters wedding, it took several attempts to get it right, but once I got the hang of it, this is a cheap facelift, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The negative report must have come from the original lift.</li>
            <li> and I set them pretty tight, but I swab the area where I&#x27;m going to place them with alcohol</li>
            <li> The tapes held tight the first time I applied and rubbed them as directed.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using these for photographs, job interviews, and social events.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, the adhesive turns your skin red and mine left a sore and then scabbed.</li>
            <li> and I wear the tapes to work, to social events, etc.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and recently received compliments from friends coworkers and strangers and can only attribute this to the face lift tapes</li>
            <li> The video also tells you it may take a little practice to get it exactly how you want it.</li>
            <li> It was not really difficult to place, you have to play a little once or twice to get it positioned the way you like it.</li>
            <li> , I know with it on, I look as good (if not better) as my younger family members and friends who are all at least five-ten years younger than me.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new set of bands through the company BUT was unaware that face bands meant only 1/2 of the entire set...that portion for the upper face.  </li>
            <li> The tapes were simple to use and I finally got rid of the sagging chicken neck, fun and easy.</li>
            <li> &quot; My pastor is very observant and during the sermon, he kept looking directly at me</li>
            <li> Now that I have the routine down, it takes about 3 minutes to get everything into place and ready to go.</li>
            <li> The adhesive on the tape is very, very strong, and I have never had them fail, even in the heat of the deep South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical of buying this product because of some of the negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Got new one and stretch it carefully.  </li>
            <li> only difficulty I seem to be having is the elastics tend to slip down toward the base of my skull - I get the best results with them placed a little higher up.</li>
            <li> Not good with thin hair, otherwise works great</li>
            <li> I recently went to a conference where my picture was taken and posted on social media</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I saw this in a magazine and thought about it some more, before finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the bands are not long enough causing the stickers to come off.</li>
            <li> She is self conscious about some of the \\&quot;loose skin\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The tapes stuck really well for me and the ones for the face I even cut in half as they were too big.</li>
            <li> It took me quite a little time to really apply the tabs in the correct position.  </li>
            <li> You need to play around with placement a little bit to ensure that the tape doesn&#x27;t show and lifts the area where needed, but you can absolutely delay surgery and fillers.</li>
            <li> getting the elastic in place under my hair was a little trickier - I needed a couple of attempts to figure out how much hair to lift up and how to style it over the elastics without displacing them.</li>
            <li> It was a little strange feeling at first after I got the bands secured, but you acclimate to the feeling in about an hour and do not notice it.</li>
            <li> They are hard to remove and I would fresh ones daily.</li>
            <li> I have 47 year old, pale, sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> This is the original version and the band has knots in it which I don&#x27;t care for because my hair is thin</li>
            <li> All that mid 40&#x27;s sagging just disappears, and I feel more put together, and less tired looking when I wear them.</li>
            <li> an unmistakable marker of my true age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lived with this, unhappily, while I consider surgery which for a variety of reasons, I really want to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, the crease did not disappear completely, but it lifted to a higher position, and now I don&#x27;t have the &#x27;tired&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use all off in hot weather too visible</li>
            <li> If you have long enough hair on the sides of your face, then this will work well.</li>
            <li> Tape stays on all day long, can even sleep with it, won&#x27;t come off (if placed properly).  </li>
            <li> Need to have long hair....does not work with short hair as the tape shows</li>
            <li> as long as you experiment and test them before making your public debut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wore the neck lift around the house and after a few hours of normal movement, one side popped off.  </li>
            <li> However, they did not know the true reasoning behind the change.</li>
            <li> but once you apply them they last for a long time!</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was a little bit unsure, but then, when I gave it a try, Wow!</li>
            <li> Even if it did stick, you would be hard pressed to get them in place so that any positive result was reached.  </li>
            <li> Once I mastered that, both tapes and elastics are hidden completely.</li>
            <li> and they would loose their  sticky quality constantly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, several tines a year I an in the public eye, as part of a musical group that tours nationally each year, and internationally every few years.</li>
            <li> The tapes take a few seconds to really adhere, so hold one it in one place for about 5-10 seconds before stretching the elastic around to the other side of your head.  </li>
            <li> After wearing it for several hours the band slipped to the top of my ears and was a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be cumbersome and difficult to fit.</li>
            <li> how much you want to lift your skin, I have nothing negative to say about the product</li>
            <li> I did notice it tightened my double chin, but it was not worth the discomfort I had for the next 10 days.</li>
            <li> but I also wear bangs and have long hair.</li>
            <li> It took to long to apply then</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t wear it for long.</li>
            <li> You do not need long hair to use them.  </li>
            <li> and they stay on as long as you want</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin for long</li>
            <li> Put this on and was wondering why the clerk at the store was looking at me do strange.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The tapes used would not stick to my face when I stretched the band for the eye lift.  </li>
            <li> I tested how long they would stay in place,  </li>
            <li> - I now have $50 worth of broken, not sticky, and what the heck - save your money</li>
            <li> they could make the adhesives a little smaller and possibly hidden behind the ears more.</li>
            <li> The tapes are really easy to apply, stay in place, and no one is the wiser unless you want to let them in on your little secret.  </li>
            <li> Two, the tighter you  pull the bands, the longer the tail will be, therefore, the tail will hang down in the back if your hair isn&#x27;t long enough to cover it.  </li>
            <li> After several attempts, I finally found that securing with a couple of bobby pins seems to help, but while the tape and elastics are completely hidden by my hair, sometimes the bobby pins stick out</li>
            <li> Also, the barbs on the ends of the elastic can get irritating if you don&#x27;t position them EXACTLY right.</li>
            <li> I started getting sagging skin last year due to menopause.</li>
            <li> My mail man is always getting our mail mixed up with other people&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> it stayed on all day long without coming off!  </li>
            <li> One of the elastic things didn&#x27;t even have hooks on them, and they were all way too long, plus they didn&#x27;t stick well, and kept coming off!  </li>
            <li> At the present time, I can not consider any type of surgical procedure to my face or neck because my other health challenges will not permit.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered 3 other very similar products.</li>
            <li> and then I pull back my skin and attach the other one  </li>
            <li> Cannot wear very long.</li>
            <li> Depending on the temperature, and whether I am sweating or not, these didn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> The tapes wouldn&#x27;t hold very long about.</li>
            <li> Even when you wipe skin dry with alcohol..</li>
            <li> by the way you have to let the alcohol  dry</li>
            <li> well with ALCOHOL, let it dry thoroughly, THEN apply the adhesive AND hold your hand over it for about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> let dry</li>
            <li> : Don&#x27;t forget to use the alcohol swab, and let it dry, at the application sites.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use the alcohol swab, and let it dry, at the application sites.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to advertisment</li>
            <li> When I first received this product it was very confusing to figure out how to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was not asked the color of my hair, thus I received a dark brown band, my hair is blonde.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure that I have it completely figured out.  </li>
            <li> I saw loose skin.</li>
            <li> While stretching cord to attach from one tape to another, tape came loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also down to only using 1 bobby pin to hold the elastic in position.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old with a very heavy neck.  </li>
            <li> The second time I used the neck lift the band broke in half.</li>
            <li> Frankly, if you think you&#x27;re going to look like you&#x27;ve lost ten years, or more, you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and the band is black.  </li>
            <li> otherwise, the black strings will show through my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> If you are a normal person used to feeling natural and comfortable you will hate this product!</li>
            <li> The bands were so tight it cut the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> It did caused  a little rash when I left it on over night...</li>
            <li> little item can actualy show you what you will look like when you can afford an actual lower face-lift!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, Dyanne</li>
            <li> BUT then I was so paranoid about my hair blowing back from my face and people seeing little paper like tabs on edge of face.....</li>
            <li> Three tiny little elastic bands and some tape.</li>
            <li> The contraption instead functions more like you&#x27;d expect a fish hook stuck in the face, rudely hoisting just a sliver of cheek skin up and creating a weird pulled effect.</li>
            <li> Never really did use this.</li>
            <li> Although slightly harder to hide the bands in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides a minimal face lift but at what price?</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> They will work with practice and being careful to follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I only wasted one strip.</li>
            <li> You can get 2 or 3 days use of the tapes if you don&#x27;t get them wet, and don&#x27;t leave the elastic band connected all day and all night.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instruction carefully,  </li>
            <li> Still probably won&#x27;t do it everyday, but when I do use it I have no problem with getting it stay for several hours - in fact</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even waste my time sending it back, just threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> You also have to be careful with the elastic band for the face and eye lift - if you make it too taut, you may end up looking unnatural or the band may break.</li>
            <li> I am nearly 50 with thick shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> I mean you get used to looking so young.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to rotate skin sites where you place the contact tape otherwise rashes or other skin irritation may develop.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the tape took the skin off my neck and it was raw and it had to heal.</li>
            <li> even then It barely affects the performance, and never, ever fails completely .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tape held all day long, the bands did not pop loose.&lt;br /&gt;They did seem to loosen a little as the day went by</li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;m just talking about the part that supposedly tightens the midface; the other part that aims to tighten the neck, did nothing at all.)    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not willing to go through it again</li>
            <li> I have asked if the company can sell all their other items on Amazon and they say they are looking into it.</li>
            <li> one side stays put and the other side pops off.  </li>
            <li> Despite other reviews, I don&#x27;t believe these tapes and bands, even with practice (which I did spend quite a bit of time doing, used up some tapes practicing) provide any noticable results.  </li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars due to the issues with the tape not adhering as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I just popped and releases abruptly</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of spirit gum for a little extra hold</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even stick until I got to the other side.  </li>
            <li> No one can tell you are using these, other than your face is lifted.  </li>
            <li> Alcohol works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> THE OTHER HAND</li>
            <li> They were not aware of my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I never knew when it would pop off usually before I left home.</li>
            <li> and my daughter noticed it on me the other day.  </li>
            <li> face aging is due to a loss of fat volume in the face.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a person at the other end of your email who promptly reads and responds to our request or comment.</li>
            <li> To lazy to send back .</li>
            <li> It kept slipping down the night</li>
            <li> I have a little loose skin under my neck.</li>
            <li> I spent thousand$ on Thermage and fillers that only gave me a \\&quot;subtle</li>
            <li> It is hard to hide in my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Directions are bad and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Of course, I got the dark</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> And if the hook breaks after about an hour use, then I render this whole kit useless.</li>
            <li> For the price however, they could include an extra band each, just in case one loses one.  </li>
            <li> but they sent me a set for dark hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.  </li>
            <li> That old tired look is gone when I wear them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You definite need medium to thick hair to hide the bands.</li>
            <li> To think of the money people spend on surgery, the pain, the down time etc when all you need are these.  </li>
            <li> No surgery or other face lift creams needed!</li>
            <li> The bands are nicely hidden, because I have a lot of dark hair.  </li>
            <li> but the second pad went on a little wonky.  </li>
            <li> It made a vast difference but sadly, these things don&#x27;t last forever</li>
            <li> There is a slight lift to the jowls when using this product, but nothing like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> If you sweat slightly the adhersive will peel off.  </li>
            <li> see no change in my slight eye bags</li>
            <li> It does do the job, but after half an hour it started giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> You get less than what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I was thnking about a half face lift &amp; came across this.</li>
            <li> but they can be seen nun the less.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all the stick on&#x27;s came off in less than a hour.&lt;br /&gt;They would not stay on.  </li>
            <li> This seems to lessen the less time I have the tape on.  </li>
            <li> Not that I am  trying for alot just a slight lift...</li>
            <li> it was a mess.</li>
            <li> But because I have sensory issues (I can&#x27;t wear anything clingy or skin tight, I have to cut all tags off my clothes etc)</li>
            <li> They do work, but to give yourself the maximum lift, they have to be tight.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, I had seen something of this nature exposed by two women on TV years ago, but was not able to find it until I randomly put \\&quot;non-surgical facelift\\&quot; into your search engine.</li>
            <li> I even wear my hair up with a few strands messily hanging down the sides to cover up the tapes and nothing shows.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and found out about these bands and tape.</li>
            <li> , I just need my little tapes, they do all that I need...</li>
            <li> The little sticky things pulled lose in under a minute.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to use.</li>
            <li> I had one of the elastic barbs poke the edge of my ear all day once, but that was my fault for putting the tape a little too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the neck one because it hurts after a little while</li>
            <li> It does what it says but the tapes are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Im allergic to nickel.there is a little metal strip to hold tape</li>
            <li> and this comes in contact a little with your neck.so</li>
            <li> These little bands work wonders.  </li>
            <li> i keep little bottle with my make up.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to learn the technique</li>
            <li> They take a little practice in the beginning, however, I can now apply within minutes.  </li>
            <li> I just stick the lower part of the tape and pull it up a little, then press the rest of the tape, it doesn&#x27;t even need a strap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes it would lift my droopy neck just a little (not under the illusion that it would approximate the effects of an actual face lift).</li>
            <li> and once I got everything in place they did make a difference, however, within a few minutes I was always needing to adjust the elastic pieces because once you start doing your hair the elastic would move out of position I even tried using bobby pins but that didn&#x27;t help and they were noticeable.</li>
            <li> so after a few hours I took it off.</li>
            <li> (i wear them almost everyday, they boost my morale)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its practical for everyday</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY..</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR $$$$</li>
            <li> I had Radiesse done in 12/21/2012 for 1 syringe at the cost of $650.00, what a waste.</li>
            <li> I may be one of the few people this has happened to?</li>
            <li> It does take off a few years.</li>
            <li> First let me say when I ordered these I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> And I did find I could still wear my hair up by allowing a few strands to hang in front of my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to go through a few before I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I would still recommend them though as they did take quite a few years off.</li>
            <li> to me with was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> which are my trouble spots.</li>
            <li> The tapes show if the wind blows and the hooks are not comfortable.</li>
            <li> so i use the tape that goes at the back of the neck &amp; behind the ears.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t hold on the skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this scam.</li>
            <li> If I continue to use it for a few days I have rash on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I did reveal the \\&quot;secret\\&quot; to a few, their remarks were:  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Cheap Crap.</li>
            <li> Waste of money,</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable to wear if you want to use it all day.</li>
            <li> A few times it stuck for a few minutes until I turned my head.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> a few times then I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I saw a video while researching mini-facelift regarding Secret Lift Instant Face, Neck and Eye lift kit.</li>
            <li> Again,,,don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I can wear everyday, stayed put until chose to remove.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Use when I go out and sometime everyday.</li>
            <li> This kit is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is poor quality and simply does not work.</li>
            <li> I misplaced the wire</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Sad part is that my mom is old</li>
            <li> This is my second time re-ordering the product Secret Lift.  </li>
            <li> i let them know and received an immediate response and the missing part of my order  </li>
            <li> Wasted my money</li>
            <li> ( few seconds) apply the headband and tape.</li>
            <li> , I tried the Face, Neck and Eye Lift, the Secret Pro Neck and Jaw Lift, and the Instant Face Neck and Eye Lift products.</li>
            <li> I took a few weeks to experiment, and learn how to use them undetectably.</li>
            <li> I use 2 tapes everyday.</li>
            <li> As I age I find that I am not comfortable with some of the changes in how I look.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> , late on the night of my arrival (and finding upon unpacking that I had forgotten the Lifts), I ordered another batch of Lifts for delivery to my hotel,  and sent a rather desperate email to CosmeSearch (the company who sells all the products), begging them to somehow speed my delivery (deliveries for my past order always came promptly and within the promised &amp;#34;Standard Mail&amp;#34; timeframes, but I knew the far bounds of that time frame would not be soon enough this time).</li>
            <li> If you are pale and blone do not order the bands that are brown.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have it that I have to be very careful when removing the &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34;, and even then its difficult not to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find it worked out for the first 30 mins of the night but after sweating and movement they just would not stay!</li>
            <li> the negative side, I am of a dark skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased these from cosmesearch quite a few times over the past couple of years</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that one of the tapes came loose after the ceremony.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> plus is for blonde hair whene my order was for dark hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> In addition, the adhesive tapes opened a raw, rash in front of my ears where they had been attached.</li>
            <li> only problem is one set of elastics arrived broken, called the company customer service and person was rude.</li>
            <li> no packaging, less taI pes. ....arrived late....</li>
            <li> Also, if you pull a little too hard on them, they tear and then you&#x27;ve ruined it.</li>
            <li> I have just a little and am in my late thirties but it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I was so blown away by the results just by placing a small piece of tape to the side of my neck attached to a band and in two seconds my neck looked like a kids again.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the person with the negative post had trouble</li>
            <li> That was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> , im not sure how any body could not beable to apply this....</li>
            <li> Not sure how product works for those with lots of excess skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was also very uncomfortable and felt like the band was cutting into the top part of my ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> at times you can reuse them, just depends on length of wear and sweat (dancing usually just one wear)....</li>
            <li> Not sure how to make it work for me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
            <li> When I lifted the two elastics to attach at my crown, magically those horrible little jowls and small eye wrinkles all went away!  </li>
            <li> And lastly,  when removing the bands, it will also pull some of your hair, and that too, is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinner, so I&#x27;m not sure it would hide well.  </li>
            <li> Compliments are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Where has this product been the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> The past 2 years have seen jowls come to my face and neck</li>
            <li> Cut in two small strips and place one end  behind your ears and lift sagging skin and put other end on that skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkles or \\&quot;crows feet, I just wanted a lift for my jaw line.</li>
            <li> M y only complaint is is that it is slightly uncomfortable around my ears.  </li>
            <li> I really do not like to waste money and that is just what happened when I purchased Secret Lift!  </li>
            <li> You cannot say the adhesive is not strong!  </li>
            <li> I dont find the tape to be all that visible, perhaps that is because I am very pale skinned.</li>
            <li> Sorry it took so long to rate</li>
            <li> I felt no circulation, uncomfortable where the tapes are if I leave it on for long.</li>
            <li> The original with the wire was annoying and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, and you have to have hair that is at least past your ears and neck for this.  </li>
            <li> I only received the black ones impossible to use for my blond hair.</li>
            <li> A little mineral powder to kill the \\&quot;tape shine\\&quot; and they are very hard to see, even up close.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time covering the band.</li>
            <li> Hard to work with .</li>
            <li> and it is hard to hide.</li>
            <li> One, is that it&#x27;s hard to hide the tape that you stick on the sides of your face.</li>
            <li> Hard directions to figure out on how applying.</li>
            <li> these are hard for me to use and I am embarrassed I even tried...</li>
            <li> This product is hard to use.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST..</li>
            <li> Lift\\&quot; at least 7 years...</li>
            <li> These tapes will take at least 10 years off of your age..</li>
            <li> To all the negative reviewers out there....</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to setting the tapes correctly and learning to use the least amount of pull on the elastic band.  </li>
            <li> I figured the tape might at least solve the problem temporarily, so I placed an order.  </li>
            <li> This product was such a disappointment that I would not recommend it to an enemy.</li>
            <li> Wear at least 6 hours a day for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it took at least 10 years off my face.  </li>
            <li> TAKES AT LEAST 10 YEARS OFF YOUR FACE.  </li>
            <li> Lasts at least 8 hours</li>
            <li> So I set out on a mission to remedy my situation in the least intrusive way.</li>
            <li> I do have thick shoulder length hair, which takes a lot of the worry out of the bands being noticed.</li>
            <li> Came home and literally had to hold my face while slowly peeling off the tapes that were frankly, stuck like glue to my skin.  </li>
            <li> one is useless without the other</li>
            <li> By that I mean saggy neck and droopy eyes.</li>
            <li> The band is uncomfortable and after a few hours the adhesive begins to wear away and they pull on your skin until they snap off, and then they leave adhesive residue on your skin which is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Feeling and looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but seriously....</li>
            <li> The change is subtle, but visible.</li>
            <li> LESS EXPENSIVE THAN GETTING CUT ON.  </li>
            <li> I looked ridiculous.</li>
            <li> then your fake eye lashes, your fake nails and probable a few other &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; things on you, so zip it!  </li>
            <li> Very confusing and hard to use.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the last bad review....</li>
            <li> This is not good..</li>
            <li> They can become very uncomfortable if you have to wear them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on these worthless rubber bands.  </li>
            <li> While there are definately some results with this tape, I can&#x27;t see wearing it all day long as it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Your left with sticky crap on your face which was hard to get off .....</li>
            <li> Anyway, as I wore them and moved around the barbs irritated the skin behind my ears, but the bad part was when I removed the tape it felt like facial wax ripping off my mustache hairs.</li>
            <li> and I figured if it didn&#x27;t work like the Youtube video at least I didn&#x27;t break the bank trying to find an alternative to a surgical mini-facelift!</li>
            <li> have long hair and kept getting tangled in the strings &amp; tape.&lt;br /&gt;Got frustrated with trying to use the tapes.  </li>
            <li> and this was late at night on the west coast!</li>
            <li> Very hard to use and takes a lot of practice to follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to assemble</li>
            <li> The product is very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I had a bit of a problem with fixing the elastic cord around my head as I have very thick curly hair and it kept getting caught up in the curls, but once in place you could not see it,</li>
            <li> out There I have no more words!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few products similar to this one and this is the worst</li>
            <li> I have and will continue to purchase both the Secret Lift and Secret Lift Pro products.</li>
            <li> The secret lift works.</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Secret</li>
            <li> I was looking through a health magazine and saw the \\&quot;Secret Lift\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> tried tying the bands behind my head</li>
            <li> Secret -</li>
            <li> Bands broken when I received them.  </li>
            <li> The elastic came broken.</li>
            <li> I recived my order today and the elastic bands r broken</li>
            <li> Secret lift takes years off that appearance.</li>
            <li> I tired it out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using Secret lift.  </li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s never going to know my Secret.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go to a function and wear this secret</li>
            <li> However, even if I could, I still may not elect to do so because since I discovered the tapes (approximately two (2) years ago, I have been using them every since.  </li>
            <li> Still the tape is not great.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see the tape because it is behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst thing I have ever bought in my lift.  </li>
            <li> So for now, I am just using the neck lift where the strings go behind your neck.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and thought the adjustable elastic bands might show through my hair, but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They can be mildly uncomfortable if the tape isn&#x27;t placed exactly right, or if you wear them for a very long time, but it&#x27;s never unbearable, just annoying at worst.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use, get sticked on your hair, is visible and not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I was getting injections of fillers, but since I have been applying the tapes, it is much, much less costly, painful and bothersome.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to use the tapes 2 days in a row since I have to let my skin heal for a few days.</li>
            <li> No good!,,,,</li>
            <li> Maybe the glue was old but very disappointed as I hoped it would work</li>
            <li> Very expensive considering the very small amount of stickers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Poor customer service to have an ordering process like that!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product figuring it wasn&#x27;t so expensive that I couldn&#x27;t give it a try.</li>
            <li> Company sent me the wrong colored bands-- on the amazon site</li>
            <li> Too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> So useless.</li>
            <li> said to watch video because i was putting the bands on wrong.</li>
            <li> I was worried about wearing this on windy day, but I am unable to notice that the tape is even there.</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to work the bands through the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I guarantee you won&#x27;t be sorry or regret.</li>
            <li> It would have been laughable</li>
            <li> I can understand getting the \\&quot;barbs\\&quot; the wrong way and having that hurt</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t find this difficult to do at all.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be rather difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product in theory should work well, in reality it is mediocre.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally obsessed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have seen these used before and remained skeptical until they arrived yesterday.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t figure  the application out something is wrong with you.</li>
            <li> I am so angry a bout</li>
            <li> TOO COMPLICATED TO USE</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use this product because I could not understand the directions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought this drawer.</li>
            <li> This company sent me the wrong color bands with my package.  </li>
            <li> Working the bands is a bit tricky and if you have very thin hair, this is not for you, since your hair has to cover the bands.</li>
            <li> But this product is of very poor quality.</li>
            <li> no good bad decision to purchase never again</li>
            <li> They were impossible to rethread, which rendered the system useless.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are afraid of injectables or a facelift</li>
            <li> This is a crazy looking string and tape joke.</li>
            <li> but I was desperate) on the tape</li>
            <li> AND AFRAID IT WILL SNAP AS YOU ARE WEARING IT...</li>
            <li> Am unhappy with it but am still trying to use the product now</li>
            <li> besides the stretch string is the wrong color!</li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkles on my face, but my neck looks horrible.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> These can also be very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If you hate your sagging neck, get this guaranteed you will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to understand instructions.  </li>
            <li> It does work, but for me they are very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The tape was very difficult to get off and it hurt coming off.  </li>
            <li> but it seems very difficult to do.  </li>
            <li> but the adhesive tape is impossible to conceal in front of your ears.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to hide the tapes and the «glue» that is used on the tapes damages the skin.</li>
            <li> horrible product,  very hard to wear</li>
            <li> really bad, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> You can lift your eye but is painful</li>
            <li> We were both rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> The quality was terrible needless to say I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stupid.  </li>
            <li> I should have known that this would not work.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on me for being so stupid.  </li>
            <li> I even hate to admit that I bought this...</li>
            <li> Mrs. Chancellor having a bad neck tape day!</li>
            <li> Women find themselves trying to compete in this ugly world, that criticizes them for competing!  </li>
            <li> However the product performed as promised - I just felt \\&quot;silly\\&quot; using it and was fearful it would be detected by others.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> its idiot proof...even for me!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this was one of the worst purchases I have made.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, it does not stick well to the skin</li>
            <li> Terrible did not stick ackward to use.</li>
            <li> The bands break and in all it is worthless!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever.  </li>
            <li> #34;hold up&amp;#34; during the worst of the humidity I would still purchase them and look forward to autumn</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WAS TERRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> THE BANDS WERE AS THIN AS A STRAND OF HAIR.......TERRIBLE!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I should have known better. this is a joke.</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying the concept is great and once I got everything in place they did make a difference, however, within a few minutes I was always needing to adjust the elastic pieces because once you start doing your hair the elastic would move out of position I even tried using bobby pins but that didn&#x27;t help and they were noticeable. The small piece of elastic for the neck just isn&#x27;t long enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> It works!  I used it for my saggy skin on my neck.  But because I have sensory issues (I can&#x27;t wear anything clingy or skin tight, I have to cut all tags off my clothes etc) I could &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; having this on....so after a few hours I took it off.</li>
            <li> Never really did use this.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay stuck.  It&#x27;s stupid.  Yes, when you use your fingers to pull your face back, you look incredibly young! But the tape doesn&#x27;t stick.  I&#x27;m only 31 and I just wanted to look younger because I play Ariel and Belle for a company, but no.  Didn&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s incredibly cheapy and stupid.  Don&#x27;t spend $15 on a rubber band with tape on each end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and how feel while wearing the tapes. I&#x27;ve been told that I look much younger and I feel as if the tapes take ten years off my appearance. I recently went to a conference where my picture was taken and posted on social media I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed or ashamed to have my pictures proudly displayed. Prior to my discovery of this product I would have been hiding in the background not wanting my picture taken or posted. I have and will continue to purchase both the Secret Lift and Secret Lift Pro products.</li>
            <li> Neck lifts and bands tapes are visible.  Trick I found is just use transparent surgical tape.  Cut in two small strips and place one end  behind your ears and lift sagging skin and put other end on that skin.  Not visible, no bands and stays in place.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I followed the instructions but after numerous attempts, I couldn&#x27;t get them to work at all. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> When you order this, there is no way to order the color, light or dark.  Of course, I got the dark and I wanted the light.  Poor customer service to have an ordering process like that! I have used the neck tape twice and it seemed to make some difference.  The eye tape is more difficult for me to use so tried once and gave up...besides the stretch string is the wrong color! Beware!</li>
            <li> Did not live up to advertisment</li>
            <li> No surgery face lift - this has made a big difference to my life the extra lift  without doubt makes me 10 years younger.    many thanks</li>
            <li> I truly am not trying to insult those who swear this actually works. Hey - maybe ya&#x27;ll simply figured it out better than I could. If so -- Bravo!  But it totally bombed for me!     I read the instructions and tried several times, but could not escape what seems to be the sheer physics of it: the tapes hold okay, but one slender point of contact with the skin on each side of the face, is incapable of lifting the entire area in a way which is useful or vaguely natural-looking.     The contraption instead functions more like you&#x27;d expect a fish hook stuck in the face, rudely hoisting just a sliver of cheek skin up and creating a weird pulled effect. (And I&#x27;m just talking about the part that supposedly tightens the midface; the other part that aims to tighten the neck, did nothing at all.)    The only thing I got outta this whole exercise was a good laugh at myself for falling for this one.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a surgical necklift after losing weight, everytime I looked in the mirror I saw loose skin. I did a little research and found out about these bands and tape. I thought I may as well give it a try. I was so blown away by the results just by placing a small piece of tape to the side of my neck attached to a band and in two seconds my neck looked like a kids again. Anyone who wants to do it the easy way without surgery I would say that this product is what you need.. I really does wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> I was over joyed when I tried the tape! I looked so much younger!!!  Problem is, the tape does not hold.  I have tried everything from cleaning the skin real good, to using alcohol on my skin to make sure it was clean and dry.  The longest the tape would hold was about 45 min... if I was lucky.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it does not work at all it doesnt stick properly</li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly. It looked fine but simply doesn&#x27;t have the stickyness needed to hold in place.</li>
            <li> The product REALLY works.  I will order more of the face tapes.</li>
            <li> I do not understand the reviews that say this project is effective. It did not work for me at all and  I tried many time. Tape would not say on</li>
            <li> I have been getting make up tips from someone on Youtube she is the one who turned me on to the instant face and neck take lift tapes.. For anyone who wants to have get botox or plastic surgery but can&#x27;t afford it, I promise the Instant Face and Neck Tape Lift Tapes work...I only use the Face lift tape they are so easy to use and they are worth every penny..I don&#x27;t know how I will ever go without them again!!!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a mini face lift for a few years now, but have mot been able to save the $$ to do so. I ordered this product figuring it wasn&#x27;t so expensive that I couldn&#x27;t give it a try. I love it. Not sure why the person with the negative post had trouble, I had Zero trouble putting the tape and bands on the very first time. BUT--I watched the Youtube \\&quot;how to\\&quot; before using, and did EXACTLY as recommended.I do have thick shoulder length hair, which takes a lot of the worry out of the bands being noticed. I will not, however, be ordering from Amazon for refills. I love this product so much, and want to use it on a daily basis (it just does so much for my morale to look in the mirror and see the me of 10 years ago)I went directly to the site and ordered the refill tapes. Amazon charged me $6 or $7 to \\&quot;ship\\&quot;. The product came US mail. The direct site is charging me $1.88 to ship via US mail! I have also ordered another product that uses almost surgical grade tape with no bands. I&#x27;ll write a review when they arrive and I try them. This will also give you a pretty good idea of what a mini face lift will do for you. I exerciise and try to eat right, keep my weight in check, but my genes dictated that my lower face would \\&quot;jowl\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t have a problem with wrinkles, so I don&#x27;t know how this product would work for that problem. But with this product I have my jaw line back and a tighter neck!</li>
            <li> This REALLY works on &amp;#34;uncreping&amp;#34; my neck!  The pull of the band is not too uncomfortable as it does its magic (it&#x27;s worth it)!</li>
            <li> Love it. Make sure to clean and dry area first, I use alcohol.  May take a couple times to get it right. Stays on all day. Very happy with product</li>
            <li> Matron of honor  at my friends wedding. No air condition. Face perspired-tape came off. Lopsided face in pictures,did not like</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t understand it.</li>
            <li> It works and stays on all day. Just make sure you use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol to clean your skin and then let it dry a few minutes before you stick it on.  It is hard to hide in my short hair.  However, when I wear my hair piece it&#x27;s invisible</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  It took me quite a little time to really apply the tabs in the correct position.  But I finally managed it and what a difference it makes.  Can vouch for this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to indulge myself and add something inexpensive to my beauty regimen. This product is nice for a special event or a photo shoot.  This is not something I could do every morning before going to work, but if you have the time to invest in putting the tapes on, go for it.  It does have some lifting effects and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for. I had a lower face lift some years ago as a treat to myself following chemotherapy. It made a vast difference but sadly, these things don&#x27;t last forever but I&#x27;m not willing to go through it again untill I really need it. The tapes are easy to apply. make sure you scrape the hair in front of the ears Well forward and clip out of the way.Really cleanse the skin with non oily toner before applying tape. I position my tapes quite high up, well above the tragus of the ear and spend time massaging tapes to mould comfortably.then rearrange the hair over the ears. You can experiment with the angle of the elastics to achieve your required look. I slept in the tapes one night with no problem, then reinserted the elastics the following day for another event. I recommend the tiniest touch of lip gloss on the cheeks for extra definition and glamour.  My youngest son 17yrs said from the top of the stairs \\&quot;Gosh mum what have you done you&#x27;ve got cheek bones!\\&quot; and came to admire the engineering but couldn&#x27;t find it! My older son is a classical pianist and we often perform together. I recently overheard someone in the audience say \\&quot;That&#x27;s his wife!!\\&quot; (he is 27 and I am 56)  I would recommend this to anyoune wanting to look good for an occasion.  Once the elastics are removed, follow on with a regular daily regime of facial exercises to maintain the lifted look. Liz</li>
            <li> I received these face lift tapes and wondered how on earth will they work. Well I tried them and I could not believe the difference, I looked 20 years younger.  I am now going to experiment and leave it on to see just how long the sticky pads will stay stuck to my face to give me confidence when I go out as I don&#x27;t want them pinging off when my face gets warm.   I had a bit of a problem with fixing the elastic cord around my head as I have very thick curly hair and it kept getting caught up in the curls, but once in place you could not see it, so I suppose practice will make perfect.       The main problem is, is that there is not enough elastic cords in the pack, one face lift cord is simply not enough compared with all the pads that are included so I hope this company will put their extra cord packs on Amazon (I know they sell them) for us to purchase at the same time as the main pack.  All in all an excellent shopping experience, very fast delivery and I will definitely deal with this company again.  In fact I have placed another order for a further pack to enable me to get the extra cord until they are put for sale on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I see all the great reviews but the did not work for me. They didn&#x27;t stick at all. That was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> This is truly what I would call a 5 star product.  I have been using the Instant Face Lift Tapes for several years now and absolutely love the difference they make.  I not only notice the difference but so does everyone else.  It always feel so good to hear the many compliments on how much younger I look for my age. I really can&#x27;t  believe the amount of money people spend on facial surgeries to get the same result as this product produces.  It is instant, painless and never disappoints. I use to use them when I would go to a special event, but now I love them so much, I wear them almost everyday, and they are so easy to apply.  I think these tapes are amazing in so many different ways, especially because they are hidden when wearing them.  Who would know?????  Everyone wants less wrinkles, right?  This is the perfect producy and the service is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. You need to play around with placement a little bit to ensure that the tape doesn&#x27;t show and lifts the area where needed, but you can absolutely delay surgery and fillers.</li>
            <li> I just received my order and I immediately put them on and WOW... THE PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES.. It took 20 years off my face within 5 minutes and as a first time buyer, i had no difficulties what so ever. The tapes are soft and comfortable. The price is so low i ordered two orders and i am not a paid sponsor , just a woman looking to feel better about herself and with Confidenence now. I highly suggest this product to any man or woman looking to not ONLY LOOK YOUNG, FEEL YOUNG TOO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> really bad, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom, who is 60+ and has recently lost a good bit of weight. She is self conscious about some of the \\&quot;loose skin\\&quot; so i thought she could try these out, to see if they would work for her. They do not hold or stay in place. We were both rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty simple and does what it says it will do- it will lift your face using tape and elastic bands, and get rid of jowls. It will NOT get rid of wrinkles though, so really just expect a lifted look. Working the bands is a bit tricky and if you have very thin hair, this is not for you, since your hair has to cover the bands. Also, the barbs on the ends of the elastic can get irritating if you don&#x27;t position them EXACTLY right. But when all is said and done it is a straightforward item. Company sent me the wrong colored bands-- on the amazon site I did not see a place to specify color -- but when I called them they mailed me the correct color right away, gratis.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tapes and could not believe the difference it made, I looked 20 years younger.  It took a bit of getting used to as I kept getting the elastic cords fastened up in my hair, but once I got a system going it was great. You have to ensure that your hair conceals the tape at the side of your face but I put makeup on top of them and it makes abig difference.  Practice does make perfect.   The company was very helpful, in fact they sent me a free set of cords when I asked if I could purchase them seperately.    Delivery was excellent, I received these items more quickly than when I ordered goods from my own country.   All in all a good shopping experience. I have asked if the company can sell all their other items on Amazon and they say they are looking into it.</li>
            <li> wow,this is so amazing,results are great,so easy to apply,and the tape holds,i will never be without it,simple, im not sure how any body could not beable to apply this....its idiot proof...even for me!!!</li>
            <li> This is the original version and the band has knots in it which I don&#x27;t care for because my hair is thin and I have a hard time covering the band. Definitely prefer the pro version over this since with the pro I can&#x27;t even find the band after in place. This is fine for every day kind of use when I don&#x27;t feel like anyone would be scrutinizing and it is cheaper than the pro with reusable bands.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very sure about this product at first, but I was curious.  I decided to try this product and found that it worked realy good for me.  I even purchased the item a second time and would recomend this product to anyone who wishes to look younger in minutes, without the expense and pain of surgery.</li>
            <li> Women are so vain! I&#x27;ve heard.  No, the world is vain.  Women find themselves trying to compete in this ugly world, that criticizes them for competing!  I have found that the secret lift works as it claims to work, giving a surprising and amazing result.  It&#x27;s so easy, inexpensive, and fun.  Do I feel like I&#x27;m cheating?  No, I just feel terrific.  The secret lift works.</li>
            <li> the product arrived on time and as advertised. the video showed how to use the product in a way easy to understand. very satisfied with INSTANT FACE AND NECK TAPES, THEREFORE, WOULD SUGGEST TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THIS PRODUCT GETS 5 STARS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these tapes, they take 10 years off my sagging face.  I started getting sagging skin last year due to menopause. (like over night) I have been using them for more than a year with NO PROBLEMS, but beware of the wind LOL!  I live in a windy city, so i try not to go out on those days.  I&#x27;m saving money to get fillers or a liquid face lift next year, i cannot wear these tapes for the rest of my life. (i wear them almost everyday, they boost my morale)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good  luck!</li>
            <li> I read all reviews before purchasing this product. I also watched the you tube video on how to apply.The product was easy to use for me. The tapes stuck really well for me and the ones for the face I even cut in half as they were too big. They still worked great. The face ones lift cheeks and jawline and if placed higher lift eyes. The neck one is great and takes away the excess skin by pulling neckline. It definitly took some years off when I looked in the mirror. I don&#x27;t know if its practical for everyday but it would be great for a special event. The tapes are pretty transparent on me but I also wear bangs and have long hair. For the price I was surprised by how well it actually works. Just experiment beforehand with pulling skin in different areas and the desired results. I like to place mine where the band comes just over my ear to lift cheeks and jawline but not effect my eyes. Not sure how product works for those with lots of excess skin. I have just a little and am in my late thirties but it works well for me.</li>
            <li> What more can I say except that the neck and face lifts are fantastic, I don&#x27;t need to go under the knife now, I just need my little tapes, they do all that I need... If you are thinking of a face lift, save yourself from all the pain and suffering and try the instant face and neck lift, you will be amazed, my friends and family think that I look really good and years younger too, believe me it is a fantastic buy and so amazing, I have just reordered...</li>
            <li> I just got my instant face tapes in the mail today I have had them on for 5 hours so far and they are still holding great. Plus am 44 years now I Look 32 this product really works. I had a mini lift 3 years ago but i notice my eyes still look kinda of saggy. Bumy face look younger but with these tapesit looks great now and I dont have to go back to see my doctor for botox right now. Wow am so happy thanks to this company and amazon for putting it out there.</li>
            <li> TAPE DOES NOT STICK,JUST POPS OFF THE FACE, DOESN&#x27;T HOLD FOR A SECOND.. LEFT MESSAGE WITH SELLER, YOU CAN&#x27;T RETURN, ..WAS VERY HOPEFUL...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY..MAYBE I&#x27;LL; JUST HOLD MY SAGGING SKIN BACK WITH MY HANDS ALL DAY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GOT A FULL REFUND FROM SELLER. AT LEAST..</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face and neck.  It works very well and I love it! Cannot be compared and the price is just reasonable!</li>
            <li> For months I&#x27;ve been debating on bowtox and rejuverderm ..Then I found secretlift ...Boy it has changed my outlook on surgery..The bands are wonderfull ..Makes me look so much younger..Its so easy and fast..I can&#x27;t believe I found this wonderful little secret...Secretlift I give you a A plus</li>
            <li> It makes me look 10 years younger! Its very easy to apply. And I use it every day :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Hard to work with . A waste of time and money.  This does not work.  I threw it in trash.  I tried several times to use but gave up.  It took to long to apply then it fell off.</li>
            <li> I ordered these thinking they would be great....Have tried them several times.... and each time.... one side stays put and the other side pops off.  First time I used them they stayed on most of the day... but as I was shopping...POP....it came off... was very embarassing!..... I wish maybe there was another adhesive to use... maybe that would work... but since there isn&#x27;t.... I would not waste my money on these again.....:&gt;(</li>
            <li> I have ordered five sets (I think) of these now and will keep purchasing until I need something more invasive.  I simply place the tapes right in front of my ears, hook it on top, style my hair and I&#x27;m good for the day.  I&#x27;m 50 years old and no my face is not on the floor so it lifts just fine for my purposes.  It isn&#x27;t fakey looking for me - seems like it just makes me look more rested and refreshed which is what I was looking for anyway.  I love it. It&#x27;s quick, easy, super affordable and gives me the look I want.  I use the light color and have strawberry blond hair and you can&#x27;t see a thing.  I even wear my hair up with a few strands messily hanging down the sides to cover up the tapes and nothing shows.  For those who have had unsatisfactory results I would suggest trying the tapes in slightly different positions, higher or lower, in front of the ear and maybe adjusting the placement of your hook at your hair&#x27;s crown.  The angle of the tapes and the tension placed on the bands will definitely affect the lift direction.  You want the face to be lifted the exact same direction the muscle did when it was more toned.  It took me a few tries to get the perfect placement but now it&#x27;s easy.  So for me, I love this little gadget and will keep on using until I just can&#x27;t pick my face up anymore :-)</li>
            <li> I have a little loose skin under my neck. I used the neck tape/lift. It worked wonderfully and I looked so much younger. The only problem is that the tape took the skin off my neck and it was raw and it had to heal. Does any one have any suggestions or has had this happen to them? I want to be able to use it again, but I could never use it again the next day. I also didn&#x27;t wear it for long. Just for the night out. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The tapes work wonderfully and are comfortable to wear.  They are easy to use and if placed correctly a little foundation will cover the tapes.  I will definitely buy another box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the last bad review....Maybe they did not use them right? I have purchased these from cosmesearch quite a few times over the past couple of years and I think they work great! There are times when I am tired or make up just doesn&#x27;t cut it, and when I wear these, everyone tells me how great I look, and I feel better knowing I look good....They might take a bit getting used to (I got used to them right away) but to look \\&quot;uplifted\\&quot; again, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> You can easily see the adhesive tape that is placed in front of the ears</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reordering these tapes for the second time, and plan to continue using them until I can have a mid face lift in the summer. They&#x27;ve really done wonders for raising my droopy outer eyelids and flat cheeks. Although skeptical at first I honestly have to say this is one of the best and cheapest solutions I&#x27;ve found for looking great!</li>
            <li> There is a slight lift to the jowls when using this product, but nothing like the picture shows. My mouth would look contorted if I pulled back to much. The neck lift works fine as it pulls the skin back and holds. If you don&#x27;t get it right the first time you have to use two new patches. Once I put the patches too close to my ears and they started getting to hurt that I finally removed them because my ears were sore. The patches stick well enought that it even holds overnight. When you decide it&#x27;s time to remove the adhesive works so well that it hurts like hell when taking it off. There&#x27;s got to be a better way.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts and they were confirmed upon using (or trying to use this product).  This doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  Maybe I&#x27;m too far gone and need the real thing - surgery!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t comprehend why there are favorable reviews of this item. These instant face and neck lift tapes do not work. I read the reviews but i made the mistake of buying them because there are so many good reviews. I might even report item this product to the better business bureau. Contents: you will receive some tape and string in a box with instructions to wear the adhesive tape on your face. DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS ITEM I PROMISE YOU IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR $$$$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few products similar to this one and this is the worst</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! The little sticky things pulled lose in under a minute.</li>
            <li> With my second purchase of this product I was shopping with my thirty something son and ran into an old friend. She introduced us to a friend that was with her. what a wonderful surprise when this total stranger said,\\&quot;you look like brother and sister.\\&quot; I will not be without this product.</li>
            <li> This product will change you whole look, however do not attempt to wear in the summer months outside.  If you sweat slightly the adhersive will peel off.  Only good for indoor special occasions.  Also the tab at the end of the elastic bands will irriate your ear if close.</li>
            <li> no good bad decision to purchase never again</li>
            <li> I thought this was one of the worst purchases I have made.The quality was terrible needless to say I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I saw this in a magazine and thought about it some more, before finding it on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t really think a rubber band could work, but once I stuck the tapes on and hid the rubber bands under my hair...I looked different! The crows feet went away and my eyebrows looked higher. One of my colleagues asked if I had done something different with my makeup, I just told him I had my eyebrows waxed (I did!) But it actually works, and super easy to use. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wow, does this product work great.  Better than cosmetic surgery, I can&#x27;t believe the results.  Do not hesitate, the advertisements do not lie!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, it does not stick well to the skin and it is hard to hide. I would send it back but it would cost to much.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d buy this again.  However the product performed as promised - I just felt \\&quot;silly\\&quot; using it and was fearful it would be detected by others.  I think I&#x27;m gonna just stay with Botox!</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Secret Lift\\&quot; at least 7 years...I NEVER go without it...It is an absolutely amazing product! It takes a couple of trys to learn to place the tapes just the way you want them, but be patient...IT IS SO WORTH IT. These tapes will take at least 10 years off of your age..No Kidding, I absolutely cannot go anywhere without out them. Be sure there is no oil on the skin where you will be placing the tapes to be sure they adhere well... I always first cleanse the area with rubbing alcohol.You will have people asking if you \\&quot;had work done\\&quot;...I did, and I have always kept a big supply on hand so that I never have to be without them!!</li>
            <li> I liked this item; it works good for a special event or a day where you might look extra tired. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this mostly as a gag gift. Hilarious. Some rubber bands and tape. Crack a smile and **sproing** it pops off!  LOL!!!</li>
            <li> These are great work very well defiantly take 5 years away quickly from my under eye area Love This product!!!!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be cumbersome and difficult to fit. I actually needed help from a friend to get it on and off. My hair is fine and the elastic bands got tangled it was a mess. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I was looking through a health magazine and saw the \\&quot;Secret Lift\\&quot;....at first I thought it was a joke and another money scam, but further investigation led me to the video and at that point I had to give it a try.  I had Radiesse done in 12/21/2012 for 1 syringe at the cost of $650.00, what a waste. It suppose to last for 6 months and it lasted only for 2 months. The secret lift is good for The Nasolabial folds.  I went out to eat the day I received the lifts (3-6-12) and every body gave me complements and asked me what did I do!!!!.  I told them the first thing I did was change my hair style, I did not tell them the second thing I did(wearing the secret lift); they will have to figure that one out on their own. The product is wonderful, it rally get the job done.  By the way, I use the lifts more than once, just make sure you clean the area of all makeup, oils, face cream etc. with alcohol and you are good to go. On (3-26-2012) I need to add some good news,  I went to my hair dresser and she used a concealer on the tape and it was flawless...no trace of the tape also you can sleep with the tape on and use it 2 to 3 days without changing it, just use a hair pin and pin the bands up and sleep with a hair bonnet on.</li>
            <li> I tried it the first day, and never used it again. It does pull your skin, but where it pulls, there is just puckered skin. I may be one of the few people this has happened to?</li>
            <li> I plan on using these for photographs, job interviews, and social events. I feel like my old self with these. That old tired look is gone when I wear them. Nice to look in a mirror and see the face I had a decade ago and not my grandma looking back at me! The confidence it gives me! They also stay put until you take them off. I found them very comfortable and not noticable to anyone. Beats the pain and expense of surgery!</li>
            <li> They are great to do business with. I&#x27;m very satisfied. Sorry it took so long to rate</li>
            <li> excellent product ,stays in place, just followed the directions exactly for great results.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised.  I would advise this for people with fairly thick hai, or those who creatively style theor hair to cover the band.  It does take off a few years.</li>
            <li> I like, Love, what I had order,some things need time to work still. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed. Glue did not stick. I could not use it at all. I had to throw it all out.</li>
            <li> Tape won&#x27;t even stick.  While stretching cord to attach from one tape to another, tape came loose. Duct tape would probably work better (and now comes in designer colors  ;-)</li>
            <li> First let me say when I ordered these I was very skeptical. I had high hopes but low expectations. I have spent much money on lifting/firming cremes, tightening serums, etc. etc. and nothing ever worked.&lt;br /&gt;So for the price I thought why not give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;The concept made sense but my concerns were: would the tape hold, would it be visible, would the bands be visible in my hair and of course, would it even work.&lt;br /&gt;All I was looking to do was lift the jaw line and get rid of those jowls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So package arrives and I attempted to place the tape.&lt;br /&gt;4 hours later and after going thru 6 pieces of the tape, I finally found the right placement for the tape and the bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes practice and everyones face is different.&lt;br /&gt;I tried tying the bands behind my head but I ended up with what I can only refer to as an ear flap. This extra skin that was pulled up was now folded back against my ear. ARGGGGGG&lt;br /&gt;I thought to myself, this is what a facelift would look like if they didnt cut away the extra skin.&lt;br /&gt;It was also very uncomfortable and felt like the band was cutting into the top part of my ear.&lt;br /&gt;So then I tied the bands on top of my head, this worked great for me. Although slightly harder to hide the bands in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definite need medium to thick hair to hide the bands. You definite need a hairstyle that covers your ears to hide the tape. I have very long, very thick hair. And I did find I could still wear my hair up by allowing a few strands to hang in front of my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I dont find the tape to be all that visible, perhaps that is because I am very pale skinned. But you really need to work on positioning the tape in the right place to make it less visible. My first couple of tries with the tape I really thought it was not going to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with the tape sticking. I did use an alcohol based cleanser to swab the area before placing tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would imagine sweatingwill cause the tape to loosen, since I live in the south I will report back and update on what happens as the hot humid weather kicks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was my first day of wearing them and so far I love them !!!&lt;br /&gt;My jowls have been reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape held all day long, the bands did not pop loose.&lt;br /&gt;They did seem to loosen a little as the day went by so I simply tightened up one notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no change in my slight eye bags but I can live with them and these also do not help with wrinkles but I dont have many of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purpose was to lift/reduce the jowls and get my jaw line back and for that, they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand why these would not work for everyone. It really depends on your skin coloring, hair type and style and exactly what area you are trying to lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are these the perfect solution, no, but for me they did what I hoped they would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these direct from CosmeSearch only because in the ad on Amazon I could not find an option for choice of color.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Take your time and use it correctly and the results are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I used baby wipes to thoriughly clean the areas where the tapes were to stick and this works very well.&lt;br /&gt;This really substitutes for a surgical procedure that costs plenty and really, why go through all that drama??!!</li>
            <li> Love them Love them Love them</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. Happy with the results. Makes a difference in face and takes years off your apperance.</li>
            <li> Excellent, thanks for do a great costumer service !!!</li>
            <li> This system is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old with a very heavy neck.  These tapes cannot pull it all back,&lt;br /&gt;but certainly help.  Takes a little practice, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Despite other reviews, I don&#x27;t believe these tapes and bands, even with practice (which I did spend quite a bit of time doing, used up some tapes practicing) provide any noticable results.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I received this product a couple of days ago. It does everything it promises. I&#x27;m 36 years, and I recently noticed a crease going from my nose to my chin. Which makes me look older than my years. I applied the tape right in front of my ears and lift. Now, the crease did not disappear completely, but it lifted to a higher position, and now I don&#x27;t have the &#x27;tired&#x27; look. It&#x27;s amazing, I feel so much more confident and peppy when I go out. To get the strongest hold, you must wipe the area with alcohol first, and position the tape as close to your ear as possible. I don&#x27;t intend on going one day without wearing my lift tape, I hope it works for you guys as well.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again.  Very hard to use and takes a lot of practice to follow the instructions.  Very expensive considering the very small amount of stickers. Rip off</li>
            <li> Excellent. Takes away a good 15yrs off my face.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because you can adjust the lifting. I am 40I don&#x27;t need too much lift so I like that its adjustable. I recomend using a moisturizer first  and where you put the tapes just clean that area good before you put the tapes on.The only thing I dont like is how I look without the tapes I mean you get used to looking so young. :)  I also recomend from cosmesearch the wrinkle patches there awesome and really work I use them on my forehead.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  Easy to use, comfortable &amp; lasts all day.  I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference it makes.  Love using it when I go to parties where people haven&#x27;t seen me in a while.  Get many compliments on how young I look (I&#x27;m 63). I only need to use the face lift tapes.... don&#x27;t need to use the neck lift tapes yet.  Very happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> I am ordering this the 2nd time because they really work....but lost the biggest rope &amp; never got the 3rd one like it has in it now..All I have is the one for the neck &amp; its great..just used it last night...</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use, have used them for years.  You do not need long hair to use them.  I have a boob that is cut short in back and they work just fine.  Secret - at times you can reuse them, just depends on length of wear and sweat (dancing usually just one wear).... I always keep a set of back up tapes in my purse.  It really does make you feel years younger than you look....or it does me (but then I am a woman of a certain age, and I&#x27;ve lost 100 pounds so I need all the help I can get ).  TRY THEM</li>
            <li> Works OK in certain situations depending on the hairstyle</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this actually works. At first, I was skeptical of buying this product because of some of the negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here, but I&#x27;m glad I did! You wouldn&#x27;t think that bands and tapes could give you a instant face lift but it works like magic. If you take your time and read the instructions properly then it is very effective and lasts throughout the entire day. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a facelift without spending thousands of dollars.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to use.</li>
            <li> I kept this product on my save for later list for about a year. I finally moved it up to my cart and purchased it. I got really excited about it too! Ran to YouTube and watched the video a couple times.. Bout 5 days later it was at my house. I applied it correctly the FIRST TIME surprisingly and the results were so dramatic it put a lil lump in my throat. I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about my turkey neck inherited from my dad. I&#x27;m 50 and always thought I  looked a lot older. I am so satisfied. I wanted to take before pictures but didn&#x27;t want to remove them. My kids were amazed..</li>
            <li> This product made my wedding a memorable experience. I wasn&#x27;t worried about the wedding pictures and looking like I needed to keep my veil on. My husband cried when he saw me. He said I looked so beautiful. Even my son was impressed.</li>
            <li> I should have known that this would not work.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on me for being so stupid.  What a joke. LOL!</li>
            <li> I had to go through a few before I got the hang of it. It does do the job, but after half an hour it started giving me a headache. They can become very uncomfortable if you have to wear them for a long time. I would still recommend them though as they did take quite a few years off.</li>
            <li> First of all, I do like the face lift tapes but I have lost my money because since reordering on April 10th I still have not received my 40 tapes with the 2 elastic neck lift bands.  I&#x27;ve contacted the company directly and they told me unless the tapes are returned in the mail that they cannot replace them.  Since the order this past time was through Amazon, (because they had a better deal) I also emailed them.  They emailed me back saying they would indeed replace the tapes but I still have not received them.  My mail man is always getting our mail mixed up with other people&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m sure my tapes were put in the wrong mailbox.  I emailed Amazon to please send them UPS  and ask for a signature and also an I.D.  (otherwise,anyone can sign).  I do wish stores would start selling these tapes so I would no longer have mail problems.  I can&#x27;t depend on our mail system.  Right now I&#x27;m wearing a strip of medical tape to hold up my neck and jaw line.  I twist it in the middle so the back doesn&#x27;t stick to my hair and I leave just enough on each end to stick on the side of my face just below my ear, partly on my jaw line. Also I sometimes lay a sheer ribbon the width of the tape along in the middle of the tape leaving an inch or so at each end.  It is pretty comfortable, actually more so than the thin elastic Cosme Search elastic neck band which often cuts into my neck.&lt;br /&gt;It sticks very well lasting all day as long as you clean the oil off your face first.  I get the  medical tape at Wall Greens and it is very cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Gently clean the area with olive oil and then warm soapy water and a terry cloth rag at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money this is a total rip off you will find yourself returning this product or tossing it in the nearest trash can which I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.L</li>
            <li> Face does not work to good but love neck one.  Cannot wear very long. Gives me a headache but great to outings and parties.</li>
            <li> These face lift tapes are excellent . make sure you clean then area properly with alcohol cleanser and they stay on as long as you want they absolutely lifted my confidence too. A must  have for when you skin feels saggy and old. Brilliant stuff</li>
            <li> the elastic strips for the facelifts were too short, kept pullin tapes off of face. they need to be just alittle longer</li>
            <li> Very difficult to work with. I think the lift stickers need to be smaller and thinner.  My neck looked like it had been burned by a hair straightener(what I told people) after a day of wearing them.  Thanks anyway. It was  a worthy effort.</li>
            <li> Holds but tape can be seen</li>
            <li> I think this product is every woman&#x27;s easy answer to looking great without surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the price is reasonable, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to friends and they love it to.</li>
            <li> Hot flashes and sweating causes the tape to come undone quickly. If not for that, it probably would stay put.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference it made. I look 20 years younger</li>
            <li> to me with was a waste of money. always looking for the next best thing to look younger.  not this one</li>
            <li> This product was too big. If you are a smaller person, this will not work for you. I wish it was made in different sizes.</li>
            <li> I reall like the results, easy enough to put on . it stayed on all day long without coming off!  M y only complaint is is that it is slightly uncomfortable around my ears.  I had to keep moving around the ear area!  maybe with alittle more practice I can fix I t around the ears.</li>
            <li> One of the elastic things didn&#x27;t even have hooks on them, and they were all way too long, plus they didn&#x27;t stick well, and kept coming off!  No good!,,,,</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.  Too expensive.  Bands broken when I received them.  Have not received replacement bands.  Could  be useful if  better made.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find it worked out for the first 30 mins of the night but after sweating and movement they just would not stay!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product as the elastics were broken and couldn&#x27;t us them at all.  I guess it is a buyers beware.  I do like the concept.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Doesn&#x27;t work. Sticks to your skin with tape that won&#x27;t stick no matter how clean your skin is. I personally feel like it is a rip off.</li>
            <li> Sorry but it wouldn&#x27;t stick at all. So useless. Maybe the glue was old but very disappointed as I hoped it would work</li>
            <li> The concept is simple and easy to apply. The only downfall I have noticed is that the tape doesn&#x27;t stick for an extended period of time. Be sure to cleanse your application site with rubbing alcohol as it helps the tape to adhere better. This product gives a great &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; effect however I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars due to the issues with the tape not adhering as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> After one week of use, the metal barbs and hook became detached from the elastic bands.  They were impossible to rethread, which rendered the system useless. In addition, the adhesive tapes opened a raw, rash in front of my ears where they had been attached. I would not purchase this product again, nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin for long</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  You get less than what you pay for.  Directions are bad and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Better than surgery!!!!  And, they work!</li>
            <li> they do kinda work you just have to pull your hair forward to hide the tape &amp; put make up on after or they will not stick. So if u wear your hair close and around your face they are a good idea for a special day!</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work as shown. Very hard to assemble and once you figure it out and tape it on, no visible lift seen and it keeps coming off. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes it would lift my droopy neck just a little (not under the illusion that it would approximate the effects of an actual face lift). However, it does not work.  Adhesive pads do not stick well and even for the moment that they are in place before popping off, there is no appreciable difference in the way my neck looks.</li>
            <li> I first thought this was funny but I love it. Its gives me a instant face lift in the cheek and jowl area. which are my trouble spots. it does what it says for me. I wear it when i go out, my hair covers it, I have shoulder length hair and I look younger because of it. I will recommend it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works as promised. only problem is one set of elastics arrived broken, called the company customer service and person was rude. said to watch video because i was putting the bands on wrong. I was not. The elastic came broken. They did replace it when i called back a second time. Also these cannot be worn over two or three hours as the elastics begin to hurt.</li>
            <li> Terrible did not stick ackward to use. Would never recommend</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try these. The tapes definitely hold if you do it correctly. They do work, but to give yourself the maximum lift, they have to be tight.  I tried them twice and both times they gave me a headache but I realize this may not happen to everyone.</li>
            <li> I tried the face lift only once, as I worry the tape or string might come off in public, but it definitely lifted my face.  I didn&#x27;t try the eye lift or neck one, but I do think they will work as well.  My son said I looked 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Works as described. It takes some trial and error to find best placement but the package does advise to try without using the tape first</li>
            <li> Very disepointed !!!!  I recived my order today and the elastic bands r broken plus is for blonde hair whene my order was for dark hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> use it for wedding and events, makes your pictures look so much better. being a senior, we need all the help we can get.</li>
            <li> If you are a normal person used to feeling natural and comfortable you will hate this product! Very difficult to use, get sticked on your hair, is visible and not comfortable to wear. It provides a minimal face lift but at what price? Feeling and looking ridiculous. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stick as well as I had hoped, it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to wear for long periods. I Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I never should of bought this, reminds me of the times I tell the children not to buy stuff that is junk.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the tape not sticking and it wasn&#x27;t gummy.  One things is my sideburns were too short so I put the tape up higher and the barb was sticking between my face and ear.  Another problem I didn&#x27;t figure was that my hair was too short in back for the neck lift.</li>
            <li> They stay on but it&#x27;s just not something that&#x27;s practical for every day. The tapes show if the wind blows and the hooks are not comfortable. Won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> Tape doesn&#x27;t stick.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It will lift your face but it is very difficulty to hide the adhesive lifts</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. I love it. It works if you dont want plastic surgery this is truly the next best thing. It takes years off your face. Everyone asks what are you doing you have turned back the Hands of Time. They are hard to remove and I would fresh ones daily. I highly recommend this product. Bought through Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mother,, she loves it. She makes her sisters jealous... they now know because I had to tell them where we got them.</li>
            <li> worked great the first time i tried it...really made a difference - but was sad when i had to take them off. Also i had to put little clips over the top cord so it wouldn&#x27;t show when the wind blew or in case some other hair-raising thing happened&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive way to have a &amp;#34;quickie&amp;#34; &amp; it lasted about 12 hrs until I took them off - would have lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am very allergic to adhesive and the fixture used did not react with me at all - a real plus.</li>
            <li> I was thnking about a half face lift &amp; came across this. For now its works for me but you need enough hair to cover your ears or tape will show. I only needed a jaw line lift so i use the tape that goes at the back of the neck &amp; behind the ears. They work but don&#x27;t sweat or they will slide off. So if you need to see how you would look after neck or face lift check it out. They are nice to have for that boost of confidence.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, that truly delivers the look of a more firm and toned neck. I&#x27;m 64, and gravity is beginning to make it&#x27;s entrance. Secret lift takes years off that appearance.</li>
            <li> This product works if applied per the instructions. I have read that someone else said they don&#x27;t stay on. I used an alcohol wipe to cleanse off the areas where the tapes stick and that helped it to stay put. It did let go suddenly when I had an insurance man at my house. I just popped and releases abruptly but I was able to grab it and rip it off the other side before it was noticed.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to make it work for me so I don&#x27;t think  that I will be using this product.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t hold on the skin. I Follow the instructions Step-by-step, no matter what I try this product does not work.  don&#x27;t waste your money on this scam.</li>
            <li> Had no problem with the tape, cleaned the area with alcohol and it sticks just fine. The tape is not shiny and is invisible. I was worried about wearing this on windy day, but I am unable to notice that the tape is even there. Positioning the tape was also not a problem, I was lucky to get it right the first time. It was a little strange feeling at first after I got the bands secured, but you acclimate to the feeling in about an hour and do not notice it. It took 10 years off my face immediately. I have very few wrinkles or \\&quot;crows feet, I just wanted a lift for my jaw line. This product worked great for that issue. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a subtle but fresh appearance. It really works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use for a few hours not a whole day. I felt no circulation, uncomfortable where the tapes are if I leave it on for long. If I continue to use it for a few days I have rash on my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the dishwasher is starting to show rust..This is not good..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tabs do not stay put. With in 5 min. they are popping off. I followed the instructions as writtten.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!!! For the Skeptics.. Yess It works!!!!..</li>
            <li> I am flipping out right now! Just used the neck one for the very first time today and I cannot tell you how over the top happy I am. I am slender and have had this gathering of &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; under my chin. I have tried to just focus on being thankful to be healthy and aging well but seriously.... I am over the moon right now. It is very shuttle but it is perfect, for me. It makes ME feel better about myself, I don&#x27;t really care about others. I am wanting to be able to look in the mirror and not have to go.... &amp;#34; Oh, GAWD!!!&amp;#34; Now I am looking in the mirror and going &amp;#34;Thank you, God for this amazing little, wonderful creation.&amp;#34; I will never do the surgery thing, just will not, for me.... this works perfect and is perfect and easy to use. Also, you cannot see anything... and honestly if when the wind is blowing and some young, whipper snapper says anything about these to me... I am going to say..&amp;#34;No different then your fake eye lashes, your fake nails and probable a few other &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; things on you, so zip it!  LOL hope you are laughing... I&#x27;m just so darn happy &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> The second time I used the neck lift the band broke in half.Now I have to order a new band.</li>
            <li> I love it! I buy for second time :-)</li>
            <li> Put this on and was wondering why the clerk at the store was looking at me do strange. Got in the car looked in the mirror and you could see one of the tapes showing. If you have long enough hair on the sides of your face, then this will work well. If not, then save your money.</li>
            <li> This face lifting kit really works well.  The tapes stay in place all day and no one can see the elastic bands.  Not only does it do what it says it does, but it is comfortable as well.  This did wonders for me at a recent holiday party, people said I looked great and I felt great too!  I will be back to buy more of this incredible product.</li>
            <li> These items do what the say they will do. They are very discreet, and will keep it&#x27;s hold all night.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and mostly time.these never stay in place longer than&lt;br /&gt;1minute at a time and they would loose their  sticky quality constantly. Even when you wipe skin dry with alcohol.. I&#x27;ll say it again,waste of money and time</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money. I bought it on a whim thinking it would help with my sagging jowls, but I think the only thing that will help that is plastic surgery, something I&#x27;m not about to have done.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what a little adhesive and a couple of elastic string can do.  I saw instant RESULTS; so did my family and friends. However, they did not know the true reasoning behind the change. I only shared the info with my husband.  The remarks I received were few, but the looks and the thoughts were many.  I could see them saying in their minds \\&quot;Something is different\\&quot; My pastor is very observant and during the sermon, he kept looking directly at me and I could see his mind \\&quot;wondering\\&quot;. When I did reveal the \\&quot;secret\\&quot; to a few, their remarks were:  \\&quot;I knew there was something different\\&quot;; \\&quot;I saw your face and it appeared to be thinner.  I said to myself she must have lost weight\\&quot; This is just a sampling of the remarks. Thanks Amazon, I had seen something of this nature exposed by two women on TV years ago, but was not able to find it until I randomly put \\&quot;non-surgical facelift\\&quot; into your search engine. Thanks Again.</li>
            <li> The best face tightening product I&#x27;ve found in years. I use them everyday. They&#x27;re super easy to use. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them falling off and I set them pretty tight, but I swab the area where I&#x27;m going to place them with alcohol first so the tape is on a super clean surface. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> The tabs do not stay stuck to your skin. Even if they would they are still very visable. I returned them for a refund</li>
            <li> Great product, wish it came with a couple more of the elastic bands though. Would definitely buy again and have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> Depending on the temperature, and whether I am sweating or not, these didn&#x27;t stay on very long. If you have hot flashes and get warm, they pop right off your skin. If you have sensitive skin, the adhesive turns your skin red and mine left a sore and then scabbed. Great concept if they stayed on. These can also be very uncomfortable. I tried readjusting them in every way I could to make them work optimally and nothing worked. The band is uncomfortable and after a few hours the adhesive begins to wear away and they pull on your skin until they snap off, and then they leave adhesive residue on your skin which is hard to remove. Also, if you pull a little too hard on them, they tear and then you&#x27;ve ruined it. Be prepared to have plenty of back-ups in your purse if you are out for a special occasion because you will need them. Carry alcohol to remove the residue and to re-apply. My final opinion on these are: If you are only using them for a night out and you aren&#x27;t going to be sweating much, they&#x27;re okay. For anything more, they&#x27;re more trouble than what they&#x27;re worth.</li>
            <li> This item is phenomenal, it really works.  You look years younger; of course this is vanity at its best.  Amazing product, you have to follow the instructions and you definitely need medium to long hair in the front of you face to cover the tape.  For those of you who are afraid of injectables or a facelift like I am, this is the best alternative beside facial exercises.  I highly recommend this product and oh make sure to order extra tapes cause you won&#x27;t want to run out of them.  :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
            <li> Elastic bands to secure tape in place broke instantly. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Junk. Cheap Crap.Waste of money,</li>
            <li> They will work with practice and being careful to follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I read many of the negative reviews, and most of them complained about the tapes not sticking properly. Honestly, I just can&#x27;t imagine how that could happen. I have 47 year old, pale, sensitive, combination skin. If I wash my face, and apply these tapes, they will stay on all day, and I have to GENTLY pull them off at night, or they will rip my skin right off. LOL! The adhesive on the tape is very, very strong, and I have never had them fail, even in the heat of the deep South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the effect, it is amazing. All that mid 40&#x27;s sagging just disappears, and I feel more put together, and less tired looking when I wear them. They can be mildly uncomfortable if the tape isn&#x27;t placed exactly right, or if you wear them for a very long time, but it&#x27;s never unbearable, just annoying at worst. I had one of the elastic barbs poke the edge of my ear all day once, but that was my fault for putting the tape a little too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are worth every cent and then some for special occasions, or to wear out in public. My hairstyle completely covers the tapes, but my skin is so fair, the tape just seems disappears into my skin anyway. A little mineral powder to kill the \\&quot;tape shine\\&quot; and they are very hard to see, even up close. Obviously, they don&#x27;t work for everyone, hence the one star reviews, but I would certainly recommend trying them if you are interested in a quick fix to look a bit younger and fresher. If they don&#x27;t work, no major investment lost, and if they do, the results can be startlingly good.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!!!! To all the negative reviewers out there....Those who can...do, those who can&#x27;t...diss those who can.  I&#x27;ve been using this tape for a year and after practice learned how to hide it with my hair.  You can scoff,make jokes,make sarcastic remarks, diss and try to discourage others all you want too...but I&#x27;m here to tell you once again...IT WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I knew it when I decided to try these.  They pull the skin into abnormal bulges that are visible.  Did not like.</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable to wear if you want to use it all day. The tapes do stick quite well, too well that it left a residue on my neck underneath my ears.  It turned red and burned for a week or so.  The bands were so tight it cut the back of my neck.  However, the product does pull your sagging chin and neck taut. It did give me a younger look.  I will use it again for shorter periods, like special events.</li>
            <li> works well  I use a little bit of spirit gum for a little extra hold but I don&#x27;t think it is really necessary I don&#x27;t pull it really tight just enough for a nice lift I don&#x27;t use the neck one because it hurts after a little while</li>
            <li> Although recieved it late&lt;br /&gt;But it worth it&lt;br /&gt;And the cosmesearch dealt with me so professionaly</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life! I feel so much better about my appearance. I have my face back! I actually wear the secret lift near my eyes and amazingly it lifts my jaw area as well! I am really impressed with the tape...it will stay on and not come off. You will love this product!</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the poor reviews, for me the tape did stick. It was the cord that wrap up and around my head that was a nightmare. It kept slipping down the night I tired it out. When it slips, it pulls by the ear causing major pain. My girlfriend and I went to the restroom to try and resecure the cord. I pulled it up to reattached and SNAP! The hook broke off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the cord was a better quality, these could work great. When I first put it on, I saw a difference and a lift. But if the cord slips after about 10 minutes, what good is it? And if the hook breaks after about an hour use, then I render this whole kit useless. It may work for those with thicker hair or a perfectly shaped skull...maybe. But I doubt it.</li>
            <li> This is truly a remarkable product - sort of like a magical transformation for a 24-hour period!  Of course, you can apply the miracle tabs with the bands each morning in very little time and the results are truly amazing.  The INSTANT FACE AND NECK LIFT TAPES are easily applied and you can adjust the lift with just a slight pull.  People kept telling me how good I looked (I need to order more as I was testing to see if they truly worked!) and some of my friends asked me, \\&quot;What have you done differently\\&quot;?  I would ask them why they were asking, and they would just look at me and say, \\&quot;I am not sure, but you really look great today\\&quot;!  That is a true testimony that they do, indeed, work!  Ready for an evening event?  Get your Tapes and Smile the years away!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BVYT2Y</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It worked as stated.  After wearing it for several hours the band slipped to the top of my ears and was a little uncomfortable.  I did look 10 years younger.  I would definitely purchase these again, and would recommend them to anyone needing a lift.</li>
            <li> Works great for a special events. It does have some lifting effects and I was very pleased with the results. Works more effectively on jowls. Somewhat difficult to work the bands through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reordering these tapes for the second time.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with your product, younger appearance in seconds. The tapes were simple to use and I finally got rid of the sagging chicken neck, fun and easy. I went to a wedding and noone noticed the tapes, they hid under my hair and everyone commented on how I shaved off ten years. I order the tapes monthly now until I finally let myself go when I hit my 70&#x27;s. For now old age is gone and it&#x27;s fun to look 40 when I am 50. Seriously they are wonderful, the only issue is the tapes when you try to take them off, use baby oil or a moisturizer as they do stick like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starbun..</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  Tapes don&#x27;t stick well at all.  Created more wrinkles. Would have been great for a Halloween costume face.  My family got a lot of laughs out of it. Probably was meant more for someone that doesn&#x27;t have that much of a problem in the first place.</li>
            <li> My mom really likes this product. She uses it every day and it makes her feel better about herself, and the fact that she is aging gracefully. This is a good alternative to surgery a non-painful way to look and feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money .</li>
            <li> I really do not like to waste money and that is just what happened when I purchased Secret Lift!  It does not work!  The tape does not stick.  It didn&#x27;t even stick until I got to the other side.  A few times it stuck for a few minutes until I turned my head.  What a joke!  It does not even deserve the 1 star rate!</li>
            <li> I only wasted one strip. I put it too close to hairline and it didn&#x27;t stick. I put on the neck lift tape before going to work. By the time I got home 8 hrs. later my neck was burning and red. When I took the tape off there was a blister the size of the tape. Not on one side of my neck but both. I did notice it tightened my double chin, but it was not worth the discomfort I had for the next 10 days.</li>
            <li> I was not asked the color of my hair, thus I received a dark brown band, my hair is blonde.</li>
            <li> Not good with thin hair, otherwise works great</li>
            <li> I love it! re ordering!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stick no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> There were no directions included with the product and the tape does not stick. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I already wrote my opinion and you people refused to printed because I didn&#x27;t follow your guidelines. ...I do not trust you. ...I can give a critical opinion with concise words than a bunch of words. .....the product was completely different like from the first time I order. ....no packaging, less taI pes. ....arrived late....I will not order from this company again. ....</li>
            <li> I purchased this with hesitation, thinking oh yeah an instant face life!!  But I decided to try it &amp; spend the 20.00 (shipping included).  When I received I watched the video a few times then I gave it a shot. It took me twice to get it exactly right but that wasn&#x27;t anything compared to the way I look. The video also tells you it may take a little practice to get it exactly how you want it. Wow, this is amazing, I love it &amp; I feel so confident now. No one can tell you are using these, other than your face is lifted.  This is an awesome product.  The tapes stay in place all day, no mishaps or anything. Since I purchased I have been using every day even if I don&#x27;t leave my house! They just make me feel so good &amp; look good. Ordered more cause I don&#x27;t want to run out!  I am a customer for life.  Really, give these a try, you will be very impressed.  Customer service was awesome also &amp; very fast shipping.  I promise you will love this, just give it a try, you will not be sorry.  To think of the money people spend on surgery, the pain, the down time etc when all you need are these.  I am hooked!  :)</li>
            <li> it works but lol you have to really work with it, to get best results. It did caused  a little rash when I left it on over night... I will not do that again lol... I would recommend using Secret lift.  As I said before you got to really work with it. I must start saving money to get this fixed by a doctor lol like the actors do, but until then I will be using this product...oh! by the way you have to let the alcohol  dry oh for about 3 mins or so, if you don&#x27;t! it won&#x27;t stick, I used a cotton ball to clean the neck area lol you will get better sticking power if you do. lol whatcha gonna do... better then nothing right! I hope I helped you guys out by writing this review. wow! what we do to stay pretty lol</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this method works to freshen up your look. The directions are clear and easy to follow. The change is subtle, but visible. I recoemmend setting aside one set of tapes to \\&quot;play around with\\&quot; in terms of placement, especially if you want to look especially well for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOD!!!!!! first thing I must say my product arrived just in time sooner than I expected, Now back to OH My God :-) I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it but when I did I look up and said Thank you lord because let me tell you this little amazing product does exactly like it shows on the videos easy to put on, The tape sticks very well and may the truth be spoken if I can give more stars than (5) star I would because when they said facelift without surgery wow!! I love it , I am going to keep it in Stock in my house I am going to be One of your favorite customer, My husband is going to wonder why after all these years I&#x27;m still looking good but he&#x27;s never going to know my Secret. You know viewer out There I have no more words!! all I can say is try the product if you want to look about 10 years younger in a safe way Try it just Try it and I guarantee you won&#x27;t be sorry or regret. Right now I am beside myself it&#x27;s a wonderful thing to feel good while looking Good:-) Thank you so much for this product!! Whoever invented it Awesome.</li>
            <li> I watched the YouTube video and followed the directions in the package.  I cleaned the area with alcohol after I decided where I was going to place the pads.  The first pad went on okay but the second pad went on a little wonky.  It lifted more on one side than the other but I was in a hurry.  My hair covered the flaw so I went out for the day.  Well, it was a windy day and my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.  I got so many stares from people in the stores I stopped trying to pull my hair over the tapes.  It would have been laughable had it been on someone else&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take them off as soon as I got home and OMG!!!!!!  I pulled as slowly as possible but I still thought my skin was coming off with the adhesive.  You cannot say the adhesive is not strong!  The next day, I had hot pink marks where the pads  and my skin had been.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t know why this happened.  Maybe I don&#x27;t need to clean my face with alcohol because I have dry skin.  I&#x27;ll try it once more and if it happens again, I&#x27;ll give it away.</li>
            <li> This face lifting kit really works well for me. When I go to appointments where my DOB is known, the clerk can&#x27;t believe my age. I was getting injections of fillers, but since I have been applying the tapes, it is much, much less costly, painful and bothersome.  If I am going out or around others, I apply my tapes.  They work basically with raising my cheeks which I like the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is because of the tan color of my skin, if my hair is blown, the tapes are shown with a hazy look beside me ears. Any suggestions are appreciated.</li>
            <li> These are great if you have medium to long hair. They don&#x27;t work so well for short hair because where they want you to position them they can be seen. They are kind of difficult to see but they can be seen nun the less. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The tapes wouldn&#x27;t hold very long about. 5 minutes and the. Your left with sticky crap on your face which was hard to get off ..... Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stick very good</li>
            <li> The stickers come undone which could be very embarrassing. Luckily I was home. I put alcohol on the area for the tape to make sure my skin was free of oils and that didn&#x27;t work. Rubbed the tape for several seconds as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I saw a video while researching mini-facelift regarding Secret Lift Instant Face, Neck and Eye lift kit. I went to the company&#x27;s site and immediately ordered it, the price was great and I figured if it didn&#x27;t work like the Youtube video at least I didn&#x27;t break the bank trying to find an alternative to a surgical mini-facelift! I came to Amazon reviews after purchasing the kit and read the reviews.  Since many had great to good results with this product, I really couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it.  If it would lift up my \\&quot;grandmother&#x27;s jowls\\&quot; that have started to appear, it would be fantastic! It arrived today, since I was alone I ran to my bath and followed the simple instructions. The tapes held tight the first time I applied and rubbed them as directed.  I was able to get grandma out of my face in less than five minutes! I hid the tapes well under my shoulder length hair and bangs, not a problem at all to do.  Went out to dinner with one nagging review whirling in my head about them \\&quot;popping loose\\&quot;.  Never happened.  Came home and literally had to hold my face while slowly peeling off the tapes that were frankly, stuck like glue to my skin.  The instructions state clearly to remove all makeup in front of your ears, clean the area well (I did use alcohol on the cleaned area).  The tapes went on easily, stuck tight and the luckily I got the placement right the first time.  When I lifted the two elastics to attach at my crown, magically those horrible little jowls and small eye wrinkles all went away!  I can&#x27;t understand why some reviewers had so many problems with this product.  Maybe it&#x27;s different skin types. I can understand getting the \\&quot;barbs\\&quot; the wrong way and having that hurt but that&#x27;s an easy fix (I would just hold the taped area and pull a little on the elastic and twist the barb the opposite way). I have always experimented with hair styles and makeup tricks so I didn&#x27;t find this difficult to do at all.  I can&#x27;t wait to go to a function and wear this secret, I know with it on, I look as good (if not better) as my younger family members and friends who are all at least five-ten years younger than me.  All I know is that this product definitely works on me and I will be a customer for life re-ordering tapes.</li>
            <li> This really is a very clever discreet solution that punches well above it&#x27;s weight. A great temporary fix for my crinkly neck - I will certainly order again</li>
            <li> these work great for a temporary lift on days when I am tired or haven&#x27;t gotten the rest required. work great</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters wedding, it took several attempts to get it right, but once I got the hang of it, this is a cheap facelift, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Again,,,don&#x27;t waste your money. This is a crazy looking string and tape joke. Noooo don&#x27;t do it!! It&#x27;s a real joke.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was a little skeptical. But it does work! They give you a lot of securing tape as well.</li>
            <li> First of all, the model used in the video didn&#x27;t look like she needed much of a lift. She had NO turkey neck, so yes, it made her neck appear a bit tighter.  The facelift one will pull the skin tighter to smooth out the \\&quot;parens\\&quot; around the mouth, but after a while, the band starts to hurt, because you need to pull it tight enough to pull the skin.  However, if you have TURKEY NECK, this product will NOT work for that.  If you have short hair, there are some disadvantages. One, is that it&#x27;s hard to hide the tape that you stick on the sides of your face. Two, the tighter you  pull the bands, the longer the tail will be, therefore, the tail will hang down in the back if your hair isn&#x27;t long enough to cover it.  And lastly,  when removing the bands, it will also pull some of your hair, and that too, is uncomfortable.  All in all, as the old saying goes.... \\&quot;if it&#x27;s too good to be true...then it probably isn&#x27;t\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> A total joke! Do not waste your money! Item not what it appears to be. The tape does not stick and you are able to see it if u have short hair. The bands break and in all it is worthless!!!!!!!!! True statement</li>
            <li> It does what it says but the tapes are a little pricey. Maybe CosmeSearch will consider selling a larger amount or offering a discount for regular costumers.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how well they worked.  I recommend them to everyone.  Of course, it is necessary to have enough hair to properly cover them from view.</li>
            <li> Frankly, if you think you&#x27;re going to look like you&#x27;ve lost ten years, or more, you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed. It is nice for an instant, though.</li>
            <li> Very surprised how well this product performed.  I can wear everyday, stayed put until chose to remove.  Absolutely must clean all areas, including hands, of oils.  Alcohol works extremely well.  The cords need to be more substancial.</li>
            <li> I even hate to admit that I bought this...the tabs release when you sweat...had one fly loose in a grocery store....don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> horrible product,  very hard to wear</li>
            <li> This really is the best company!!  Wonderful customer service and a fantastic product!!  Ladies, I am 63 and no one ever guesses my age and its really due to this fabulous company and product!!  If you hate your sagging neck, get this guaranteed you will not be sorry.  I&#x27;ve not used it on the cheeks, just the neck.  This will save you thousands of dollars and keep you out of the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS....LESS EXPENSIVE THAN GETTING CUT ON.  EASY TO USE.... YOU LOOK SO MUCH BETTER AFTERWARDS.  TRY IT; YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> this is truly a amazing product they will pull your eyes up like it says a instant face lift highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST and inexpensive gadget to look TEN YEARS YOUNGER INSTANTLY.  I have used this item off and on over a period of several years.  It is still the best thing out there short of surgery.  There is a learning curve to setting the tapes correctly and learning to use the least amount of pull on the elastic band.  You can get 2 or 3 days use of the tapes if you don&#x27;t get them wet, and don&#x27;t leave the elastic band connected all day and all night.  Watch videos on youtube for help.  Treat yourself to a young, fresh face.</li>
            <li> it is a great product we use it for live performances  face enhancement in class.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the product for sometime for my mother and I can tell you she is one happy customer! The tapes are simple to apply and the great thing is the same kind of tape is used for both neck and face, the skin needs to be clean and dry before you apply the tapes but once you apply them they last for a long time! They never came off alone we have always had to remove them ourselves and the longest my mom stayed In them is 10 hours! Thay can probably last longer! That&#x27;s just fabulous! The great thing about the tapes is that the elastic bands used to connect them can be adjusted to suit the level of comfort tou desire and how much you want to lift your skin, I have nothing negative to say about the product it&#x27;s great value for your money! Plus the customer service at Cosmesearch are outstanding, they are prompt in replying to any enquiry emails and do their best to resolve any issues, I am one greatly satisfied customer both in terms of product quality and service :D</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for the special occasion, just not permanent. Easy to use and greta results. Looks great. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable to wear, and does exactly what it says--gives you a face lift.  I&#x27;m 54, with a bit of a sagging jaw line.  Put on the tapes and voila---sags &amp; lines gone.  I get so many comments, \\&quot;have you changed your hair, working out?\\&quot;  I used to wear them for special occasions, now i wear them everyday.  I&#x27;m going to give some to my mom (84 years old).  Make sure you rub the tape as long as the directions say, and you&#x27;ll love this product too!</li>
            <li> This review is for the product, not the seller. The seller was super fast and professional. But this product is of very poor quality. The \\&quot;sticky pads\\&quot; that pull back your skin do NOT stick. And they are HUGE! They say it&#x27;s best to \\&quot;hide them under a wig\\&quot; but you&#x27;d seriously have to shave your head and wear a wig on your pulled back baldness to make these things work. And even if they did stick the elastic bands don&#x27;t stay in place and want to keep snapping off they holds. Sure a facelift looks great if you imagine it and put your fingers to your face and lift the way the model is in the picture...but that is NOT what these things so. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Does what is advertised and fairly comfotable, but was a bit tricky to learn how to apply correctly when all alone.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be rather difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and kept getting tangled in the strings &amp; tape.&lt;br /&gt;Got frustrated with trying to use the tapes.  Even when I did manage to&lt;br /&gt;get a set positioned right the string kept sliding in my hair and looked ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine if &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; hair was my style this might work but with my straight, smooth hair&lt;br /&gt;no way!</li>
            <li> I expected better ease of use along with some kind of result.  The product in theory should work well, in reality it is mediocre.  The adhesive leaves a sticky residue when removed.</li>
            <li> Not as easy as it looks!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful  product.  Use when I go out and sometime everyday. Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand reviews that say tapes will not stick.&lt;br /&gt;Try cleaning skin with alcohol where tapes are placed.&lt;br /&gt;Clean finger tips with alcohol as well. Do not put makeup&lt;br /&gt;over strips and do not touch sticky side of tapes.  They&lt;br /&gt;should stick. Amazing product! Look years yonger.[[ASIN:B004BVYT2Y Instant Face and Neck Lift Tapes]]</li>
            <li> I was getting married and wanted to lift my sagging neck.  I am an older woman.  I was amazed and surprised how much they worked.  I have long hair so I was able to cover the tapes.  My only disappointment was that one of the tapes came loose after the ceremony.  So I ran into th bathroom and put a drop of superglue (I know but I was desperate) on the tape and it held in place for the rest of the night.  Make sure the area to be taped and your fingers are clear of all oils, etc before taping.  I gave it a four because the tape loosened but otherwise I was very impressed.  It sure made a difference in my photos - took years off of me.</li>
            <li> These are the bomb diggity!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work like majic/exactly what this company say it does, it does!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will forever buy these.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times and have been very satisfied.  The tapes stick well and last all day.</li>
            <li> They are fun trying to see howmuch better you can look. Great fun. My husband couldnt tell but said i looked great.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised, but there is a fair amount of effort required to install and conceal the tapes on ones face.</li>
            <li> Helps....&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping</li>
            <li> These tapes and bands are fantastic, I look and feel years younger. So happy I finally found them. Instructions were great.It took a bit of practice, now only takes 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This kit is a waste of money. Tabs are visible. Looks like you tried to scotch tape your face to your ears. Very unnatural.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was a little bit unsure, but then, when I gave it a try, Wow! I looked different.  The sagging neck wasn&#x27;t there anymore.  I actually look like ten or twelfe years younger. Amazing! Also the service was excellent.  I received the product the very next day. Thank you so much. I will recomend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. You can lift your eye but is painful</li>
            <li> ok for a short time.  Only bothered to use one time</li>
            <li> You need to wear a wig with this product.  The wires, connectors, what ever, separate your hair.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on these worthless rubber bands.  I followed the instruction carefully,  Here&#x27;s what happen.&lt;br /&gt;Instruction say stretch , got it,  bang - broke the rubber band.  Got new one and stretch it carefully.  pulled of the white -- now sticky and ready to go.  Right! NOT the darn things would not stick to my clean skin (by my ears)  Ok guys, two hours later, numbereous attemts  no luck - I now have $50 worth of broken, not sticky, and what the heck - save your money</li>
            <li> they do work, but it took over a week for my neck to heal,left marks like love bites only very painful.to be fair this could be because Im allergic to nickel.there is a little metal strip to hold tape and this comes in contact a little with your neck.so everyone may not be affected like me.i did think they done a great job,wish I COULD USE AGAIN.HOPE THEY COME UP WITH A SOLOUTION.ON THE OTHER HAND IT COULD BE JUST THE STICKY TAPE.NO LASTING HARM IN GIVING THEM  A TRY</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing a review ever, but I feel good about sharing my experience with &amp;#34;Instant Fact, Neck and Eye Lift.&amp;#34;  At the present time, I can not consider any type of surgical procedure to my face or neck because my other health challenges will not permit.  However, even if I could, I still may not elect to do so because since I discovered the tapes (approximately two (2) years ago, I have been using them every since.  My main concern is underside my chin area, with the sagging.  The tapes smooth out that area very nicely.  I had to learn how to use them correctly, but once I was able to utilize properly, I am convinced that these tapes do wonders for the spirit.  I, (dare not) &amp;#34;do not leave home without them.&amp;#34;  I have been using them for so long, no one really knows how I look without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, I am of a dark skin tone.  Sometimes the tapes show, but I am not concerned, since the positive &amp;#34;out way&amp;#34; the negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is experiencing the &amp;#34;sag&amp;#34;, please give the tapes a try.  You will glad that you did, and of course, without the surgical expense!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have very few wrinkles on my face, but my neck looks horrible.  Last January I scheduled an appointment to have a face and neck lift, it was scheduled for July.  Soon after scheduling, I came across an ad for this product.  I figured the tape might at least solve the problem temporarily, so I placed an order.  Well, to my surprise, the result was amazing.  So amazing, in fact that I cancelled my appointment with the surgeon.  I use the lift tapes everyday and I find them very easy to use.  I use them for my neck only, so my hair covers all signs of usage.</li>
            <li> The tapes work fine. They aren&#x27;t that comfortable for all day, but OK for special occasions of a few hours.  For the price however, they could include an extra band each, just in case one loses one.  Thinking about it, the price is high for some tape and rubber bands. Oh well, it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally obsessed with this product.  I use it to create a lateral eyelift.  Tape stays on all day long, can even sleep with it, won&#x27;t come off (if placed properly).  It literally takes 10 years off your face.  A great Botox alternative too because you can&#x27;t frown.. My hair totally covers the clear tape.  Make sure to tease your hair in the back to hide the rubber band it comes with.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all the stick on&#x27;s came off in less than a hour.&lt;br /&gt;They would not stay on.  I would like to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
            <li> Very confusing and hard to use. Instructions were confusing enough, but then trying to apply them...not able to do period.</li>
            <li> I have seen these used before and remained skeptical until they arrived yesterday.  I immediately tried them and then went in the room where my two teenage daughters were.  They were not aware of my purchase.  I was interacting with them normally when one of them asked me, if I changed skin products or something.  I said no why? They both began looking closely and could not tell what the difference was or see the tapes and just said well whatever you are doing keep it up you look really good! Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since  7 months ago, when I tried them as a last ditch effort in preparing for my first wedding at the age of 40.  As a female who has always taken care to wear sunscreen, eat healthy, not smoke, ect.. I was concerned about my inherited  laugh lines and jowels appearance.  And I needed a ~very~ low budget solution..&lt;br /&gt;After only one practice run, I was more than happy with the performance of the lift!  Even with stress perspiration of the ceremony and after-events.  Clean skin and a few moments to put your hair up, ( use a second mirror to check where you parted your hair)  and you will  be looking at yourself 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the only complaint I can come up with is that it doesnt like many hours of sweaty activity along with naturaly oily skin.  About 6-7 hours if you aren&#x27;t being super hot/sweaty before any slippage occures..even then It barely affects the performance, and never, ever fails completely .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little item can actualy show you what you will look like when you can afford an actual lower face-lift!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, Dyanne</li>
            <li> I like them but they sent me a set for dark hair. my hair is blonde. I have tried to paint the cords no go. Too bad</li>
            <li> Best product out there - LOVE LOVE them.  they are comfortable, don&#x27;t even know you have them on.  Wear them everyday!&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more soon.  Thank You ComeSearch,Inc !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not stay put no matter what was tried. I never knew when it would pop off usually before I left home. Did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this product on TV and I wanted to try it .... Like many others I read a few of the reviews 1st....some good as well as the not so good ....and said y not its not tht expensive ...... IM SO HAPPY THAT I DECIDED TO BUY IT  ..... OMG I look like my old self and  and it even help me to feel like my old self .... I couldn&#x27;t believe what i was seeing my face transformed  right in front of my own eyes.... but the best part was my son kept sayn wow mommy ur workout is working u look great ( i havnt been to the gym in two weeks lol) I love this product this is truly a middle class woman facelift ( can&#x27;t afford the real thing) I sleep in it I wear all the time .... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for this product I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed of how old I had gotten at the young age of 40 ........</li>
            <li> The tape holds all day and somrtimes even longrr, just like they said that it would.  I use it for lift of eyes and neck on a regular</li>
            <li> I got this thinking that even if it didn&#x27;t work I was only out 15 bucks or so. I watched the video and followed the directions. I had no trouble getting the tape to stick right in front of my ears (I cleaned with alcohol first); getting the elastic in place under my hair was a little trickier - I needed a couple of attempts to figure out how much hair to lift up and how to style it over the elastics without displacing them. Once I mastered that, both tapes and elastics are hidden completely. I can see a difference, but it&#x27;s definitely subtle (which is great for a $15 product - I spent thousand$ on Thermage and fillers that only gave me a \\&quot;subtle effect\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difficulty I seem to be having is the elastics tend to slip down toward the base of my skull - I get the best results with them placed a little higher up. After several attempts, I finally found that securing with a couple of bobby pins seems to help, but while the tape and elastics are completely hidden by my hair, sometimes the bobby pins stick out so I think I need to find a better solution (any suggestions?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With pins in place, I gave it a test run today hanging around at home. After several hours, everything is still in place even after vigorous housework. I am noticing one of the hooks is starting to irritate my ear, but I think I can adjust the placement of the tape slightly next time to cure that. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the slight tightening of my jowl line which was really bothering me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Practice really does make perfect. Now that I have the routine down, it takes about 3 minutes to get everything into place and ready to go. I&#x27;m also down to only using 1 bobby pin to hold the elastic in position. Still probably won&#x27;t do it everyday, but when I do use it I have no problem with getting it stay for several hours - in fact, if anything, it&#x27;s an effort to get the tape off!</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever.  Not worth buying.  Very difficult to understand instructions.  Don&#x27;t work.  Won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference. Does feel good on face but other than that nothing</li>
            <li> It does work, but for me they are very uncomfortable.  I wore the neck lift around the house and after a few hours of normal movement, one side popped off.  Got to thinking that if I wore it out to dinner and that happened in front of friends, I would have crawled under the table.</li>
            <li> The usage is better than I thought it would be! Easy to put on, but after a while it may start hurting and can actually peel off some skin if you keep it on for too long. However, it works, the wrinkles, most importantly sagging goes away. Great for a few hours!</li>
            <li> Love the ladies (and/or men) at CosmeSearch!  GREAT customer service, I send an email asking a question and they respond fast! That&#x27;s so wonderful!  As an EXTREMELY busy actress and model (imdb.me/eileenprudhont) I need something that helps get rid of crows feet. This is better than botox!!  Truly easy to use and takes years off!  I&#x27;m not paid to say these things, but it&#x27;s true, the Instant Face and Eye Lift is a life changer!!! Thank You CosmeSearch!</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. Did nothing AT ALL. Ended up in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Okay, gluing your face up, saw this on Shark Tank. It actually works BUT then I was so paranoid about my hair blowing back from my face and people seeing little paper like tabs on edge of face..... that was stressing me out and making more wrinkles LOL .... it works but not for me.</li>
            <li> It really does take 10 years off me.</li>
            <li> I had a facelift ten years ago.  These do a much better job.  The surgery didn&#x27;t life as good as with these.  One set lasts 3 days.  They&#x27;re very comfortable, and I wear them every day.</li>
            <li> Tape is very flimsy!  Tape doesn&#x27;t stick very well!  You need an extra set of hands to apply.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This product works great! It got rid of the turkey waddle that is my neck....&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it begins to hurt around my ears after many hours</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004BVYT2Y Instant Face and Neck Lift Tapes]]After a couple of applications you will be looking so forward to&lt;br /&gt;putting on you makeup because you will see a difference and your smile will reflect the way you feel.  Try it and see!</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  I find myself always nervous that the tape and elastic band is showing.  I have blonde hair and the band is black.  So I&#x27;m always trying to pin my hair over to cover the elastic.  I also have longer hair so I&#x27;m always trying to make sure that my hair by my ears is covering the tape which is extremly hard to do on windy days.  I love the idea of this, but I&#x27;m way more self consious of who can notice this on me.  I find people staring at me and my daughter noticed it on me the other day.  The tape was very difficult to get off and it hurt coming off.  THe longer the tape is on the more my skin itches and becomes puffy and red and itchy afterwards and even while its on.  I had big welts by ears the first time.  This seems to lessen the less time I have the tape on.  Its a great idea though.  Would be much better on short haired people that can brush their hair over the tape and have their hair not move out of place.  The neck tape came off alot, especially if I got warm.</li>
            <li> This  product is a joke as far as Im concerned.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t stick.  Scotch tape would work as well.  Even if it did stick, you would be hard pressed to get them in place so that any positive result was reached.  Keep looking, its a great idea....hopefully one day there will be a product that makes a difference.  I didn&#x27;t even waste my time sending it back, just threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Hard directions to figure out on how applying. I had to do it a different way. It doesn&#x27;t stick that great. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I just need to face facts and age with grace...these are hard for me to use and I am embarrassed I even tried...</li>
            <li> We bought this for one of the characters in a play a while back. We ended up not using the product however it appeared that it would do what we needed as we experimented with it.</li>
            <li> This product was such a disappointment that I would not recommend it to an enemy. Nothing it advertises about it is true. It is poor quality and simply does not work. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> Ladies....this is a wonderful product.  WATCH THE VIDEO on Youtube or Cosmesearch site.  I had the tapes applied incorrectly(long tape around back of head adheing in front of ears) and it still worked rrall well  with major improvement until I watched videos and saw my mistakes.  I have had a face lift years ago, and don&#x27;t want to pay for another one. This product reassures me that I do not need to spend mega bucks right now Just had $1,000.00 worth of fillers in marionette lines around mouth and some in cheeks (need more) which  helped me tremendously, but with the addition of the tapes, my face looks truly sensational..And yes the filler works really well too, but that is aother story. Why the complaints?  The product is very very inexpensive, fully guaranteed and returnable? If you can&#x27;t figure  the application out something is wrong with you. Stop complaining about hair issues.  Of course you need to cover the tapes with your hair.  So grow it a bit  The original with the wire was annoying and frustrating.  I misplaced the wire The one piece units are a blessing. I am 69, photo was take July 12th after wearing tapes all day</li>
            <li> My daughter saw this and said she would like to try them.  I ordered them and when they arrived, they were nothing more than pieces of tape.  Could have done the same thing with surgical tape  or even duct tape.  Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and easy to apply.  Makes your wrinkles very fine and unnoticeable.  Highly recommend it.  Very unnoticeable</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! I only use it on my neck (I&#x27;ve never tried the face part) and it works perfectly. The tape sticks every time and stays on til I take it off. I have long hair and it hides the tapes but as long as you dont wear a ponytail, you should be fine with hair as short as shoulder length. Bottom line, it makes a HUGE difference in how my neck looks. I will be getting a neck lift at some point but for now, I am so thankful for these!! I have been using them for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-aging skin products with no results. DermaGen Anti-wrinkle patches have visibly reduced my fine lines and I have experienced smoother, softer skin after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> They almost work but don&#x27;t stick well and kinda Mickey Mouse made.  Mrs. Chancellor having a bad neck tape day!</li>
            <li> Will not be without these! Do what they say!</li>
            <li> I have reordered this product several times now and am very pleased with it. I work 3 days a week and I wear the tapes to work, to social events, etc. They stay in place all day, they are not visible to others and once I got used to them, they are comfortable to wear. Before I started using them, I really didn&#x27;t feel like going to social events with my skin sagging. But with the help of these tapes I look 10 years younger and am complimented all the time. I will continue using them, they are the greatest alternative to surgery or botox, very affordable too! Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure when I order if it what I wanted but after I had tried it it was perfect for what I needed it for and hid under the hair line quite well. Held very securely</li>
            <li> Misleading product. The add should tell consumers its not a facial creame but string and bandaides that you apply to your face to pull skin back (even though everyone can see the string unless you wear a wig like a 70&#x27;s afro?! No Thanks...in the trash it went along with my money. You should be ashamed of yourself for your add.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Delivers it&#x27;s promise.  Very comfortable and literally undetectable.  A little tricky the first time, but practice makes perfect.  Recommend to anyone who would like to look younger.</li>
            <li> This item is simply junk.  I have written to the seller two times and have yet to get a response. The elastic thingy that is supposed to life your neck snapped before I had the chance to adhere it to my neck. The tapes used would not stick to my face when I stretched the band for the eye lift.  I was sure this item was a hoak but my curiosity got the best of me and  I fell for the pitch.  So, live and learn, always trust your instincts</li>
            <li> it does work but u have to make sure you use alcohol pads on skin first. but it does work</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother. I paid over $16 for about 25 cents of product. Three tiny little elastic bands and some tape. i will never, ever buy from this vendor again. I am so angry a bout how ripped off I am. Sad part is that my mom is old and she threw the receipt away.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such fast shipping. I would definitely shop this Amazon shop again.  I thought I would try this item; I had never seen these before.  I was pleasantly pleased with my inexpensive face lift.</li>
            <li> Work so well. They actually help lift your face so that you don&#x27;t always need to wear them.Wear at least 6 hours a day for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a great concept for a quick fix- but the adhesive tape is impossible to conceal in front of your ears. Catie</li>
            <li> This is my second time re-ordering the product Secret Lift.  It is a great product and look forward to re-ordering the product when I need to...  I would like to add the owner (Ms. Sepa) or the person that took my re-order was very nice&lt;br /&gt;and very help... Again, the product does what it states....</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who is interested in looking younger but cannot afford cosmetic surgery. When I first heard of this product I thought &amp;#34;really?&amp;#34; But decided to try it anyway. I also ordered 3 other very similar products. I liked this product the best. (You may choose another) I live in Maryland where summers are hot and very humid so the toughest test has yet to happen  I need to tell you what happened to me regarding this company recently  I placed an order and the face lift tapes arrived however no strings arrived one is useless without the other i let them know and received an immediate response and the missing part of my order  Even if these tapes don&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold up&amp;#34; during the worst of the humidity I would still purchase them and look forward to autumn I am 67 years old and recently received compliments from friends coworkers and strangers and can only attribute this to the face lift tapes Again I am very very pleased</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.  These little bands work wonders.  Everything I didn&#x27;t like seeing in the mirrow is gone when I where them.  I&#x27;ve only used the top lift bands and they tighten my jawline, and neck;  just within a few minutes!  The bands are nicely hidden, because I have a lot of dark hair.  Also they are comfortable; they just feel like your wearing a headband.  You cannot really see the tape because they are transparent.  This would be perfect it they could make the adhesives a little smaller and possibly hidden behind the ears more.</li>
            <li> This product works.  The set comes in two parts, the neck band and the face bands.  They also come in two colors: brown and blonde-tone.  If you are pale and blone do not order the bands that are brown.  If you order the bands from the company be aware that the neck band and the face bands are two seperate products. I had ordered from Amazon and the bands came brown ( the only color that was available through Amazon when I ordered).  The brown bands showed through my hair and portions at the neck.  I ordered a new set of bands through the company BUT was unaware that face bands meant only 1/2 of the entire set...that portion for the upper face.  The neck band is another product.  It was my mistake.  Cosemesearch company was very patient and kind and did respond to every single message I sent them .  They made good of MY mistake..and that was actually good business on their part.  I placed yet another order as this product is the only one i have seen that definately works.  I&#x27;m VERY happy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it stays on well, I give it only 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t  used it but a couple of times</li>
            <li> The demo looks very simple but in reality the tapes do not stick to the skin and fall constantly. I only received the black ones impossible to use for my blond hair.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product it was very confusing to figure out how to use it.  I am still not sure that I have it completely figured out.  However, I have been able to figure out a way to use them for my chin and neck.  They are not the most comfortable, again, not sure if it is because I havent completly figured it out yet, but they do seem to last a long time and make a difference in the appearance of sagging neck and jowels.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I use it for a special occasion when I&#x27;m going out and want to look great. It does lift the cheeks and I was able to hide the tabs with my hair.  They also stay until I take them off! this</li>
            <li> It does the job. It just takes a while. But with time I&#x27;ll get use to it. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my mom! She can now look younger for her birthday party and feel better about herself.</li>
            <li> I love my secretlift! It takes time to figure out how to best use it but once you have it give one more confidence to go out in the world. I have been purchasing this product since 2006.</li>
            <li> Don &#x27;t let the unimpressive packaging fool you.  It works extremely well and easy to use.  I am nearly 50 with thick shoulder length hair so the bands don&#x27;t show.  I have even walked the dog out in the wind without any detection.  To feel more confident you could add a few bobby pins with hair spray to ensure all is hidden. Bottom line, it took at least 10 years off my face.  It&#x27;s a great tool to feel more competitive at work and attractive for special events or even for daily use.  My husband comments on how beautiful I look and hasn&#x27;t figured it out.  Friends comment on how great I look and asked &amp;#34; when did you get your hair cut?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works really well, however the side adhesive is abit on the big side, It would be perfect if the adhesive was skin colour . Looking forward to trying the Pro Instant Lift once it beomes available again.</li>
            <li> i love these i order them every time i run out&lt;br /&gt;lifts that saggy skin</li>
            <li> You might consider gum or scotch tape and a rubber band before you spend money on this. There&#x27;s no adhesion- it was a joke- maybe it is a joke? Bottom line, doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> TOO COMPLICATED TO USE AND AFRAID IT WILL SNAP AS YOU ARE WEARING IT...AND YOU CAN SEE THE PATCHES ON YOUR FACE AND NECK...NOT AS INVISABLE AS THEY SAY..</li>
            <li> Great product ...ony thing is for this to really work, you CAN see the plastic  adhesive tabs.  I try to hide them as far back as I can, but they really are more effective the closer to the side of your face as you can put them.  If you are going to dinner at night - don&#x27;t worry b/c your hair will cover.  IF you are outside and the wind blows - people will see it.  Works best with medium or long hair so you can pull the hair forward and cover any tell-tale signs.  I pull back the skin &amp;  attach one of these tabs to one side and then I pull back my skin and attach the other one  Be sure you clean area well with ALCOHOL, let it dry thoroughly, THEN apply the adhesive AND hold your hand over it for about 30 seconds.  Else, they one of them may pull away during the course of wearing it.  A GREAT TIP:  after application and it is secure - I will SPRAY the clear tab with Gray Away tinted spray and that will camoflauge the clear adhesive.</li>
            <li> it realy does work, it might take couple of times to get the hang of where to stick the tapes, the best one is the neck one, i have short hair at the back  and the lenght just cover the elastic.. sorry but i am not telling any of my friends they all keep saying how good i look,&lt;br /&gt; I tested how long they would stay in place,  2days then it gets bit sticky...&lt;br /&gt; for night out or day when you want to look good .. excellent&lt;br /&gt;only wish they would last the week ...&lt;br /&gt;Yes i would recommend .. after a couple of times i now know just where to place tapes .. try and you too will look 10yrs younger ...&lt;br /&gt;ps . make sure you wipe where u are going to stick tapes with alcohol. i keep little bottle with my make up. and watch the video .. its does give tips  ...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over a year now and love it.  My neck is no longer saggy looking when I go out.  I have recommended it to my sister and friends and they always thank me for recommending it.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by how well these work, and blend in.  I mainly use the neck lift, but I have been meaning to try the rest of the product.  My hair is thinner, so I&#x27;m not sure it would hide well.  The only problem I have it that I have to be very careful when removing the &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34;, and even then its difficult not to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It seemed like such a great idea, but the adhesive was not strong enough to hold the bands in place. If they were to work on the adhesive I would give it another try but not at this time.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;  Fraz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had work done, including injectable fillers. I use this just for the last bit of volume loss sagging at my mouth. That allows me to wear the elastic under my hair, where it&#x27;s a great deal more comfortable.  But even before my fillers kicked in completely, I wore the elastic at temple level and the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most face aging is due to a loss of fat volume in the face. Keep that in mind when you&#x27;re trying to work out what part of your face should be lifted for the best look. Usually, a good improvement can be obtained if you concentrate your efforts at the cheekbones. (Lifting back towards the temples.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hook the tapes on before removing the adhesive backing. The tapes take a few seconds to really adhere, so hold one it in one place for about 5-10 seconds before stretching the elastic around to the other side of your head.  Depending on where you need the most lift, you will have to part your hair around the back of your head (a horizontal part) to allow space for the elastic.  Practice lifting your cheeks towards your temples first so you can get a good idea of where to place the tapes.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY. I WILL PROBABLY TRY IT FOR ANOTHER MONTH.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT.  I READ OTHERS HAD PROBLEMS.  I BELIEVE THEY AREN&#x27;T CLEANING THEIR SKIN AS DIRECTED.  MY TAPE STAYS UP TO 24 HRS.  IT WOULD ME MORE BUT I REMOVE THEM AFTER THAT AMOUNT OF TIME.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. I&#x27;m a crossdreser and it really comes in handy. Love you instant face</li>
            <li> Good and simple idea, the problem is that it does not fix very well for enought period of time during the day</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my sister&#x27;s friend used it and loved the difference it made. I was very excited to try it. It was not really difficult to place, you have to play a little once or twice to get it positioned the way you like it. The tapes held very well, although there is a woman on YouTube demonstrating how to put them on which was very informative, but she said to wear the barbs(the things that hook on to the tape) on the inside of the tape, the instructions don&#x27;t tell you what side they should be on. Anyway, as I wore them and moved around the barbs irritated the skin behind my ears, but the bad part was when I removed the tape it felt like facial wax ripping off my mustache hairs. Under where the tape had been there were now water filled blisters on both sides, and in one spot the tape ripped the skin off the top of one of them leaving me with an open wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea, on me you could not see anything, and it did lift my neck and make a difference, but it caused blistering even though they are supposed to be hypoallergenic, which I assumed meant like surgical tape. Maybe it was because the barbs were on the inside, but they are not under the tape where the blisters formed. I will try it one more time when these blisters heal with the barbs on the outside and also I will not clean the oil from that area first as I don&#x27;t have oily skin and maybe that will be better.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Too hard to use all off in hot weather too visible I looked ridiculous. Will never order again. Wasted my money</li>
            <li> Does what it purports to do - gives me a temporary face lift so that I look younger. It softens and smoothes out undereye wrinkles and even helps with laughter lines. You have to be careful to rotate skin sites where you place the contact tape otherwise rashes or other skin irritation may develop. You also have to be careful with the elastic band for the face and eye lift - if you make it too taut, you may end up looking unnatural or the band may break. As they tell you in the instructions, it may take practice to get it right but when you do, you will get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I noticed is that the company has excellent customer service; they respond right away to inquiries and once when the elastic band broke, they sent a replacement right away. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Elastic bands some tape and hooks .... really ? I tried to strap this stuff on even watched utube for help, but the tape would come off by the time I had it where I wanted it. Not that I am  trying for alot just a slight lift... after tring for awhile of the tape coming off and trying to hide  the elastic the only thing that went up on me was my blood pressure.  God luck with it maybe you will have better luck then I. If you do let me know how you did it I would love to know and maybe try again. Still the tape is not great.</li>
            <li> I use the neck lift tapes and I greatly recommend the product, is practically invisible, you just have to know how to place it properly; takes some practice but once you master it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I only use it for the neck area.  I was not disappointed at all.  You just have to make sure the area where you are applying the tapes is clean and dry, otherwise the tapes will not stick.  Also, if its a warm day and you perspire, the tapes will tend to slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product as it does lift the neck area well.  As for using the tapes as a full face lift, its not something that I have done.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Love it.  The fastest service! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product deserves a 5 star rating. The negative report must have come from the original lift. I also bought it and did not like at all. The company went back to the drawing board and nailed it. I tried it and OMG...it took seconds as easy as putting on a head band. There are a couple steps I have mastered. Clean off the area of skin where the tape will go with alcohol...let dry ( few seconds) apply the headband and tape. I then use a warm hair dryer while rubbing the tape and it adheres in seconds and lasts all day. Compliments are unbelievable. This product has changed how I feel about myself. I found myself lifting my skin on my face daily as I look in a mirror and always wished I could look that good again. Well now I do it is even better. This is a 5 star product</li>
            <li> Whenever I have a special occasion, I put this on. It REALLY works for me.  I have shoulder length hair, and you have to have hair that is at least past your ears and neck for this.  When I disclose to family or close friends that I am wearing this, they are dumbfounded.  It is fantastic for me.  I use it when I want to look extra nice.  The only problem is that the tapes irritate my neck in the sense that it is red there the next day--I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it two days in a row or I would reposition the tapes.  It is really worth it, though.  If you can&#x27;t afford a face lift or are waiting to have one, this is the answer.</li>
            <li> Always prompt delivery and excellent customer service. The product is great. I really enjoy using these !</li>
            <li> Need to have long hair....does not work with short hair as the tape shows</li>
            <li> Where has this product been the past 20 years.  A great way to hide those wrinkles if you have long hair.  The forehead tape is great too.  I would love to know who makes the tape because it is great on the skin and there are many many uses I can think of for it.  I wish the elastic bands were a little more invisible but you can&#x27;t have everything.  Can hid in your hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quick fix ( ladies fifty plus), use to go to weddings, family reunions, high school, college reunions.  Your friends and family will be amazed at how young you look, and won&#x27;t have a clue (lol).  I also use when I do a honey and collagen facial mask to help lift the skin.  I will purchase again.  To keep the tapes on longer, I used along with spirit gum.</li>
            <li> DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT&#x27;S GOING TO DO!!  TAKES AT LEAST 10 YEARS OFF YOUR FACE.  MY HUSBAND KEEPS SAYING \\&quot;WHAT DID YOU DO, YOU LOOK GREAT,\\&quot;  I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A MONTH AND HE STILL DOESN&#x27;T KNOW.  IF YOU WANT TO LOOK GREAT FOR A NIGHT OUT, WEDDING, CLASS REUNION, THIS WILL DO THE TRICK.</li>
            <li> Замечательный продукт. Полностью меняет внешность. Держится на лице целый день. Не заметен. Замена уколов ботекса и пластической хирургии. Настоятельно рекомендую!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently. The past 2 years have seen jowls come to my face and neck an unmistakable marker of my true age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lived with this, unhappily, while I consider surgery which for a variety of reasons, I really want to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, several tines a year I an in the public eye, as part of a musical group that tours nationally each year, and internationally every few years. There are photographs, interviews, meeting a lot of people I&#x27;d like to look my best for. I just couldn&#x27;t bear to accept looking so much older than I had in previous years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried the Face, Neck and Eye Lift, the Secret Pro Neck and Jaw Lift, and the Instant Face Neck and Eye Lift products. (hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;). I took a few weeks to experiment, and learn how to use them undetectably. The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place. I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different. I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts! Fortified, I &amp;#34;went public&amp;#34; (very public!) for last summer&#x27;s events and shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were an unmitigated success. To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good. And no one ever suspected I was using the Lifts. Wow! These are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward to the present day. In anticipation of another short tour this month, I ordered my stock of Lifts. THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!),  Wothout those Lifts, I truly felt I might as well just turn around and go home, so great was my dependence on the significant appearance-booster of the Lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, late on the night of my arrival (and finding upon unpacking that I had forgotten the Lifts), I ordered another batch of Lifts for delivery to my hotel,  and sent a rather desperate email to CosmeSearch (the company who sells all the products), begging them to somehow speed my delivery (deliveries for my past order always came promptly and within the promised &amp;#34;Standard Mail&amp;#34; timeframes, but I knew the far bounds of that time frame would not be soon enough this time). I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the miracle part: A CosmeSearch representative emailed me a reply within hours...and this was late at night on the west coast! They said the would &amp;#34;upgrade your order to expedited shipping tomorrow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt; I offered to pay. They declined and said &amp;#34;free of charge&amp;#34;. I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance? I know the answer. In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  there&#x27;s a person at the other end of your email who promptly reads and responds to our request or comment. I also think you will like the products too...as long as you experiment and test them before making your public debut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m blown away. I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, even greater customer service. What do you expect? 5 Stars. Wish I could give 6!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Don&#x27;t forget to use the alcohol swab, and let it dry, at the application sites. This ensures all-day adhesionGreat product, even greater customer service. What do you expect? 5 Stars. Wish I could give 6!  PS: Don&#x27;t forget to use the alcohol swab, and let it dry, at the application sites. This ensures all-day adhesion</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, Just Wonderful. it truly is a miracle face &amp; neck lift. I will recommend it to everyone I know that is interested im somethings as instant quick a painless</li>
            <li> It is impossible to hide the tapes and the «glue» that is used on the tapes damages the skin. It is impossible to use the tapes 2 days in a row since I have to let my skin heal for a few days.</li>
            <li> The product is very hard to use.  Am unhappy with it but am still trying to use the product now</li>
            <li> I never got it to work, probably my own problem but it seems very difficult to do.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost daily for 2 months and I highly recommend it! I am a person who spends a lot of time in front of a camera and it works wonders for the sag and crepe under the chin. It took a little time to learn the technique but now it&#x27;s easy as applying a band-aid (although I goof once in a while). Lasts at least 8 hours and i carry extra tapes just in case.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use this product because I could not understand the directions.  Would like to return it for a full refund!</li>
            <li> My review has nothing to do with the service I received from this seller.  Even though a great price-really not what you need.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to use. the bands are not long enough causing the stickers to come off. the stickers are very noticeable no matter how you try to cover them. a 0*</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t remember the product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I have used this for over a year.  The results are exactly as promised.  No one knows I use the lifts.  The comments are &amp;#34;You look fantastic what are you using, &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t  know you had work done&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m constantly told I look 10 years younger than my age.  They take a little practice in the beginning, however, I can now apply within minutes.  For women who do not have the time or money for plastic surgery Instant Face Lift is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> You absolutely cannot use this with short hair.  Nuff said !! This is going into my I&#x27;m sorry I bought this drawer.</li>
            <li> While there are definately some results with this tape, I can&#x27;t see wearing it all day long as it is very uncomfortable. I wore the neck band around the house for an hour or so and the taped popped off. God forbid I had worn it out and someone saw it! I think this is great for a quick photo for friends who haven&#x27;t seen you in a while.  Also, it is hard to hide the tape around the ears, but again, for a quick, deceitful photo, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Breaks easy. Perfect for light wear. Blends great in hair.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and in good condition.  It took a couple of times to get used to the system.  I use alcohol pads before attaching the tape. At times I have had tape on for 3 days. Great idea! Great product!  (Update 2/10/15). I keep ordering the tapes.  I use 2 tapes everyday. I found that to get rid of my turkey neck, I put the tapes on my neck just below my earlobe.  I then connect the bands up over my head.  It works great!  I don&#x27;t have a turkey neck anymore when I wear the tapes.  You can&#x27;t see the tape because it is behind my ears.  The same place a plastic surgeon puts the scars of a face lift.  I view a face lift as an inside lift, while the tape system is an outside lift at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I am totally thrilled with this product.  I used it for the first time yesterday &amp; can&#x27;t believe the results. I used it on my neck in place of getting surgery. The results blew my husband &amp; myself away.</li>
            <li> As I age I find that I am not comfortable with some of the changes in how I look. By that I mean saggy neck and droopy eyes. So I set out on a mission to remedy my situation in the least intrusive way. I happened across \\&quot;Instant Face and Neck Lift Tapes\\&quot;. What a godsend. I gave them a try and they work. They took ten years off my face. I had only intended to use them for special occasions but I use them daily. I like the way I look when I am wearing them. And because I look rested and energenic I don&#x27;t mind sharing my age! Who says that Sexy has to be 25, I&#x27;m 65 and holding.</li>
            <li> These work great!  They definitely pull fine lines from my chin and neck lines.  No surgery or other face lift creams needed!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004BVYT2Y Instant Face and Neck Lift Tapes]]&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! I&#x27;ve only used the neck lift, as that&#x27;s my problem area.  The tapes are really easy to apply, stay in place, and no one is the wiser unless you want to let them in on your little secret.  Using them has boosted my self image and turned the clock back. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of curiosity, mostly because it seemed too good to be true. I was truly and placently surprised to see that it works exactly how it says.  I only have a bit of sagginess  in my jaw line,  a bit of a jowl, so I use this tape and !voila! It disappeared like magic.  It made me  looked 10 years younger.  Now I use it also to lift my eyebrows a bit. I just stick the lower part of the tape and pull it up a little, then press the rest of the tape, it doesn&#x27;t even need a strap. I love, love, love this product, I never want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;I even saw a picture in the internet where a couple of celebrities were using them. I won&#x27;t revel their names though. I highly recommend it if you want to look amazing without having to go under the knive.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product and I have continued buying that through this site.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst thing I have ever bought in my lift.  This is pretty much tape with a hair elastic cut in half.  It is maybe worth $0.20, cause that is what you are going to get.  You can literally see tape stuck to your cheek or chin.  It is actually a peice of tape that this product directs you to place on your face.  Embarrassing.  I wish the picture wasn&#x27;t so misleading, otherwise I would never have ordered it.  Do yourself a favour and buy some scotch tape and tape up the sides of your cheeks.  Then try and brush your hair over the taped area.  That&#x27;s all that this is...</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WAS TERRIBLE!!! THE TAPES WERE ABOUT AS STRONG AND, STICKY, AS SCOTCH TAPE.....THE BANDS WERE AS THIN AS A STRAND OF HAIR.......TERRIBLE!!!!! BUTTTT, I GIVE THE CO. 5 STARS FOR EXCELENT CUSTOMER SERVICE...THEY GAVE IMMIEDIATE RESPONCE, AND REFUND.</li>
            <li> I use these for my makeup clients.. this is the best company with amazing CS!! and the best product of this type</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is great for the special occasions when you want to look your best.  It really is a mini face lift and the strings are not noticeable. Sometimes i just use it to tighten my neck area... and that is actually good enough to make me feel better about myself.  It is easy to use. My hair is longer now and all one length...so I need to cut more layers in my hair to start using the face lift application where it goes on top of your head... otherwise, the black strings will show through my blonde hair. So for now, I am just using the neck lift where the strings go behind your neck.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This company sent me the wrong color bands with my package.  I am a blonde,  after 2 emails  they satisfied my request and replaced the bands with blonde ones.</li>
            <li> The tape did not stick on . Waste of money. This  tape does not work . Save your money . To lazy to send back .</li>
            <li> Love the product and have purchased from CosmeSearch numerous times. Their shipping time is extremely fast and I appreciate that factor. The few times I contacted CosmeSearch, their Customer Service was impeccable. I highly recommend CosmeSearch and their products.</li>
            <li> Worked great except the tapes don&#x27;t stay as they should!</li>
            <li> This product works great! The adhesive tapes are strong and hold all day. I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping with them on, but I bet they would hold through the night as well. I have thin hair and thought the adjustable elastic bands might show through my hair, but they don&#x27;t. It does hurt to remove the tapes when you&#x27;re done, but surgery would hurt more. I used to work for a plastic surgeon. This product works great without the pain, risk,or cost of surgery. What fun!</li>
