            <li> very good iting thanks</li>
            <li> This item that I paid for never got to me. On several occasions I wrote to you to tell you that you have the incorrect address for me. But I never got a response from you. Instead it was sent to my son&#x27;s address which is a prison address. I called to see if they received it and they said inmates can NOT receive any type of lotions. So they detroyed it. I will never buy anything from you again. I lost money for this item and postage. Claudia</li>
