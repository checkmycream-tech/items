    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent hold and no flaking!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best edge smoother to give you a sleek look.</li>
            <li>And the smell is delightful.</li>
            <li>For my relaxed edges, I experienced some breakage.  </li>
            <li>The product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product gives the promise of being a good substitute.  </li>
            <li>B003E84PQU Namaste Laboratories, LLC Edge Control Hair Gel, Olive Oil, 2.25 oz.]] is really good and is a quarter of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Holds so well, is clear and smells great!</li>
            <li>This is a great product that does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>Much better and smoother hold with the Edge Control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite edge control because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>b/c my girlfriend treated me to it :) boy am I lucky.</li>
            <li>After applying it, I noticed it did smooth my edges</li>
            <li>and it has provided me with the most amazing result, smells so pleasant, and holds down my NAPS!!!</li>
            <li>but if u have kinky hair like me, Dont Buy this, i highly recommended Olive Oil Edge Control, its way cheaper and it works way better in my opinion</li>
            <li>When I placed it on my edges they laid down and looked very nice for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>If your hair is more fine and less kinky</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my many beauty fav&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It also works better with wet hair pulled in a puff or updo.</li>
            <li>It was great a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t hold down the curly grey hairs we older ladies sometimes get.  </li>
            <li>When i put it on my edges, they curl right back up.</li>
            <li>During my never ending search for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; edge control for my 4C natural hair texture, I came across this.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;smooth natural.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer Olive Oil Edge Control, and it&#x27;s such a bargain for under $5.00, depending on where you purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I ended up having to go for the old school AMPRO gel and a toothbrush.</li>

            <li> I ended up having to go for the old school AMPRO gel and a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, and it does not make the hair hard either.</li>
            <li> Why to much money for such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it does not hold the hair all day long.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product directly from Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s store and was sold on the fact that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second batch but it&#x27;ll be my last until sephora or carolsdaughter.com has a bogo sale or half price</li>
            <li> it smoothes it down without having the heaviness or flakiness of regular gel.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for her hair (unprocessed).  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product and it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> After slicking and slicking it down I have given up and wil be passing on to one of my friends that has a softer grade.  </li>
            <li> It smoothes edges down.  </li>
            <li> A relative had this product and loved it when I tried it, ordered 4 for myself and when I received it was not a gel almost a complete liquid, could have been from a bad batch, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount on my hair when wet</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> i have very thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> I do not want the product to go to waste</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavey hair that is also dry, so I ask a lot from a pomade.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not like this product, my hair is very thick and kinky.</li>
            <li> &gt; but its very expensive.</li>

            <li> Leaves a white residue by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold and no flaking!</li>
            <li> A relative had this product and loved it when I tried it, ordered 4 for myself and when I received it was not a gel almost a complete liquid, could have been from a bad batch, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this edge control b/c I was looking for the one that works. I saw lots of youtube raves about it. This product is ok. I would not buy it again. When I placed it on my edges they laid down and looked very nice for an hour or so. It also left a white residue. I do not want the product to go to waste so I use it in days that I plan to wash my hair. It also works better with wet hair pulled in a puff or updo. I would not recommend this product and it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to replace Kizzi&#x27;s &amp;#34;Stay-Put&amp;#34; hair pomade, but it seems to be discontinued.  This product gives the promise of being a good substitute.  If it turns out to be, I will come back and give it 5 stars.  I have thin, wavey hair that is also dry, so I ask a lot from a pomade.</li>
            <li> During my never ending search for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; edge control for my 4C natural hair texture, I came across this. I must say it did not work for me. After applying it, I noticed it did smooth my edges but it only last about 10mins max. then it also turned my hair white. The only reason for not throwing it out is because I want to give it away. Heck it was $22. Why to much money for such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does exactly what it says.  I use a small amount on my hair when wet and it dries into a&lt;br /&gt;smooth natural.  At the end of the day there&#x27;s no sticky residue from it left in my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it works. The only problem is it does not hold the hair all day long.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t hold down the curly grey hairs we older ladies sometimes get.  I much prefer Olive Oil Edge Control, and it&#x27;s such a bargain for under $5.00, depending on where you purchase it.  Much better and smoother hold with the Edge Control.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery of product was as promised.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product directly from Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s store and was sold on the fact that a little goes a long way.  Well it doesn&#x27;t if you have my grade of coarse nappy hair.  After slicking and slicking it down I have given up and wil be passing on to one of my friends that has a softer grade.  I ended up having to go for the old school AMPRO gel and a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was great a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I always buy Carol&#x27;s Daughter product...tried this product twice before, no residue, no stickiness, no build-up. It&#x27;s the best edge smoother to give you a sleek look. Definitely one of my many beauty fav&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my edges were out of control while I was transitioning. The product is amazing! it smoothes it down without having the heaviness or flakiness of regular gel. And the smell is delightful. just add a dab of water to your hair/edges, slap it on and brush it down.&lt;br /&gt; but its very expensive. and i went through it within 5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second batch but it&#x27;ll be my last until sephora or carolsdaughter.com has a bogo sale or half price sell around the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;if anyone is looking for an alternative,  [[ASIN:B003E84PQU Namaste Laboratories, LLC Edge Control Hair Gel, Olive Oil, 2.25 oz.]] is really good and is a quarter of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I believe Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Style Edge Hold also works as well.</li>
            <li> Fix your price on this item amazon it looks rediculous . I hope its a computer error because the price looks out of this world!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, and it does not make the hair hard either. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not like this product, my hair is very thick and kinky. When i put it on my edges, they curl right back up. If your hair is more fine and less kinky it will probably work for you but if u have kinky hair like me, Dont Buy this, i highly recommended Olive Oil Edge Control, its way cheaper and it works way better in my opinion</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair today from my girlfriend! it is a miracle. i have very thick coarse hair and it has provided me with the most amazing result, smells so pleasant, and holds down my NAPS!!! ( Indian hair) just kidding. I havent brought it yet b/c my girlfriend treated me to it :) boy am I lucky. A must buy you will not be disapointed .</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do.  It smoothes edges down.  I love this product.  I plan to purchase again and as a gift for someone else.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Holds so well, is clear and smells great! Just wish I could find it locally - in the Modesto, CA area. Ulta used to carry it but no longer does.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for her hair (unprocessed).  For my relaxed edges, I experienced some breakage.  Do a sample test at nape before using.</li>
            <li> My favorite edge control because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
