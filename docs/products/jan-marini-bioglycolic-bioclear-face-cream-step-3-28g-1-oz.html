            <li>Best to us</li>
            <li>Its great for resurfacing &amp; keeping the acne away!  </li>
            <li>Jan Marini is a great product to begin with.</li>
            <li>I felt it did a great job.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and sunscreen are great, but I can put off buying them if its just not in the budget.</li>
            <li>I should also note that as great as this product is, I&#x27;ve periodically had to incorporate additional moisturizers depending on weather conditions, humidity, etc.</li>
            <li>Great service</li>
            <li>Great for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Apply this miracle face cream and see the great results in two (2) days.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice lotion that feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>The price is right and results are excellent.  </li>
            <li>After ready all the reviews i thought this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I have not had any breakouts, the cream is very easy to apply and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>I heard about this product and found it very cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This cream makes my face clearer and looks refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I have not written too many reviews in my life..</li>
            <li>but this one deserves some love.</li>
            <li>I was looking at making my skin brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and more even toned.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the softness and the smoothness of my face.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Janmarini!!!!</li>
            <li>Cream is great for winter time &amp; the lotion is great for summer, but I use cream all year round</li>
            <li>Super effective.. make your skin smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>After a week I could tell it had helped, but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>this product with the full line of Jan Marini cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is worth ever penny.</li>
            <li>At the time I would&#x27;ve bought magic beans if someone had promised they&#x27;d clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>And sure enough the product I received was just like buying from Jan Marini except cheaper and faster shipping!</li>
            <li>I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>however, this product has pretty much taken care of the acne.</li>
            <li>More is not better, it is an Bioglycolic acid which can create more redness to sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy</li>
            <li>Nothing really ever worked.</li>
            <li>I really can feel it working.  </li>
            <li>and it was delivered fast.  </li>
            <li>During that time I&#x27;ve only had 1 major breakout and it happened to be when I ran out of this product and hadn&#x27;t bothered to order more.</li>
            <li>However, this is the main product that I prefer to never be without.</li>
            <li>This product is the first time I have seen anything actually helping out, so even though it&#x27;s not the huge results others have posted about it&#x27;s definitely helping out my skin.</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new night cream.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my esthetician to help with adult acne and oily skin, and this stuff works!  </li>
            <li>I have had issues for years with adult acne.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft after using it and clear again.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old</li>
            <li>I plan on switching over completely to Jan Marini as I run out of my current skin care products.</li>
            <li>Once I hit adulthood I had run the gamut of different facial products, trying everything from Neutrogena to Noxema, Proactive and Cellex-C, and even went so far as to get a prescription for accutane.</li>
            <li>I have oily non sensitive skin with some breakouts, this does help with the breakouts but not completely.</li>
            <li>I find this product to not be greasy, has no smell and works well with my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product from other vendors several times and I think the cream must have been switched out for something else or the product is very old.</li>

            <li> It is so frustrating to be dealing with lines and acne...</li>

            <li> I just had to reorder this from another vendor because I won&#x27;t put this on which is like Pond&#x27;s cold cream.</li>

            <li> After ready all the reviews i thought this would be perfect. I have oily non sensitive skin with some breakouts, this does help with the breakouts but not completely. It is very greasy so use a little at a time and at night. Does cause redness, be very careful not to put under or above eye area and neck - causes dryness and itching.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face clearer and looks refreshing.  Helps out when I break out with acne.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best to us this product with the full line of Jan Marini cleanser and moisturizer. It is worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> Jan Marini is a great product to begin with. I usually purchase this face cream through Jan Marini, but I know how pricy they are so I figuredI would give Amazon a go. And sure enough the product I received was just like buying from Jan Marini except cheaper and faster shipping! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Made my skin peel.After 3 days use my skin was peeling off!! Sorry to not have better comments but that&#x27;s how it was.</li>
            <li> I have had issues for years with adult acne. Nothing really ever worked. I heard about this product and found it very cheap on Amazon. I started using it only at night and carefully inspected my skin to see if it looked dry. After a week I could tell it had helped, but not as much as I would have liked. So I began using it 2x a day. I still broke out a bit due to hormonal changes. However, the rest of the month I felt it did a great job. I&#x27;m currently only using this product, but have purchased some of the others. I plan on switching over completely to Jan Marini as I run out of my current skin care products. I figure using the set will only improve results. This product is the first time I have seen anything actually helping out, so even though it&#x27;s not the huge results others have posted about it&#x27;s definitely helping out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have not written too many reviews in my life..but this one deserves some love. I am in my late thirties and break out near my cycle. It is so frustrating to be dealing with lines and acne...however, this product has pretty much taken care of the acne. My skin feels really soft after using it and clear again. Thanks Janmarini!!!! I use the face wash as well.</li>
            <li> I really can feel it working.  It is clearing up my spots and clearing up the pimples if I get them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from other vendors several times and I think the cream must have been switched out for something else or the product is very old. I just had to reorder this from another vendor because I won&#x27;t put this on which is like Pond&#x27;s cold cream.</li>
            <li> I find this product to not be greasy, has no smell and works well with my very dry, sensitive skin. After cleansing my skin and applying Janet Marini C-Esta Serum, I use this cream to ward off any potential acne. It absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident, while reading another review on glycolic peels someone had recommended this.  I am in my mid 30&#x27;s, and deal with hormonal breakouts during that time of the month and some sun spots and discoloration.  I was looking at making my skin brighter and more even.  I have been using this product for a week now, just at night and I can see a huge difference.  I have not had any breakouts, the cream is very easy to apply and absorbs well.  My skin is brighter and more even toned.  I am so pleased.  The price is right and results are excellent.  I think I have found my new night cream.</li>
            <li> If you want a younger looking face .. then don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Face Cream. Super effective.. make your skin smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and have suffered with problem skin since puberty. I&#x27;ve had acne that started on my forehead and eventually migrated to my cheeks and finally to my chin. Once I hit adulthood I had run the gamut of different facial products, trying everything from Neutrogena to Noxema, Proactive and Cellex-C, and even went so far as to get a prescription for accutane. I don&#x27;t suffer from constant acne (at least, not since high school), but have had to deal with periodic breakouts that seem to come out of nowhere and then take at least 2 months to heal. After suffering through 1 such horrific breakout I started throwing money at estheticians (even though I couldn&#x27;t afford it) to help me fix my skin and one of them recommended this product. At the time I would&#x27;ve bought magic beans if someone had promised they&#x27;d clear up my skin. I took a chance on it and have been using it consistently for the past 4 years. During that time I&#x27;ve only had 1 major breakout and it happened to be when I ran out of this product and hadn&#x27;t bothered to order more. I also decided to try the facial cleanser and antioxidant sunscreen, all of which I now use daily. However, this is the main product that I prefer to never be without. The cleanser and sunscreen are great, but I can put off buying them if its just not in the budget. I should also note that as great as this product is, I&#x27;ve periodically had to incorporate additional moisturizers depending on weather conditions, humidity, etc.</li>
            <li> I have always battled with problem skin , discoloration and acne . This product has helped with both without breaking my pocket book .</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my esthetician to help with adult acne and oily skin, and this stuff works!  Great service and it was delivered fast.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice any differences but it&#x27;s a nice lotion that feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician turned me onto this product about two years ago.  I can attest that it works extremely well.  There&#x27;s a bit of a sting to it, but my skin becomes radiant after use.</li>
            <li> Its great for resurfacing &amp; keeping the acne away!  Great for oily skin.  Cream is great for winter time &amp; the lotion is great for summer, but I use cream all year round</li>
            <li> This product works well on my skin and keeps acne away (going through change of life).  I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 8 months.  I love the softness and the smoothness of my face.  I am 55 years old and I was looking it.  I have been using this and other products from Jan Marini and I have less wrinkles and look younger.  This is what they used when I went in for a facial.</li>
            <li> After washing your face in the evening. Apply this miracle face cream and see the great results in two (2) days. No more blemishes, jaw line breakouts! Goes along way. More is not better, it is an Bioglycolic acid which can create more redness to sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
