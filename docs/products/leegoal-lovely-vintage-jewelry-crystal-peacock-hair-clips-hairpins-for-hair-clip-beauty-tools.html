            <li>/&gt; GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>they are most beautiful.  </li>
            <li>and I am very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li>This is very beautiful the whole clasp is made with metal (plus)</li>
            <li>Kind of clunky.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful clip and you can tell it&#x27;s really well made.  </li>
            <li>and I have had many, many compliments on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely stunning.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair clip.</li>
            <li>A lovely peacock covered with discreet crystals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the design and the look of it.</li>
            <li>Great looks antique y classy.</li>
            <li>I like being able to pin it up off my neck when it&#x27;s so hot, and this clips lets me do it and still look like I&#x27;ve done something nice with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I cannot use in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the &#x27;WOW&#x27; that some clips are, but that&#x27;s sometimes a good thing.</li>
            <li>thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented.</li>
            <li>This shipped reasonably quickly and is a sturdy piece.  </li>
            <li>This is very pretty</li>
            <li>Feels better than many of the everyday clips that most of us reach for, and livens things up a bit, but also lets you and the rest of an outfit take center stage when you want your hair to look good, but not be the focus.</li>
            <li>so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and big enough to hold up a bun or ponytail.</li>
            <li>also own the brown, purple and green similar clips and am delighted with them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks pretty in hair.</li>
            <li>Now it sits on my dresser, looking pretty.</li>
            <li>They are pretty with a style somewhere between Victorian and Art Nuevo</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>very sturdy and no issues with the gems falling out after almost a year of owning and using.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for yourself, or as a fantastic present at an extremely reasonable price, for any occasion.</li>
            <li>and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait</li>
            <li>I love to put my hair in a low bun and then have this clip just above the bun.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted.</li>
            <li>i bought a few more</li>
            <li>Due to their size and weight of these clips, you will need to strongly secure these with hair spray if they are in this sort of hairstyle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very classy.</li>
            <li>A versatile &#x27;go to&#x27; hair clip that is suitable to wear for nearly everything including special occasions, work, casual weekends, even beach days.</li>
            <li>The fact that it was an overseas seller wasn&#x27;t a problem - the item arrived early before the stated timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds hair well and is a bit more subtle than some similar pieces.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, but also very heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is only one thing you need to be aware of with this clip, and that is because it is made of metal it is fairly heavy.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s larger and possibly a little less &#x27;elegant&#x27; than I am usually looking for, but it&#x27;s sturdy and makes me feel like a princess.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this looks so pretty when I wear my hair up -,I</li>
            <li> I just received the product and waited so long for it.</li>
            <li> WITH LONG HAIR&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought two of these with the intention of using them in a loose up-do.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would just make a bun &amp; put this above the bun, but it weighs a lot, and it pulls the hair down with its weight.</li>
            <li> i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been surprised by the negative review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not go unnoticed, but draws quiet attention.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was carefully packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for small and subtle, this is probably not going to be your first choice.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would hold up in a chlorinated pool, but works well both as a hair accent and to actually hold hair off from the neck.</li>
            <li> Adds a pop of color to my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> AND AGAIN A LITTLE HEAVY</li>
            <li> vintage looking, sturdy, heavy.</li>
            <li> I realized then they knowingly mailed one with missing stones otherwise the stones would be floating around the package if it were a mistake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super-sturdy, grips well, but heavy.  </li>
            <li> have had a few compliments when wearing it</li>
            <li> Instead, put your hair up how you want it (e.g. with plain discreet hairgrips or hair elastics) and THEN put this clip on wherever you want it for decoration.  </li>
            <li> have mid length very thin hair, and it holds it beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> PRETTY MUCH USELESS!!</li>
            <li> Granted it did come from overseas but was highly disappointed with the quality and especially that it was missing stones.</li>
            <li> I thought I would find the missing stones in the sealed package but was wrong.</li>
            <li> It is badly aligned, so the 2 sides never really close, and the metal barbs intended to hold the hair inside the clip are also misaligned, so the hair immediately slips through.</li>
            <li> Clip isn&#x27;t aligned to hold hair, clip looks like it was twisted.</li>
            <li> This is sadly, an unusable hair piece.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> My daughter loved this!</li>
            <li> I have ordered every one of these and they are all beautiful.  I&#x27;ve also ordered a set for my sister and am now looking for a perfect box to hold them all.  they are most beautiful.  thank you.</li>
            <li> This shipped reasonably quickly and is a sturdy piece.  It holds hair well and is a bit more subtle than some similar pieces.  It does not go unnoticed, but draws quiet attention.  A versatile &#x27;go to&#x27; hair clip that is suitable to wear for nearly everything including special occasions, work, casual weekends, even beach days. Not sure how it would hold up in a chlorinated pool, but works well both as a hair accent and to actually hold hair off from the neck. It&#x27;s not the &#x27;WOW&#x27; that some clips are, but that&#x27;s sometimes a good thing. Feels better than many of the everyday clips that most of us reach for, and livens things up a bit, but also lets you and the rest of an outfit take center stage when you want your hair to look good, but not be the focus.</li>
            <li> Clip isn&#x27;t aligned to hold hair, clip looks like it was twisted. PRETTY MUCH USELESS!! I can&#x27;t even use this</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and I have had many, many compliments on it and I am very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful clip and you can tell it&#x27;s really well made.  The fact that it was an overseas seller wasn&#x27;t a problem - the item arrived early before the stated timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one thing you need to be aware of with this clip, and that is because it is made of metal it is fairly heavy.  It&#x27;s super-sturdy, grips well, but heavy.  For this reason, I would suggest using it in a decorative sense on your hair, but don&#x27;t make this clip be the only thing that is holding your hair in the style, otherwise the clip will pull/drag on your hair.  Instead, put your hair up how you want it (e.g. with plain discreet hairgrips or hair elastics) and THEN put this clip on wherever you want it for decoration.  It&#x27;s absolutely stunning.  I love to put my hair in a low bun and then have this clip just above the bun.  It&#x27;s very classy.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve let my hair grow out, it drives me nuts sometimes.  I like being able to pin it up off my neck when it&#x27;s so hot, and this clips lets me do it and still look like I&#x27;ve done something nice with my hair.  Would I order it again?  Absolutely.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this item.  I purchased it for my niece and she loved it. I am very satisfied with the purchase also the price was great.</li>
            <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger and possibly a little less &#x27;elegant&#x27; than I am usually looking for, but it&#x27;s sturdy and makes me feel like a princess. Wonderful price and arrived in good time fully intact.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this looks so pretty when I wear my hair up -,I have had a few compliments when wearing it</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip. Adds a pop of color to my dark brown hair. very sturdy and no issues with the gems falling out after almost a year of owning and using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been surprised by the negative review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip: A lovely peacock covered with discreet crystals.&lt;br /&gt;In mine no stone was missing.&lt;br /&gt;I have mid length very thin hair, and it holds it beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t try it in a swimming pool considering the crystals are probably glued.&lt;br /&gt;The clip can be used with a blue jean or dressed up.&lt;br /&gt;It is a sturdy construction and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I also own the brown, purple and green similar clips and am delighted with them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service: I received the clip 16 days in advance, and had to sign for it.&lt;br /&gt;This might explain why it is $2 more expensive than all the others I bought ($3 each)&lt;br /&gt;It was carefully packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I offered the orange-red one to a friend, she was very happy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for yourself, or as a fantastic present at an extremely reasonable price, for any occasion.</li>
            <li> cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use myself but give as gift to people who helps me on vacation.</li>
            <li> I love the design and the look of it. I wore it in my hair on a trip to the hospital. I recieved numerous compliments.</li>
            <li> This is sadly, an unusable hair piece. It is badly aligned, so the 2 sides never really close, and the metal barbs intended to hold the hair inside the clip are also misaligned, so the hair immediately slips through. I thought I would just make a bun &amp; put this above the bun, but it weighs a lot, and it pulls the hair down with its weight. Very uncomfortable. Now it sits on my dresser, looking pretty.</li>
            <li> This is very beautiful the whole clasp is made with metal (plus) but, I thought it would be a lot smaller. Kind of clunky.</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR CLIP IS VERY NICE AND AGAIN A LITTLE HEAVY BUT IT WORKS WELL WITH LONG HAIR&lt;br /&gt; GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> If you are looking for small and subtle, this is probably not going to be your first choice. I bought two of these with the intention of using them in a loose up-do.  Due to their size and weight of these clips, you will need to strongly secure these with hair spray if they are in this sort of hairstyle. They are pretty with a style somewhere between Victorian and Art Nuevo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, but also very heavy. I cannot use in my fine hair.</li>
