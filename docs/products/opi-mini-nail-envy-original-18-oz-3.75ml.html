    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>It provides the greatest protection for my nails which have a tendency to split and peel.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful experience.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best nail strengtheners I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that a mini is offered in Nail Envy.</li>
            <li>Still great product in any size.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the product and this size is great for my purse or travel bag.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>love this product and the price</li>
            <li>I have been using the stuff for a month and LOVE how it reinforces my nails.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to quit nail biting and this is helping me to stop after many years.  </li>
            <li>The formula dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Same great product that it has always been.</li>
            <li>Small size and is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, truly the only way I am able to grow nails</li>
            <li>i really thought OPI would somehow make them stronger from the inside out, you have to apply this as two bottom coats, your nail polish then once a day for a week apply this as the top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that makes my nails strong!!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad I bought the travel size to try it first, now that i really like it</li>
            <li>&amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I got it right away</li>
            <li>as usual great product.</li>
            <li>my nails are somehow a bit more strong and less chippy than they were before.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying the product</li>
            <li>Really strengthens nails!</li>
            <li>I bought this so I could try out the little bottle&#x27;s brush, which I love!  </li>
            <li>notice that my nails didn&#x27;t break that easy and it helps to prevent yellow nails.</li>
            <li>The Dry and Brittle formula works much better for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a while and really can&#x27;t tell that it has made a difference.</li>
            <li>I have another bottle of Nail Envy, and it is much whiter.  </li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s a good one, I get very few chips) under my normal colors and change my polish about twice a week /</li>
            <li>It keeps my nails long and strong.</li>
            <li>This made them grown strong and long!</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this product but it dried out my nails even more.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very small (note the size carefully) but is an inexpensive way to buy a great product.</li>
            <li>Have used for ~3 weeks, so far, seems to be making my nails stronger, so they&#x27;re growing longer.</li>
            <li>/felt that I had harder nails after about the first week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>tiny bottle but just enough to really try it</li>
            <li>However, the product was yellow, which I suspect was because it was old.  </li>
            <li>An advantage of the smaller size is that I have found that the full size bottle will thicken before I use it all, resulting in waste.</li>

            <li> /felt that I had harder nails after about the first week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> tiny bottle but just enough to really try it</li>

            <li> An advantage of the smaller size is that I have found that the full size bottle will thicken before I use it all, resulting in waste.</li>
            <li> but of course you can wear it clear and/or add a layer every other day for a week as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle was much smaller that i expected and much smaller than it looks in the picture</li>
            <li> (mine are naturally thin and brittle and this makes them thick and strong).</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have had trouble finding it in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I paint two coats and then every other day paint another coat...</li>
            <li> My nails still peel (iron deficiency problem) but they dont crack and tear to the skin like previously.</li>
            <li> A little smelly</li>
            <li> Them are less weak now.</li>
            <li> so this got really tiresome, but the product did make my nails harder when i wore it.</li>
            <li> This is a very small piece.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use it as my base coat, maybe rotating it with my previous Orly Bonder because my nails feel stronger now and have grown out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, it was meant to be five!!</li>
            <li> use it as a base coat</li>

            <li> I bought this tiny size to try it out, and I honesty think this stuff is making a difference on my nails. Them are less weak now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  A little smelly</li>
            <li> tiny bottle but just enough to really try it out.&lt;br /&gt;i felt like it did make my nails stronger but only when i had the polish on. i really thought OPI would somehow make them stronger from the inside out, you have to apply this as two bottom coats, your nail polish then once a day for a week apply this as the top coat. then at the end of the week, take it all off and start again.&lt;br /&gt;i like to change my nail polish alot so this got really tiresome, but the product did make my nails harder when i wore it.</li>
            <li> This is a very small piece. But you can never expect anything too big at this price. Think twice before you buy this.</li>
            <li> The bottle was much smaller that i expected and much smaller than it looks in the picture but i do think it works. my nails are somehow a bit more strong and less chippy than they were before.</li>
            <li> love this product and the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that a mini is offered in Nail Envy. This was my first time buying the product and I&#x27;ve got to say it has improved my nail strength. I saw/felt that I had harder nails after about the first week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a base coat (and it&#x27;s a good one, I get very few chips) under my normal colors and change my polish about twice a week / every 5 days, but of course you can wear it clear and/or add a layer every other day for a week as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and I will continue to use it as my base coat, maybe rotating it with my previous Orly Bonder because my nails feel stronger now and have grown out so maybe I don&#x27;t need to have the Envy on every week.</li>
            <li> I have used OPI Nail Envy for several years.  It provides the greatest protection for my nails which have a tendency to split and peel.  I ordered this because I have had trouble finding it in local stores.  Wish the bottle was bigger.  Still great product in any size.</li>
            <li> Order this it&#x27;s great‼️</li>
            <li> Wonderful experience. I got it right away &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best nail strengtheners I&#x27;ve found. The bottle is very small (note the size carefully) but is an inexpensive way to buy a great product. An advantage of the smaller size is that I have found that the full size bottle will thicken before I use it all, resulting in waste. With the smaller size, that problem is eliminated.</li>
            <li> My nails are week and the upper layers peel.  Ugh. BUT OPI nail envy to the rescue.  I wish I had purchased a bigger bottle.  I paint two coats and then every other day paint another coat...then I start over.  I have been using the stuff for a month and LOVE how it reinforces my nails.  My nails still peel (iron deficiency problem) but they dont crack and tear to the skin like previously.</li>
            <li> as usual great product. It&#x27;s the only product that makes my nails strong!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and really can&#x27;t tell that it has made a difference.</li>
            <li> Really strengthens nails! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I added a review earlier but accidentally only have it one star!  I&#x27;m sorry, it was meant to be five!!</li>
            <li> I love the product and this size is great for my purse or travel bag. Same product, but smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> The formula dries very quickly. I had no idea it was going to be really tiny but i&#x27;m glad I bought the travel size to try it first, now that i really like it I will be buying the bigger size.&lt;br /&gt;I notice that my nails didn&#x27;t break that easy and it helps to prevent yellow nails.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product but it dried out my nails even more. The Dry and Brittle formula works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Have used for ~3 weeks, so far, seems to be making my nails stronger, so they&#x27;re growing longer.</li>
            <li> Same great product that it has always been. This is a very tiny bottle, so if you have never tried this product, give this size a whirl.</li>
            <li> I am trying to quit nail biting and this is helping me to stop after many years.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need to bite them anymore because the nail polish protects them and makes them stronger..</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, truly the only way I am able to grow nails (mine are naturally thin and brittle and this makes them thick and strong).</li>
            <li> The only thing that works for me</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could try out the little bottle&#x27;s brush, which I love!  However, the product was yellow, which I suspect was because it was old.  I have another bottle of Nail Envy, and it is much whiter.  I poured out the yellow liquid, and poured in the white!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Small size and is perfect for travel. Keeps my nails from peeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve always had brital nails that rip when they grow. This made them grown strong and long!</li>
            <li> The only nail polish I use. It keeps my nails long and strong.</li>
