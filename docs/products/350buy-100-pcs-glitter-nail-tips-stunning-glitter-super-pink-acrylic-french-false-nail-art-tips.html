            <li> The tips are so cute but they are not the bright pink color that I expected. Still very cute and worth the money. Great product!</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM! same color as in picture and sparkly! in the sized packages and everything, came in way earlier than expected also.</li>
            <li> I love the color and how the glitter looks...my only problem has been that the nail tips break (crack)really easy. you just have to be careful.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NOT THE BRIGHT PINK LIKE THEY SHOWED ON THE PICTURE! SO DISAPPOINTED! DONT KNOW IF I WILL USE. WILL NOT BE BUYING THESE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> If is good buy the is nice and cheap to very nicer color  when you put them will look  better</li>
            <li> They are really thin it&#x27;s hard to keep them on even with the acrylic on</li>
            <li> Super flimsy. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Got them thank u already got atot of attention</li>
            <li> Very Nice...The color looks just like the picture.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and the price equals the beauty</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful product, only thing that i would change is that they are a little bit transparent. I would like to have them more pink.&lt;br /&gt;All in all beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> These tips are pretty but don&#x27;t stick well with glue. I thought that the glitter dust was inhibiting the adheasion but not the case still had problems if we cleaned the dust off. I used glue drier to help and it did. DO NOT WIPE the tips with anything or the glitter comes off before acrylic is applied.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as i hoped looks&lt;br /&gt; kinda dull once acrylic is applied</li>
            <li> I am in love with these nails as a female impersonator I have wore these nails just about every show since I got them they are wonderful I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> These nails won&#x27;t stay on with any nail/super glue.  Do not waste your money on these.  I&#x27;ve see Better quality nails at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get here, but that&#x27;s expected. Very pleased with pink glitter tips. One thing I would change is the tracking details. Never  knew where the package was couldn&#x27;t track it .</li>
            <li> Pretty in pink So worth the wait GREAT price&lt;br /&gt;I always use white tips then end up bored &amp; always paint a design that eventually comes off These have built in glitter doesn&#x27;t come off yay !!LOVE that</li>
            <li> Just as bright and sparkly as the picture! They came in bags by size which is super helpful!</li>
