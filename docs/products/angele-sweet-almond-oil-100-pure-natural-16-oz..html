            <li>Great product, I have tried other Almond oils, this is the best.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t regret getting it at all, this one is almost by far the BEST oil</li>
            <li>I’ve tried so many moisturizers, but this is the best I’ve found for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very smoothly to use.</li>
            <li>Very lightly scented.</li>
            <li>This oil smells so good that I use it on my skin after a bath to prevent dryness &amp; it absorves quickly.</li>
            <li>oil itself soaks fairly swiftly into the skin (I tried this one on my hands and face, feet and knees), leaving skin super</li>
            <li>Very good for my very dry skin and using a good skin moisturizer.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wipe with a warm damp cloth and a light film of oil remains as my moisturizer for the night.</li>

            <li>This almond oil leave my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I tried sweet almond oil a bit hesitant because since I already have oily skin I do not want to appear like I have grease smeared all over my face.</li>

            <li>I love finding new uses for this product.</li>
            <li>Large size, smooth oil.  </li>
            <li>I put a few drops on my loufa with my almond blossom soap, it works great.</li>
            <li>Great quality but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I use it after the shower quite frequently, but my favorite it to use it on my legs after I shave and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I applied it each night before going to sleep, so it gets absorbed by my skin while I am asleep.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s just 100% all natural almond oil too.</li>
            <li>The oil is a good value, and works extremely well as a moisturizer.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li>Really helps!</li>
            <li>Nice oil for home made spa stuff- not really scented.</li>
            <li>;) Smells yummy too.</li>
            <li>Love this product, especially in winter in WI.  </li>
            <li>is my first one.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying almond oil</li>
            <li>Really soothing and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>This seems to be helping with my split ends pretty well.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when this arrived was ofcourse the package it comes in.</li>
            <li>First time using this product.</li>
            <li>Its oily at first</li>
            <li>The package was pretty damaged in the shipping process...</li>
            <li>I used this oil in place of a basic moisturizer and its fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I feel like I need to apply more later.</li>
            <li>It’s so smooth and mild that my partner and I use it as a personal lubricant as well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great for a moisturizer- especially in the dry winter air.</li>
            <li>My skin is also super sensitive.  </li>
            <li>at my age , 66 , this is better than any lotion for my dry skin here in the Southwest....</li>
            <li>Thus, I can’t use most of the body locations and dry skin moisturizers on the market.  </li>
            <li>Although the price is higher than a lot of other sweet almond oils, I find that it works on my face really well, it feels softer and smoother and has improved my complexion significantly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sweet almond oil has really no scent, (as opposed to bitter almond oil which smells like cherries), so it is really nice that if you have allergies to certain strong smells, this oil won&#x27;t bother you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By morning, it is absorbed, and my face is soft and fresh and ready for new application.</li>
            <li>It also works really well as a skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>addition to how well it works, I really like that it has virtually no scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my hands and it has really helped to keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li>really help the dryskin</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>Unlike all of those others I&#x27;ve tried, this oil really absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>It gently and thoroughly loosens and liquifies makeup and surface dirt in preparation for cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I find it really helps soften the skin without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn’t have much of a scent at all, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so much softer.</li>
            <li>So I really, really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I end up with very manageable, silky</li>
            <li>but the skin absorbs it fast and wont leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>Use it every night haven&#x27;t really seen much difference yet anyway</li>
            <li>I have been looking for more natural beauty products, especially facial cleansers, moisturizers, etc.</li>
            <li>too early to tell you if that&#x27;s working!!!</li>
            <li>I am so happy it is a big bottle and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The seller sends you an email with tips on other ways to use it. :-)</li>
            <li>rub that together in your hands and then over your hair from about mid crown down, then once youve done that rub your hands over the top of your head to smooth that area without making it oily.</li>
            <li>recently I got my hands on this sweet almond oil, via a promotion they were doing on Facebook.</li>
            <li>I use it as an after shower moisturizer, particularly after shaving.</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered a second bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use on my face at night and really keeps skin soft!  </li>
            <li>A few months back I stumbled across a beauty blog where the author discussed the many benefits of sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended….good size for the price.</li>
            <li>AS WELL.I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>I sometimes add to the oil a little lavender, my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I received the oil very quickly (faster than expected, in fact!).</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to help as a pre-conditioner for my curly, dry hair and to use as a body moisturize.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to putting some in my new little roll on bottles and my new oils, going to be a great carrier in addition to all the other uses.</li>
            <li>So far I really like the oil.</li>
            <li>I have found that it really helps moisturize my skin, giving it a really natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with my body lotion, and it absorb pretty fast, not too oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very luxurious and rich compared to the other brands I have.</li>
            <li>tried so many different oils for my dry hair, none work as well as this.</li>
            <li>I do this right after my daily shower.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>this feels like such better quality vs. other almond oil I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The bottle has a flip top with small hole</li>
            <li>I leaves your skin feeling completely refreshed!</li>
            <li>Her skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I have a long history of having very dry skin.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle enough for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After using this almond oil just a few times my skin is soft and my flakey legs are smooth again.</li>
            <li>My daughter in law uses all organic and natural products...</li>
            <li>My skin is overly sensitive to majority of body locations and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>100% natural, so I used it on my daughter as well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so incredibly soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>THAT IS 64 YEARS OLD IS SOFT AND LOOKS</li>
            <li>I like it so far it rubs in well</li>
            <li>I tried massaging the oil over my face right after I step out of the bath, while my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li>A tiny thing of Moroccan oil costs twice as much as this giant bottle and works exactly the same in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I have been using this especially to make homemade conditioner, and even shared it with friends who had been struggling to find the right product for their dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone that has dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Having tried a number of other oils including melaleuca and olive, this is my first time trying almond oil</li>
            <li>It has only a subtle but appealing scent.</li>
            <li>i use it everyday ,and hope useful to me</li>
            <li>My skin feels even more subtle and softer than ever before!</li>
            <li>It keeps my eye area very moisturized and the dark under circles in control.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly without an overwhelming oily feeling- which is the reason I hate a lot of lotions.</li>
            <li>Soft skin for this time of year when everything is dry!  </li>

            <li> Great product, I have tried other Almond oils, this is the best.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t regret getting it at all, this one is almost by far the BEST oil</li>
            <li> I’ve tried so many moisturizers, but this is the best I’ve found for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very smoothly to use.</li>
            <li> Very lightly scented.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good that I use it on my skin after a bath to prevent dryness &amp; it absorves quickly.</li>
            <li> oil itself soaks fairly swiftly into the skin (I tried this one on my hands and face, feet and knees), leaving skin super</li>
            <li> Very good for my very dry skin and using a good skin moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Wipe with a warm damp cloth and a light film of oil remains as my moisturizer for the night.</li>

            <li> This almond oil leave my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I tried sweet almond oil a bit hesitant because since I already have oily skin I do not want to appear like I have grease smeared all over my face.</li>

            <li> Great for many different things related to hair  and skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it in my hair and it looks great and is not at all frizzy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself has a nice matching blue label and comes with a secure plastic top that you can easily pop open for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get more and try the new products too</li>
            <li> I love finding new uses for this product.</li>
            <li> Large size, smooth oil.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my loufa with my almond blossom soap, it works great.</li>
            <li> Great quality but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it after the shower quite frequently, but my favorite it to use it on my legs after I shave and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I applied it each night before going to sleep, so it gets absorbed by my skin while I am asleep.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s just 100% all natural almond oil too.</li>
            <li> The oil is a good value, and works extremely well as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft.</li>
            <li> For me, Angele Sweet Almond Oil is very hypo-allergenic.</li>
            <li> this oil really works and it quickly absorbs</li>
            <li> Almond oil is AMAZING for skin and hair, so you cant go wrong if you experiment wisely.</li>
            <li> , it works wonderfully as a glossing serum if you take a tiny bit, say a few drops and mix with a drop or two of water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Really helps!</li>
            <li> Nice oil for home made spa stuff- not really scented.</li>
            <li> ;) Smells yummy too.</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially in winter in WI.  </li>
            <li> is my first one.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying almond oil</li>
            <li> Really soothing and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> This seems to be helping with my split ends pretty well.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when this arrived was ofcourse the package it comes in.</li>
            <li> First time using this product.</li>
            <li> Its oily at first</li>
            <li> The package was pretty damaged in the shipping process...</li>
            <li> I used this oil in place of a basic moisturizer and its fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I feel like I need to apply more later.</li>
            <li> It’s so smooth and mild that my partner and I use it as a personal lubricant as well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great for a moisturizer- especially in the dry winter air.</li>
            <li> My skin is also super sensitive.  </li>
            <li> at my age , 66 , this is better than any lotion for my dry skin here in the Southwest....</li>
            <li> Thus, I can’t use most of the body locations and dry skin moisturizers on the market.  </li>
            <li> Although the price is higher than a lot of other sweet almond oils, I find that it works on my face really well, it feels softer and smoother and has improved my complexion significantly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sweet almond oil has really no scent, (as opposed to bitter almond oil which smells like cherries), so it is really nice that if you have allergies to certain strong smells, this oil won&#x27;t bother you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By morning, it is absorbed, and my face is soft and fresh and ready for new application.</li>
            <li> It also works really well as a skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> addition to how well it works, I really like that it has virtually no scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my hands and it has really helped to keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> really help the dryskin</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> Unlike all of those others I&#x27;ve tried, this oil really absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> It gently and thoroughly loosens and liquifies makeup and surface dirt in preparation for cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I find it really helps soften the skin without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn’t have much of a scent at all, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so much softer.</li>
            <li> So I really, really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I end up with very manageable, silky</li>
            <li> but the skin absorbs it fast and wont leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Use it every night haven&#x27;t really seen much difference yet anyway</li>
            <li> I have been looking for more natural beauty products, especially facial cleansers, moisturizers, etc.</li>
            <li> too early to tell you if that&#x27;s working!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy it is a big bottle and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The seller sends you an email with tips on other ways to use it. :-)</li>
            <li> rub that together in your hands and then over your hair from about mid crown down, then once youve done that rub your hands over the top of your head to smooth that area without making it oily.</li>
            <li> recently I got my hands on this sweet almond oil, via a promotion they were doing on Facebook.</li>
            <li> I use it as an after shower moisturizer, particularly after shaving.</li>
            <li> I quickly ordered a second bottle.  </li>
            <li> I use on my face at night and really keeps skin soft!  </li>
            <li> A few months back I stumbled across a beauty blog where the author discussed the many benefits of sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended….good size for the price.</li>
            <li> AS WELL.I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> I sometimes add to the oil a little lavender, my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I received the oil very quickly (faster than expected, in fact!).</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to help as a pre-conditioner for my curly, dry hair and to use as a body moisturize.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to putting some in my new little roll on bottles and my new oils, going to be a great carrier in addition to all the other uses.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the oil.</li>
            <li> I have found that it really helps moisturize my skin, giving it a really natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with my body lotion, and it absorb pretty fast, not too oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very luxurious and rich compared to the other brands I have.</li>
            <li> tried so many different oils for my dry hair, none work as well as this.</li>
            <li> I do this right after my daily shower.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this feels like such better quality vs. other almond oil I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The bottle has a flip top with small hole</li>
            <li> I leaves your skin feeling completely refreshed!</li>
            <li> Her skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I have a long history of having very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle enough for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After using this almond oil just a few times my skin is soft and my flakey legs are smooth again.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law uses all organic and natural products...</li>
            <li> My skin is overly sensitive to majority of body locations and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> 100% natural, so I used it on my daughter as well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so incredibly soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> THAT IS 64 YEARS OLD IS SOFT AND LOOKS</li>
            <li> I like it so far it rubs in well</li>
            <li> I tried massaging the oil over my face right after I step out of the bath, while my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> A tiny thing of Moroccan oil costs twice as much as this giant bottle and works exactly the same in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I have been using this especially to make homemade conditioner, and even shared it with friends who had been struggling to find the right product for their dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone that has dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Having tried a number of other oils including melaleuca and olive, this is my first time trying almond oil</li>
            <li> It has only a subtle but appealing scent.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday ,and hope useful to me</li>
            <li> My skin feels even more subtle and softer than ever before!</li>
            <li> It keeps my eye area very moisturized and the dark under circles in control.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly without an overwhelming oily feeling- which is the reason I hate a lot of lotions.</li>
            <li> Soft skin for this time of year when everything is dry!  </li>
            <li> As a pregnant woman with eczema I am skeptical of trying new skin care products.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount-don&#x27;t put too much</li>
            <li> so it will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have only used a few times but so far I find it soothing on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I rub a few drops anywhere on my skin where it is dry (heck, even on my scalp, where it makes my hair soft!).</li>
            <li> I have stopped using other creams and only use this on my face.</li>
            <li> I also color my hair which can dry it out in the process.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin; however, the winter weather causes me to have dry patches on my chin and forehead...</li>
            <li> I use it after bath/shower on my skin, what a help for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it sparingly on the dry ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed, colored, dry hair</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin on my hands...</li>
            <li> Autumn is when I start to notice my skin begins to dry out.</li>
            <li> but before my skin is fully dry.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 starts is that for some reason, I expected it to smell &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; when actually, there is really no scent.  </li>
            <li> I use such a small amount each day, so the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Moreover, a little bit (size of a dime or less) is enough for both my hands, so it will last for quite some time!</li>
            <li> For instance, since my hair is a little oily already, I only use about a dime sized amount on my ends.</li>
            <li> After I use it on my hands I rub my hair with the little bit left and it helps for the frizz.</li>
            <li> And it takes only a few drops a day</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried quite a few oils and crèmes, some of which helped, but none of which produced the overall result I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only tried this a few times.</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin patch on my ankle that I had previously unsuccessfully treated with coconut oil; I&#x27;ve used this almond oil on it four times and</li>
            <li> just apply this to my belly and other areas after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I even started running the excess from my hands into my wet hair as a leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li> Beware- a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have some other brand of oil that leaks whenever I pour, but this one doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping me and my little one and our dry itchy winter skin and hair.</li>
            <li> And it also helps a lot with the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil for month now and don&#x27;t see any results of my dark circles lighten up</li>
            <li> very moisturizing during cold, dry winters.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hair and it combats the frizzes without leaving a weighed down or greasy look and feel.</li>
            <li> I use this for my cuticles, and it works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I read that if you combine it with avocado &amp; honey put it around your eyes that it reduces black circles.  </li>
            <li> I usually let it dry for a little bit before getting fully dressed because it is an oil, and I don&#x27;t want to leave marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I like to keep a bottle of body oil in my shower to apply after I towel off a little</li>
            <li> so you squirt out just a few drops.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I live in Northern MN and my dry &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; was bad this year.</li>
            <li> oil is cold pressed and made in Italy, so I know I&#x27;m getting high quality, and I can tell from how well it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all it takes is a few drops massaged into my scalp!  </li>
            <li> I use it at night on my feet and notice that my feet are not as bad as they normally are in winter.</li>
            <li> Living in a dry climate, that is a tough compliment to receive!</li>
            <li> I don’t think this product was being sold on Amazon (at least I didn’t see here before) when I bought it via a facebook ad.</li>
            <li> You just need a very small amount to hydrate your hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s cap came completely broken off with the box in shambles.  </li>
            <li> my cap was broken and some had leaked out ....</li>
            <li> I apply it after a bath, and I find it doesn’t leave any greasy film on my skin, and I don’t have any bad reactions from it, like acne or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice almond oil. Used on skin in addition to adding to some homemade beauty recipes I make.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using it for just over a week and have already had some great results. I have a dry skin patch on my ankle that I had previously unsuccessfully treated with coconut oil; I&#x27;ve used this almond oil on it four times and it&#x27;s almost gone. I&#x27;m also using it in my hair and it looks great and is not at all frizzy or weighed down. It also works really well as a skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to how well it works, I really like that it has virtually no scent. This oil delivers on all marks and I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Although the price is higher than a lot of other sweet almond oils, I find that it works on my face really well, it feels softer and smoother and has improved my complexion significantly.  Maybe it’s those Mediterranean almonds they use to make the oil!  I have very sensitive skin and I am happy to pay a few more dollars to get the quality results I want.  And it takes only a few drops a day so it will last me a long time.  I also color my hair which can dry it out in the process.  Using this sweet almond oil has helped my hair regain it&#x27;s luster and shine and all it takes is a few drops massaged into my scalp!  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious!!  A great massage oil and doesn&#x27;t feel super greasy when you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend and I gave it a try.  As a pregnant woman with eczema I am skeptical of trying new skin care products.  It has turned out to be a wonderful moisturizer!  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  My skin feels great without greasy residue that some oils can leave on the skin.  My eczema has even shown some improvement.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The customer service was excellent. They shipped fast and arrived in great condition. The oil is great for using in your hair. I love it!!! You just need a very small amount to hydrate your hair. I also mix with avocado and blend to put in my hair with a warming cap. Your hair gets shinier and softer.</li>
            <li> very good almond oil - meets every expectation.  will buy this again!  :)</li>
            <li> Really helps! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Angele box arrived damaged (inside of an undamaged shipping box) and therefore I am leery to use the product.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law uses all organic and natural products...she was excited to receive this product...she loves the way her skin and hair feel</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to make body butter!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in perfect condition. It has a very light pleasant scent. Even though it is an oil it does not&lt;br /&gt;leave you feeling greasy. I have only used a few times but so far I find it soothing on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This almond oil is a great moisturizer. I have been using it on my hands and it has really helped to keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li> Very good for my very dry skin and using a good skin moisturizer. I use cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Great for winter skin problems. I use it at night on my feet and notice that my feet are not as bad as they normally are in winter.</li>
            <li> Nice oil for home made spa stuff- not really scented.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bees knees! I use it after the shower quite frequently, but my favorite it to use it on my legs after I shave and exfoliate. Holy smooth legs Batman! This stuff is awesome...it&#x27;s beyond awesome...it BE-AWESOME! ;) Smells yummy too. lol</li>
            <li> Large bottle of sweet almond oil, high quality and great for skin.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially in winter in WI.  Keeps skin moist, and feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li> OMG! this oil changed my life</li>
            <li> I use this in all of my home made bath care products.  Leaves my hair silky soft, and it is a great alternative to jojoba oil I had used on my face which caused my face and neck to break out!  My skin is also super sensitive.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this especially to make homemade conditioner, and even shared it with friends who had been struggling to find the right product for their dry scalp. Works like a charm! Excellent product and great customer service. I received the oil very quickly (faster than expected, in fact!).</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing, using as a carrier oil, smells good.</li>
            <li> at my age , 66 , this is better than any lotion for my dry skin here in the Southwest.... Thank you for develope this product</li>
            <li> Love the oil and fragrance. So far do good and it helps hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Almond oil. I am familiar to this kind of oil but sweet Almond oil is my first one. But I don&#x27;t regret getting it at all, this one is almost by far the BEST oil I  have tried. I got it at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I am telling you, this oil is really nice. It has only a subtle but appealing scent. It&#x27;s very soothing. I mixed it with my body lotion, and it absorb pretty fast, not too oily. Even try to put it on my hubby and massage him when his back sores. He loves it. I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair yet. It works well on my nails and cuticles too. I just love this oil. Great one!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know all the uses for this until I purchased. I use on my face at night and really keeps skin soft!  I also soaked cucumbers in the fridge and applied to my eyes to help soothe  and refresh!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Extraordinarily light and smooth feeling.  NOT GREASY!  Absolutely delightful to use.</li>
            <li> I use it to help me prevent stretchmarks during my pregnancy, also is great for hydrating skin and massages.</li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s cap came completely broken off with the box in shambles.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This almond oil smells like cake. I love it! I use it as a moisturizer since I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of things even coconut oil! It&#x27;s been working beautifully.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for moisturizing and make-up removal. It is also a perfect replacement for the lotions I had been using that contain paraben.</li>
            <li> too early to tell you if that&#x27;s working!!!</li>
            <li> Working great so far. Looking forward to putting some in my new little roll on bottles and my new oils, going to be a great carrier in addition to all the other uses. It&#x27;s helping me and my little one and our dry itchy winter skin and hair. I put a few drops on my loufa with my almond blossom soap, it works great.</li>
            <li> I received my order in a timely manner and I would recommend this oil to others.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it exactly what I wanted.  Trying it out for a week to give it a chance.  It had great reviews so maybe I just need to give it time.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice large size bottle of what seems like really high quality almond oil. I got this for trying to keep pregnancy stretch marks at bay, and so far so good! (Of course, they say stretch marks are hereditary, but either way-- I&#x27;m 34 weeks and haven&#x27;t gotten any yet!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just apply this to my belly and other areas after getting out of the shower. I usually let it dry for a little bit before getting fully dressed because it is an oil, and I don&#x27;t want to leave marks on my clothes. I even started running the excess from my hands into my wet hair as a leave in conditioner! Works like a charm! A tiny thing of Moroccan oil costs twice as much as this giant bottle and works exactly the same in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> good product. it wrks for me.</li>
            <li> this feels like such better quality vs. other almond oil I&#x27;ve bought. It&#x27;s very luxurious and rich compared to the other brands I have.</li>
            <li> Wow...love this oil..I make homemade  lotions and this is a great addition.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my order,took a bit longer to arrive than I thought it would. bottle has inside feature to keep oil from leaking out if on side .Can be removed ,but I leave in in case bottle falls over.</li>
            <li> In trying to eliminate lotions with toxic toxins in them I have been making my own body lotions.  Just made a batch will the sweet almond oil and I love it.  I&#x27;ve made it for some for family and friends and the love it also.  Will definitely have this brand on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the oil. It is a great price for the size and it leaves my skin feeling really soft. Beware- a little goes a long way! Don&#x27;t over do it or you will be oiling everything you touch</li>
            <li> A good almond oil for the hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great product!! really help the dryskin</li>
            <li> Love it! This oil left my skin so soft and perfect!</li>
            <li> i use it everyday ,and hope useful to me</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very nice overall moisturizer.  I&#x27;m a big fan now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I love it. This almond oil leave my skin nice and soft. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> I love Angele Sweet Almond Oil!  My skin is overly sensitive to majority of body locations and moisturizers. Thus, I can’t use most of the body locations and dry skin moisturizers on the market.  For me, Angele Sweet Almond Oil is very hypo-allergenic. I highly recommend it for anyone that has dry sensitive skin. Best of all, it does not leave me feeling oily. I use it as an after shower moisturizer, particularly after shaving. But, I use it all over!  It’s so smooth and mild that my partner and I use it as a personal lubricant as well! I’ve tried so many moisturizers, but this is the best I’ve found for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil. It has no preservatives and I use it each day on my face. The seller sent me via email different tips on how and what I can use the oil for. One of them was for my face. I have stopped using other creams and only use this on my face. My face looks so much better. I even have red cheeks. I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> Soft skin for this time of year when everything is dry!  I love this moisturizer!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying almond oil so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I love this! I have some other brand of oil that leaks whenever I pour, but this one doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Really soothing and moisturizing! I&#x27;ll continue to buy this almond oil. Good for use on face and hair and just as a body moisturizer on its own or in a home made lotion</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> The oil is a good value, and works extremely well as a moisturizer.  The reason for the 4 starts is that for some reason, I expected it to smell &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; when actually, there is really no scent.  But it is a wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for more natural beauty products, especially facial cleansers, moisturizers, etc. I have tried jojoba oil, grapeseed oil and virgin coconut oil for moisturizing my face. All were ok, but almond oil has them all beat. Unlike all of those others I&#x27;ve tried, this oil really absorbs into my skin. I use this mostly on my face, underneath primer &amp; makeup. I also apply it before bedtime after washing my face. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this oil. My skin looks great and it helps reduce the appearance of my fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Somewhat of a mystery to me in the sense of it being an oil, that isn&#x27;t oily(?) I&#x27;ve been looking for something that i could use on my face that could maybe help prevent or soften age lines. Having tried a number of other oils including melaleuca and olive, this is my first time trying almond oil and i&#x27;m really happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This seems to be helping with my split ends pretty well. I use it twice a week and sleep with it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice slip, doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly. Great for massages.</li>
            <li> nourishes my hair and skin wonderfully! tried so many different oils for my dry hair, none work as well as this.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin; however, the winter weather causes me to have dry patches on my chin and forehead...no bueno! I tried sweet almond oil a bit hesitant because since I already have oily skin I do not want to appear like I have grease smeared all over my face. I was pleasantly surprised! It only takes a small amount-don&#x27;t put too much or you will look greasy. It&#x27;s great as a moisturizer before I put on my make-up or just bare faced. Love!</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good that I use it on my skin after a bath to prevent dryness &amp; it absorves quickly.</li>
            <li> received timely and intact</li>
            <li> I use this for my cuticles, and it works extremely well! It is a great moisturizer, and works wonders on dry skin. Moreover, a little bit (size of a dime or less) is enough for both my hands, so it will last for quite some time!</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this product. Restoring my skin, which was in need of repair.  Has so many benefits and uses.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it. quality is good and 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased the Premium sweet almond oil from Angele. I use it after bath/shower on my skin, what a help for my dry skin. I have used it sparingly on the dry ends of my hair. This oil is great for dry skin. It helps your skin to stay moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Almond Oil and was just so excited to see this. I ordered it and received it today and could not be any happier with it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for my hair. I have relaxed, colored, dry hair so this is helpful as a prepoo and also to seal my ends. I am so happy it is a big bottle and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Very smoothly to use.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this lotion.  It smells good, it works well... very moisturizing during cold, dry winters.</li>
            <li> this oil really works and it quickly absorbs</li>
            <li> I use this lovely oil in my day spa as Step one in my facials.  It gently and thoroughly loosens and liquifies makeup and surface dirt in preparation for cleansing.  Non comedogenic, no fragrance.  Elegant packaging.</li>
            <li> I don’t think this product was being sold on Amazon (at least I didn’t see here before) when I bought it via a facebook ad. I have used sweet almond oil for some time, but I like this one the best. What I like to do is use it as a blend with grapeseed oil, as a cleanser for my face. I apply it after a bath, and I find it doesn’t leave any greasy film on my skin, and I don’t have any bad reactions from it, like acne or irritated skin. I have tried it as a massage oil and I really was happy with it there too!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I have a long history of having very dry skin. Over the years I have tried quite a few oils and crèmes, some of which helped, but none of which produced the overall result I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So recently I got my hands on this sweet almond oil, via a promotion they were doing on Facebook. I applied it each night before going to sleep, so it gets absorbed by my skin while I am asleep. I have found that it really helps moisturize my skin, giving it a really natural looking glow. My face seems so much more attractive--although maybe that is just wishful thinking--and all my friends have commented on how radiant my skin seems.  Living in a dry climate, that is a tough compliment to receive!</li>
            <li> Great for many different things related to hair  and skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product which I bought to remove eye make-up.  The bottle has a flip top with small hole so you squirt out just a few drops. If you combine with using some sort of cotton square, removes makeup well and no sting to the eyes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Can&#x27;t wait to get more and try the new products too</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Pure and awesome</li>
            <li> I have only tried this a few times. I read that if you combine it with avocado &amp; honey put it around your eyes that it reduces black circles.  I used it as a mask in my hair and on my face. My hair was shined and my face glowed.</li>
            <li> Just how it was advertised!</li>
            <li> This is the best oil I have found. Bought 1 bottle for facial cleansing. Smells good, Slides on and removes all makeup (waterproof too) especially easy around the eyes. All mascara and liner come off instantly. Wipe with a warm damp cloth and a light film of oil remains as my moisturizer for the night. By morning, it is absorbed, and my face is soft and fresh and ready for new application. I notice that my fine lines are not as visible anymore. Makeup goes on smoothly. I tried the most expensive face creams, serums etc but this simple one step product is the best. I quickly ordered a second bottle.  Highly recommended….good size for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  I put it around my eyes at night and used it to give my boyfriend a massage!  Great quality but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I leaves your skin feeling completely refreshed! The is no oily or greasy feeling. This would be great for a man or a women because there is no fragrances added. It also works great for hair conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin on my hands... this is making a huge difference! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good packaging and quality seems to be great, same as what I used before.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love finding new uses for this product. I originally bought it to help as a pre-conditioner for my curly, dry hair and to use as a body moisturize. Not only does it work well for those purposes and it does not have a greasy or heavy feel, but it works well as a light after shampoo moisturizer when a few drops are added to my regular curl-defining products. I&#x27;ve also used it as a shaving oil and make-up remover. I love how it&#x27;s fragrance free so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfumes. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love how light this is, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin.  I also use it on my hair and it combats the frizzes without leaving a weighed down or greasy look and feel.</li>
            <li> Light, pleasant, herbal scent. Hydrates well, absorbs quickly. 100% natural, so I used it on my daughter as well. Her skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I tried massaging the oil over my face right after I step out of the bath, while my skin is still wet. I find it really helps soften the skin without clogging my pores. Also, it doesn’t have much of a scent at all, which I appreciate. I sometimes add to the oil a little lavender, my favorite scent. I use such a small amount each day, so the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the Almond oil! My daughter uses it on her hair!  It is great for keeping her hair from being frizzy!</li>
            <li> Autumn is when I start to notice my skin begins to dry out. I like to keep a bottle of body oil in my shower to apply after I towel off a little but before my skin is fully dry. A friend recommended almond oil so I went searching and found this. This stuff is great! It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft. Some oils leave me feeling greasy afterward. Not this one! I love that it&#x27;s just 100% all natural almond oil too. No perfumes, no dyes. Nothing added. I highly recommend this fantastic oil!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Very lightly scented. Worked beautifully for making salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> Friend of mine recommended this and I like it, but my girlfriend loves it! It has many uses, but mostly I massage my GF&#x27;s back with it. Nice smelling, makes giving a massage a breeze and the &amp;#34;massagee&amp;#34; seems to like it quite a lot!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now. It&#x27;s been great for a moisturizer- especially in the dry winter air. Absorbs quickly without an overwhelming oily feeling- which is the reason I hate a lot of lotions. It also doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. Will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> A few months back I stumbled across a beauty blog where the author discussed the many benefits of sweet almond oil. I&#x27;d never even heard of it before then, but I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am so happy that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it all over my body: I rub a few drops anywhere on my skin where it is dry (heck, even on my scalp, where it makes my hair soft!). I do this right after my daily shower. It makes my skin feel so much softer. And for my face, I find that it reduces lines and wrinkles. And it also helps a lot with the dark circles under my eyes. So I really, really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently obtained a bottle of Angele&#x27;s sweet almond oil directly from them, to try out, and I can say without any hesitation that I feel that it is the best that I have used - and that&#x27;s really saying something. My skin feels even more subtle and softer than ever before! I give it top marks and look forward to getting my hands on more.</li>
            <li> Love it, makes shaving easier</li>
            <li> Large size, smooth oil.  I use to dilute my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift.  I really liked the packaging!  It made it a great gift to be unwrapped.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I make bath bombs and this makes them really amazing!  Sweet almond oil is really great stuff!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!  From a makeup remover, to a moisturizer for my kids it  has been the perfect addition to my beauty products.  I love that I can use it for so many different things and it is gentle enough for sensitive skin.  This is a must have!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when this arrived was ofcourse the package it comes in. In this case, it comes in a very nice and pretty blue and gold box, which I immediately thought would be great for giving as a gift. The bottle itself has a nice matching blue label and comes with a secure plastic top that you can easily pop open for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet almond oil has really no scent, (as opposed to bitter almond oil which smells like cherries), so it is really nice that if you have allergies to certain strong smells, this oil won&#x27;t bother you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is cold pressed and made in Italy, so I know I&#x27;m getting high quality, and I can tell from how well it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself soaks fairly swiftly into the skin (I tried this one on my hands and face, feet and knees), leaving skin super soft.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lightweight oil so skin does not feel greasy after rubbing it in properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a good sized bottle so it should last most users a GOOD long time. Even with daily use, or adding to mixes for lotions, soaps, etc. this will last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use almond oil for hair mask and added a tiny bit to conditioner. Almond oil is AMAZING for skin and hair, so you cant go wrong if you experiment wisely. For instance, since my hair is a little oily already, I only use about a dime sized amount on my ends. This works beautifully for me and I end up with very manageable, silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it works wonderfully as a glossing serum if you take a tiny bit, say a few drops and mix with a drop or two of water. rub that together in your hands and then over your hair from about mid crown down, then once youve done that rub your hands over the top of your head to smooth that area without making it oily. Just experiment as I have done, and figure out what method works best for you. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for my honest opinion and review. All thoughts and ideas are my own*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil for month now and don&#x27;t see any results of my dark circles lighten up</li>
            <li> The oil it&#x27;s self is great I love it....&lt;br /&gt;But my cap was broken and some had leaked out ....it needed to be sealed better padded better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Tracy S.</li>
            <li> First time using this product. It leaves my skin so incredibly soft and glowing. Its oily at first but the skin absorbs it fast and wont leave an oily residue. I use it at night as well under my eyes. It keeps my eye area very moisturized and the dark under circles in control.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!  The package was pretty damaged in the shipping process...its a good thing I didn&#x27;t want it for a gift. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. I was used to the perfumed almond oils that smell really sweet but since this has no synthetic ingredients there is no scent. I use it on my hands and feet to soften. After I use it on my hands I rub my hair with the little bit left and it helps for the frizz. The seller sends you an email with tips on other ways to use it. :-)</li>
            <li> The almond oil arrived in a well-sealed bottle. So, no spills. It is great, odorless, and gets absorbed by skin quickly. I bought this tp rub on my pregnant belly and it&#x27;s perfect. I also mix some with my lotion to put on my arms and legs :-)</li>
            <li> Great product, I have tried other Almond oils, this is the best. Good customer service follow-up</li>
            <li> Very nice, almost no smell (a plus in my book), very useful as a massage oil.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS.I PUT IT ON AFTER A BATH WHILE I&#x27;M STILL WET,IT SOAKS IN AND MY SKIN THAT IS 64 YEARS OLD IS SOFT AND LOOKS GREAT.ALSO MY FACE LOOKS GOOD AS WELL.I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS.</li>
            <li> I live in Northern MN and my dry &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; was bad this year. After using this almond oil just a few times my skin is soft and my flakey legs are smooth again. My face loves it too!!! Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I used this oil in place of a basic moisturizer and its fantastic! No greasy residue, it goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling super soft and lovely! Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this oil.  It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and I am actually happy that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Using it as a moisturizer and hair treatment.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love massages and I bought a bottle of the almond oil and convinced my girlfriend to use it for a massage. I loved it! She said she is going to buy some, too. I think it would be a great product for massage therapists to use on their patients!</li>
            <li> good delivery. I like it so far it rubs in well but I feel like I need to apply more later.</li>
            <li> Use it every night haven&#x27;t really seen much difference yet anyway</li>
            <li> good product,fair price,thanks. Emil</li>
