            <li> I love the way this scent lasts ALL day!  It smells so good too.  I&#x27;ve been asked over and over \\&quot;what is that perfume?\\&quot; J-Lo knows her fragrance and that&#x27;s why she cornered the market in celebrity perfumes! I&#x27;m collecting ALL of her perfumes and have six so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume from Beauty Encounter through Amazon.com for a great price and a timely delivery. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. We&#x27;d shopped around for the spray and didn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally for the great price and quantity that we got it from this seller at Amazon. I recommend the perfume and this seller.</li>
            <li> Love it so much. Smells so beautiful</li>
            <li> scent of seduction, fresh, soft and lovely, the use for any occasion. I love the drive with my husband goes crazy with its aroma</li>
            <li> I choosed it because i like it. I had one but i turnded off. This fragance is so delicate and sublim</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; great product description.  Accurate on all levels.</li>
            <li> What a beautiful scent! Not too overpowering, just right. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> If you are a &#x27;JGLOW&#x27; loyal,this line of perfume is not even closer.It does not linger on you long enough.&lt;br /&gt;It is a mild perfume and can be worn to work.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how this smelled. It is soft and clean. Really liked the bottle. Price was good too.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS WONDERFUL.  I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BOTTLE.  THIS WILL LAST THROUGH CHRISTMAS.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE</li>
            <li> I like the actual smell, very clean and soft and floral. But the downside (and maybe it&#x27;s just me) but it doesn&#x27;t stick for very long. Like it doesn&#x27;t last all day, and i feel i have to spray a LOT to make it last even half day.&lt;br /&gt;It might be cuz it&#x27;s Toilette instead of Parfum, not sure, but very nice scent over all. Day time scent for sure, it&#x27;s one of those scents where it&#x27;s very simple, and nice, perfect for around family or school where you&#x27;re not putting too much effort to smell/look fabulous. I&#x27;d recommend. Also, not really age specific. Some ppl say it&#x27;s more of a motherly scent, but i&#x27;m 24 and i feel it&#x27;s a universal scent. Floral and nice. Not sweet really. Like it overall.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase! One of my all time favorite perfumes. It looked like the original factory seal too.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes!  And I usually find the best deals for my perfumes at Amazon.  This is a beautiful fragrance - light and mild.  I have to be careful not to wear strong, over powering scents as they will give me an instant headache/migraine.  Another amazing fragrance by Jennifer Lopez is JLO Glow.  I really love her fragrances!</li>
