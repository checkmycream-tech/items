            <li>gives her skin a &#x27;feel good&#x27; feeling for the whole day or night and the feeling of renewal.</li>
            <li>The eye cream was what I was most excited about</li>
            <li>I have seen this happen with my older creams and have never had a problem with Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s products before, they are exceptional.  </li>
            <li>I still don´t get why you can get this set so cheap... if you got it in store, you would spend abput 150dlls for the three creams...</li>
            <li>I found this lotion a few years ago and nothing compares, Its is awesome</li>
            <li>and my face looks great as long as I use these products.  </li>
            <li>I saw the price and thought that I&#x27;m lucky to find this brand sold so cheap.</li>
            <li>was shipped on time and item looked exactly as the picture shows...)</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Elizabeth Arden Millennium creams from TJMaxx.</li>
            <li>Seems like the only moisturizer product that works for me, I am over 70 and most age reducing products burn my skin, but not this one</li>
            <li>As a male, I use this product and love all of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried all 3 components of this package.</li>

            <li>very moisturizing and relaxing for skin, my mom loves this product and can really feel the nutrition for her skin.</li>
            <li>so much that I buy it in a three-piece package:</li>
            <li>I was very glad to see comments at Amazon and several other websites around the Internet about men using this cream too.  </li>
            <li>But I was concerned that TJMaxx does not have steady supply and</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>OSG Enterprises was the seller and the products seemed old.  </li>
            <li>I received this set as a early Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>my wife uses Millinium make up and feels that this is by far</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only takes about a day or 2 to see very noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>You can almost feel your skin taking a big drink, and it makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>Not a very good deal to pay for both the original and return shipping.</li>
            <li>I am in my sixty&#x27;s and so far the only product that works for me.</li>

            <li> I received this facial cream order and determined it was either old or had previously been opened.</li>
            <li> Have been an Liz Arden Millenium fan for a long time.</li>
            <li> The feeling is gives her is above any that she gets from any other make up on the market.</li>
            <li> Plus, to get them from Amazon you only need to pay about half than in the malls.</li>
            <li> Both of the bottles had residue cream that was dried out on the outside of the bottles.</li>
            <li> any other web site.</li>
            <li> one bottle was not well closed and leaked a little bit, but I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I look at least 10 years younger</li>
            <li> so much less than the department store...</li>
            <li> I think the formula has changed from when I previously used the product.  </li>
            <li> The other creams are so thick they won&#x27;t absorb and the extreme perfume smell hurts my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and it was completely dried up.  </li>
            <li> Having Rosacea makes it hard to use a lot of cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> These products are the only reason my face looks as well as it does, otherwise it would look really dry and be awful.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write bad reviews but was so unhappy with these creams</li>
            <li> When I put this stuff on my face it was very thick and not spreadable at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> But the worse was the smell, even my husband noticed and made a comment.</li>
            <li> Day Renewal fragrance has a heavy, and unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Just one bad side :</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I think this is the very best moisturizing cream I have ever tried!  Not just the best from Elizabeth Arden, but the best of any brand I have ever tried!  You can almost feel your skin taking a big drink, and it makes my skin feel so soft! Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> very nice product, my skin loves it and the price is really good ! Just one bad side : one bottle was not well closed and leaked a little bit, but I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> OSG Enterprises was the seller and the products seemed old.  The eye cream was what I was most excited about and it was completely dried up.  The other creams are so thick they won&#x27;t absorb and the extreme perfume smell hurts my eyes.  I have seen this happen with my older creams and have never had a problem with Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s products before, they are exceptional.  This was a one-time purchase of E.A. products from several sellers because of a cheaper price and my trying to save money and I was disappointed.  I&#x27;ll stick to the E.A. website in the future to ensure freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Item was shipped on time and item looked exactly as the picture shows...)</li>
            <li> I love Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Millenium products--the best for mature skin!  The price and quality of this trio is unbeatable.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a early Christmas gift. I absolutely love it.  I can feel and tell a difference in my skin. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I love it.  It does what it promised to do and much more.  I am in my sixty&#x27;s and so far the only product that works for me.</li>
            <li> These skin care products were introduced to me by my daughter-in-law.  Very luxurious.  I think my skin looks better after using them for a year.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Elizabeth Arden Millennium creams from TJMaxx. This is the best facial cream I have ever used! It made my skin visibly smoother. From now on I want to stick to this product. But I was concerned that TJMaxx does not have steady supply and no way I am going to pay the list price on Elizabeth Arden website. Thanks Amazon, I can buy this great product at a great price !</li>
            <li> Product as advertised and arrived very quickly &amp; was very good price! I have used product for years, but never bought at this price</li>
            <li> My wife love this product and Amazon had them cheaper that any other web site. Thank you Amazon you continue to save me money and make my wife happy.</li>
            <li> Love the 8 hour cream!  Cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> I received this facial cream order and determined it was either old or had previously been opened. Both of the bottles had residue cream that was dried out on the outside of the bottles. I was planning to return the product but was asked to pay for the return shipping. Not a very good deal to pay for both the original and return shipping. I will not be ordering this facial cream again!</li>
            <li> Seems like the only moisturizer product that works for me, I am over 70 and most age reducing products burn my skin, but not this one</li>
            <li> They work on your skin really gentlly. Provides comfort and protection.  Plus, to get them from Amazon you only need to pay about half than in the malls.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year and it seems to keep my skin more pliable and reduces wrinkles. Age spots on face seem minimized, but not on hands.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing and relaxing for skin, my mom loves this product and can really feel the nutrition for her skin. gives her skin a &#x27;feel good&#x27; feeling for the whole day or night and the feeling of renewal.</li>
            <li> my wife uses Millinium make up and feels that this is by far the best make up she has ever used and will continue to use it from now on.  The feeling is gives her is above any that she gets from any other make up on the market.</li>
            <li> I was very glad to see comments at Amazon and several other websites around the Internet about men using this cream too.  As a male, I use this product and love all of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s products.  These products are the only reason my face looks as well as it does, otherwise it would look really dry and be awful.  I look at least 10 years younger and my face looks great as long as I use these products.  The Elizabeth Arden Millenium Night Renewal Cream works wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much that I buy it in a three-piece package: Elizabeth Arden Millenium 3 Piece Set - Day Renewal Emulsion (2.5 oz), Night Renewal Cream (1.7 oz), Eye Renewal Cream (0.5 oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes about a day or 2 to see very noticeable results.  To the men out there: nobody will know that you use this, but they will all think you have great skin!</li>
            <li> Excelent service and excelent product! I love to buy with this provider. They always be kind and do good follow up to me</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. I used Elizabeth Arden before and liked the brand. I saw the price and thought that I&#x27;m lucky to find this brand sold so cheap. When I put this stuff on my face it was very thick and not spreadable at all. But the worse was the smell, even my husband noticed and made a comment. This smell was so distracting that I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep at night. I normally don&#x27;t write bad reviews but was so unhappy with these creams so I decided to post it. Anyway I think I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery. Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, the product was received as was described.</li>
            <li> best cream ive ever had</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful....for many years I had to buy it at a well known department store here in town...then found it on line and I couldn&#x27;t be happier...this is a wonderful product and a extremely wonderful buy...I couldn&#x27;t believe the price....so much less than the department store...Hope you get more of these...and please let me know thru e-mail when you do....</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried all 3 components of this package. They are all working for me. Good as moisturizers over day/night. not too oily. No allergy. Safe to use.</li>
            <li> Fast as lighten delivery! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Have been an Liz Arden Millenium fan for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product. SAM&#x27;s Club used to sell it. The product arrived quickly so I was happy to see this trio available online at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I still don´t get why you can get this set so cheap... if you got it in store, you would spend abput 150dlls for the three creams... vs 50 here... why??? they seem good, they smell good, but...??????</li>
            <li> I think the formula has changed from when I previously used the product.  Day Renewal fragrance has a heavy, and unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> not the best product by Elisabeth Arden for sure, light texture, not for my skin</li>
            <li> Have used Millenium for Thirty Years because it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my Rosacea. Having Rosacea makes it hard to use a lot of cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> This 3 piece set is really great. This was a gift to my mom and She Love it! Shipping on time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I found this lotion a few years ago and nothing compares, Its is awesome the entire Millenium set is ideal!</li>
