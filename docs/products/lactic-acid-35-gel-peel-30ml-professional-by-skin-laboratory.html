    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The greatest thing I ever did was I did not apply to my neck, I applied in my arms.</li>
            <li>The peeling is perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent place to start</li>
            <li>For a while things were great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Lactic Acid is great as a weekly exfoliate.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome exfoliant to just brighten up your skin quick!</li>
            <li>Once all the scarring is gone, I will do weekly lactic acid peels to keep my face bright.</li>
            <li>Good to use  helps with age or problem skin</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s my biology, good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is a wonderful mild peel.      </li>
            <li>I understandwanting perfect skin right overnight, but whatever issues or damage you are dealing with didn&#x27;t happen overnight</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better!</li>
            <li>This is a quality product that comes with very detailed instructions on what to do (and what not to do) to ensure good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing these about every 2 weeks or so for over a year, and my skin is amazing.  </li>
            <li>kind of skin).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I read about Lactic Acid being more effective for hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to do this at home.</li>
            <li>Then patted on some baking soda, at which my point my skin hollered in protest, and I immediately doused my face with cool water for a good minute.</li>
            <li>God knows how much more you will have to spend to fix the issues this stuff creates.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that those are much diminished.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather be safe than scarred, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use this peel 2 more times, waiting 10-14 days between treatments and increasing the application time up to the suggested 8 min.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much better.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do it more than once a week because your skin hasn&#x27;t had a chance to heal yet.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product  </li>
            <li>It helped rid most of my acne and my skin looks and feels smoother.  </li>
            <li>Would it be safe to use this product under the eye to reduces wrinkles?</li>
            <li>Of all the chemical peels I have purchased, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, reliable honest company.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mid 40&#x27;s, very fair</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t peeling or experiencing redness and my skin clearly wasn&#x27;t rejecting the product, which is GREAT sign.</li>
            <li>The peel is in gel form, and application is easy with either a synthetic brush or cotton pad.  </li>
            <li>I experienced absolutely no frosting of any kind.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very mild gel peel, smooths skin.  </li>
            <li>While I have been doing my own acid peels on and off for some time, this is my first time trying a lactic-only peel.  </li>
            <li>Seems fine.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it stings more, and I can guess how higher acidic concentrations might scar, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product, thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>I experienced minimal peeling on the sides of my nose about three days after doing the peel.  </li>
            <li>Too mild..</li>
            <li>Being that I&#x27;m going the \\&quot;at home\\&quot; route now AND have skin issues, I opted for this light 35% version first.</li>
            <li>By the time I wake up, my face is better than normal.  </li>
            <li>I also had the very beginning of fine lines along either side of my mouth</li>
            <li>This kind of peel could be good for those with sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m pretty average</li>
            <li>Love this product, light enough to use once a week with immediate results&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looked brighter right away.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li>I probably could have taken the \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; factor into account and started with a higher concentration, but I&#x27;m glad I started here.</li>
            <li>(great products if you have dry uber sensitive skin)  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first treatment with this</li>
            <li>Be consistent, be careful, and be kind to yourself and your skin.</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li>I noticed the skin around my face got redder and left more scabs.</li>
            <li>The first peeling went well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really see a diff but who knows!</li>
            <li>I expect it will only get better.</li>
            <li>Medicine - meh, not so much luck, barely worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 light peels over the past decade (at a spa) and both had nice results.</li>
            <li>things I wish I knew the first time I used this:&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first 1 lasted a month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mission to clear up adult acne and improve my complexion and reduce some fine lines.</li>
            <li>Next morning I woke up and didn&#x27;t notice much change, skin felt fine.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced little discomfort while it was on my face, and then only at the sides of my nose.  </li>
            <li>My husband noticed and wants to try it himself.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY</li>
            <li>WORKS AND IS GENTLE.</li>
            <li>This serum is very tingly when you apply it, but leaves the skin feeling much clearer and softer.  </li>
            <li>(Yeah, I get the whole &#x27;acid neutralizer&#x27; logic but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me - won&#x27;t ever use it again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the baking soda to neutralize as suggested, just gently cleanse with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-A fan brush will make application SO much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didnt really sting much when it was on.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help me much..</li>
            <li>It was the first time I was able to get rid of the dead skin without using a scrub (and consequential rashes).&lt;br /&gt;So, being the baby that I am, I went looking for a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; lactic acid peel and found this one.</li>
            <li>the direction say to.&lt;br /&gt;it leaves your face red for a few days, this will pass to a nice smooth clear complexetion.&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you use tretinoin (retin a), the area will burn a little more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking the results so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m currently testing out acne patches - have had some success, you can read my reviews for details.</li>
            <li>Despite my fears about my skin being too sensitive for a peel, I believe the opposite is true.</li>
            <li>and I saw an overall improvement in brightness and tone right away.  </li>
            <li>I experienced some extremely mild tingling on some parts of my face during the Lactic peel, followed my moderate flakiness a few days later - as was expected.  </li>
            <li>I have had minimal purging, and while the hyperpigmentation is still there, my skin overall is more luminous.  </li>
            <li>I love lactic peels because they generally don&#x27;t cause you to peel or have down time where you don&#x27;t want to show your face to the world.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty gentle on my face because it barely made it red.</li>
            <li>Let me start of by saying that my skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t tolerate very much -- and I&#x27;m a total baby when it comes to trying new products.</li>
            <li>Never left it on for more than 30 seconds, and I went through one bottle previously.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect one&#x27;s problems to be solved instantly while still being gentle.  </li>
            <li>I had some extremely minor stinging and itching the first time, but no discomfort</li>
            <li>I HAVE A LIGHT CASE OF MELASMA AND UNEVEN SKIN TONE.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT HARSH</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and look forward to continuing.</li>
            <li>But after having a professional lactic acid peel at a spa, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>The company offers instructions on how to use it.  </li>
            <li>, have some sun damage, average pores, oily T-zone, and am allergic to everything (e.g. the \\&quot;super sensitive skin which breaks out in mini-blisters the moment it doesn&#x27;t like something</li>
            <li>I have some hyperpigmentation from past blemishes and hormonal birth control and the beginning of fine lines around my mouth.      </li>
            <li>but then I started noticing that my face was looking older, and i&#x27;m only 20.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 2 minutes the first time, and five minutes the second time.  </li>
            <li>I abstained from using retinol cream and my clarisonic mia for 24 hours, used alcohol on a cotton ball to prep, poured just over a quarter size into a glass custard dish, applied quickly with a 1 1/2&amp;#34; flat taklon art brush I use for applying facials and rinsed with lots of water, patted dry and applied Philip Thomas Roth sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Gently patted skin dry and applied some Cetaphil sensitive skin face lotion (since it was night time</li>
            <li>I tried to go the cheap route buying this and actually wasted my money!</li>
            <li>an extra layer of moisture than you normally would.&lt;br /&gt;-PATCH TEST.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very familiar with Lactic Acid and this one is NO GOOD.</li>
            <li>I always soap and clean my face then apply a small amount onto my face, wait a minute, wash off, and re soap my face.</li>
            <li>Before now I&#x27;ve been using a different, very reputable, company but they are expensive.</li>
            <li>I never have to wear makeup and barely any oil areas on my face throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I barely had any dryness when using it.</li>
            <li>This is strong medicine, and has the potential to seriously screw up your skin if you leave them on too long, you apply too often and don&#x27;t give your skin a chance to recover between peels, or you begin with a too high concentration.  </li>
            <li>I have now spent over 40 hours on various websites (incl Amazon) researching peels and zit treatments until my eyeball are ready to pop.</li>
            <li>Right after, my face is pink/red, but only for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I barely felt any tingling when it was on, and afterwards, while my skin felt a tiny bit smoother, it wasn&#x27;t the result I was looking for.</li>
            <li>first few times you do this, do NOT leave on for longer than like 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is dry, but also acne prone.  </li>

            <li> Never left it on for more than 30 seconds, and I went through one bottle previously.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect one&#x27;s problems to be solved instantly while still being gentle.  </li>
            <li> I had some extremely minor stinging and itching the first time, but no discomfort</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LIGHT CASE OF MELASMA AND UNEVEN SKIN TONE.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT HARSH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and look forward to continuing.</li>

            <li> I have some hyperpigmentation from past blemishes and hormonal birth control and the beginning of fine lines around my mouth.      </li>
            <li> but then I started noticing that my face was looking older, and i&#x27;m only 20.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 2 minutes the first time, and five minutes the second time.  </li>
            <li> I abstained from using retinol cream and my clarisonic mia for 24 hours, used alcohol on a cotton ball to prep, poured just over a quarter size into a glass custard dish, applied quickly with a 1 1/2&amp;#34; flat taklon art brush I use for applying facials and rinsed with lots of water, patted dry and applied Philip Thomas Roth sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Gently patted skin dry and applied some Cetaphil sensitive skin face lotion (since it was night time</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very familiar with Lactic Acid and this one is NO GOOD.</li>
            <li> I always soap and clean my face then apply a small amount onto my face, wait a minute, wash off, and re soap my face.</li>
            <li> Before now I&#x27;ve been using a different, very reputable, company but they are expensive.</li>
            <li> I never have to wear makeup and barely any oil areas on my face throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I barely had any dryness when using it.</li>
            <li> This is strong medicine, and has the potential to seriously screw up your skin if you leave them on too long, you apply too often and don&#x27;t give your skin a chance to recover between peels, or you begin with a too high concentration.  </li>
            <li> I have now spent over 40 hours on various websites (incl Amazon) researching peels and zit treatments until my eyeball are ready to pop.</li>
            <li> Right after, my face is pink/red, but only for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I barely felt any tingling when it was on, and afterwards, while my skin felt a tiny bit smoother, it wasn&#x27;t the result I was looking for.</li>

            <li> almost all the acne that was in a \\&quot;clearing up\\&quot; stage (which can last for WEEKS, unfortunately) looked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingling sensation when you apply it -- however, it&#x27;s neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I saw less improvement this time than the time I got done in a professional salon three weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have bought other items from this same company.</li>

            <li> I will recomended to people with dry skin.</li>

            <li> I have a little bit of scarring left, and I will remove that with a TCA 30% peel.</li>
            <li> So Forehead is the least sensitive part on my face.</li>
            <li> I plan to get the stage 2 50% lactic acid peel after I am done with this, which will probably be a few months as even the smallest bottle is plenty for several peels.  </li>

            <li> Some tingle, but still not much.</li>
            <li> I had minimal breakouts and oily skin before using it.</li>
            <li> Before I apply the peel I cleanse with Cetaphil and wait about a half hour until my skin is bone dry.  </li>
            <li> If you have issue on your face or other places visible, please help yourself and do not apply this.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other creams and leave it on all day.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Good to use  helps with age or problem skin</li>
            <li> While I have been doing my own acid peels on and off for some time, this is my first time trying a lactic-only peel.  I went with the lower strength (35%) and I&#x27;m using it immediately following their Salicylic Acid (20%) peel.  I&#x27;m really liking the results so far. I experienced some extremely mild tingling on some parts of my face during the Lactic peel, followed my moderate flakiness a few days later - as was expected.  My skin looked brighter right away.  This is a quality product that comes with very detailed instructions on what to do (and what not to do) to ensure good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Lactic Acid from skin labratory for a couple months now (also the  Salicylic Acid 20%) . For a while things were great but then I started noticing that my face was looking older, and i&#x27;m only 20. I used it to try and get rid of some existing acne scars. I used it once a week, and since I&#x27;ve stopped my skin looks a lot healthier. Never left it on for more than 30 seconds, and I went through one bottle previously. The second batch may have just been bad I&#x27;m not sure, but it burned the hell out of my skin left it red and blotchy for hours. So for now i&#x27;ll be sticking to my regular face wash, toner, and moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> I had some problem with dark pigmentation on my neck due to improper care and sun damage. So, I bought Salicylic acid 30%, which worked charms and seen result. It solved 95% of my issue. Then I read about Lactic Acid being more effective for hyperpigmentation. I thought it would not hurt to give it a try. I followed every single instruction, the pre-application and post-application procedure. The greatest thing I ever did was I did not apply to my neck, I applied in my arms. After one day, I saw that the area which was regular color with my skin has darkened. I did not judge this because I know some stuff takes time to show effects. But I stopped using it as well. After 3 weeks, it has not faded, I still have that dark mark due to applying this. I am going to use Salicylic acid again and stop the use of this.    If you have issue on your face or other places visible, please help yourself and do not apply this. You will be embarrassed to go out for the next month or so. God knows how much more you will have to spend to fix the issues this stuff creates. Hope this helps someone and prevents the problem that I am facing.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have purchased before and will buy from this company again. I have bought other items from this same company. Quick shipping, reliable honest company. Thank You.</li>
            <li> A little stinging and not much in the way of results.  Used only on my hands however (spotted from driving).  35% sounds like a lot but feel it&#x27;s much less (as described in other reviews.)</li>
            <li> I just finished my first treatment with this and I found it too weak for my liking. I barely felt any tingling when it was on, and afterwards, while my skin felt a tiny bit smoother, it wasn&#x27;t the result I was looking for. This kind of peel could be good for those with sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m pretty average and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the 35% Lactic Acid peel.  I have sensitive skin that is dry, but also acne prone.  I have some hyperpigmentation from past blemishes and hormonal birth control and the beginning of fine lines around my mouth.      I have used this product twice, once a week for the past two weeks.  I follow the acne.org method, but the night before and the day of the peel I give it a break so my skin doesn&#x27;t get too dry.  Before I apply the peel I cleanse with Cetaphil and wait about a half hour until my skin is bone dry.  The peel is in gel form, and application is easy with either a synthetic brush or cotton pad.  I have experienced little discomfort while it was on my face, and then only at the sides of my nose.  I left it on for 2 minutes the first time, and five minutes the second time.  I experienced absolutely no frosting of any kind.  I neutralize with a baking soda paste after rinsing with copious amounts of water, and follow with a thick layer of Vanicream, and once that is absorbed I put on a layer of Vanicream SPF 60,  (great products if you have dry uber sensitive skin)  I experienced minimal peeling on the sides of my nose about three days after doing the peel.  I have had minimal purging, and while the hyperpigmentation is still there, my skin overall is more luminous.  I also had the very beginning of fine lines along either side of my mouth and I&#x27;m happy to say that those are much diminished.  In my opinion this is a wonderful mild peel.      I plan to get the stage 2 50% lactic acid peel after I am done with this, which will probably be a few months as even the smallest bottle is plenty for several peels.  I encourage anyone looking into at home peels to read read read about them and use your head.  This is strong medicine, and has the potential to seriously screw up your skin if you leave them on too long, you apply too often and don&#x27;t give your skin a chance to recover between peels, or you begin with a too high concentration.  I understandwanting perfect skin right overnight, but whatever issues or damage you are dealing with didn&#x27;t happen overnight and I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect one&#x27;s problems to be solved instantly while still being gentle.  It&#x27;s a slow process and that bites, but your skin will not improve by being rough with it.  Be consistent, be careful, and be kind to yourself and your skin.</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> Not effective needed a higher concentration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to do this at home. Easy-to-follow instructions, quality product. I noticed results almost immediately.  I had some extremely minor stinging and itching the first time, but no discomfort so I waited five days and went six minutes the second time around.  I abstained from using retinol cream and my clarisonic mia for 24 hours, used alcohol on a cotton ball to prep, poured just over a quarter size into a glass custard dish, applied quickly with a 1 1/2&amp;#34; flat taklon art brush I use for applying facials and rinsed with lots of water, patted dry and applied Philip Thomas Roth sunscreen.  I waited about 12 hours before applying any makeup and then just a beauty balm, mascara and gloss.  No redness or irritation and I saw an overall improvement in brightness and tone right away.  My husband noticed and wants to try it himself.</li>
            <li> So Forehead is the least sensitive part on my face. I put almost the same amount all over my face. I noticed the skin around my face got redder and left more scabs. I am thinking about put two layers on my forehead to even out the skin tone. My forehead is a lot darker than the rest of my face. The first peeling went well. I saw less improvement this time than the time I got done in a professional salon three weeks ago. I will see if my skin evens out after 6 times with two weeks of interval.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LIGHT CASE OF MELASMA AND UNEVEN SKIN TONE.  THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS AND IS GENTLE. I USED THE 35% STRENGTH. IT&#x27;S NOT HARSH AT ALL. NOTICE DIFF. RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick but it&#x27;s addictive because one week later I have to do it again to keep my acne away. But I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s my biology, good product.</li>
            <li> Not for the feint of heart, but if you follow the instructions very carefully, the value here is in the number of treatments you can provide yourself for a fraction of the salon cost.  Thank you, Skin Laboratory and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Seems fine.  I mix it with other creams and leave it on all day.  Can&#x27;t really see a diff but who knows!</li>
            <li> Love this product, light enough to use once a week with immediate results&lt;br /&gt;LE*</li>
            <li> Good product. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it has improved my scars. I expect it will only get better. Its pretty gentle on my face because it barely made it red.</li>
            <li> this product works for me.  be carefull, start slowly just like the direction say to.&lt;br /&gt;it leaves your face red for a few days, this will pass to a nice smooth clear complexetion.&lt;br /&gt;you need to be patient.  it&#x27;s takes a few application</li>
            <li> This serum is very tingly when you apply it, but leaves the skin feeling much clearer and softer.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and look forward to continuing.</li>
            <li> As a licensed esthetician I 100% stand behind this.  Just about anyone can use this.  It is considered a rather &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; peel probably the safest route to go.  I love lactic peels because they generally don&#x27;t cause you to peel or have down time where you don&#x27;t want to show your face to the world.  This is an awesome exfoliant to just brighten up your skin quick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mission to clear up adult acne and improve my complexion and reduce some fine lines. I have now spent over 40 hours on various websites (incl Amazon) researching peels and zit treatments until my eyeball are ready to pop. I&#x27;m mid 40&#x27;s, very fair, have some sun damage, average pores, oily T-zone, and am allergic to everything (e.g. the \\&quot;super sensitive skin which breaks out in mini-blisters the moment it doesn&#x27;t like something so have to take daily allergy meds\\&quot; kind of skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently testing out acne patches - have had some success, you can read my reviews for details. Medicine - meh, not so much luck, barely worth mentioning. I&#x27;m now onto chemical peels. I&#x27;ve had 2 light peels over the past decade (at a spa) and both had nice results. Being that I&#x27;m going the \\&quot;at home\\&quot; route now AND have skin issues, I opted for this light 35% version first. I&#x27;d rather be safe than scarred, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First peel: I followed the directions...cleansed skin, wiped with alchol as a &#x27;toner&#x27;, got out the baking soda, settled in next to the sink, applied peel with q-tip, and set the timer for 1 min.  (BTW, yes, I did the recommended patch tests! Hated to wait but again, better safe than sorry!) Skin tingled a bit but not much, no redness, so left on an additional 30 sec. Then patted on some baking soda, at which my point my skin hollered in protest, and I immediately doused my face with cool water for a good minute. (Yeah, I get the whole &#x27;acid neutralizer&#x27; logic but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me - won&#x27;t ever use it again. No worries, the water was sufficient.) Gently patted skin dry and applied some Cetaphil sensitive skin face lotion (since it was night time and I have issues with sunscreen, I didn&#x27;t apply any). So far so good! Next morning I woke up and didn&#x27;t notice much change, skin felt fine.  Regardless, I applied my sensitive skin Oil of Olay 15 SPF lotion very heavily before my SPF 30 makeup. And waited for a miracle, or at least for someone to notice...HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days, no real change. HOWEVER...almost all the acne that was in a \\&quot;clearing up\\&quot; stage (which can last for WEEKS, unfortunately) looked better than I expected. So that was a little heartening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second peel: 5 days later. I know you&#x27;re supposed to wait a week but I wasn&#x27;t peeling or experiencing redness and my skin clearly wasn&#x27;t rejecting the product, which is GREAT sign. Same process, except I bought a toner to use instead of alcohol, used a cotton pad instead of a q-tip, didn&#x27;t use baking soda, and left the peel on for 4 minutes. Some tingle, but still not much. It&#x27;s now 24 hours later.  Results: no reduction in age spots, but softer and I dare say a wee bit brighter skin, and improved acne healing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Despite my fears about my skin being too sensitive for a peel, I believe the opposite is true. I probably could have taken the \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; factor into account and started with a higher concentration, but I&#x27;m glad I started here. I&#x27;m going to use this peel 2 more times, waiting 10-14 days between treatments and increasing the application time up to the suggested 8 min. If I see increased healing and other improvements, no matter how small, I&#x27;m going to order the 50% concentration. If my acne gets worse, I&#x27;m going to switch to a Salicylic acid peel and give that a few months.  Either way, I&#x27;ll continue to post reviews in hopes that other like-minded ladies can benefit from my experience and verbosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you&#x27;re like me and frustrated by instructions that say \\&quot;don&#x27;t apply to active volcano zits\\&quot; because there is no such moment in time when you do NOT have eruptions, let me just say that I compromised by trying to cover such spots as lightly as possible. Yeah, it stings more, and I can guess how higher acidic concentrations might scar, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I think that might be an age thing, though... sorry, all you PYTs out there. :)</li>
            <li> The peeling is perfect. I like it. My skin is so much better. I will recomended to people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Let me start of by saying that my skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t tolerate very much -- and I&#x27;m a total baby when it comes to trying new products. But after having a professional lactic acid peel at a spa, I was intrigued. It was the first time I was able to get rid of the dead skin without using a scrub (and consequential rashes).&lt;br /&gt;So, being the baby that I am, I went looking for a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; lactic acid peel and found this one. It&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t use the baking soda to neutralize as suggested, just gently cleanse with lukewarm water. My skin looks and feels so much better! There is a slight tingling sensation when you apply it -- however, it&#x27;s neither pleasant nor unpleasant. You might notice initial redness, but that goes away after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Some things I wish I knew the first time I used this:&lt;br /&gt;-A fan brush will make application SO much easier.&lt;br /&gt;-Put vaseline/petroleum jelly/beeswax on lips, under eyes, or any other sensitive places that you DON&#x27;T want to be peeled.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply once a week-ish. Don&#x27;t do it more than once a week because your skin hasn&#x27;t had a chance to heal yet.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply an extra layer of moisture than you normally would.&lt;br /&gt;-PATCH TEST. JUST DO IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very familiar with Lactic Acid and this one is NO GOOD. Before now I&#x27;ve been using a different, very reputable, company but they are expensive. So I tried this one hoping to save some money because it is about half the cost. There is no comparison in the two products and I&#x27;m not sure this is the \\&quot;real-deal\\&quot;. There is no way to verify what is actually in this liquid, just have to trust that the company is selling what they claim to be selling, and I am not convinced.  After using this product one time I thru it away. I tried to go the cheap route buying this and actually wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product  It helped rid most of my acne and my skin looks and feels smoother.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions that some people recommend in their reviews on here. This is a serious chemical peel, even if it is an &amp;#34;introductory&amp;#34; lactic acid peel. Im not sure if you wash it off well that you really need to neutralize with baking soda, but I did anyway. It didnt really sting much when it was on. I had some peeling a few days after, my skin just seems healthier but not much lghteneing of scars yet.</li>
            <li> Would it be safe to use this product under the eye to reduces wrinkles? Please anyone with experience let me know, please and thank you, I dont know what to rate so I will give it a four for now</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me, made my face break out and I am still almost a year later trying to get rid of the acne scars cause by it.  they must have been deep acne!</li>
            <li> Of all the chemical peels I have purchased, this is my favorite. It prevents breakouts and it brightens my face.  I have a little bit of scarring left, and I will remove that with a TCA 30% peel. Once all the scarring is gone, I will do weekly lactic acid peels to keep my face bright. There is no downtime at all! I wear this before I sleep. Right after, my face is pink/red, but only for a few hours. By the time I wake up, my face is better than normal.  If you use tretinoin (retin a), the area will burn a little more. So to avoid this, don&#x27;t use tretinoin for a few days to a week. I love this product, thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  You do need to do your research before buying it, as different acid peels work for different purposes.  I&#x27;ve been doing these about every 2 weeks or so for over a year, and my skin is amazing.  Helps with the occasional acne, and definitely makes the pores look smaller and evens out skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times you do this, do NOT leave on for longer than like 10 seconds.  Then gradually build up from there.</li>
            <li> Bought it for acne scars.. Didn&#x27;t help me much.. Too mild.. No visible peeling</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this. I had minimal breakouts and oily skin before using it. I use it every week in the shower and it helps a lot. I never have to wear makeup and barely any oil areas on my face throughout the day. I will be purchasing my 2nd bottle. The first 1 lasted a month +. I always soap and clean my face then apply a small amount onto my face, wait a minute, wash off, and re soap my face. It makes my face feel clean. I barely had any dryness when using it. Love the product.</li>
            <li> Works as directed.  Use the artist brush as it spreads the product evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very mild gel peel, smooths skin.  No down time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a spot remover like I am probably a glycolic peel would be the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lactic Acid is great as a weekly exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Excellent place to start, product is what it says it is, and for those who know the benefits of lactic acid, it works!  The company offers instructions on how to use it.  Would always trust and buy again from Skin Lab</li>
