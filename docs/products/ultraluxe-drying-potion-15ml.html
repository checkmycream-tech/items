            <li>I happy</li>
            <li>And it smells great too.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I have used over the counter products, proactive, origins, Aveda and many others - this is the best of them all.</li>
            <li>This is NOT Sonya Dakar&#x27;s famed (and beloved, award-winning) Drying Potion.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff EVER for quick fixes... GET IT</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this product and for such a great price!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great service!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love!</li>
            <li>Yes, it uses more than just applying at night, but for me, this is what has worked.  </li>
            <li>You cannot wear it during the day because of the white coloring, but it is perfect for overnight use.</li>
            <li>Maybe it depends on your skintype, but this worked SO much better for me than the Mario Badescu one.  </li>
            <li>It does not work 100% of the time, but it&#x27;s so much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li>It works fast and it is a great product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work overnight, but my problem areas have gotten much better.</li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love using it</li>
            <li>love it and its lavender scent.</li>
            <li>Since the break-up of Sonya and her family, dividing up the business, Sonya has come up with another drying lotion, but it is not as effective as the original.  </li>
            <li>The product is still pretty effective though.</li>
            <li>But overall, it works great.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sonya Dakar for making such great products!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overdrying, washes off easily in the a.m., and it works quickly.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just the blemish which is great</li>
            <li>No worth the money,, I really thought that this was a good product because of all of the good review.</li>
            <li>Dries pimples quick.</li>
            <li>It DOES reduce some redness, and decreases the pain of them a bit, but it&#x27;s more effective on the typical pimple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that I can honestly say has worked for me.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it dries out very quickly, which is a huge drawback given how costly it is.</li>
            <li>This potion leaves a huge white mark on your face, kind of like whiteout, so it is definitely only for use at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a knockoff, but after doing some research, it appears that Sonya Dakar has changed names.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well to get rid of pimples.</li>
            <li>It was not made clear in the description that this is a similar product to the original cult favorite &amp;#34;drying potion,&amp;#34; but no longer produced by Sonya Dakar.</li>
            <li>Has a nice slightly tingly feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to think about this product when I first got</li>
            <li>Love this spot treatment for blemishes that won&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried a Q-tip with this product and it seems like it absorbs too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned this works really well.  </li>
            <li>This drying potion really works.  </li>
            <li>This drying potion really works.</li>
            <li>I only don&#x27;t like that I can&#x27;t find a brick &amp; mortar store it&#x27;s sold in, and it&#x27;s costly; but worth it for me!</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep the lid on tight, because it dries really fast, just like it does on your face.     </li>
            <li>This is my go-to for all new pimples!</li>
            <li>it works better, faster and costs less</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>but I just get a new one.</li>
            <li>This is an imitation as the original is no longer being produced.</li>
            <li>I compared the new bottle directly to my old one.</li>
            <li>A word of caution: if you happen to pick at it and make it somewhat of an open wound (like if you accidentally scratch off some skin or something so that it makes a little scab), DO NOT put the Drying Potion on top of it.</li>
            <li>My friend&#x27;s old salon was selling it for $25 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I know that there are mixed reviews for this product, but it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I use it to clear up a blemish by putting it directly on the spot and leaving it on overnight.</li>
            <li>I contacted Dakar directly via their website and toll-free number.</li>
            <li>My daughter had a little bit of a breakout right after this product arrived, and it helped clear up some pimples really well.  </li>
            <li>Not sure I would buy this again solely because of the bottle and the possibility of breeding more bacteria after putting the item on the face and back in the bottle.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry up too fast on</li>
            <li>Usually, the blemish is gone or significantly reduced by the morning.</li>
            <li>Yes, it dries white and it does flake and/or rub off, but it does not come completely off till you wash.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Ultraluxe&amp;#34; formula is watery and does not work the same as the old.</li>
            <li>The price is high but it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money, you have a better chance buying clearsil for half the price!</li>
            <li>As other posts state, it DOES flake off when you sleep, particularly if you&#x27;re lying on the side of your face that it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>The pimples that are much deeper than just the typical surface ones, well it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well.  </li>

            <li> just my opinion) would not buy again, expensive for a small bottle, and not that effective for moderate/severe acne</li>
            <li> It does have a tendency to dry in the bottle</li>
            <li> I can not live without it</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take very long to see results!</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not an all-over product, but it usually works wonders for individual zits.</li>
            <li> The product is supposed to be the same, but it seems to have a slightly thinner consistency.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled that the seller didn&#x27;t clearly indicate the changes to the product.</li>
            <li> It seems this is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed as I&#x27;ve used the original Drying Potion for around 10 years, going through countless bottles.</li>
            <li> My one complaint about this purchase was that although it was wrapped in bubble wrap, the lid was partially opened and about a third of the product had leaked out.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was told the Dakars divorced and when the marriage and business dissolved, so did the rights to make certain products (ie: Drying Potion).</li>
            <li> Overall, I have clear skin, but when I do get a pimple, it tends to be that one enormous, painful spot that causes people to stop and stare.  </li>
            <li> But this didn&#x27;t work for me especially because I get the deep, red, painful pimples.</li>
            <li> Keep the cap on tight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that adding a few drops of water to the bottle fixes the dryness temporarily.</li>
            <li> however it dries out quickly and its a rather small bottle :(</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I gave it a try, and it works like a charm on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonder cream in a small jar!</li>
            <li> Especially if they&#x27;re painful.</li>
            <li> It makes the scabbing worse.</li>
            <li> This product got every pimple worse than ever, they got purple..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, didn&#x27;t do a thing for her.  </li>
            <li> It smells awful, but at the end of the day, you wash and put this on your face, a lot less acne.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bad to pop zits, but some of them just have to be popped.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: (</li>
            <li> Always searching for something to help with the annoying cystic acne outbreaks.  </li>

            <li> This potion leaves a huge white mark on your face, kind of like whiteout, so it is definitely only for use at bedtime.  That being said, this does work well.  My daughter had a little bit of a breakout right after this product arrived, and it helped clear up some pimples really well.  My only concern is that you use the wand and put it back in the container.  I just wonder about bacteria returning to the potion.  I prefer tubes and using cotton balls or Q-tips or something.  I tried a Q-tip with this product and it seems like it absorbs too much of the product.  Not sure I would buy this again solely because of the bottle and the possibility of breeding more bacteria after putting the item on the face and back in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have clear skin, but when I do get a pimple, it tends to be that one enormous, painful spot that causes people to stop and stare.  I keep this on hand for those occasions.  As other posts state, it DOES flake off when you sleep, particularly if you&#x27;re lying on the side of your face that it&#x27;s on.  I combat this by using it during the day.  If I can stay home, that&#x27;s great.  If not, I use it while I&#x27;m home, wash it off when I need to leave, and reapply when I get back.  Yes, it uses more than just applying at night, but for me, this is what has worked.  And overall, it lasts forever, since I don&#x27;t need it that often.    It reduces the redness and the size of almost ever pimple I&#x27;ve ever had.  The pimples that are much deeper than just the typical surface ones, well it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well.  It DOES reduce some redness, and decreases the pain of them a bit, but it&#x27;s more effective on the typical pimple.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t buy the Sonya Dakar drying potion from Amazon.com but I bought it from another place and wanted to share my experiences about this product)    Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me. If you have the occasional pimple than it may work for you. But this didn&#x27;t work for me especially because I get the deep, red, painful pimples. Yes it did tingle when I put it on but that was it and it didn&#x27;t reduce the size or redness for me. Also when this product dries it flakes so I don&#x27;t know how it will stay on your face overnight.     Bottom line: (just my opinion) would not buy again, expensive for a small bottle, and not that effective for moderate/severe acne</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to think about this product when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it every night and it didn&#x27;t take very long to see results!</li>
            <li> Sonya Dakar Drying Potion works great for spot treatment. Obviously it&#x27;s not an all-over product, but it usually works wonders for individual zits. Even big ones. It can take more than one night of using it for really stubborn zits, like the big painful ones, but it speeds the process along and definitely helps. I&#x27;ve noticed that it brings under-the-skin ones to a head. I know, I know...it&#x27;s bad to pop zits, but some of them just have to be popped. Especially if they&#x27;re painful. So it brings it up to the surface so that you can. Or you can just not touch it, and use the potion again that night. A word of caution: if you happen to pick at it and make it somewhat of an open wound (like if you accidentally scratch off some skin or something so that it makes a little scab), DO NOT put the Drying Potion on top of it. It makes the scabbing worse. I made that mistake. But overall, it works great. Make sure you keep the lid on tight, because it dries really fast, just like it does on your face.     I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a little bit goes a long way. Also, it&#x27;s cheaper here than it is in salons, if you happen to find one that carries it. My friend&#x27;s old salon was selling it for $25 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I know that there are mixed reviews for this product, but it works very well for me. I use it to clear up a blemish by putting it directly on the spot and leaving it on overnight. Usually, the blemish is gone or significantly reduced by the morning. I definitely recommend it for spot-treatment!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! I tried everything on the market for blemishes and this potion is a miracle. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Read about this in a celebrity interview. Frustrated, I gave it a try, and it works like a charm on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This did nothing.  Try Origins Spot Remover - it works better, faster and costs less</li>
            <li> did not wake up and see any difference. it also flakes when it dries. don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about?! don&#x27;t waste your money, you have a better chance buying clearsil for half the price!</li>
            <li> This product will definitely at the very least, reduce your blemish significantly overnight. You cannot wear it during the day because of the white coloring, but it is perfect for overnight use. I have used over the counter products, proactive, origins, Aveda and many others - this is the best of them all.</li>
            <li> Maybe it depends on your skintype, but this worked SO much better for me than the Mario Badescu one.  It&#x27;s not overdrying, washes off easily in the a.m., and it works quickly.  I only don&#x27;t like that I can&#x27;t find a brick &amp; mortar store it&#x27;s sold in, and it&#x27;s costly; but worth it for me!</li>
            <li> Works great for cystic acne!</li>
            <li> Love this spot treatment for blemishes that won&#x27;t dry your skin.  Reasonably priced too. Great for stubborn cyst like pimples.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It does not work 100% of the time, but it&#x27;s so much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. With this I can actually see that it makes a difference. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that I can honestly say has worked for me. Yes, it dries white and it does flake and/or rub off, but it does not come completely off till you wash. It does not stain pillowcases or clothes either. You can&#x27;t even see it on your pillowcase in the morning.</li>
            <li> Dries those nasty buggers off.</li>
            <li> Must have it.... I can not live without it</li>
            <li> Since the break-up of Sonya and her family, dividing up the business, Sonya has come up with another drying lotion, but it is not as effective as the original.  It seems this is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using this drying potion for years on the occasional breakout. It works fast and it is a great product. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My daughter has dealt with acne since last May.  Someone mentioned this works really well.  Unfortunately, didn&#x27;t do a thing for her.  When in doubt, don&#x27;t just try OTC remedies, go to the doctor.  He prescribed a cream that has worked wonders!!!</li>
            <li> No worth the money,, I really thought that this was a good product because of all of the good review. This product got every pimple worse than ever, they got purple.. Don&#x27;t get trick this won&#x27;t cure a pimple over night</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I had used it before and it worked well.  My one complaint about this purchase was that although it was wrapped in bubble wrap, the lid was partially opened and about a third of the product had leaked out.</li>
            <li> I ordered Sonya Dakar Drying Potion, which was what the product listing and photo and indicated, and instead received a similar product called Ultraluxe Drying Potion. At first I thought it was a knockoff, but after doing some research, it appears that Sonya Dakar has changed names. The product is supposed to be the same, but it seems to have a slightly thinner consistency. Not thrilled that the seller didn&#x27;t clearly indicate the changes to the product. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Always searching for something to help with the annoying cystic acne outbreaks.  I never do these review things but want to say to anyone like me who draws the short straw in the skin dept.  this stuff helps!! Keep the cap on tight so it doesn&#x27;t dry up too fast on yeah !</li>
            <li> This is NOT Sonya Dakar&#x27;s famed (and beloved, award-winning) Drying Potion. This is an imitation as the original is no longer being produced. I contacted Dakar directly via their website and toll-free number. Sadly, I was told the Dakars divorced and when the marriage and business dissolved, so did the rights to make certain products (ie: Drying Potion). Don&#x27;t let the blue bottle fool you. It has another name printed on the blue bottle, &amp;#34;Ultraluxe,&amp;#34; and is manufactured in a different city. I compared the new bottle directly to my old one. The &amp;#34;Ultraluxe&amp;#34; formula is watery and does not work the same as the old. I&#x27;m so disappointed as I&#x27;ve used the original Drying Potion for around 10 years, going through countless bottles. I was told Sonya Dakar is now making a replacement product but I have yet to try it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this product and for such a great price! This is a wonder cream in a small jar! Fast shipping and great service!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It didn&#x27;t work overnight, but my problem areas have gotten much better. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This drying potion really works.  It smells awful, but at the end of the day, you wash and put this on your face, a lot less acne.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic!  I love using it, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just the blemish which is great</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I&#x27;ve bought this before and had to buy it again. This stuff is gold. Dries pimples quick. It stings, but that&#x27;s how you know it is working. Love Love Love!</li>
            <li> This drying potion really works. I have been using this for years. The price is high but it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Spot treatment 1-2 nights on the pimple and its gone. It does have a tendency to dry in the bottle but I just get a new one.</li>
            <li> It was not made clear in the description that this is a similar product to the original cult favorite &amp;#34;drying potion,&amp;#34; but no longer produced by Sonya Dakar. The product is still pretty effective though.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff EVER for quick fixes... GET IT</li>
            <li> love it and its lavender scent. however it dries out quickly and its a rather small bottle :(</li>
            <li> Drying potion Is a great product for my skin. I received in shortly time just as they said. I happy</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Has a nice slightly tingly feeling when you first put it on. It works pretty well to get rid of pimples. And it smells great too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it dries out very quickly, which is a huge drawback given how costly it is. I&#x27;ve found that adding a few drops of water to the bottle fixes the dryness temporarily.</li>
            <li> Just put a little dot of this on a pimple before bed time and it&#x27;ll be near gone in the morning!! This is my go-to for all new pimples! Thanks Sonya Dakar for making such great products!!!</li>
