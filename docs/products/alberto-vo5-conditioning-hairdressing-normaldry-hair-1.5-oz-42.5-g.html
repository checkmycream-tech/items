            <li>I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a more pleasant smell</li>
            <li>When I was a kid this was very popular and still is a great product today to help smooth hair and get rid of any fly away hairs, also has a fabulous scent that will remind you of when you first used this product.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Vo5 Hairdressing to keep my leather boots and shoes clean and in good shape.</li>
            <li>seem great at first</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on your website.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in store, thinking it was a cream conditioner I had used many moons ago.  </li>
            <li>any more so that is why I went to Amazon and found it there.</li>
            <li>That was many years ago</li>
            <li>Great product - thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>used it before and love the results</li>
            <li>It makes the difference in whether I walk out feeling confident about my hair, or want to hide under a hat.  </li>
            <li>Instead I would purchase a pomade, which seems more versatile than this product.</li>
            <li>This is not like most of the conditioners that are sold where you apply it in the shower and then rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair more body, ends static, gives it a healthy shine and tames the frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the newer liquid products.</li>
            <li>not into you, much better newer products.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a retail store &amp; never thought about trying Amazon.  </li>
            <li>For me, I have used this product for years and still love it.</li>
            <li>favorite things about this:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>This is a favorite hair product of mine.  </li>
            <li>It gives shine to my hair as well as making it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Your hair will be more manageable.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is alright, but could be better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years...</li>
            <li>very easily leaves your hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>The ointment comes out as ointment and is easily applied.</li>
            <li>and it washed out easily.</li>
            <li>Will strongly recommend</li>
            <li>It gives a awesome shine, a little to greasy</li>
            <li>In the morning, most of it was absorbed, and kept my scalp supple through the day WITHOUT  being too greasy or shinny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to having pretty healthy hair</li>
            <li>and I am pretty pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The tubes are full.  </li>
            <li>but it is cool and works well.  </li>
            <li>;  Given the reasonable price, I thought it was worth a try, and boy, I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and seems to dissipate rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t use too much; less is more!</li>
            <li>It is better than all the new stuff.</li>
            <li>If too much remains on in the morning, it easily wipes off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many products recommended by my hairdresser, and this is the best to make my hair look less dry and kinky.  </li>
            <li>After years of coloring and using heat devices (blow dryer, curling brushes, etc) to style my fine hair, the ends have really suffered.</li>
            <li>I was able to squeeze the tube to suck it back in, and the stuff is this enough that it doesn&#x27;t come out very quickly on it&#x27;s own, but I&#x27;ll make sure I put the cap back on more quickly from now on.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it since I have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo and vo5 &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; every other night for over 6 months with good results.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of grease to hold a guy&#x27;s hair in place without smelling up the room.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and miss it very much.  </li>
            <li>The longer it&#x27;s left on, the  more of the psoriasis it loosens.  </li>
            <li>It has never needed any improvement, and I hope they leave it well enough alone and available!</li>
            <li>I remember my Mother using this when it first came out</li>
            <li>The smell, though, is pretty rancid.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that can be tricky to get the hang of, but once you do it&#x27;s just as good as anything you&#x27;d buy at the store for three times the price and ten times the graphic</li>
            <li>Delivered the right product on time for a decent price.</li>
            <li>Love it sounds a bit strange</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and this product makes the hair more managable and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have real unruly hair.</li>
            <li>So I bought a case of it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years as it really works for me.  </li>
            <li>but  MOST OF them the next day seemed to have dried my hair out  even more</li>
            <li>are a real embarrassment.  </li>
            <li>and then I use only about 1/16&amp;#34; and rub it on my palms and then smooth it over my ends.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really provide any hold, but does help a bit with frizzy looking hair.</li>
            <li>This hairdressing makes my hair very sleek and tames all my frizz and flyaways.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>It does not weigh down my baby fine hair, and it keeps the style better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s exactly the same as I remember.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it higher than the last inch or two of the hair or else you risk looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product keeps it slicked down and civilized all day.</li>
            <li>you hands spread in out and then put in on  your  DRY hair if you use too  of much it will be very greasy looking and feeling that way ,  </li>
            <li>The box color is the same used for extra body for fine hair -- nut conditioning for normal.dry hair is a different color.  </li>
            <li>he&#x27;s old school and has used Vo-5 for decades.......</li>
            <li>that old stuff that my mom used to use?!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>She uses frequently</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell, but it soon goes away, and the benefits are well worth the initial smell.  </li>
            <li>No more flyaway hair, with this it is easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Found mine in a local store and found it thick and with a clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Lasts a very long time as you only need a TINY spot of it and rub it into your hands and lightly stroke over hair.</li>
            <li>The product arrived properly packaged and was of high quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered two new tubes recently.  </li>
            <li>I find it especially useful now that my hair is \\&quot;old and gray\\&quot;, has dry unruly ends and a very dull appearance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Extrabody for fine hair is extremely hard to find.</li>
            <li>Great for just adding a little life to your hair, only need a very small amount a tube will last for months.</li>
            <li>would not tell any one to use this to greasy and just not good unless you like oily look and does not was out easy</li>
            <li>1/16\\&quot; of an inch or less into my palm, rub my hands together, apply first at the temples and then throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li>so the dry dead-looking ends that I&#x27;d developed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so the dry dead-looking ends that I&#x27;d developed</li>
            <li> They always look new by rubbing a little bit of Vo5 on the shoes or handbags.</li>
            <li> and it works as I have such dry</li>
            <li> Keeps hair from being dry and frizzey; especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I had used this product for a long time until I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is damaged and lots of  spray in conditioners that I have tried  </li>
            <li> I expected this to provide a bit of \\&quot;hold\\&quot; for my hair like pomade but to a lesser degree.</li>
            <li> After shampooing and while hair is still wet, I squeeze a tiny amount..</li>
            <li> I have used this product for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> It helps seal the bottom, especially split ends and rough edges.</li>
            <li> I have used this same product for over twenty years and it is   still a top notch product, but almost impossible to find in stores, now.</li>
            <li> , I left the tube on the counter with the cap off while I was using the bit I put in my hand, and next time I looked at it about half an inch of VO5 was coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li> You must be careful and use just a tiny amount, rub your hands together and apply throughout your hair, or just to dry ends.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that such a tiny amount makes such a big difference!  </li>
            <li> Just a touch is all that&#x27;s needed, so a tube lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This is product is for use AFTER you wash your hair and dry it.</li>
            <li> then I touch my dry hair set hair.</li>
            <li> I had a very dry and scaly scalp ( bald head) on which I had tried various dandruff shampoos, moisturizing lotions, creams, and salves, including products for eczema and other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> And that one little inexpensive tube will last for months!  </li>
            <li> Do an Elvis show and it gives just that little extra I need.</li>
            <li> this does a great job but use a very  VERY VERY LITTLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I happened to find an old tube of vo5 that had been around for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> (The latter is also a thick greasy product that I quit using several years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just remember a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Need only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Now my hair looks like an oil slick, and 6 shampoos later, my hair still looks like I was involved in a head-on collision with an oil tanker.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell like a couple other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to throw it away due to the smell.</li>
            <li> Rub it into the ends of damp or wet hair--and done!</li>
            <li> Am disappointed the product was discontinued but thankful it is available on line.</li>
            <li> If rumor not true, a win-win situation for all.</li>
            <li> Maybe half a pinkie nail, unless you have crazy large pinkie nails.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a hair product I use everyday, so I decided to order online, and with shipping it worked out to be cheaper than buying it from the store.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, hair that has become kinky in spots as I have aged.  </li>
            <li> sorry old fashioned vo5.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these days and just need a little</li>
            <li> My mother, who is hard of hearing, heard they were discontinuing this product.  </li>
            <li> One complaint though</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you will hate it.  </li>
            <li> the secret to this is to use just a very very little dab</li>
            <li> Very hard to find this VO5 product in stores.</li>
            <li> Now the product is so thin it runs between my fingers.</li>
            <li> smells bad.</li>
            <li> Although the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free products help quite a bit, I still had these horrible frizzy ends.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great!! My Dad is so happy....he&#x27;s old school and has used Vo-5 for decades.......thank you!</li>
            <li> I had forgotten about this product and recently tried it again.  So wonderful for curly hair. I do wish it had a more pleasant smell but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I had used this product for a long time until I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any longer. So glad I found it on your website.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Have used this for years.</li>
            <li> Delivered the right product on time for a decent price. Very hard to find this VO5 product in stores.</li>
            <li> Always reliable. Keeps hair in place without being greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and this product makes the hair more managable and shiny.  Need only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Great hair conditioner</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t use too much; less is more!</li>
            <li> I have real unruly hair. This product keeps it slicked down and civilized all day. Good stuff. I thought that  Alberto was not going to make VO5 anymore. So I bought a case of it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have been using the GOLD VO5 for years.  It gets the job done and is good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis in my scalp, and this product can be put on my scalp but NOT make my hair greasy.  The longer it&#x27;s left on, the  more of the psoriasis it loosens.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This Alberto VO5 is an excellent hair dressing without being greasy or leaving   an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; look. I have used this same product for over twenty years and it is   still a top notch product, but almost impossible to find in stores, now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a hair product I use everyday, so I decided to order online, and with shipping it worked out to be cheaper than buying it from the store. though the product may not be for everyone, when you do use it, a dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in store, thinking it was a cream conditioner I had used many moons ago.  Little did I realize that it&#x27;s essentially Vaseline and it won&#x27;t wash out!!!  Now my hair looks like an oil slick, and 6 shampoos later, my hair still looks like I was involved in a head-on collision with an oil tanker.  Now I&#x27;m stuck googling \\&quot;how to remove vaseline from hair\\&quot;....  be warned!!!!</li>
            <li> I do not want Alberto Culver to stop making this product.</li>
            <li> Using this since I was teenager. Happy with the order and timely delivery!</li>
            <li> I thought everything was great!!!  I have looked every where for this product and no one including Walmart has it.  I have used this for years and miss it very much.  It gives a great shine to my hair, thanks again for your great service and great price.</li>
            <li> This is the best-ever hair product ... been around for many years but excellent for making hair shiny and manageable!</li>
            <li> It gives a awesome shine, a little to greasy</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years as it really works for me.  Now I cannot find it in any of the stores here in Calgary any more so that is why I went to Amazon and found it there.</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t like this product then you were not using it properly. This is product is for use AFTER you wash your hair and dry it. It&#x27;s NOT a conditioner you use in the shower after you shampoo your hair. ONLY use a tiny pea size blob. My mother used VO5 on my hair as a child. That was many years ago and I needed some for my granddaughters hair. I was delighted to find it on Amazon. Yes, it&#x27;s exactly the same as I remember. Lasts a very long time as you only need a TINY spot of it and rub it into your hands and lightly stroke over hair. It makes hair shine and conditions. Helps with split ends and fly away hair. Great product - thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have always used Vo5 Hairdressing to keep my leather boots and shoes clean and in good shape. They always look new by rubbing a little bit of Vo5 on the shoes or handbags. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> this does a great job but use a very  VERY VERY LITTLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have long hair that is damaged and lots of  spray in conditioners that I have tried  seem great at first but  MOST OF them the next day seemed to have dried my hair out  even more BUT NOT THIS ONE yeah!!!!!!! the secret to this is to use just a very very little dab I CAN NOT SAY THAT ENOUGH  rub in the palm of you hands spread in out and then put in on  your  DRY hair if you use too  of much it will be very greasy looking and feeling that way ,  it does not have the greatest smell but that seems to go away THIS PRODUCT LAST ALONG TIME</li>
            <li> This is the only hairdressing my husband will use. I try to keep spares, one for each bathroom and one for his travel case.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 30 years. It is better than all the new stuff. Makes my hair shinny. I use a tiny bit. I rub it in my hand then I touch my dry hair set hair. It finishes my hairdo.</li>
            <li> used it before and love the results</li>
            <li> I had a very dry and scaly scalp ( bald head) on which I had tried various dandruff shampoos, moisturizing lotions, creams, and salves, including products for eczema and other skin conditions.  All of this over a period two years. None of these seemed to help.  I happened to find an old tube of vo5 that had been around for at least 5 years.  I put on a generous amount ( 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch) on my scalp just after shampooing and before going to bed-- covered it up with a night cap.  Sometimes we have to sacrifice. Ha!  In the morning, most of it was absorbed, and kept my scalp supple through the day WITHOUT  being too greasy or shinny.  I have used this shampoo and vo5 &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; every other night for over 6 months with good results.  If too much remains on in the morning, it easily wipes off.&lt;br /&gt;  I ordered two new tubes recently.  The order came promptly and in good shape.  The tubes are full.  The ointment comes out as ointment and is easily applied.</li>
            <li> After years of coloring and using heat devices (blow dryer, curling brushes, etc) to style my fine hair, the ends have really suffered. I&#x27;m used to having pretty healthy hair so the dry dead-looking ends that I&#x27;d developed are a real embarrassment.  Although the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free products help quite a bit, I still had these horrible frizzy ends. After trying a variety of more expensive products that never worked, I read a blog that mentioned Alberto VO5, and I thought, &amp;#34;Oh, that old stuff that my mom used to use?!&amp;#34;  Given the reasonable price, I thought it was worth a try, and boy, I&#x27;m glad I did.  I don&#x27;t put it on until I&#x27;m done styling my hair (I tried applying it sooner and the results weren&#x27;t good) and then I use only about 1/16&amp;#34; and rub it on my palms and then smooth it over my ends.  It makes the difference in whether I walk out feeling confident about my hair, or want to hide under a hat.  Just don&#x27;t use to much, or your hair will be heavy and greasy-looking.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I was so very happy to know that you carried this VO5 product!  It has never needed any improvement, and I hope they leave it well enough alone and available!</li>
            <li> I have used the VO5 for gray hair for years. Now the product is so thin it runs between my fingers. I made a purchase at 3 different stores thinking the product was defective. Guess I will have to change brands.</li>
            <li> I used this ass a teenager.  It is perfect for my hair.  I have thick, course, hair that has become kinky in spots as I have aged.  It works great for my hair.  I have tried many products recommended by my hairdresser, and this is the best to make my hair look less dry and kinky.  The order took awhile to get to me.  Shipping was slow.</li>
            <li> Husband loves to use this in his daily grooming routine.  It makes his hair shine and is not sticky.  He always gets compliments about the way his hair looks.</li>
            <li> I expected this to provide a bit of \\&quot;hold\\&quot; for my hair like pomade but to a lesser degree. It doesn&#x27;t really provide any hold, but does help a bit with frizzy looking hair. I don&#x27;t mind the smell like a couple other reviewers did. It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and seems to dissipate rather quickly. One complaint though, I left the tube on the counter with the cap off while I was using the bit I put in my hand, and next time I looked at it about half an inch of VO5 was coming out of the tube. I was able to squeeze the tube to suck it back in, and the stuff is this enough that it doesn&#x27;t come out very quickly on it&#x27;s own, but I&#x27;ll make sure I put the cap back on more quickly from now on. I haven&#x27;t had any issues of my hair looking greasy, but I only use about a pea sized amount. Overall, I would probably not buy this product again. Instead I would purchase a pomade, which seems more versatile than this product.</li>
            <li> Very light weight perfect hair dress and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of grease to hold a guy&#x27;s hair in place without smelling up the room.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner.This is not like most of the conditioners that are sold where you apply it in the shower and then rinse it out.  It is a hairdressing.  You must be careful and use just a tiny amount, rub your hands together and apply throughout your hair, or just to dry ends.  I find it especially useful now that my hair is \\&quot;old and gray\\&quot;, has dry unruly ends and a very dull appearance.  After shampooing and while hair is still wet, I squeeze a tiny amount..1/16\\&quot; of an inch or less into my palm, rub my hands together, apply first at the temples and then throughout my hair.  It gives my hair more body, ends static, gives it a healthy shine and tames the frizzy ends.  If you use too much, you will hate it.  I find it hard to believe that such a tiny amount makes such a big difference!  I remember my Mother using this when it first came out and that must have been in the 1950&#x27;s!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell, but it soon goes away, and the benefits are well worth the initial smell.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything else like this on the market.  And that one little inexpensive tube will last for months!  Don&#x27;t knock it, just use it correctly.</li>
            <li> I just bought a tube of this stuff at Walmart for $3 and I am pretty pleased with it.  I needed a slicked back look and, with a small bit of this, that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  I worked the hairdressing through my hair to the ends, brushed my hair back into a ponytail and secured it, then braided the ponytail and secured it, too.  This hairdressing makes my hair very sleek and tames all my frizz and flyaways.  The smell, though, is pretty rancid.  If  I continue smelling like this throughout the day, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to throw it away due to the smell.</li>
            <li> would not tell any one to use this to greasy and just not good unless you like oily look and does not was out easy</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Ive been using this product since I was a child.  My mother used it to stop my flyaway hair and to make it shiny.</li>
            <li> VO5 makes my hair shiny without making it oily. Works much better than the newer liquid products. Just a touch is all that&#x27;s needed, so a tube lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> smells bad. very easily leaves your hair super greasy. sorry old fashioned vo5. not into you, much better newer products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for as long as I can remember.  It smooths the hair and puts a shine on it that lasts all day.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a retail store &amp; never thought about trying Amazon.  Ssurprise, surprise there it was &amp; at a price that was astonishingly low.</li>
            <li> For me, I have used this product for years and still love it. Found mine in a local store and found it thick and with a clean, fresh fragrance. In my opinion, this is the same formula as in years gone by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite things about this:&lt;br /&gt;1 Just a dab of this (the size of a dime) rubbed in the palm of my hand works to shine my hair....and it works as I have such dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 It makes my hair look healthly not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 It does not weigh down my baby fine hair, and it keeps the style better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 No more flyaway hair, with this it is easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The box color is the same used for extra body for fine hair -- nut conditioning for normal.dry hair is a different color.  (The latter is also a thick greasy product that I quit using several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extrabody for fine hair is extremely hard to find.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid this was very popular and still is a great product today to help smooth hair and get rid of any fly away hairs, also has a fabulous scent that will remind you of when you first used this product.  Great for just adding a little life to your hair, only need a very small amount a tube will last for months.</li>
            <li> My dad has been using this for years.  He is now in the Veterans Nursing Home and he has been asking me for&lt;br /&gt;this for months and I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Thank you so much.  He (me too) appreciate this.  Have a great day.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite hair product of mine.  It gives shine to my hair as well as making it more manageable.  Just remember a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these days and just need a little but it works great. Do an Elvis show and it gives just that little extra I need. Love it sounds a bit strange but it is cool and works well.  E</li>
            <li> This stuff looks like something your grandmother would slather onto her head in the 50&#x27;s to \\&quot;set\\&quot; her style in place for the next two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like that at all--well, it depends on how you use it. This is a product that can be tricky to get the hang of, but once you do it&#x27;s just as good as anything you&#x27;d buy at the store for three times the price and ten times the graphic design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is almost a microscopic amount. Maybe half a pinkie nail, unless you have crazy large pinkie nails. Rub it into the ends of damp or wet hair--and done! It helps seal the bottom, especially split ends and rough edges. I wouldn&#x27;t use it higher than the last inch or two of the hair or else you risk looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no smell and it washed out easily. I like it, so maybe you should too.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it since I have been using this product for years. Am disappointed the product was discontinued but thankful it is available on line.</li>
            <li> Great hairdressing. Use pea sized amount after shower. Keeps hair from being dry and frizzey; especially in the winter time.Your hair will be more manageable. The fragrance is alright, but could be better.</li>
            <li> My mother, who is hard of hearing, heard they were discontinuing this product.  I didn&#x27;t have time to check and she wanted all you had.  She uses frequently so I ordered.  If rumor not true, a win-win situation for all. LOL</li>
            <li> shipment was on time and everything else  was good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years...I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Excellent product but unavailable in Australia</li>
            <li> The product arrived properly packaged and was of high quality. Will strongly recommend</li>
