            <li>It is not the best FOR your hair, and unless I continue I will have some sort of grow-out, which is a bummer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll look like my hair had the best season ever.</li>
            <li>I wanted to lighten my hair a bit for summer without going too drastic, and this worked perfectly.  </li>

            <li>I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>hazel eyes fair skin•</li>
            <li>Good seller&lt;br /&gt;And</li>

            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>Great cheap way to lighten your hair during the winter.</li>
            <li>But, another nice thing is this isn&#x27;t scientific, there isn&#x27;t a pattern, so</li>
            <li>The sun is a lot more effective than the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>and I get perfect natural highlights.</li>
            <li>Seems better than putting hair dye in your hair.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the lighter it will become.</li>
            <li>and the stylist couldn&#x27;t believe I used sun in because my hair was so healthy.</li>
            <li>He uses it every summer and his hair gets awesome blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need more heat...</li>
            <li>Works better in the sun and us it for a couple of days to even out the highlights.</li>
            <li>Company offers free shipping which is a great perk!</li>
            <li>It works great and is fast.  </li>
            <li>People already mistakenly assume that I am my children&#x27;s (ages 11, 9, and 8) grandmother.  </li>
            <li>Therefore when the sun is out in NY, I use this by damping where my highlights grew in, and a tad more , and head out to the beach.</li>
            <li>What more can I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;(P.S:</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>works amazing and totally worth it!</li>
            <li>My hair is quite long and it looks silky and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I am giving this 5 stars because it gave me natural beautiful highlightings that I can control, and I saved a ton of money.</li>
            <li>I loved it back in the 90&#x27;s and love it now!</li>
            <li>and it was so easy to do my roots.</li>
            <li>have dark brown, color treated hair, so to fight brassy tones, I also got purple shampoo and my hair looks awesome!</li>
            <li>but the price is same price in the stores i am trying to find out with free shipping  but great item.</li>
            <li>Dampen your hair lightly and spray on Sun-in where you want highlights.</li>
            <li>works well with light brown hair.  </li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s light brown</li>
            <li>Very nice...gentle and effective...</li>
            <li>My hair color is light brunette</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for bringing and brightening highlights.</li>
            <li>I love this product, as it gently lightens my hair.</li>
            <li>Moderation is key for good results.</li>
            <li>Where I live, many woman have kids at age 20.  </li>
            <li>Really works!!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see how I&#x27;d fit in a color.  </li>
            <li>In for many years since I get my hair professionally highlighted twice a year.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how many applications it took to get to the light bleach blonde hair</li>
            <li>and it gives me the golden look I want without having to dye it.</li>
            <li>I found this product useful ..</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown, and at the fourth use it took on more of a reddish tinge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love that it kept my hair feeling soft and not over-processed or dry/brittle.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always used original, and I really like this lemon scent.  </li>
            <li>3 applications (using a hair dryer), and my hair is much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>my first time using the lemon Sun-In...</li>
            <li>This product worked exactly as it advertised on me</li>
            <li>This product worked exactly as it advertised on me.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how much it has lightened up!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>in one day my hair went from pretty dark brown to a beautiful blonde!</li>
            <li>Very pleased, would recommend to anyone, even medium to dark brunette hair!</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the lemon fresh version does not smell very good but it won&#x27;t bother you once it is in your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using sun-in for a long time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>my dark brown hair turned into a nice caramel.  </li>
            <li>Works real well but definitely smells funny and nozzle breaks easily.</li>
            <li>only there was something easy, like Sun-In,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After three uses I had some nice highlights and a slightly lighter color.  </li>
            <li>Or if you are visiting a coastal beach fill a large bottle with some salt water and bring it home.  </li>
            <li>I use it more in the spring/summer to keep a more blonde look and less in the fall/winter to keep my hair darker.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Seems ok, but not fast results</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should try it haha.</li>
            <li>It really is</li>
            <li>I have ombré now, without the price tag, thanks to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping product as described.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>With 3 kids and a full-time job, I can barely make it to the hairdresser&#x27;s every 3 months for a quick cut.  </li>
            <li>so he uses this to turn it back to it&#x27;s original color.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use as well - spritz damp hair and either blow dry it or head out into the summer heat, and voila.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do have to do it a few times to notice but the results are nice,  very natural looking.</li>
            <li>After just 2 treatments with the hair dryer, the hair on top of my hair is lighter and the grays much less visible....</li>
            <li>I used this for 4 years in high school...</li>
            <li>I was a little scared to try this product, since I&#x27;ve read many reviews that it should not be used in color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It does do some lightening, but the action really depends on sunlight</li>
            <li>But for my Caucasian bf it works fast, and looks like he got professional highlights.</li>
            <li>For those who live on or near a coastline, I have found over the years that Sun-In works really well with the ocean&#x27;s salt water.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally light brown/dark blonde and helps bring out the blonde undertones in my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A month after using it consistently, I would get asked daily if I had colored my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pictures attached are my natural color using Sun</li>
            <li>I spray some of it in a couple of times a week, and my friends think I have had my hair treated professionally.</li>
            <li>Like natural highlights or sun bleached.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t kill my hair and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>My hair still looks natural and is not damaged.  </li>
            <li>I eventually got my hair done professionally</li>
            <li>in the early 1990&#x27;s, I used Sun-In during my college years.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally brown hair</li>
            <li>In back in high school</li>
            <li>Really works like it is supposed to and doesn&#x27;t turn your hair orange or some strange colors.</li>
            <li>I only had to do this recently after dying my light hair dark brown and then lightening with sun in...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it would work because I mostly have dark brown hair and my hair gets slightly lighter over summer but not noticeable.</li>
            <li>(although there is a blow dryer method, I think going out in the method is what actually makes it look natural).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde and recently moved from CA to Seattle.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going to continue with once a week treatments to achieve a very subtle, but meaningful, change.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would work because I mostly have dark brown hair and my hair gets slightly lighter over summer but not noticeable.</li>
            <li> (although there is a blow dryer method, I think going out in the method is what actually makes it look natural).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde and recently moved from CA to Seattle.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to continue with once a week treatments to achieve a very subtle, but meaningful, change.  </li>

            <li> I naturally have dirty blonde hair but to keep up the golden blonde I had in my childhood, I use this product.</li>
            <li> helps keep the grey away.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing and it actually does what the bottle says.</li>
            <li> I also will apply it onto dry hair and blow dry...</li>
            <li> Then, I dry it.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s summer, then I&#x27;ll dry it until it&#x27;s a bit damp and go lay in the sun for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry or use heat on my hair that often, i was just trying to get out in the sun.</li>
            <li> (dark blonde)</li>
            <li> a tip for those of you who get a yellow or brassy tone after lightening, find a (dark) purple shampoo and use 1x every week or every other week depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> I am  a Male I decide to change my hair color little bit but with out colring  </li>
            <li> If you only want your hair to become a little bit lighter</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will apply when my hair was wet, spray it in, and then leave the house and go about my business.</li>
            <li> Lightens just as it claims to as long as your hair isn&#x27;t too dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> The thing is, I am tired of spending so much money on them during the summertime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually died my hair darker and lighter with both all over color and highlights in the past.</li>
            <li> But using a hair mask/heavy conditioner the next time you wash your help usually helps.</li>
            <li> The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed in the past is that sometimes it leaves my hair a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I could only imagine that I&#x27;d do it all very unevenly.  </li>
            <li> Not recommended for dark hair colors, however.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and have never had it turn brassy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the grays are gone, but they aren&#x27;t showing up against the lighter hair as they did against my dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair was growing out really dark.  </li>
            <li> Flat irons also work (the product is heat activated) but they&#x27;re also not nearly as effective as hair dryers or the sun.</li>
            <li> it turned out slightly yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair has never gotten dry or stringy and I hardly ever get split ends.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little boost in lightening up my hair for my beach vacation and used this sparingly, about 5 times over a 3 week period.  </li>
            <li> IM A TEENAGER, AND DURING THE SUMMER I WANTED TO TRY TO MAKE MY HAIR A LITTLE LIGHTER.</li>
            <li> I read a little bit about it, and bought a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I use it a lot during the winter months to give my hair a little highlight and know one suspects a thing.</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair and this gives it just enough highlights to brighten it up.</li>
            <li> i have used it a few times and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> then you should apply everyday for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks however, it does get brassy.</li>
            <li> so it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Coloring at home was not attractive, as I&#x27;m not very coordinated when it comes to arts and crafts.  </li>
            <li> and I used this spray and within a week my hair was a dirty blonde!</li>
            <li> I have been using sun-in for at least 6-7 years.  </li>
            <li> But, alas, as I was looking under the fluorescent lights in the bathroom at work, I did not like seeing those gray hairs popping up.  </li>
            <li> but if you want dramatic changes in you hair color</li>
            <li> Bf is obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It made my hair noticeably lighter without making it look weird.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m dirty blond</li>
            <li> Also, it is almost impossible to dye over your hair once you use this, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I have virgin hair again because I hate roots.</li>

            <li> I have used Sun In Lemon since I was in middle school (I am now graduating from university with my bachelors). I naturally have dirty blonde hair but to keep up the golden blonde I had in my childhood, I use this product. Like the directions say, keep applying until you get to your desired shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will apply when my hair was wet, spray it in, and then leave the house and go about my business. I also will apply it onto dry hair and blow dry... works well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never gotten dry or stringy and I hardly ever get split ends. My hair is quite long and it looks silky and beautiful! I&#x27;ve actually died my hair darker and lighter with both all over color and highlights in the past. I have used Sun In Lemon in both cases and it still works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip for those of you who get a yellow or brassy tone after lightening, find a (dark) purple shampoo and use 1x every week or every other week depending on your needs. I only had to do this recently after dying my light hair dark brown and then lightening with sun in... it turned out slightly yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures attached are my natural color using Sun In to lighten the bottoms as well as all over use during summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and happy lightening!</li>
            <li> I love this product, as it gently lightens my hair. I spray some of it in a couple of times a week, and my friends think I have had my hair treated professionally.</li>
            <li> works well, wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Like natural highlights or sun bleached. You do have to do it a few times to notice but the results are nice,  very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I use this all year around all over my hair. It does do some lightening, but the action really depends on sunlight and/or heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been incorporated into my haircare routine. After I shower, I towel off my hair and brush this spray through it. Then, I dry it. If it&#x27;s summer, then I&#x27;ll dry it until it&#x27;s a bit damp and go lay in the sun for a while.</li>
            <li> I loved it back in the 90&#x27;s and love it now! 3 applications (using a hair dryer), and my hair is much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Didn&#x27;t think it would work because I mostly have dark brown hair and my hair gets slightly lighter over summer but not noticeable. It didn&#x27;t kill my hair and it looks natural. Seems better than putting hair dye in your hair. BUT!!! Buy at target for cheaper ($4) and try to find it on cartwheel for an additional 10% off!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally blonde and I hadn&#x27;t used Sun In for many years since I get my hair professionally highlighted twice a year.  I wanted a little boost in lightening up my hair for my beach vacation and used this sparingly, about 5 times over a 3 week period.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  My hair still looks natural and is not damaged.  Moderation is key for good results.</li>
            <li> Seems ok, but not fast results</li>
            <li> For those who live on or near a coastline, I have found over the years that Sun-In works really well with the ocean&#x27;s salt water.  Or if you are visiting a coastal beach fill a large bottle with some salt water and bring it home.  Dampen your hair lightly and spray on Sun-in where you want highlights. Then, either sit outside in the sun or use a hair dryer.  The more you use it the lighter it will become.</li>
            <li> I used this for 4 years in high school... I have a natural ash dark blonde. I don&#x27;t remember how many applications it took to get to the light bleach blonde hair I ended up with but my hair stayed healthy and looked great and it was so easy to do my roots. The sun is a lot more effective than the blow dryer. If you have brown hair or darker it will turn your hair orange and do not use on processed hair! I eventually got my hair done professionally and the stylist couldn&#x27;t believe I used sun in because my hair was so healthy. I have virgin hair again because I hate roots.</li>
            <li> works well with light brown hair.  helps keep the grey away.  A+</li>
            <li> Bf is obsessed with this stuff. It really works. He uses it every summer and his hair gets awesome blonde highlights. As a mixed ethnicity woman I doubt it would work on ethnic hair. But for my Caucasian bf it works fast, and looks like he got professional highlights. His hair used to be blonde as a kid but now it&#x27;s light brown so he uses this to turn it back to it&#x27;s original color. I am unaware if this works on darker hair. Maybe I should try it haha.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I am  a Male I decide to change my hair color little bit but with out colring  so i bought this and i start using 5  or 6 time  oh my gosh works great  no one notice i am using this easy to use perfect item is a permenant till you cut your heair  but the price is same price in the stores i am trying to find out with free shipping  but great item.</li>
            <li> i have used it a few times and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I don&#x27;t blow dry or use heat on my hair that often, i was just trying to get out in the sun. Maybe I need more heat...</li>
            <li> IM A TEENAGER, AND DURING THE SUMMER I WANTED TO TRY TO MAKE MY HAIR A LITTLE LIGHTER. I HAVE MEDIUM BROWNISH HAIR AND IT TURNED MY HAIR ORANGE! DONT BUY THIS! I WILL PROBABLY END UP DYING IT DARKER AGAIN.. ITS LITERALLY BLEACH. NEVER EVER BUY SUN-IN!</li>
            <li> Works well for what you need it to do, it will lighten your hair.</li>
            <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair and I used this spray and within a week my hair was a dirty blonde! It is extremely moisturizing and it actually does what the bottle says. If you only want your hair to become a little bit lighter then I suggest you only use it for a couple of days but if you want dramatic changes in you hair color then you should apply everyday for a few weeks. The only complaint I have is that the lemon fresh version does not smell very good but it won&#x27;t bother you once it is in your hair.</li>
            <li> made my hair orange and I am level 7 (dark blonde)</li>
            <li> Sun in work great, I&#x27;m dirty blond and it gives me the golden look I want without having to dye it. Works better in the sun and us it for a couple of days to even out the highlights. If you are thinking about getting,  just do it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really works like it is supposed to and doesn&#x27;t turn your hair orange or some strange colors. Not recommended for dark hair colors, however. Company offers free shipping which is a great perk!</li>
            <li> Ive always loved this product.  It works great and is fast.  I have dark brown hair and have never had it turn brassy</li>
            <li> As I neared my 44th birthday, the gray hairs were starting to come in.  I have always hoped that when the gray struck, I&#x27;d be an enlightened woman who didn&#x27;t feel that she needed to hide her gray.  My hair is short and curly, so I wash-and-go.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up.  But, alas, as I was looking under the fluorescent lights in the bathroom at work, I did not like seeing those gray hairs popping up.  Where I live, many woman have kids at age 20.  People already mistakenly assume that I am my children&#x27;s (ages 11, 9, and 8) grandmother.  And that&#x27;s without gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what to do?  With 3 kids and a full-time job, I can barely make it to the hairdresser&#x27;s every 3 months for a quick cut.  I really didn&#x27;t see how I&#x27;d fit in a color.  And then there&#x27;s the expense.  Coloring at home was not attractive, as I&#x27;m not very coordinated when it comes to arts and crafts.  I could only imagine that I&#x27;d do it all very unevenly.  &amp;#34;If only there was something easy, like Sun-In,&amp;#34; I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the early 1990&#x27;s, I used Sun-In during my college years.  I was a lifeguard in summer, and I loved having my hair look lighter.  I continued through the school year with Sun-In and a hair dryer, and my dark brown hair turned into a nice caramel.  I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, what do you know?  Sun-In still exists!  I read a little bit about it, and bought a bottle.  After just 2 treatments with the hair dryer, the hair on top of my hair is lighter and the grays much less visible....even under those fluorescent lights.  So I&#x27;m going to continue with once a week treatments to achieve a very subtle, but meaningful, change.  I don&#x27;t think the grays are gone, but they aren&#x27;t showing up against the lighter hair as they did against my dark hair.  It really is a remarkable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that won&#x27;t work forever.  But perhaps by the time I&#x27;m all gray, I will have become that enlightened woman who doesn&#x27;t care and embraces her age.  A girl can hope!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have ombré now, without the price tag, thanks to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown, color treated hair, so to fight brassy tones, I also got purple shampoo and my hair looks awesome!</li>
            <li> Lightens just as it claims to as long as your hair isn&#x27;t too dark to begin with. After a few weeks however, it does get brassy. To combat this you need to either get a shampoo or spray that helps de-brassify your hair. Also, it is almost impossible to dye over your hair once you use this, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Very nice...gentle and effective...I am a natural blonde and don&#x27;t put any &#x27;other&#x27; lightening products on my hair ...my first time using the lemon Sun-In...TYVM!</li>
            <li> I have short hair that used to be very blonde when i was a kid... Then gradually darkened. This took me back to the color i want, in about a week. I recomend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sun-in for a long time and I love it.  I have naturally brown hair and I comb this in before I lay out in the sun and I get perfect natural highlights.</li>
            <li> Works real well but definitely smells funny and nozzle breaks easily.</li>
            <li> Works! It&#x27;s gradual so you have time to decide whether you want your hair to get lighter or not. Hair dryers work but I also agree that the sun is the best way to go. Flat irons also work (the product is heat activated) but they&#x27;re also not nearly as effective as hair dryers or the sun. It made my hair noticeably lighter without making it look weird. Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•light brown hair hazel eyes fair skin•</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to try this product, since I&#x27;ve read many reviews that it should not be used in color treated hair. My hair color is light brunette and I have highlights. The thing is, I am tired of spending so much money on them during the summertime. Therefore when the sun is out in NY, I use this by damping where my highlights grew in, and a tad more , and head out to the beach. It works like a charm. I do think I will go back to the salon when they grow in again during winter (although there is a blow dryer method, I think going out in the method is what actually makes it look natural). I am giving this 5 stars because it gave me natural beautiful highlightings that I can control, and I saved a ton of money. What more can I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;(P.S: although it says it is moisturizing, I like to use a leave-in conditioner after I take a shower)</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as it advertised on me</li>
            <li> Been using this since my teens and it still work great. I have dirty blonde hair and this gives it just enough highlights to brighten it up. Love it.</li>
            <li> works well if used correctly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Good seller&lt;br /&gt;And good product</li>
            <li> I found this product useful .. my hair is lighter almost 2 degrees than it was before .. something i didnt like is that it  smell</li>
            <li> I have been using sun-in for at least 6-7 years.  I love it!  My hair is naturally light brown/dark blonde and helps bring out the blonde undertones in my hair.  I use it more in the spring/summer to keep a more blonde look and less in the fall/winter to keep my hair darker.  The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed in the past is that sometimes it leaves my hair a little dry.  But using a hair mask/heavy conditioner the next time you wash your help usually helps.</li>
            <li> Really works!! Just don&#x27;t od on it while using it because your hair could turn yellow</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as it advertised on me. I ordered it against my mom&#x27;s warnings-it turned her hair orange way back in the day. On the hair color scale my hair is definitely the darkest, maybe darker. I lived on the Oregon Coast this summer and would spray some on before walks on the beach, a shift outside, or a hike.&lt;br /&gt;A month after using it consistently, I would get asked daily if I had colored my hair, that&#x27;s how much it has lightened up! I am so pleased! It is not the best FOR your hair, and unless I continue I will have some sort of grow-out, which is a bummer. But, another nice thing is this isn&#x27;t scientific, there isn&#x27;t a pattern, so the grow out won&#x27;t look like if I HAD died my hair...it&#x27;ll look like my hair had the best season ever. ;) Very pleased, would recommend to anyone, even medium to dark brunette hair!</li>
            <li> Great cheap way to lighten your hair during the winter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Didn&#x27;t change my hair color and split my hair ends.</li>
            <li> Hair was growing out really dark.  Has this &amp;#34;not on purpose&amp;#34; ombre look.  About 6 applications now it all looks even.  Will try and post pic</li>
            <li> I used Sun In back in high school and recently found it again. I&#x27;d always used original, and I really like this lemon scent.  I wanted to lighten my hair a bit for summer without going too drastic, and this worked perfectly.  After three uses I had some nice highlights and a slightly lighter color.  My hair is light brown, and at the fourth use it took on more of a reddish tinge.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it kept my hair feeling soft and not over-processed or dry/brittle.  It was easy to use as well - spritz damp hair and either blow dry it or head out into the summer heat, and voila.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Still works well for me!</li>
            <li> i got this at walmart. This stuff totes works 100 percent. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know you could not  put it on colored hair so it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> in one day my hair went from pretty dark brown to a beautiful blonde! works amazing and totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for bringing and brightening highlights. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it is very natural looking. Works best in the sun but hair dryer works good too.</li>
            <li> Works. I&#x27;m a natural blonde and recently moved from CA to Seattle. I use this to keep my hair from getting darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for years. I use it a lot during the winter months to give my hair a little highlight and know one suspects a thing.</li>
