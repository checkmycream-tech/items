            <li> Doesn&#x27;t decrease hand pain!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, and it works very well on sore and painful muscles.  Other products are too warm/hot, but Miracle Rub is not.  The smell dissipates and does not linger for long, but the pain-reducing effect does.  By using Miracle Rub, I can cut back or eliminate the use of ibuprofen.  This product was packaged well and arrived quickly.  I will continue to buy and use Miracle Rub.</li>
            <li> I dearly love the effects of the Miracle Rub.  I have used it for quite sometime and it gets rid of the aches and pains and also of leg cramps.  Use it all the time.  Thank you so much for carrying it in your inventory.  Thanks lghj</li>

            <li> Did not relieve pain as well as I had hoped.  The smell was stronger than I like</li>

            <li> Wonderful healing soothing rub. It really works!</li>
            <li> This cream does wonders for pain.</li>
            <li> my mom was satisfied.  it doesn&#x27;t smell and seems to work.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR RELIEVING JOINT PAIN IMMEDIATELY!!  RECOMMEND!!!!!AAAAA!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good!!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love Miracle Rub for my knees.  I have used more expensive products in the past but have found that Miracle Rub provides the best results.  My mother also uses it on her feet.  She says that it helps her circulation and makes her feet feel better (and softer).</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  My 89 mother can&#x27;t llive without it.</li>
            <li> This product is so great, my husband and I use it for all muscle pain we got from work it relaxes and healed the pain right away,  specially in the kind of work we do which has a lot of standing this miracle of aloe really helps..we are so thanful that we found this product...</li>
            <li> it will help you pain</li>
            <li> It works. I try other stuff but this thing works well. It actually works to combine different things like some natural stuff with arnica.&lt;br /&gt;But this is pretty good for the price as base.</li>
            <li> does not work for me.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says.  It helps relieve muscle aches and pains and it is gentle on the skin.  I&#x27;ve never come across a better muscle ointment.  My massage therapist uses Biofreeze and it is just as good as miracle rub and has a milder odor, however it costs much more.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to relieve any pain. The smell was so strong that it ligered for days after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Though not the same size as i had wanted, you sent me two smaller sizes, after i gave you a go ahead; plus a bonus feet healing tube. It is great.</li>
            <li> Works well on my knee pain. Pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> I found this cream by accident at Ross.  It was just by chance that this cream was available.  After searching around I finally decided it must be ordered.  Amazon does have the lowest price.  I will say that it does have a pretty fierce sting when applied but that is usually when it helps the most.  I love it so much that I bought 5 tubes!!!</li>
