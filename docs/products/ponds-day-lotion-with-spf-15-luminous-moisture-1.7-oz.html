    <ol>
            <li>/&gt; Perfect for summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the bottle for awhile, and I&#x27;m impressed that it&#x27;s lasted this</li>
            <li>this is wonderful for all day wear &amp; also for bedtime.</li>
            <li>Great face lotion, your skin feels so silky!</li>
            <li>I will buy this product again and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>but despite those claims on the product information, it&#x27;s still an excellent moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND it has built in sunscreen which is just icing on an already delicious cake.  </li>
            <li>Not the best for standing up on your dresser, but great to carry with you in your purse.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels great going on &amp; absorbs into skin</li>
            <li>i am hoping for great results.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>so it fits perfectly in my already crowded medicine cabinet and stands up easily on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>this is a very effective product.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very nice.</li>
            <li>stuff is NICE!</li>
            <li>I would happily use this since the price is on point and the product seems good.</li>
            <li>Pleasant is the way to describe it.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this moisturizer, and the scent is also pleasant.  </li>

            <li>Moisturizes fairly well.</li>
            <li>Excellent light weight moisturizer and sun protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>Really good for my oily skin, will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>but it smells good.</li>
            <li>Granted that I have good skin to start with</li>
            <li>But would be great if it had more anti wrinkle into it.</li>
            <li>This one has an SPF of 15 which isn&#x27;t great but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>POND&#x27;S LUMINOUSE MOISTURE DAY SPF 15 LOTION is a great way to protect my skin from more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it contains an SPF in it, which is great for protecting your skin, but it doesn&#x27;t look, feel or smell at all like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this lotion does a good job moisturizing my skin effectively without leaving it feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>best part is, it&#x27;s not very expensive!  </li>
            <li>a light protection for the face and neck, the Pond&#x27;s product is great.</li>
            <li>giving this product a five-star rating because I liked the way it made my face feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes legs look nice to go without nylons</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the product is sold with that kind of thing in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For this kind of use, it&#x27;s a five star sun lotion.</li>
            <li>Lotion is very moisturizing and smells great!  </li>
            <li>this may be a blessing in disguise when it&#x27;s warm out</li>
            <li>Nice aroma and gives me the dewiness I expect from a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the bottle is nice and sleek</li>
            <li>It feels nice and cooling on my skin and the scent</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Fits in purse, travel friendly, has a great smell and good light coverage!</li>
            <li>Although the fragrance does smell really good, it is also really strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for more than just face &amp; with SPF 15, great for being in the sun too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very natural scent,reflects sunlight,fresh feeling on about 5-10 minutes &amp; great for</li>
            <li>This product, which I received as part of an Influenster Vox Box, has been effective in making my skin better over the 3 weeks I have been using it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has good coverage.  </li>
            <li>The things I liked most about it were that it didn&#x27;t feel too oily on my skin and seemed to absorb into my skin rather than hanging around on top, like some do.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty happy with</li>
            <li>Very light on the face not grease</li>
            <li>I also liked that it didn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More over Clinique here comes Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more from this product, but it is just okay.</li>
            <li>product made my face feel a lot better and may have even made it look better.</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion, and I use it as a sunblock too.</li>
            <li>However, my favorite thing is the shape of the container.</li>
            <li>I tried this product specifically for the 15 spf because most sunscreens break my face out</li>
            <li>She loves it and swears she looks more &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; and lighter.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it and would say anyone should try this and you will love as well</li>
            <li>As with all SPF products I can&#x27;t be totally sure it&#x27;s offering the sun protection it claims, but don&#x27;t have a reason to doubt that it is.</li>
            <li>I love a moisturizer that contains SPF.</li>
            <li>I really love this product as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>&quot; my skin at all, or makes it any more \\&quot;luminous,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would have thought an item like this would have been more in the $10+ range.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>To me this moisturizer feels like one of the more pricier brands out there.</li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF 15 in</li>
            <li>the very mild, pleasant fragrance dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is the best I have come across in a long time.</li>
            <li>Its an okay product smells good , but didn&#x27;t really suit my skin , gave 3 stars for price and smell.</li>
            <li>It has a silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin and a pleasant, mild scent.</li>
            <li>This may be a downside if you don&#x27;t want to reorder often, but could also be an upside if you want something that&#x27;s easy to take with you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very light floral fragrance that does go away quickly</li>
            <li>It glides on nicely with no heavy feeling, it has a pleasant scent, and the minerals really do make my skin look a bit more \\&quot;luminous.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>mo9WS34W5CWYXH]]I would have liked a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>like that it goes on smoothly and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried it myself and it soaks in easily and feels smooth and almost silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>i hope they never discontinue this fine product.</li>
            <li>light, lightly-scented, does NOT burn my eyes, and seems to not cause any skin issues (I get zits really easily if I use something oily or greasy)</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly but still makes my skin feel soft and great.  </li>
            <li>On the Pond&#x27;s side my skin had a nice glow and the makeup over the Pond&#x27;s moisturizer had a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes the light fruity smell, which I try not to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightly floral, instead of fruity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Often I have found moisturizers with SPF can smell a bit like sunscreen, but this moisturizer has a very mild clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is a great daily moisturizer for my skin.</li>
            <li>Fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>POND&#x27;S LUMINOUSE MOISTURE DAY SPF 15 LOTION, 1.7 OUNCH, comes in a cute, fun size.</li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;light, non-greasy,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I almost feel like this is a primer, it seems to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li>packaging is nice, but that&#x27;s the only nice thing I have to say.</li>
            <li>There is no greasy feeling after application, it absorbs quickly, and is easy to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a good size, flat which makes it easy to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li>I have always had problem skin, so I can&#x27;t help but worry, when trying a new product, about what kind of havoc it might wreak on my face.</li>
            <li>nice, light feeling to it; not a heavy &#x27;clog your pores&#x27; moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product has a lovely scent, goes on smoothly, and is gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Its very light, non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it which is great because I don&#x27;t love highly fragranced facial lotions, they break me out.</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t go out without make-up, but those with naturally beautiful skin will undoubtedly enjoy the brightness it adds to skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a floral smell that is pretty strong, so if you are adverse to fragrance, this might not be the moisturizer for you.</li>
            <li>it a pretty light scent.</li>
            <li>This product, for the most part is pretty gentle too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly luminous about it, but it is by far the best daily moisturizer I have found in it&#x27;s price range.</li>
            <li>I found Ponds Luminous Moisture to be gentle on my face and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love this product immediately skin feel very soft and the effects were noticeable immediately I received this complements of influenster in the mama box box</li>
            <li>no problem for me &amp; I&#x27;m very sensitive to many perfume</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I can&#x27;t use many of the over-the-counter moisturizers</li>
            <li>It is good for protecting limited areas from the sun, perhaps the nose and ears and the backs of the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a fine job moisturizing with no side effects, and is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>A quality product worth recommending.</li>
            <li>I really liked that because it made my face feel soft, and it was really gentle.</li>
            <li>definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>like that this has SPF in it, it felt non-greasy and absorbed well.  </li>
            <li>, that can also be sensitive, and this has been one of my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I need a little more from a moisturizer in terms of SPF and anti-aging properties, but this product would be great for younger woman.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin sensitive to the sun, wind and products with strong ingredients.  </li>
            <li>do very much like this as a moisturizer and will continue to use it, and I do like that</li>
            <li>surprise, surprise the Pond&#x27;s side actually looked better.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion and the convenient smaller packaging.</li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one only has SPF 15, which is okay for the winter time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this will be my first time using Ponds Luminous day SPF 15 lotion .</li>
            <li>considering the price, do take note that this is a smaller tube than most lotions come in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my super fancy high end</li>
            <li>(Face must be either freshly washed with a facial cleanser or if no make-up on, I rinse with a clean wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>My wife love it.it protect her face from the sun and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and someone asked me recently if I had \\&quot;had botox done\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s currently listed at less than half that, which is a great bargain for a really effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For the larger areas of my body, I just grab a large cheap tub of No-Ad or Banana Boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle, a kind of sweet scent, very pleasing, yet not over powering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about that</li>
            <li>Again, I don&#x27;t really care one way</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a moisturizer that really protects, then this contains all the ingredients you need, and it makes your skin really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to any Fountain of Youth qualities</li>
            <li>cent is a tad strong,yet smells much like a breeze blowing through jasmine blossoms,so</li>
            <li>Have been using this for about three months, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I hoped this would be light enough to prevent breakouts but still offer some protection.</li>
            <li>I really dislike this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I expected so much more of this product</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>and this really works well for me.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this SPF lotion.</li>
            <li>The days I did wear it were moderature temperature, mid-70&#x27;s, so I wasn&#x27;t sweating much.</li>
            <li>works really well under any foundation.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed that it \\&quot;brightens\\</li>
            <li>lotion is light and non-greasy and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li>I like to mix a tiny dab with my foundation to make it look more natural,</li>
            <li>However, it is scented and kind of heavily so - flowery-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it feels so good going on and provides subtle hints of illumination, I like to use this one for my face, forearms, shoulders and chest.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets absorbed very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Since I found it this is the daily cream I use!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m an older woman,</li>
            <li>I have tried many different moisturizers over the years, all different brands and price points.</li>
            <li>If fragrance bothers you, or you don&#x27;t like a fragrance that is strong, then you&#x27;ll want to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because this product has some pretty strong sunscreen ingredients, you may find it irritating if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Ponds product goes on clear and soaks right on, leaving a soft, dewy sheen.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves Pond&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It works great for its intended use, but just don&#x27;t be silly and stay in the sun without a heavier-duty sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a shine any sooner than I normally do on my combination</li>
            <li>It really does give a luminous look to the skin, especially when used regularly and with the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean cleansing towelettes.</li>
            <li>Hey, where I live, everyone swims and sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little tube of sunscreen, even though you don&#x27;t get much of it for the price, and the SPF is only 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>flat tube is very nice: it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in a bag and it has a flat cap that is much easier to open than a round one but locks down securely.</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I originally thought my wife would be the only user of this product, but soon discovered it was also good for my skin, which is the same basic \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; type as hers -- a little bit greasy around the forehead, but dry on the rest of the face.</li>
            <li>This is Non comedogenic which means no more clogged pores so maybe now my face will clear up and look better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;RECOMMENDATION: This small tube (1.7 oz) and light SPF (15) isn&#x27;t really made for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>will for certain use this in the future after this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li>It has a moderate and pleasant floral scent with a hint of cucumber that, unfortunately, I&#x27;m quite sensitive to, because otherwise, I really like this</li>
            <li>the summer heat seems to bake my face into an old leather shoe.</li>
            <li>I have oily &amp; sensitive skin, so finding moisturizers that 1)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I do wear soft contact lenses, so that may be a contributing</li>
            <li>I had hoped to be able to discontinue the expensive day lotion with SPF15 I&#x27;ve been using but this just isn&#x27;t rich enough.</li>
            <li>I mean, I suppose that all moisturizers make your skin look better.</li>
            <li>The Pond&#x27;s moisturizer formulation is unfortunately too greasy for my skin, I have normal to oily skin and the lotion was just too moisturizing to put it kindly, my face felt sticky and my mineral make-up started caking around my t-zone.  </li>
            <li>I have wasted quite a bit of lotion over the years because it has come out of the bottle too quickly.</li>
            <li>Broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen&lt;</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine for a moisturizer, but as a sunscreen, I have to \\&quot;reapply at least every two hours.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The same thing happened about a week later when an older guy carded me and said, \\&quot;Well, I&#x27;ve never made a mistake that big before.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know that it was this Ponds moisturizer that made these two people think I was so young, but it never happened when I wasn&#x27;t using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some time ago, while I was using this Ponds moisturizer, I was carded at a local pub, which surprised me since I&#x27;m well over 40.</li>
            <li>because I know it works, but if I didn&#x27;t have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li>What we use barely matters.  </li>
            <li>It has a very faint, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The only important thing about moisturizer is that we use it at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that the scent is definitely geared toward &#x27;old lady.</li>
            <li>never really noticed any summertime issues with my skin when I was younger; however, as I get older</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and soft; it&#x27;s vaguely tropical in a soft way.</li>
            <li>When I squeeze the bottle only a little bit of the moisturizer comes out at a time, a feature I really like.</li>
            <li>only drawback, she says, is the tube, which has a twist on cap while she would prefer a pop-up cap -- something about it being hard to grab the cap when your hands are freshly lotioned up.</li>

            <li> but despite those claims on the product information, it&#x27;s still an excellent moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND it has built in sunscreen which is just icing on an already delicious cake.  </li>
            <li> Not the best for standing up on your dresser, but great to carry with you in your purse.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels great going on &amp; absorbs into skin</li>
            <li> i am hoping for great results.</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> so it fits perfectly in my already crowded medicine cabinet and stands up easily on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> this is a very effective product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice.</li>
            <li> stuff is NICE!</li>
            <li> I would happily use this since the price is on point and the product seems good.</li>
            <li> Pleasant is the way to describe it.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this moisturizer, and the scent is also pleasant.  </li>

            <li> Moisturizes fairly well.</li>
            <li> Excellent light weight moisturizer and sun protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> Really good for my oily skin, will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> but it smells good.</li>
            <li> Granted that I have good skin to start with</li>
            <li> But would be great if it had more anti wrinkle into it.</li>
            <li> This one has an SPF of 15 which isn&#x27;t great but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> POND&#x27;S LUMINOUSE MOISTURE DAY SPF 15 LOTION is a great way to protect my skin from more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it contains an SPF in it, which is great for protecting your skin, but it doesn&#x27;t look, feel or smell at all like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this lotion does a good job moisturizing my skin effectively without leaving it feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> best part is, it&#x27;s not very expensive!  </li>
            <li> a light protection for the face and neck, the Pond&#x27;s product is great.</li>
            <li> giving this product a five-star rating because I liked the way it made my face feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes legs look nice to go without nylons</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the product is sold with that kind of thing in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For this kind of use, it&#x27;s a five star sun lotion.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very moisturizing and smells great!  </li>
            <li> this may be a blessing in disguise when it&#x27;s warm out</li>
            <li> Nice aroma and gives me the dewiness I expect from a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the bottle is nice and sleek</li>
            <li> It feels nice and cooling on my skin and the scent</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fits in purse, travel friendly, has a great smell and good light coverage!</li>
            <li> Although the fragrance does smell really good, it is also really strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for more than just face &amp; with SPF 15, great for being in the sun too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very natural scent,reflects sunlight,fresh feeling on about 5-10 minutes &amp; great for</li>
            <li> This product, which I received as part of an Influenster Vox Box, has been effective in making my skin better over the 3 weeks I have been using it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and has good coverage.  </li>
            <li> The things I liked most about it were that it didn&#x27;t feel too oily on my skin and seemed to absorb into my skin rather than hanging around on top, like some do.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty happy with</li>
            <li> Very light on the face not grease</li>
            <li> I also liked that it didn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More over Clinique here comes Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product, but it is just okay.</li>
            <li> product made my face feel a lot better and may have even made it look better.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion, and I use it as a sunblock too.</li>
            <li> However, my favorite thing is the shape of the container.</li>
            <li> I tried this product specifically for the 15 spf because most sunscreens break my face out</li>
            <li> She loves it and swears she looks more &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; and lighter.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it and would say anyone should try this and you will love as well</li>
            <li> As with all SPF products I can&#x27;t be totally sure it&#x27;s offering the sun protection it claims, but don&#x27;t have a reason to doubt that it is.</li>
            <li> I love a moisturizer that contains SPF.</li>
            <li> I really love this product as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> &quot; my skin at all, or makes it any more \\&quot;luminous,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would have thought an item like this would have been more in the $10+ range.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> To me this moisturizer feels like one of the more pricier brands out there.</li>
            <li> I love that it has SPF 15 in</li>
            <li> the very mild, pleasant fragrance dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best I have come across in a long time.</li>
            <li> Its an okay product smells good , but didn&#x27;t really suit my skin , gave 3 stars for price and smell.</li>
            <li> It has a silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin and a pleasant, mild scent.</li>
            <li> This may be a downside if you don&#x27;t want to reorder often, but could also be an upside if you want something that&#x27;s easy to take with you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light floral fragrance that does go away quickly</li>
            <li> It glides on nicely with no heavy feeling, it has a pleasant scent, and the minerals really do make my skin look a bit more \\&quot;luminous.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> mo9WS34W5CWYXH]]I would have liked a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> like that it goes on smoothly and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and it soaks in easily and feels smooth and almost silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> i hope they never discontinue this fine product.</li>
            <li> light, lightly-scented, does NOT burn my eyes, and seems to not cause any skin issues (I get zits really easily if I use something oily or greasy)</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs quickly but still makes my skin feel soft and great.  </li>
            <li> On the Pond&#x27;s side my skin had a nice glow and the makeup over the Pond&#x27;s moisturizer had a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> My wife likes the light fruity smell, which I try not to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightly floral, instead of fruity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Often I have found moisturizers with SPF can smell a bit like sunscreen, but this moisturizer has a very mild clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is a great daily moisturizer for my skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> POND&#x27;S LUMINOUSE MOISTURE DAY SPF 15 LOTION, 1.7 OUNCH, comes in a cute, fun size.</li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;light, non-greasy,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I almost feel like this is a primer, it seems to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> packaging is nice, but that&#x27;s the only nice thing I have to say.</li>
            <li> There is no greasy feeling after application, it absorbs quickly, and is easy to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a good size, flat which makes it easy to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> I have always had problem skin, so I can&#x27;t help but worry, when trying a new product, about what kind of havoc it might wreak on my face.</li>
            <li> nice, light feeling to it; not a heavy &#x27;clog your pores&#x27; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product has a lovely scent, goes on smoothly, and is gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Its very light, non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it which is great because I don&#x27;t love highly fragranced facial lotions, they break me out.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t go out without make-up, but those with naturally beautiful skin will undoubtedly enjoy the brightness it adds to skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a floral smell that is pretty strong, so if you are adverse to fragrance, this might not be the moisturizer for you.</li>
            <li> it a pretty light scent.</li>
            <li> This product, for the most part is pretty gentle too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly luminous about it, but it is by far the best daily moisturizer I have found in it&#x27;s price range.</li>
            <li> I found Ponds Luminous Moisture to be gentle on my face and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I love this product immediately skin feel very soft and the effects were noticeable immediately I received this complements of influenster in the mama box box</li>
            <li> no problem for me &amp; I&#x27;m very sensitive to many perfume</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I can&#x27;t use many of the over-the-counter moisturizers</li>
            <li> It is good for protecting limited areas from the sun, perhaps the nose and ears and the backs of the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a fine job moisturizing with no side effects, and is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> A quality product worth recommending.</li>
            <li> I really liked that because it made my face feel soft, and it was really gentle.</li>
            <li> definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> like that this has SPF in it, it felt non-greasy and absorbed well.  </li>
            <li> , that can also be sensitive, and this has been one of my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I need a little more from a moisturizer in terms of SPF and anti-aging properties, but this product would be great for younger woman.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin sensitive to the sun, wind and products with strong ingredients.  </li>
            <li> do very much like this as a moisturizer and will continue to use it, and I do like that</li>
            <li> surprise, surprise the Pond&#x27;s side actually looked better.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion and the convenient smaller packaging.</li>
            <li> pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one only has SPF 15, which is okay for the winter time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this will be my first time using Ponds Luminous day SPF 15 lotion .</li>
            <li> considering the price, do take note that this is a smaller tube than most lotions come in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my super fancy high end</li>
            <li> (Face must be either freshly washed with a facial cleanser or if no make-up on, I rinse with a clean wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> My wife love it.it protect her face from the sun and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and someone asked me recently if I had \\&quot;had botox done\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s currently listed at less than half that, which is a great bargain for a really effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For the larger areas of my body, I just grab a large cheap tub of No-Ad or Banana Boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle, a kind of sweet scent, very pleasing, yet not over powering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about that</li>
            <li> Again, I don&#x27;t really care one way</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a moisturizer that really protects, then this contains all the ingredients you need, and it makes your skin really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to any Fountain of Youth qualities</li>
            <li> cent is a tad strong,yet smells much like a breeze blowing through jasmine blossoms,so</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about three months, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I hoped this would be light enough to prevent breakouts but still offer some protection.</li>
            <li> I really dislike this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I expected so much more of this product</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> and this really works well for me.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I really like this SPF lotion.</li>
            <li> The days I did wear it were moderature temperature, mid-70&#x27;s, so I wasn&#x27;t sweating much.</li>
            <li> works really well under any foundation.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed that it \\&quot;brightens\\</li>
            <li> lotion is light and non-greasy and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> I like to mix a tiny dab with my foundation to make it look more natural,</li>
            <li> However, it is scented and kind of heavily so - flowery-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it feels so good going on and provides subtle hints of illumination, I like to use this one for my face, forearms, shoulders and chest.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets absorbed very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Since I found it this is the daily cream I use!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m an older woman,</li>
            <li> I have tried many different moisturizers over the years, all different brands and price points.</li>
            <li> If fragrance bothers you, or you don&#x27;t like a fragrance that is strong, then you&#x27;ll want to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because this product has some pretty strong sunscreen ingredients, you may find it irritating if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ponds product goes on clear and soaks right on, leaving a soft, dewy sheen.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves Pond&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It works great for its intended use, but just don&#x27;t be silly and stay in the sun without a heavier-duty sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a shine any sooner than I normally do on my combination</li>
            <li> It really does give a luminous look to the skin, especially when used regularly and with the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean cleansing towelettes.</li>
            <li> Hey, where I live, everyone swims and sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little tube of sunscreen, even though you don&#x27;t get much of it for the price, and the SPF is only 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> flat tube is very nice: it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in a bag and it has a flat cap that is much easier to open than a round one but locks down securely.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I originally thought my wife would be the only user of this product, but soon discovered it was also good for my skin, which is the same basic \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; type as hers -- a little bit greasy around the forehead, but dry on the rest of the face.</li>
            <li> This is Non comedogenic which means no more clogged pores so maybe now my face will clear up and look better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: This small tube (1.7 oz) and light SPF (15) isn&#x27;t really made for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> will for certain use this in the future after this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> It has a moderate and pleasant floral scent with a hint of cucumber that, unfortunately, I&#x27;m quite sensitive to, because otherwise, I really like this</li>
            <li> the summer heat seems to bake my face into an old leather shoe.</li>
            <li> I have oily &amp; sensitive skin, so finding moisturizers that 1)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do wear soft contact lenses, so that may be a contributing</li>
            <li> I had hoped to be able to discontinue the expensive day lotion with SPF15 I&#x27;ve been using but this just isn&#x27;t rich enough.</li>
            <li> I mean, I suppose that all moisturizers make your skin look better.</li>
            <li> The Pond&#x27;s moisturizer formulation is unfortunately too greasy for my skin, I have normal to oily skin and the lotion was just too moisturizing to put it kindly, my face felt sticky and my mineral make-up started caking around my t-zone.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted quite a bit of lotion over the years because it has come out of the bottle too quickly.</li>
            <li> Broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen&lt;</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine for a moisturizer, but as a sunscreen, I have to \\&quot;reapply at least every two hours.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The same thing happened about a week later when an older guy carded me and said, \\&quot;Well, I&#x27;ve never made a mistake that big before.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know that it was this Ponds moisturizer that made these two people think I was so young, but it never happened when I wasn&#x27;t using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some time ago, while I was using this Ponds moisturizer, I was carded at a local pub, which surprised me since I&#x27;m well over 40.</li>
            <li> because I know it works, but if I didn&#x27;t have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li> What we use barely matters.  </li>
            <li> It has a very faint, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The only important thing about moisturizer is that we use it at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that the scent is definitely geared toward &#x27;old lady.</li>
            <li> never really noticed any summertime issues with my skin when I was younger; however, as I get older</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and soft; it&#x27;s vaguely tropical in a soft way.</li>
            <li> When I squeeze the bottle only a little bit of the moisturizer comes out at a time, a feature I really like.</li>
            <li> only drawback, she says, is the tube, which has a twist on cap while she would prefer a pop-up cap -- something about it being hard to grab the cap when your hands are freshly lotioned up.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure how luminous it really makes your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time for a face lotion with sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t reek of sunscreen and I finally found what I am looking for with this!</li>
            <li> but seriously, this Ponds moisturizer feels exactly the same as others I have.  </li>
            <li> I was initially surprised at how inexpensive this product was, but then realized it was because it was such a small bottle (only 1.7 ounces)</li>
            <li> After letting both sides dry a bit I then applied my makeup as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work somewhere where I get hot and dusty and this product was a blessing to have since it does not sweat</li>
            <li> It takes up much less room on the dressing table and is terrific for travel.</li>
            <li> Of course, in my younger years, I could have cared less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, the warnings and directions are just the same as on the moisturizer with SPF protection I was using previous to this, but this one feels nicer</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> wife is careful to stick to products that don&#x27;t close the pores, and she says Ponds fills the bill.</li>
            <li> I put the Pond&#x27;s Luminous on one side and the Clinique on the other.  </li>
            <li> or the other</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink like other sunblocks and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not like other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Small enough for make up bag, not bulky.</li>
            <li> but it was like every other moisturizer I have tried</li>
            <li> and I think was not worth my money.</li>
            <li> less heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested the moisturizer on my hand for three days, but since the skin of my hand is drier and subject to washing I did not foresee that it would have this reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The moisturizer did make my skin feel moisturized, but I would have preferred a less pedestrian scent.</li>
            <li> It says apply liberally, but you also need to stay away from the eye area, which is difficult, especially when you occasionally touch your face/eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to be discontinued as the store where I first bought it no longer has it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t create \\&quot;dewey skin\\&quot; and def is a waste.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this as an everyday moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really a good lotion for the face if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and smells real faint of Roses.</li>
            <li> dry my face out has been tough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is NOT SAFE FOR CONTACT LENS WEARERS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very heavily scented.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel thin and watery, and it&#x27;s not super thick or greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it hard to find something like that that</li>
            <li> sometimes lotion with SPF is very thick and not comfortable to spread on my face.  </li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between this and others, at least not in terms of illumination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Are you serious?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> minerals\\&quot; I sometimes feel a bit like I&#x27;m wearing glitter, but in this case it&#x27;s very subtle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Clinique moisturizing gel (which sadly doesn&#x27;t have a sun screen) for years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This unfortunately did not react well as my skin felt itchy by the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> To bad amazon don&#x27;t sale it anymore</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great stuff. I repeat my order over and over.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so I have to stick with products that don&#x27;t add to my sheen.  I&#x27;ve used the Clinique moisturizing gel (which sadly doesn&#x27;t have a sun screen) for years and I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to compare the two products face-to-face.  I put the Pond&#x27;s Luminous on one side and the Clinique on the other.  After letting both sides dry a bit I then applied my makeup as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And surprise, surprise the Pond&#x27;s side actually looked better.  On the Pond&#x27;s side my skin had a nice glow and the makeup over the Pond&#x27;s moisturizer had a more natural look.  As the day progressed the Pond&#x27;s side didn&#x27;t get any oilier looking than the Clinique side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is definitely a product that I will start using on a regular basis.  More over Clinique here comes Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I originally thought my wife would be the only user of this product, but soon discovered it was also good for my skin, which is the same basic \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; type as hers -- a little bit greasy around the forehead, but dry on the rest of the face. We both use it with satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often daily lotions with sun protection makes the skin shiny, but this product is a bit different. There is no greasy feeling after application, it absorbs quickly, and is easy to rub into the skin. My wife likes the light fruity smell, which I try not to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is careful to stick to products that don&#x27;t close the pores, and she says Ponds fills the bill. I don&#x27;t know much about that but I take her word for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback, she says, is the tube, which has a twist on cap while she would prefer a pop-up cap -- something about it being hard to grab the cap when your hands are freshly lotioned up. Again, I don&#x27;t really care one way or the other but there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a good size, flat which makes it easy to pack when traveling. A quality product worth recommending.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time for a face lotion with sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t reek of sunscreen and I finally found what I am looking for with this! Its very light, non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it which is great because I don&#x27;t love highly fragranced facial lotions, they break me out. This is Non comedogenic which means no more clogged pores so maybe now my face will clear up and look better.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product, but it is just okay. It covers but I was breaking out so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product immediately skin feel very soft and the effects were noticeable immediately I received this complements of influenster in the mama box box</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and the convenient smaller packaging. Fits in purse, travel friendly, has a great smell and good light coverage!</li>
            <li> Before I tried this product I did use the facial wash product. I really liked that because it made my face feel soft, and it was really gentle. This product, for the most part is pretty gentle too. Although the fragrance does smell really good, it is also really strong. Pleasant is the way to describe it. If fragrance bothers you, or you don&#x27;t like a fragrance that is strong, then you&#x27;ll want to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because this product has some pretty strong sunscreen ingredients, you may find it irritating if you have really sensitive skin. However, if you are looking for a moisturizer that really protects, then this contains all the ingredients you need, and it makes your skin really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves Pond&#x27;s products. It works especially well with the facial wash that goes with it.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to be able to discontinue the expensive day lotion with SPF15 I&#x27;ve been using but this just isn&#x27;t rich enough. It&#x27;s o.k. for days at home mixed with  a night cream but it&#x27;s not really a good lotion for the face if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably the only guy reviewing this product, but here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never really noticed any summertime issues with my skin when I was younger; however, as I get older the summer heat seems to bake my face into an old leather shoe. About a year ago, I started sneaking dollops of my wife&#x27;s moisturizers to help combat the desert heat and Ponds Luminous Moisture Day Lotion with SPF15 was one of my favorites to swipe. The things I liked most about it were that it didn&#x27;t feel too oily on my skin and seemed to absorb into my skin rather than hanging around on top, like some do. I also liked that it didn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product made my face feel a lot better and may have even made it look better. Some time ago, while I was using this Ponds moisturizer, I was carded at a local pub, which surprised me since I&#x27;m well over 40. When the waitress saw my age on my drivers license, she exclaimed, \\&quot;Are you serious? Whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep it up.\\&quot; The same thing happened about a week later when an older guy carded me and said, \\&quot;Well, I&#x27;ve never made a mistake that big before.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know that it was this Ponds moisturizer that made these two people think I was so young, but it never happened when I wasn&#x27;t using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product a five-star rating because I liked the way it made my face feel. I can&#x27;t really speak to any Fountain of Youth qualities it may or may not have.</li>
            <li> cent is a tad strong,yet smells much like a breeze blowing through jasmine blossoms,so no problem for me &amp; I&#x27;m very sensitive to many perfume scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too thick or thin. Feels great going on &amp; absorbs into skin pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for more than just face &amp; with SPF 15, great for being in the sun too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very natural scent,reflects sunlight,fresh feeling on about 5-10 minutes &amp; great for everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use as body lotion too in the spring &amp; summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes legs look nice to go without nylons&lt;br /&gt; Perfect for summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hoping to find in bigger bottles!</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion, and I use it as a sunblock too. It doesn&#x27;t stink like other sunblocks and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Seems to even out my tone too.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about three months, and I really like it. Moisturizes fairly well. However, my favorite thing is the shape of the container. It takes up much less room on the dressing table and is terrific for travel.</li>
            <li> I tried this product specifically for the 15 spf because most sunscreens break my face out I hoped this would be light enough to prevent breakouts but still offer some protection. It worked like a charm. No burnt nose and no break outs. Excellent light weight moisturizer and sun protection.</li>
            <li> Very light on the face not grease</li>
            <li> Very heavily scented. Smelled to the point people commented about it.</li>
            <li> This product, which I received as part of an Influenster Vox Box, has been effective in making my skin better over the 3 weeks I have been using it.  It goes on smooth and has good coverage.  I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love this little tube of sunscreen, even though you don&#x27;t get much of it for the price, and the SPF is only 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it feels so good going on and provides subtle hints of illumination, I like to use this one for my face, forearms, shoulders and chest. For the larger areas of my body, I just grab a large cheap tub of No-Ad or Banana Boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ponds product goes on clear and soaks right on, leaving a soft, dewy sheen. The scent is mild and soft; it&#x27;s vaguely tropical in a soft way. Lightly floral, instead of fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is for both UVA and UVB applications, and contains avobenzone, ensulizole and octisalate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed this product running into my eyes when I wear it on my face and go for a run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: This small tube (1.7 oz) and light SPF (15) isn&#x27;t really made for a day at the beach. You&#x27;d use up a tube on one person in one day, over the course of reapplying enough to cover your exposed body. I don&#x27;t think the product is sold with that kind of thing in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a light protection for the face and neck, the Pond&#x27;s product is great. It fits well in my purse and I like the way it feels on my face. The luminous hints add a touch of makeup to a fresh-faced look. For this kind of use, it&#x27;s a five star sun lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pond&#x27;s moisturizer for about two weeks now. I have oily &amp; sensitive skin, so finding moisturizers that 1) don&#x27;t make my face shiny or 2) dry my face out has been tough.  I like the consistency of this moisturizer, and the scent is also pleasant.  Often I have found moisturizers with SPF can smell a bit like sunscreen, but this moisturizer has a very mild clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give the final fifth star because I haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;illuminating&amp;#34; going on with the daily use of this moisturizer. But it is a great daily moisturizer for my skin. I would recommend this product, and I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Its an okay product smells good , but didn&#x27;t really suit my skin , gave 3 stars for price and smell. But it&#x27;s not like other moisturizer. I only recommend it to people with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I really dislike this tinted moisturizer. It doesnt add any color to your skin, especially if you&#x27;re Indian like I am. It doesn&#x27;t create \\&quot;dewey skin\\&quot; and def is a waste. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wear SPF every day. This one only has SPF 15, which is okay for the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it goes on smoothly and absorbs very quickly. It has a very faint, pleasant smell. I&#x27;ve been using the bottle for awhile, and I&#x27;m impressed that it&#x27;s lasted this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed that it gives my skin a luminous effect, though. I mean, I suppose that all moisturizers make your skin look better. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between this and others, at least not in terms of illumination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.it protect her face from the sun and dry skin. To bad amazon don&#x27;t sale it anymore</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy...But would be great if it had more anti wrinkle into it.Small enough for make up bag, not bulky.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this almost daily and is now on her second bottle. She loves it and swears she looks more &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; and lighter. I tried it myself and it soaks in easily and feels smooth and almost silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> I expected so much more of this product but it was like every other moisturizer I have tried and I think was not worth my money.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo9WS34W5CWYXH]]I would have liked a higher SPF. It&#x27;s a bit expensive. And I&#x27;m not sure how luminous it really makes your skin. See video.</li>
            <li> I adore this moisturizer.  It is light and absorbs quickly but still makes my skin feel soft and great.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly luminous about it, but it is by far the best daily moisturizer I have found in it&#x27;s price range.</li>
            <li> this is a very effective product. nice, light feeling to it; not a heavy &#x27;clog your pores&#x27; moisturizer. i hope they never discontinue this fine product. the very mild, pleasant fragrance dissipates quickly. this is wonderful for all day wear &amp; also for bedtime.</li>
            <li> this will be my first time using Ponds Luminous day SPF 15 lotion . i am hoping for great results.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to be discontinued as the store where I first bought it no longer has it.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very moisturizing and smells great!  However after several days use my face broke out all over with pimples.  Had to stop use &amp; once I did my face cleared up.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  I like the consistency, not too runny, not too pasty.  This is now my standard day cream now.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion does a good job moisturizing my skin effectively without leaving it feeling greasy or oily. It really does give a luminous look to the skin, especially when used regularly and with the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean cleansing towelettes. This is my go-to everyday moisturizer. I only wish Ponds also made a luminous night cream.</li>
            <li> Really good for my oily skin, will purchase it again. Use it before my foundation</li>
            <li> i dont know whether it luminizes or anything but it smells good. and it doesnt have the greasy effect. definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> Fabulous lotion. Smooth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this really works well for me.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and use trention on a regular basis.  This makes my skin sensitive to the sun, wind and products with strong ingredients.  sometimes lotion with SPF is very thick and not comfortable to spread on my face.  I found Ponds Luminous Moisture to be gentle on my face and easy to apply.  However, it didn&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; very moisturizing.  this may be a blessing in disguise when it&#x27;s warm out and I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used to use a different brand of 15 spf lotion under my foundation, however I had to be careful not to get it near my eyes, because half-way thru the day, my eyes would start burning and tearing.  What&#x27;s the point, then?  I am using moisturizer in order to protect the skin susceptible to wrinkles (hello? eyes? are you listening?) and if it makes my eyes burn, why am I wearing it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS stuff is NICE! light, lightly-scented, does NOT burn my eyes, and seems to not cause any skin issues (I get zits really easily if I use something oily or greasy) so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this from now on.  I like to mix a tiny dab with my foundation to make it look more natural, less heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a keeper! Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> The Pond&#x27;s moisturizer formulation is unfortunately too greasy for my skin, I have normal to oily skin and the lotion was just too moisturizing to put it kindly, my face felt sticky and my mineral make-up started caking around my t-zone.  Since the SPF for the lotion is only SPF 15, I included additional sunblock to my face.  This unfortunately did not react well as my skin felt itchy by the afternoon.  I ended up washing off  my make-up immediately and re-applying my make-up with my regular moisturizer.  Before I even applied it on my face I tested the moisturizer on my hand for three days, but since the skin of my hand is drier and subject to washing I did not foresee that it would have this reaction.&lt;br /&gt;My aunt who has drier skin is testing this product for me now so this review may be updated</li>
            <li> I am really careful about what I put on my face, I have really really sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this has SPF in it, it felt non-greasy and absorbed well.  However, it is scented and kind of heavily so - flowery- which always scares me in face products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my super fancy high end french face cream because I know it works, but if I didn&#x27;t have such sensitive skin I would happily use this since the price is on point and the product seems good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light floral fragrance that does go away quickly (so no smelling like a flower all day, which gets annoying.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel oily or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel like makeup. No breakouts from it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it&#x27;s inexpensive and has an SPF in it. I&#x27;ve found it hard to find something like that that I actually like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> It works great and so do the products to match it! love it and would say anyone should try this and you will love as well</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on well and wears well under makeup. As with all SPF products I can&#x27;t be totally sure it&#x27;s offering the sun protection it claims, but don&#x27;t have a reason to doubt that it is. When I see the descriptors \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; and \\&quot;illuminating minerals\\&quot; I sometimes feel a bit like I&#x27;m wearing glitter, but in this case it&#x27;s very subtle and I don&#x27;t see any sparkle effect. I don&#x27;t see a shine any sooner than I normally do on my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When considering the price, do take note that this is a smaller tube than most lotions come in. This may be a downside if you don&#x27;t want to reorder often, but could also be an upside if you want something that&#x27;s easy to take with you.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer. Not oily or greasy at all. Gets absorbed very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Since I found it this is the daily cream I use!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I think all moisturizers should include sun protection. This one has an SPF of 15 which isn&#x27;t great but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an older woman, and I need a little more from a moisturizer in terms of SPF and anti-aging properties, but this product would be great for younger woman. The only problem is that the scent is definitely geared toward &#x27;old lady.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer did make my skin feel moisturized, but I would have preferred a less pedestrian scent.</li>
            <li> great product. It needs to soid in stores. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Great face lotion, your skin feels so silky!</li>
            <li> I really like this SPF lotion. I have always had problem skin, so I can&#x27;t help but worry, when trying a new product, about what kind of havoc it might wreak on my face. Thankfully, Pond&#x27;s Luminous Moisturizer caused me no skin issues. It&#x27;s very mild. It has a silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin and a pleasant, mild scent. I typically don&#x27;t go out without make-up, but those with naturally beautiful skin will undoubtedly enjoy the brightness it adds to skin. It&#x27;s not glittery or shimmery, but does brighten up the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot and put it on every morning before I apply my make-up. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product has a lovely scent, goes on smoothly, and is gentle on the skin.  My skin is very sensitive and I can&#x27;t use many of the over-the-counter moisturizers but this one did not irritate at all.  I will buy this product again and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> POND&#x27;S LUMINOUSE MOISTURE DAY SPF 15 LOTION, 1.7 OUNCH, comes in a cute, fun size. Not the best for standing up on your dresser, but great to carry with you in your purse. The fragrance is subtle, a kind of sweet scent, very pleasing, yet not over powering. It does a fine job moisturizing with no side effects, and is gentle to the skin. I love a moisturizer that contains SPF. Of course, in my younger years, I could have cared less. Now days I wish I had listened to others, protecting my skin from the sun to lessen the unwanted and unsightly side effects of sun exposure. POND&#x27;S LUMINOUSE MOISTURE DAY SPF 15 LOTION is a great way to protect my skin from more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product description:&lt;br /&gt;* For bright, luminous skin all day&lt;br /&gt;* Illuminating minerals&lt;br /&gt;* Broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;* Non comedogenic, won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* Dermatologist tested and hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> I really love this product as a moisturizer.  It glides on nicely with no heavy feeling, it has a pleasant scent, and the minerals really do make my skin look a bit more \\&quot;luminous.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ll continue to use this as an everyday moisturizer.  However, I&#x27;m not going to be throwing away my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF level is only 15, but it is broadband spectrum.  That&#x27;s fine for a moisturizer, but as a sunscreen, I have to \\&quot;reapply at least every two hours.\\&quot;  Not really practical if you are busy and also in and out of the sun all day.  Also, if you swim or sweat, you need to use a waterproof sunblock.  Hey, where I live, everyone swims and sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the warnings and directions are just the same as on the moisturizer with SPF protection I was using previous to this, but this one feels nicer and I like the \\&quot;illuminating minerals.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do very much like this as a moisturizer and will continue to use it, and I do like that it has that extra SPF protection.  It works great for its intended use, but just don&#x27;t be silly and stay in the sun without a heavier-duty sunscreen.</li>
            <li> . . . more expensive stuff I have.  Granted that I have good skin to start with but seriously, this Ponds moisturizer feels exactly the same as others I have.  Nice aroma and gives me the dewiness I expect from a moisturizer.  $3.99 each, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.  Get it.  The only important thing about moisturizer is that we use it at least twice a day.  What we use barely matters.  That we use it is is key.  (Face must be either freshly washed with a facial cleanser or if no make-up on, I rinse with a clean wash cloth.  In either case, apply the moisturizer to damp skin.)</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice. It absorbs quick and smells real faint of Roses. I like the fact that it does not feel greasy or \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; off. I work somewhere where I get hot and dusty and this product was a blessing to have since it does not sweat off.&lt;br /&gt;I will for certain use this in the future after this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; quality is negligent.&lt;br /&gt;2. It says \\&quot;light, non-greasy,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not. It makes my skin greasy immediately and especially at so at the end of the day. The days I did wear it were moderature temperature, mid-70&#x27;s, so I wasn&#x27;t sweating much. My daughter touched my face about 20 minutes after I put the lotion on and said, \\&quot;Ewww, what&#x27;s on your face, Mommy?\\&quot; It does say it&#x27;s non-comedogenic. I didn&#x27;t notice any blemishes as a result of wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;3. It says apply liberally, but you also need to stay away from the eye area, which is difficult, especially when you occasionally touch your face/eyes. As a result, my biggest reason for not liking this lotion is that every day I wore it, my eyes watered the ENTIRE day. I do wear soft contact lenses, so that may be a contributing factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT SAFE FOR CONTACT LENS WEARERS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This packaging is nice, but that&#x27;s the only nice thing I have to say.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer.  I have combination skin, that can also be sensitive, and this has been one of my favorite.  I love that it contains an SPF in it, which is great for protecting your skin, but it doesn&#x27;t look, feel or smell at all like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel thin and watery, and it&#x27;s not super thick or greasy at all.  My skin is also prone to breakouts, and switching to this moisturizer hasn&#x27;t caused any difference in the frequency of breakouts in the last month I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well under any foundation.  I apply it after I get out of the shower and have cleansed my face.  I&#x27;ve used liquid foundation, tinted moisturizer, and mineral foundation over it, and it hasn&#x27;t created any sort of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed that it \\&quot;brightens\\&quot; my skin at all, or makes it any more \\&quot;luminous,\\&quot; but despite those claims on the product information, it&#x27;s still an excellent moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, it&#x27;s not very expensive!  I would have thought an item like this would have been more in the $10+ range.  It&#x27;s currently listed at less than half that, which is a great bargain for a really effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Moisture Day Lotion with SPF 15 doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. It has a moderate and pleasant floral scent with a hint of cucumber that, unfortunately, I&#x27;m quite sensitive to, because otherwise, I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is light and non-greasy and absorbs instantly. It is good for protecting limited areas from the sun, perhaps the nose and ears and the backs of the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat tube is very nice: it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in a bag and it has a flat cap that is much easier to open than a round one but locks down securely.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and someone asked me recently if I had \\&quot;had botox done\\&quot;.  I highly recommend it AND it has built in sunscreen which is just icing on an already delicious cake.  :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many different moisturizers over the years, all different brands and price points. I have to say this is the best I have come across in a long time. The shape of the bottle is nice and sleek so it fits perfectly in my already crowded medicine cabinet and stands up easily on it&#x27;s own. When I squeeze the bottle only a little bit of the moisturizer comes out at a time, a feature I really like. I have wasted quite a bit of lotion over the years because it has come out of the bottle too quickly. It feels nice and cooling on my skin and the scent it a pretty light scent. I almost feel like this is a primer, it seems to smooth out my skin. To me this moisturizer feels like one of the more pricier brands out there. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer. It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. I love that it has SPF 15 in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a floral smell that is pretty strong, so if you are adverse to fragrance, this might not be the moisturizer for you. I was initially surprised at how inexpensive this product was, but then realized it was because it was such a small bottle (only 1.7 ounces) - something to be considered when purchasing.</li>
