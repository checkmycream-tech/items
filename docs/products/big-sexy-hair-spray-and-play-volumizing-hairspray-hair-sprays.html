            <li>Best spray around...very fine.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I used to always pay $20 plus tax, so I love that i can now get it cheaper here! :)</li>
            <li>With fine hair I need all the help I can get and this is probably one of the best brands I have used for volume and hold.  </li>
            <li>Very strong hairspray, your hair will not move with this stuff!</li>
            <li>It holds the best out of everything I&#x27;ve tried and it light weight.</li>

            <li>After probably three spray downs my hair was held fairly well.</li>
            <li>Love this spray holds great and keeps hair in place</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply until you are sure you are happy with the style.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is cheaper than in most stores that I have seen, too!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>You will LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>In love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this spray for years and it has remained my favorite volumizer hair spray!</li>
            <li>When I saw this great price I snatched it up right away!!</li>
            <li>Great cut for Florida and fine hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing with the use of mouse, hairspray  and electric jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice hold without adding any weight to the hair.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave residue after shampooing and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice hair spray that will help the hair stay all</li>
            <li>Although it is kind of sticky in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this spray must absorb oil, because I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks and feels cleaner much longer when I use this spray.</li>
            <li>am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Just an all around nice product.</li>
            <li>The scent was surprisingly nice for an aerosol hairspray.</li>
            <li>Huge can - good price.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but its very fine.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this brand!</li>
            <li>but I do find it works the best at holding a style for my hair which is fine and straight</li>
            <li>Holds great in windy, hot or humid days.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
            <li>With the help of this hair spray I can look a bit more in style.</li>
            <li>What I did not like was that, for me anyway, it did not seem to hold up for more than a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this twice :)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite volumizing hair spray.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>was one of the top hair sprays.</li>
            <li>This is my all tine favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>no though since it seems to have more holding power</li>
            <li>I love the big sexy hair products !!!!</li>
            <li>I love the volumizing lift it gives your hair.</li>
            <li>The hairspray works well, the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite tho.</li>
            <li>I also love BSH&#x27;s spray mousse.</li>
            <li>Has a finer spray which I like better even though it costs more money.</li>
            <li>Like it but don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will keep using it probably.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, it&#x27;s been pivotal in stretching out my hair-washing.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>but this is much better.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it and wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li>I have tried many volumizing hairsprays.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Your price is better also.</li>
            <li>so I tried it and love it.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion that I curl my hair, I use this to help hold the curl and it does as good as anything I have found.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will not try anything else</li>
            <li>and I will be sure to use again.</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Always tells me to get her more.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve used, and this giant bottle has lasted me for over a year.</li>
            <li>Only the Best Spray !</li>
            <li>Love tis brand.</li>
            <li>I used sebastian shaper hairspray for many years in my career.</li>
            <li>I did weddings on call for many years</li>
            <li>and when I switched to this hairspray I could work my updos with better finesse.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love that I can comb through my hair or refresh my style without worry.</li>
            <li>Great stuff and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth the money, lasts a long time, excellent product.</li>
            <li>I does give volume to fine hair but can be drying so spray just the areas that need more volume.</li>
            <li>It is light, very light smell, and you can work with your hair easily after you use it.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair products were recommended to me by a friend whose hair always looks great.  </li>
            <li>Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>Hold is strong with out the stiffness you get</li>
            <li>It is so good, I bought four more HUGE cans of it and gave them to all my friends, and now they all threw away their old sprays.</li>
            <li>good news is that the larger nozzle makes scraping off the gunk easier than with tiny spray heads, and I like the coverage it gives the 80% of the time it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Ive been wanting to try this hairspray for a while now, not bad but probably wont repurchase, not any better then the way cheaper brands I&#x27;ve boughten.</li>
            <li>Brushes out fine and washes out well.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair that will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and you can spray it and put it into place.</li>
            <li>Its light, but strong.</li>
            <li>Love the medium firm hold, the scent is non-perfumey and pleasant, and almost took off a star because the nozzle gets gummed up so quickly, as is the issue with really good</li>
            <li>Both the spray &amp; play and the spray &amp; play harder are very good products.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, I kept looking at the huge size of the can</li>
            <li>Great stuff, definitely buy it for cheap on Amazon</li>
            <li>LOL remember aqua net??</li>
            <li>but not one hair moved, like they had helmet on their head, the wind would blow, but their hair, not one hair moved LOL, or a big section would get a gust under their hair and a big section of hair moved lol..</li>
            <li>I found that after several hours my hair would get fuzzy and not hold curl in an attractive manner.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the whole line of products are amazing.</li>
            <li>Hair feels like it has thickness and stays light and bouncy all day</li>
            <li>But, this is the only product that gives my fine hair the texture it needs to do whatever I want it to and still look good</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair, and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products.</li>
            <li>quick light spray to set</li>
            <li>It holds really well, is pretty light, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>:)  Will use this seller again, much easier than trying to find someone with a licenses to buy it at the beauty supply house.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in this.</li>
            <li>but overall really good.</li>
            <li>Good enough that I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t overdue it though because it is pretty strong, but its nothing you can&#x27;t comb out.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was very nicely and carefully put together with box etc.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair is a fantastic product that holds your hair, looks natural, and even smells good.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my fine hair, not too heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>As a note, if I remember to do a quick rinse and finger rub across the sprayer after each use, it never gets gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i just love the big sexy hairspray its not sticky and will hold your hair in place for hours.&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li>Super hold.  </li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brand, but if you want more control I&#x27;d go for one that has a bit more hold.</li>
            <li>Love it, good volume but not overly stiff</li>
            <li>Even if you bought this for the full price I&#x27;d say it was worth it because it lasts forever</li>
            <li>Plus, who doesn&#x27;t want BIG SEXY HAIR!</li>
            <li>I tried BSH products and they are first rate!</li>
            <li>Shipment and delivered as ordered,however, the product is not what I wanted and the nozzle causes the spay to come out in globs rather than spray or mist---even washing with hot water doesn&#x27;t make a difference!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I guess this is useful for updos</li>
            <li>and you are not crazy with it.    </li>
            <li>but, I was absolutely amazed at how much body I had!!!     </li>
            <li>I still had to use bobbypins on the sides though because this didn&#x27;t completely tame my flyaways, but for the most part it held nicely.</li>
            <li>I like that this hairspray provides great &amp;#34;buildable&amp;#34; hold without leaving my hair stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years after trying many, many other brands.  </li>
            <li>it will not hold a curl, slides right out of barrettes etc.</li>
            <li>quick all over spray with big sexy hairspray&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose this is a good product for people who simply want bigger volume, as it helps a bit with that, but I was looking for HUGE volume, and this didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>Lol.. And no, I did not put a lot on, no more then I do with my tresesme hair spray and my hair</li>
            <li>My first ever review of a hair/beauty product, this stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look very natural and is incredible stiff to the touch.</li>
            <li>Even after running a fine toothed comb through my hair it still looked natural.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray, it&#x27;s wonderful for adding volume and only takes a little to last the whole day.</li>
            <li>First of all, this stuff is sticky - it sticks to your arms, clothes, etc.  </li>
            <li>I does exactly as advertised:  </li>
            <li>With this, I spray all over my hair first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using anything but Big Sexy Hair  Hairspray.</li>
            <li>Also use the Big Sexy mousse.</li>
            <li>Is it worth so much money?  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty short--just under my ears--</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and it leaves no nasty residue.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using it</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair volumizing hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I know this wasn&#x27;t super-control hold xxxx, but when I use a hairspray I expect it to be able to hold back a piece of hair that weighs .000002 oz.</li>
            <li>Yes, the price for the spray is 5 times or more than the average sprays, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite hairspray; I have hair that tends to fall flat</li>
            <li>Your hair may feel a bit stiffer, depending on how much  you use, but definitely not like most hairsprays; my hair stays natural-looking, not molded into place.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is a good uni-sex aroma, it won&#x27;t flake or show, washes out easily and a little bit goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will come in handy on wet windy winter days when nothing else will hold but any other time I&#x27;ve got to use something with a more &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; hold.</li>
            <li>No white flakes, brushes out easily.  </li>
            <li>This hair spray is just to stiff for me, it reminds me of the girls in high school their hair looked really good</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and cut short in what&#x27;s called an inverted bob.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair that requires some teasing and help to get body into it.  </li>
            <li>Also the delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, has a light fragrance, and it actually works.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I do like this spray and hold very well.</li>
            <li>but then that is just another step in getting ready.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to really scratch at it with a fingernail, or wash the nozzle after spraying.</li>
            <li>really like this product...</li>
            <li>It really does keep my hair volumized.</li>
            <li>and this really works for me.  </li>
            <li>It holds very well but is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I buy this on Amazon, as it is much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>It really does hold a style all day</li>
            <li>I really like it and even bought some for my daughter in law.  </li>
            <li>And a whole lot cheaper than I could buy elsewhere..</li>
            <li>I look like I have twice as much hair</li>
            <li>it really stays.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight as could be and like trying to do something with corn silk...</li>
            <li>any light and volumizing mousse - entire head&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I use this spray after curling and under my roots, it really adds volume.</li>
            <li>Holds very well.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>so I always try to find hairspray that helps the ends from curling, but this product does not help with frizzing, curled ends, or really anything at all.</li>
            <li>About 70% of the hair will somewhat stay straight, but Suave doesn&#x27;t work for my hair either.</li>
            <li>so I underestimated how much of this I would have to put on.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to wipe off the spray nozzle with a warm washcloth to open it back up when it gets tacky</li>
            <li>Makes my flat, fine hair look much fuller.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray any other time</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other sprays, but none of them offer the hold and texture this spray does.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone  who like me, has super fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I have super flat hair and although it does flatten out a little as the day goes on, nothing like my hair is used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this product, as it is a good holding hairpsray for general use, but it just did not completely meet my standards.  </li>
            <li>the spraying action is consistent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and waaaay cheaper, but definitely not as good as this--not as volumizing or functional.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it really works!</li>
            <li>Love this hair spray, it gives my thin and fine hair the ump lift it needs.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey though, so may stick to an previous favorite.</li>
            <li>(mainly applied to ends)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray at a cheaper price than the salon will definitely be ordering via amazon for my future hair spray</li>
            <li>I can finally curl my hair, BIG AND SEXY.  </li>
            <li>Never have to worry able is looking a mess</li>
            <li>so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Costs a little more but it delivers in manageability and hold.  </li>
            <li>overall good, but the heading of \\&quot;spray and play\\&quot; made me think it might not hold too stiff, but it does hold pretty hard...not crunchy or anything but not as soft a hold as I was hoping for...but that is probaly me since it doesn&#x27;t claim to be a soft hold.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a soft and gentle hold that works...</li>
            <li>It is rather wet when you first apply it, so that you can shape your hair before it dries, which can be useful -</li>
            <li>As hair spray goes, this is long lasting and does give hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>, I definitely am getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds pretty well but not as good as other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have bought hair sprays for several years, and had never quite found the right on for me.  </li>
            <li>I can literally make my chin length hair stand straight up with the hair spray alone, and just as easily coax it back down by gently combing through.</li>
            <li>Then I can curl it with a curling iron(which is rare, my straight hair never wants to curl).</li>
            <li>; My hair is naturally almost spiraled, they&#x27;re like messy curls that are cute and everything, but I like to straighten my hair a lot.</li>
            <li>The last hair spray that I used of this quality was available only in salons and high-end department stores.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it holds it in place without my hair feeling like it been glued down.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents and this one does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>I find that it is important to work through your hair a bit after you spray because it can make your hair stiff, if you put too much in.  </li>
            <li>It was a fair price online and a little more expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li>It is good at keeping flyaways down for half up/bun/pony tail styles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well..  :O)</li>
            <li>When I use this stuff, I can wake up, and my hair is in the same shape as when I went to sleep...for real!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you clean the front of the spray from time to time or it will spray weird at times.</li>
            <li>It really works and has not made my hair look &amp;#34;unmovable&amp;#34; as long as I do not use too much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often use hairspray--the last one I bought is still mostly full after two years of owning it, so I don&#x27;t an extensive repertoire of products to balance this against.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine and also becoming very thin.  </li>
            <li>My hair is snow white and more than half the way to my waist</li>
            <li>I have hard to manage hair and Spray and Play makes it much more managable.  </li>
            <li>excellent, did what it promised, even holds my thick crazy hair in perfect position during these humid muggy summer months.  </li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell, people around me thought I was drinking because it smelled like alcohol haha.</li>
            <li>I can either style my hair and spray it into nearly permanent place</li>
            <li>or I can spray it onto my hair after a blow out and comb through for a soft touchable hold that provides texture as well.</li>
            <li>(stays where you put it but is soft and controlled).  </li>
            <li>if I curl my hair frequently).  </li>
            <li>recently ran out of this product and tried some alternatives in between getting my next bottle of big sexy hairspray, but all fall short</li>
            <li>I was going through my old Amazon orders, and</li>
            <li>why forced to write 3 more words?</li>
            <li>I live in the South and we have nasty hot and humid summers, this hair spray is incredible!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just get ready to get shot in the eye, or spray down the mirror, or watch it shoot spray straight up in the air.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for hair spray the other day and it was right in front of me</li>
            <li>I wore my hair pulled back in a high ponytail because my hair wasn&#x27;t cooperating</li>
            <li>Previously I used Tresemme, the firm kind.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the extra bucks because it last a long time</li>
            <li>I have wasted sooo much money on hair products that make \\&quot;super hold\\&quot;, \\&quot;extreme body\\&quot; type claims.</li>
            <li>Style stays all day long, tons of value, and my hair is not hard, crunchy, and sticky.  </li>
            <li>I turned the can from side to side and it was obvious that it was only half full.</li>
            <li>Other sprays seemed to increase the breakage I was having trouble controlling, but this spray keeps your style in place and combs out easily with minimum hair falling out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Redken products, so I hate to say it, but I like this better than the product I was using.  </li>
            <li>As I grow older, my hair has been falling out at alarming rates.</li>
            <li>Infact, when I let my hair down later all I had to do was brush my hair out and it felt like I had never had hairspray in in the first place.</li>
            <li>Will not let u down , very highly recommend this and the hair gel</li>
            <li>I blow dry as fluffy and full as possible, spray, and what a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, but fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Only hairspray that works on my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long curly hair that I blow dry to straighten and then curl with either a 1 1/2 inch Hot Tool curling iron or Conair pink rollers.  </li>

            <li> Best spray around...very fine.</li>
            <li> Best of all, I used to always pay $20 plus tax, so I love that i can now get it cheaper here! :)</li>
            <li> With fine hair I need all the help I can get and this is probably one of the best brands I have used for volume and hold.  </li>
            <li> Very strong hairspray, your hair will not move with this stuff!</li>
            <li> It holds the best out of everything I&#x27;ve tried and it light weight.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t apply until you are sure you are happy with the style.</li>

            <li> You will LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> In love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for years and it has remained my favorite volumizer hair spray!</li>
            <li> When I saw this great price I snatched it up right away!!</li>
            <li> Great cut for Florida and fine hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing with the use of mouse, hairspray  and electric jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice hold without adding any weight to the hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave residue after shampooing and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair spray that will help the hair stay all</li>
            <li> Although it is kind of sticky in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Best of all, this spray must absorb oil, because I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks and feels cleaner much longer when I use this spray.</li>
            <li> am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Just an all around nice product.</li>
            <li> The scent was surprisingly nice for an aerosol hairspray.</li>
            <li> Huge can - good price.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but its very fine.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brand!</li>
            <li> but I do find it works the best at holding a style for my hair which is fine and straight</li>
            <li> Holds great in windy, hot or humid days.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
            <li> With the help of this hair spray I can look a bit more in style.</li>
            <li> What I did not like was that, for me anyway, it did not seem to hold up for more than a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite volumizing hair spray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> was one of the top hair sprays.</li>
            <li> This is my all tine favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li> no though since it seems to have more holding power</li>
            <li> I love the big sexy hair products !!!!</li>
            <li> I love the volumizing lift it gives your hair.</li>
            <li> The hairspray works well, the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite tho.</li>
            <li> I also love BSH&#x27;s spray mousse.</li>
            <li> Has a finer spray which I like better even though it costs more money.</li>
            <li> Like it but don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will keep using it probably.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, it&#x27;s been pivotal in stretching out my hair-washing.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li> but this is much better.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many volumizing hairsprays.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Your price is better also.</li>
            <li> so I tried it and love it.</li>
            <li> On the rare occasion that I curl my hair, I use this to help hold the curl and it does as good as anything I have found.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will not try anything else</li>
            <li> and I will be sure to use again.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Always tells me to get her more.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve used, and this giant bottle has lasted me for over a year.</li>
            <li> Only the Best Spray !</li>
            <li> Love tis brand.</li>
            <li> I used sebastian shaper hairspray for many years in my career.</li>
            <li> I did weddings on call for many years</li>
            <li> and when I switched to this hairspray I could work my updos with better finesse.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love that I can comb through my hair or refresh my style without worry.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth the money, lasts a long time, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I does give volume to fine hair but can be drying so spray just the areas that need more volume.</li>
            <li> It is light, very light smell, and you can work with your hair easily after you use it.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair products were recommended to me by a friend whose hair always looks great.  </li>
            <li> Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> Hold is strong with out the stiffness you get</li>
            <li> It is so good, I bought four more HUGE cans of it and gave them to all my friends, and now they all threw away their old sprays.</li>
            <li> good news is that the larger nozzle makes scraping off the gunk easier than with tiny spray heads, and I like the coverage it gives the 80% of the time it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Ive been wanting to try this hairspray for a while now, not bad but probably wont repurchase, not any better then the way cheaper brands I&#x27;ve boughten.</li>
            <li> Brushes out fine and washes out well.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is baby fine</li>
            <li> I have fine thinning hair that will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and you can spray it and put it into place.</li>
            <li> Its light, but strong.</li>
            <li> Love the medium firm hold, the scent is non-perfumey and pleasant, and almost took off a star because the nozzle gets gummed up so quickly, as is the issue with really good</li>
            <li> Both the spray &amp; play and the spray &amp; play harder are very good products.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I kept looking at the huge size of the can</li>
            <li> Great stuff, definitely buy it for cheap on Amazon</li>
            <li> LOL remember aqua net??</li>
            <li> but not one hair moved, like they had helmet on their head, the wind would blow, but their hair, not one hair moved LOL, or a big section would get a gust under their hair and a big section of hair moved lol..</li>
            <li> I found that after several hours my hair would get fuzzy and not hold curl in an attractive manner.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the whole line of products are amazing.</li>
            <li> Hair feels like it has thickness and stays light and bouncy all day</li>
            <li> But, this is the only product that gives my fine hair the texture it needs to do whatever I want it to and still look good</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair, and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products.</li>
            <li> quick light spray to set</li>
            <li> It holds really well, is pretty light, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> :)  Will use this seller again, much easier than trying to find someone with a licenses to buy it at the beauty supply house.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in this.</li>
            <li> but overall really good.</li>
            <li> Good enough that I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t overdue it though because it is pretty strong, but its nothing you can&#x27;t comb out.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was very nicely and carefully put together with box etc.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair is a fantastic product that holds your hair, looks natural, and even smells good.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my fine hair, not too heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> As a note, if I remember to do a quick rinse and finger rub across the sprayer after each use, it never gets gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i just love the big sexy hairspray its not sticky and will hold your hair in place for hours.&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li> Super hold.  </li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brand, but if you want more control I&#x27;d go for one that has a bit more hold.</li>
            <li> Love it, good volume but not overly stiff</li>
            <li> Even if you bought this for the full price I&#x27;d say it was worth it because it lasts forever</li>
            <li> Plus, who doesn&#x27;t want BIG SEXY HAIR!</li>
            <li> I tried BSH products and they are first rate!</li>
            <li> Shipment and delivered as ordered,however, the product is not what I wanted and the nozzle causes the spay to come out in globs rather than spray or mist---even washing with hot water doesn&#x27;t make a difference!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, and this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I guess this is useful for updos</li>
            <li> and you are not crazy with it.    </li>
            <li> but, I was absolutely amazed at how much body I had!!!     </li>
            <li> I still had to use bobbypins on the sides though because this didn&#x27;t completely tame my flyaways, but for the most part it held nicely.</li>
            <li> I like that this hairspray provides great &amp;#34;buildable&amp;#34; hold without leaving my hair stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years after trying many, many other brands.  </li>
            <li> it will not hold a curl, slides right out of barrettes etc.</li>
            <li> quick all over spray with big sexy hairspray&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose this is a good product for people who simply want bigger volume, as it helps a bit with that, but I was looking for HUGE volume, and this didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Lol.. And no, I did not put a lot on, no more then I do with my tresesme hair spray and my hair</li>
            <li> My first ever review of a hair/beauty product, this stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look very natural and is incredible stiff to the touch.</li>
            <li> Even after running a fine toothed comb through my hair it still looked natural.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray, it&#x27;s wonderful for adding volume and only takes a little to last the whole day.</li>
            <li> First of all, this stuff is sticky - it sticks to your arms, clothes, etc.  </li>
            <li> I does exactly as advertised:  </li>
            <li> With this, I spray all over my hair first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using anything but Big Sexy Hair  Hairspray.</li>
            <li> Also use the Big Sexy mousse.</li>
            <li> Is it worth so much money?  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty short--just under my ears--</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and it leaves no nasty residue.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using it</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair volumizing hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I know this wasn&#x27;t super-control hold xxxx, but when I use a hairspray I expect it to be able to hold back a piece of hair that weighs .000002 oz.</li>
            <li> Yes, the price for the spray is 5 times or more than the average sprays, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite hairspray; I have hair that tends to fall flat</li>
            <li> Your hair may feel a bit stiffer, depending on how much  you use, but definitely not like most hairsprays; my hair stays natural-looking, not molded into place.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is a good uni-sex aroma, it won&#x27;t flake or show, washes out easily and a little bit goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will come in handy on wet windy winter days when nothing else will hold but any other time I&#x27;ve got to use something with a more &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; hold.</li>
            <li> No white flakes, brushes out easily.  </li>
            <li> This hair spray is just to stiff for me, it reminds me of the girls in high school their hair looked really good</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and cut short in what&#x27;s called an inverted bob.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair that requires some teasing and help to get body into it.  </li>
            <li> Also the delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, has a light fragrance, and it actually works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I do like this spray and hold very well.</li>
            <li> but then that is just another step in getting ready.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to really scratch at it with a fingernail, or wash the nozzle after spraying.</li>
            <li> really like this product...</li>
            <li> It really does keep my hair volumized.</li>
            <li> and this really works for me.  </li>
            <li> It holds very well but is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I buy this on Amazon, as it is much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> It really does hold a style all day</li>
            <li> I really like it and even bought some for my daughter in law.  </li>
            <li> And a whole lot cheaper than I could buy elsewhere..</li>
            <li> I look like I have twice as much hair</li>
            <li> it really stays.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight as could be and like trying to do something with corn silk...</li>
            <li> any light and volumizing mousse - entire head&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I use this spray after curling and under my roots, it really adds volume.</li>
            <li> Holds very well.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> so I always try to find hairspray that helps the ends from curling, but this product does not help with frizzing, curled ends, or really anything at all.</li>
            <li> About 70% of the hair will somewhat stay straight, but Suave doesn&#x27;t work for my hair either.</li>
            <li> so I underestimated how much of this I would have to put on.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to wipe off the spray nozzle with a warm washcloth to open it back up when it gets tacky</li>
            <li> Makes my flat, fine hair look much fuller.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray any other time</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other sprays, but none of them offer the hold and texture this spray does.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone  who like me, has super fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I have super flat hair and although it does flatten out a little as the day goes on, nothing like my hair is used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product, as it is a good holding hairpsray for general use, but it just did not completely meet my standards.  </li>
            <li> the spraying action is consistent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and waaaay cheaper, but definitely not as good as this--not as volumizing or functional.  </li>
            <li> Wow, it really works!</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray, it gives my thin and fine hair the ump lift it needs.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey though, so may stick to an previous favorite.</li>
            <li> (mainly applied to ends)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray at a cheaper price than the salon will definitely be ordering via amazon for my future hair spray</li>
            <li> I can finally curl my hair, BIG AND SEXY.  </li>
            <li> Never have to worry able is looking a mess</li>
            <li> so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Costs a little more but it delivers in manageability and hold.  </li>
            <li> overall good, but the heading of \\&quot;spray and play\\&quot; made me think it might not hold too stiff, but it does hold pretty hard...not crunchy or anything but not as soft a hold as I was hoping for...but that is probaly me since it doesn&#x27;t claim to be a soft hold.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a soft and gentle hold that works...</li>
            <li> It is rather wet when you first apply it, so that you can shape your hair before it dries, which can be useful -</li>
            <li> As hair spray goes, this is long lasting and does give hair more volume.  </li>
            <li> , I definitely am getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds pretty well but not as good as other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have bought hair sprays for several years, and had never quite found the right on for me.  </li>
            <li> I can literally make my chin length hair stand straight up with the hair spray alone, and just as easily coax it back down by gently combing through.</li>
            <li> Then I can curl it with a curling iron(which is rare, my straight hair never wants to curl).</li>
            <li> ; My hair is naturally almost spiraled, they&#x27;re like messy curls that are cute and everything, but I like to straighten my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> The last hair spray that I used of this quality was available only in salons and high-end department stores.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it holds it in place without my hair feeling like it been glued down.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents and this one does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> I find that it is important to work through your hair a bit after you spray because it can make your hair stiff, if you put too much in.  </li>
            <li> It was a fair price online and a little more expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> It is good at keeping flyaways down for half up/bun/pony tail styles.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well..  :O)</li>
            <li> When I use this stuff, I can wake up, and my hair is in the same shape as when I went to sleep...for real!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you clean the front of the spray from time to time or it will spray weird at times.</li>
            <li> It really works and has not made my hair look &amp;#34;unmovable&amp;#34; as long as I do not use too much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use hairspray--the last one I bought is still mostly full after two years of owning it, so I don&#x27;t an extensive repertoire of products to balance this against.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine and also becoming very thin.  </li>
            <li> My hair is snow white and more than half the way to my waist</li>
            <li> I have hard to manage hair and Spray and Play makes it much more managable.  </li>
            <li> excellent, did what it promised, even holds my thick crazy hair in perfect position during these humid muggy summer months.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell, people around me thought I was drinking because it smelled like alcohol haha.</li>
            <li> I can either style my hair and spray it into nearly permanent place</li>
            <li> or I can spray it onto my hair after a blow out and comb through for a soft touchable hold that provides texture as well.</li>
            <li> (stays where you put it but is soft and controlled).  </li>
            <li> if I curl my hair frequently).  </li>
            <li> recently ran out of this product and tried some alternatives in between getting my next bottle of big sexy hairspray, but all fall short</li>
            <li> I was going through my old Amazon orders, and</li>
            <li> why forced to write 3 more words?</li>
            <li> I live in the South and we have nasty hot and humid summers, this hair spray is incredible!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just get ready to get shot in the eye, or spray down the mirror, or watch it shoot spray straight up in the air.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for hair spray the other day and it was right in front of me</li>
            <li> I wore my hair pulled back in a high ponytail because my hair wasn&#x27;t cooperating</li>
            <li> Previously I used Tresemme, the firm kind.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the extra bucks because it last a long time</li>
            <li> I have wasted sooo much money on hair products that make \\&quot;super hold\\&quot;, \\&quot;extreme body\\&quot; type claims.</li>
            <li> Style stays all day long, tons of value, and my hair is not hard, crunchy, and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I turned the can from side to side and it was obvious that it was only half full.</li>
            <li> Other sprays seemed to increase the breakage I was having trouble controlling, but this spray keeps your style in place and combs out easily with minimum hair falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Redken products, so I hate to say it, but I like this better than the product I was using.  </li>
            <li> As I grow older, my hair has been falling out at alarming rates.</li>
            <li> Infact, when I let my hair down later all I had to do was brush my hair out and it felt like I had never had hairspray in in the first place.</li>
            <li> Will not let u down , very highly recommend this and the hair gel</li>
            <li> I blow dry as fluffy and full as possible, spray, and what a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, but fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Only hairspray that works on my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair that I blow dry to straighten and then curl with either a 1 1/2 inch Hot Tool curling iron or Conair pink rollers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought tons of high end different sprays, and felt that they were all too heavy for something that still didnt hold a curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My main praise for this hairspray was the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t look stiff, greasy, and crunchy after applying it.</li>
            <li> It works well; whether I have a long or short cut.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Can be so helpful to give volume to flat hair.</li>
            <li> so long it would have been gone that very same month...</li>
            <li> I felt it last long, doesn&#x27;t need a lot of product to do the job.</li>
            <li> This hair spray holds tight, does not have a strong or long lasting scent and doesn&#x27;t leave little dried drops on my hair.</li>
            <li> Even little old ladies like this stuff!</li>
            <li> I spray under my hair sections where I want volume, blow dry for 5-10 seconds, comb hair back, and WHA-LA!!!</li>
            <li> Only issue would be that you have to clean the nozzle every now and then, the spray gets clumped and it makes the bottle spray in weird directions.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but keeps it in place.</li>
            <li> Holds all day long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it would have taken to use</li>
            <li> I only buy the Spray &amp; Play Harder</li>
            <li> Holds all day long.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it does not weight your hair down, and gives it amazing volume and stay power without just a small amount of spray!  </li>
            <li> I felt I had to use a lot of the spray to get the desired result, only to have gusts of wind ruin my look, or else the other tragedy-helmet head.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different products (changing shampoos, conditioners, mousse, and hairsprays - even other styling products).  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 3 days because it is very long and color-treated.</li>
            <li> Now, when my hair is ALMOST dry, I spray some in my hands, rub them together, and then rub my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> towel dry</li>
            <li> Let hair loose after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it to add a little volume, but that only lasts about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that it dulls the hair a little after sprayed.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a foundation, and then firm up with Tresemme Tres Two Extra Hold Hair Spray, 11 Ounce.</li>
            <li> I should have bought the spray and play harder.  </li>
            <li> It does add volume with absolutely no gunk.  </li>
            <li> On average I get 2 months out of it with my medium to long hair, and sometimes 3 months when my hair is shorter.  </li>
            <li> Hold head upside down after blowing it dry 90% and, spray hair at the root, then  mist all over and use my hands to place the hair where I want it to stay all day.</li>
            <li> By the time it dried out, my hair had fallen flat, and so it stayed that way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel like you have been polluted with cancerous fumes with this product either, as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> not a very touchable look!</li>
            <li> I bought this due to</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even feel half empty, and it&#x27;s a fixture of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I have short  thick hair that I style like Nick Wooster.</li>
            <li> Then I flip my head upside down and spray all over.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was less than at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I would imagine the hairspray would work well on any hair type, though the mousse would give serious volume overload to anyone with thick hair or hair that has natural body to it.</li>
            <li> I usually just fluff it up a little, spray again and roll.  </li>
            <li> She coached me a little on how to use it.</li>
            <li> then the wind blows or little rain</li>
            <li> This, however, allows me to spray a little and still have movement along with hold.</li>
            <li> It does not flake and if I want to freshen it up a little water and running my fingers through my hair will do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After styling my hair, I use this product to \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; it up a little bit and give it some life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to spray the product without it spraying out harshly in one solid area.</li>
            <li> It will give your hair a firm hold, but is lightweight and won&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> If I use this hairspray everyday, I can get 1-3 months out of it (depending on</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Holds well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky</li>
            <li> Is not sticky or heavy but holds style.</li>
            <li> Holds my styled hair firmly and even on</li>
            <li> For about 6 months to a year I used this product almost everyday and it worked 30/100.</li>
            <li> That being said, I did find an opportunity to use this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> The spray holds firm yet remains flexible and doesn&#x27;t make it too dirty, and it smells much lighter.</li>
            <li> it is a little stiff hold.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff or crunchy.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is a bit stiff when you use it.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because my hair is stiff and hard even when I use a little.  </li>
            <li> She said that I could return it with reciept if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Use your smarts and consider it to be the amount of a small to medium</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where I got this or how I ended up with it</li>
            <li> it stay on u r haire longer small amount</li>
            <li> I can usually go two days without having to shampoo it out</li>
            <li> and I was not satisfied, so I decided to try this one since it was in my girlfriends drawer.</li>
            <li> so not sure how the hairspray will stack up as I grow my hair out.  </li>
            <li> Leaves no residue behind when you brush after using it, hair stilol has no flaky stuff like other hair sprays I have used.  </li>
            <li> With longer hair, I like a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t spray it stiff!</li>
            <li> , they thought they would mess up their hair!!</li>
            <li> Use sparingly as it get very stiff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, hard hold without looking like you have a bunch of hairspray holding everything together.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to recommend.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this as my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; hairspray, while keeping my coveted (and hard to find) \\&quot;Spray and Play Harder\\</li>
            <li> It also gives some hair a hard and darker color when applied sometimes making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> My complaint is the nozzle.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> While I hated to pay over $12 for hair spray, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Until this product, even the &amp;#34;Super-Mega Hold&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;Ultimate Hold&amp;#34; sprays would never quite hold my curly thick hair, and the smells were unbearable.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel thick or tacky when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Not amazing or a must have</li>
            <li> and looks dirty if I don&#x27;t wash it every single day.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and normally hate hairspray because it leaves my hair sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> would give this product 4/5 stars because it was unable to tame all of my flyaways.</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair very very stiff and feels disgusting unless you brush it out, but then it makes your hair very greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of smelly sprays that actually attracted dirt and made my hair into a hair helmet.</li>
            <li> It fuses your hair into one big plastic helmet :(</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I was *not* a fan of hairspray, having relatively thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> In my book this brand is slightly expensive</li>
            <li> LIKE I AM UNABLE TO RETURN.  </li>
            <li> As you can imagine, it was extremely expensive by comparison.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really angry!</li>
            <li> so maybe it was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Does hairspray go bad?</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it, good volume but not overly stiff</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine hair, not too heavy or sticky.  Great product</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product!  No complains!!</li>
            <li> I have hard to manage hair and Spray and Play makes it much more managable.  Also the delivery was very prompt. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  My hair is extremely fine and also becoming very thin.  With the help of this hair spray I can look a bit more in style.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used this, I wouldn&#x27;t try anything else. For ultimate volume, part hair into several sections, pin up, and spray liberally. Let hair loose after about 20 minutes. It&#x27;s lightweight, has a light fragrance, and it actually works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Don&#x27;t expect to run your fingers through your hair after applying it. It will hold my up-dos all day. I&#x27;ve tried using it to add a little volume, but that only lasts about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I does give volume to fine hair but can be drying so spray just the areas that need more volume. I do like this spray and hold very well.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice hold without adding any weight to the hair.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that it dulls the hair a little after sprayed.  May chose to use a shine serum to correct but then that is just another step in getting ready.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product, as it is a good holding hairpsray for general use, but it just did not completely meet my standards.  First of all, this stuff is sticky - it sticks to your arms, clothes, etc.  This I can deal with though.  What I did not like was that, for me anyway, it did not seem to hold up for more than a couple hours.  It is rather wet when you first apply it, so that you can shape your hair before it dries, which can be useful - but that was not what I was looking for.  By the time it dried out, my hair had fallen flat, and so it stayed that way.  I suppose this is a good product for people who simply want bigger volume, as it helps a bit with that, but I was looking for HUGE volume, and this didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> A friend who works in a salon turned me on to this hair spray. I was sick and tired of smelly sprays that actually attracted dirt and made my hair into a hair helmet. This is a MIRACLE hair spray. It is light, very light smell, and you can work with your hair easily after you use it. It is so good, I bought four more HUGE cans of it and gave them to all my friends, and now they all threw away their old sprays. How is that for a recommendation?</li>
            <li> I guess this is useful for updos but it doesn&#x27;t look very natural and is incredible stiff to the touch. It fuses your hair into one big plastic helmet :( not a very touchable look! Brushes out fine and washes out well.</li>
            <li> If this wasn&#x27;t the best hair spray at a tolerable price, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.  It works well; whether I have a long or short cut. Fragrance is a good uni-sex aroma, it won&#x27;t flake or show, washes out easily and a little bit goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get ready to get shot in the eye, or spray down the mirror, or watch it shoot spray straight up in the air.  I don&#x27;t get it.  Buy a $1 bottle of hair spray and the spraying action is consistent. The nozzle gums up and then there is no telling which direction the spray is heading. You&#x27;ll need to really scratch at it with a fingernail, or wash the nozzle after spraying. (Do you think you&#x27;ll remember to do that? Nope...)  Few things are more aggravating than after you&#x27;ve just woken up, are running late, then you shoot yourself in the eye with hairspray.  Great product... **** dispenser!!!</li>
            <li> I had my hair cut yesterday at a $13.00 hair cut salon. The gal that cut my hair used this product on my hair and sorta&#x27; tried to sell it to me. I have wasted sooo much money on hair products that make \\&quot;super hold\\&quot;, \\&quot;extreme body\\&quot; type claims. So, I did not buy the hairspray and told her that I would give it a day and see what happens.    She coached me a little on how to use it. Hold head upside down after blowing it dry 90% and, spray hair at the root, then  mist all over and use my hands to place the hair where I want it to stay all day. That&#x27;s just how she used this product on me.    My hair is fine and cut short in what&#x27;s called an inverted bob. Great cut for Florida and fine hair but, I havent seen body since my mid 40&#x27;s and I&#x27;m now 53.     I slept on it last night and, woke up this morning with \\&quot;ain&#x27;t gonna happen unless I shampoo and style\\&quot; hair but, I was absolutely amazed at how much body I had!!!     I did go back to the \\&quot;salon\\&quot; today and bought a can, the 10.5 oz. To my BIG SUPRISE, it was $20.00!!!! Twenty dollars for  hair spray, IN THIS ECONOMY????!!! Before purchasing, I kept looking at the huge size of the can but the weight did&#x27;nt seem to justifiy the size. I turned the can from side to side and it was obvious that it was only half full. I asked if this was a can that someone had returned and she said \\&quot;No, our shelves were stocked a couple of days ago\\&quot;. Hmmm...must buy a scale.    She said that I could return it with reciept if not satisfied. I&#x27;ll try it tomorrow and may or not keep it depending on how my style holds up in 89 degree temperature and humidity.    The big and tall size of the can is obviously all about selling the idea of \\&quot;bigger hair\\&quot;. Definately NOT bigger amounts of PRODUCT. Buy the big can if you want. Use your smarts and consider it to be the amount of a small to medium can that will last you about one month if you have short hair and you are not crazy with it.    I&#x27;ll try it and get back with ya&#x27; on all aspects of this review.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray.  It holds well, but doesn&#x27;t make it sticky or crunchy.</li>
            <li> really like this product...I&#x27;ve ordered this twice :)</li>
            <li> Best hairspray.  No white flakes, brushes out easily.  Holds all day long.  Only issue would be that you have to clean the nozzle every now and then, the spray gets clumped and it makes the bottle spray in weird directions.  But that&#x27;s hairspray for ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, hard hold without looking like you have a bunch of hairspray holding everything together.</li>
            <li> While I hated to pay over $12 for hair spray, it was worth it.  I does exactly as advertised:  spray it, then play with it, and it definitely stays in place (though sticky).</li>
            <li> Love this spray holds great and keeps hair in place</li>
            <li> This is my favorite volumizing hair spray. I have very fine straight hair, and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products. With this, I spray all over my hair first. Then I can curl it with a curling iron(which is rare, my straight hair never wants to curl). Then I flip my head upside down and spray all over. My curls and volume last all day.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to hairspray. It holds the best out of everything I&#x27;ve tried and it light weight. A little bit goes a long way so it last a long time too. I tease my hair on a daily basis and it holds all day. I don&#x27;t like using anything but Big Sexy Hair  Hairspray. I&#x27;m lost without my hairspray.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray, it gives my thin and fine hair the ump lift it needs. Can be so helpful to give volume to flat hair.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair products were recommended to me by a friend whose hair always looks great.  I like the results I&#x27;m getting, and I&#x27;m still learning how to use it.  Now, when my hair is ALMOST dry, I spray some in my hands, rub them together, and then rub my hands through my hair. Then, I finish styling my hair.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hairspray on the market!  Seriously, it does not weight your hair down, and gives it amazing volume and stay power without just a small amount of spray!  This is a MUST USE for any type of hair!  Plus, who doesn&#x27;t want BIG SEXY HAIR!</li>
            <li> This spray helps mold my style and keeps it there without the stiffness.  It&#x27;s expensive but I treat myself once in a while.</li>
            <li> overall good, but the heading of \\&quot;spray and play\\&quot; made me think it might not hold too stiff, but it does hold pretty hard...not crunchy or anything but not as soft a hold as I was hoping for...but that is probaly me since it doesn&#x27;t claim to be a soft hold.  I&#x27;d say its def a product to set a style rather than to spray and play...hope that helps some</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Holds my hair in place but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff or crunchy. Doesn&#x27;t leave residue after shampooing and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair spray that will help the hair stay all day.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell, people around me thought I was drinking because it smelled like alcohol haha.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is a great product with excellent hold. This is my stand by hairspray and I won&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s great to use while teasing your hair with a teasing comb or to use if you flip your head over and spray at the roots. I find that it is important to work through your hair a bit after you spray because it can make your hair stiff, if you put too much in.  Holds great in windy, hot or humid days.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair great. Never have to worry able is looking a mess then the wind blows or little rain</li>
            <li> The cheapest place to find this product outside a beauty store and I needed a license to purchase!  Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or weighted-down.  Also use the Big Sexy mousse.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to I read this was one of the top hair sprays. I didn&#x27;t like it, it felt like I was using aqua net!! LOL remember aqua net?? This hair spray is just to stiff for me, it reminds me of the girls in high school their hair looked really good but not one hair moved, like they had helmet on their head, the wind would blow, but their hair, not one hair moved LOL, or a big section would get a gust under their hair and a big section of hair moved lol.. and they wouldn&#x27;t turn their heads all the way, they thought they would mess up their hair!! LOL.. that was back in 1988! Lol.this is just my opinion, if you don&#x27;t want your hair to move AT ALL. This is for you.. Lol.. And no, I did not put a lot on, no more then I do with my tresesme hair spray and my hair is touchable and moves and the wind will blow my hair around. Lol.</li>
            <li> This is my all tine favorite hair spray.  It&#x27;s not sticky and provides great holding and styling capabilities.  Have been using it for years after trying many, many other brands.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and responds differently to product so it&#x27;s hard to recommend.  All I can say is...try it, you might like it.  Or not.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray.  Leaves no residue behind when you brush after using it, hair stilol has no flaky stuff like other hair sprays I have used.  My hairdresser uses it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where I got this or how I ended up with it but I&#x27;ve had it under my cabinet for probably quite sometime now. I was looking for hair spray the other day and it was right in front of me and so I decided to give it a try. Had I known how awesome this product was I never would have had this under my cabinet for so long it would have been gone that very same month... I don&#x27;t know how long it would have taken to use but I would have used it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product. It&#x27;s amazing. It really does keep my hair volumized. Honestly, I have super flat hair and although it does flatten out a little as the day goes on, nothing like my hair is used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get enough of this product and will be buying it up!</li>
            <li> As hair spray goes, this is long lasting and does give hair more volume.  The following day, though, hair seems to need shampooing.</li>
            <li> awesome it is amazing it stay on u r haire longer small amount is infe to hold really loved it</li>
            <li> It arrived and one tub was so slit I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. I&#x27;m really angry!</li>
            <li> In my book this brand is slightly expensive but I do find it works the best at holding a style for my hair which is fine and straight and I have a lot of it.  I only buy the Spray &amp; Play Harder no though since it seems to have more holding power.  I can usually go two days without having to shampoo it out but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The sprayer broke after one use. I love this hairspray any other time so maybe it was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite hairspray; I have hair that tends to fall flat and this really works for me.  Best hairspray I have used!</li>
            <li> This is actually the only hairspray I will use. I have thick long hair and normally hate hairspray because it leaves my hair sticky and stiff. This, however, allows me to spray a little and still have movement along with hold. The price on amazon is cheaper than in most stores that I have seen, too!</li>
            <li> I love the big sexy hair products !!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray! Although it is kind of sticky in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Huge can - good price.  Came on time.  Product is not sticky - just started using it.</li>
            <li> I love the volumizing lift it gives your hair. This is my second one in a year. I felt it last long, doesn&#x27;t need a lot of product to do the job. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair that I blow dry to straighten and then curl with either a 1 1/2 inch Hot Tool curling iron or Conair pink rollers.  I found that after several hours my hair would get fuzzy and not hold curl in an attractive manner.  So don&#x27;t recommend this for that type of stying.  It is good at keeping flyaways down for half up/bun/pony tail styles.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine turned me on to this spray.  I have bought hair sprays for several years, and had never quite found the right on for me.  Until this product, even the &amp;#34;Super-Mega Hold&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;Ultimate Hold&amp;#34; sprays would never quite hold my curly thick hair, and the smells were unbearable.  I felt I had to use a lot of the spray to get the desired result, only to have gusts of wind ruin my look, or else the other tragedy-helmet head.  Big Sexy Hair is a fantastic product that holds your hair, looks natural, and even smells good.  You don&#x27;t feel like you have been polluted with cancerous fumes with this product either, as a little goes a long way.  Yes, the price for the spray is 5 times or more than the average sprays, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Ive been using the sebastian zero gravity hair spray and I was not satisfied, so I decided to try this one since it was in my girlfriends drawer. This product is great! I have short  thick hair that I style like Nick Wooster. Hold is strong with out the stiffness you get and it doesn&#x27;t over shine.</li>
            <li> I use this hair spray all the time, I think it is the best ever!! It holds very well but is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; AT ALL!! I live in the South and we have nasty hot and humid summers, this hair spray is incredible!! Do yourself a favor and get some--the price on this is very good by the way!! Fast shipping as well..  :O)</li>
            <li> This product is great no complaints. Will not let u down , very highly recommend this and the hair gel</li>
            <li> The hairspray works well, the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite tho. My complaint is the nozzle. It&#x27;s very hard to spray the product without it spraying out harshly in one solid area. I end up with a ton of hairspray in one spot and everything else gets missed.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used!!! It is a great value. I buy this on Amazon, as it is much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> Hair fall increases if you use this product.</li>
            <li> This truly does a great job of providing lift to my hair. I use it as a foundation, and then firm up with Tresemme Tres Two Extra Hold Hair Spray, 11 Ounce.</li>
            <li> My first ever review of a hair/beauty product, this stuff is worth it. Because my hair is baby fine it will not hold a curl, slides right out of barrettes etc. and looks dirty if I don&#x27;t wash it every single day. This spray is a must have for my hair type. I can either style my hair and spray it into nearly permanent place or I can spray it onto my hair after a blow out and comb through for a soft touchable hold that provides texture as well. Best of all, this spray must absorb oil, because I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks and feels cleaner much longer when I use this spray. I also love BSH&#x27;s spray mousse. Admittedly, the spray nozzle does tend to clog if not regularly cleaned, but I just spray it into my hand and use like regular mousse close to my scalp. These two products allow me to do hair styles that were never before possible for me. I can literally make my chin length hair stand straight up with the hair spray alone, and just as easily coax it back down by gently combing through. I often entertain my husband and children by doing this! I would imagine the hairspray would work well on any hair type, though the mousse would give serious volume overload to anyone with thick hair or hair that has natural body to it. Love, love, love this brand!</li>
            <li> I should have bought the spray and play harder.  Has a finer spray which I like better even though it costs more money.</li>
            <li> This spray Does what it claims. I have tried dozens of hair sprays, and this works the best on my thinning fine hair. Other sprays seemed to increase the breakage I was having trouble controlling, but this spray keeps your style in place and combs out easily with minimum hair falling out. As I grow older, my hair has been falling out at alarming rates. This product adds fullness and makes my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> Love it! I used Sebastian Shaper spray for years, but the perfume of it overwhelms. I tried BSH products and they are first rate! The spray holds firm yet remains flexible and doesn&#x27;t make it too dirty, and it smells much lighter. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Like it but don&#x27;t LOVE it.  It really does hold a style all day but that&#x27;s because my hair is stiff and hard even when I use a little.  This will come in handy on wet windy winter days when nothing else will hold but any other time I&#x27;ve got to use something with a more &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; hold.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone  who like me, has super fine limp hair.  The spray bodifies and makes my hair look bigger!</li>
            <li> This hair spray is a MUST HAVE for any type hair.  I really like it and even bought some for my daughter in law.  It was a fair price online and a little more expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> Is it worth so much money?  Well, not sure--this stuff is expensive!--but I love it and will keep using it probably.  It does add volume with absolutely no gunk.  Your hair may feel a bit stiffer, depending on how much  you use, but definitely not like most hairsprays; my hair stays natural-looking, not molded into place.  I have to say, it&#x27;s been pivotal in stretching out my hair-washing.  When I use this stuff, I can wake up, and my hair is in the same shape as when I went to sleep...for real!  I usually just fluff it up a little, spray again and roll.  For a working mom, it&#x27;s sorta priceless.  My hair is pretty short--just under my ears--so not sure how the hairspray will stack up as I grow my hair out.  Previously I used Tresemme, the firm kind.  It&#x27;s good and waaaay cheaper, but definitely not as good as this--not as volumizing or functional.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray.  I used to use Rave max hold but this is much better.  I am a man with semi spiked hair.  I do my hair once a day and this will hold for the entire day.  It does not flake and if I want to freshen it up a little water and running my fingers through my hair will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Very strong hairspray, your hair will not move with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Costs a little more but it delivers in manageability and hold.  It is what I will continue to buy and continue to recommend!</li>
            <li> And a whole lot cheaper than I could buy elsewhere.. :)  Will use this seller again, much easier than trying to find someone with a licenses to buy it at the beauty supply house.</li>
            <li> I like it , a bit 2$prizie / with a discount I can go for that !. why forced to write 3 more words? next time I wont rate it !</li>
            <li> Only hairspray that works on my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hairspray there is... Its light, but strong. You will LOVE this product! I use it daily, and it leaves no nasty residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hairspray for years.  It&#x27;s the only spray that will hold my hair in place in this Oklahoma wind.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
            <li> Definitely holds my hair up. The smell is great. Make sure you clean the front of the spray from time to time or it will spray weird at times.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. I have thin, fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but keeps it in place. When I saw this great price I snatched it up right away!!</li>
            <li> In love! This hair spray holds tight, does not have a strong or long lasting scent and doesn&#x27;t leave little dried drops on my hair. I love it and wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many volumizing hairsprays.  Some were too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; &amp; did not work as advertized &amp; others made my hair look &amp;#34;unmovable.&amp;#34;  My experience with this one has been great.  It really works and has not made my hair look &amp;#34;unmovable&amp;#34; as long as I do not use too much.  This is the best of the volumizing hairspray I have tried.  Both the spray &amp; play and the spray &amp; play harder are very good products.</li>
            <li> I use this hairspray religiously. It&#x27;s my favorite. In fact, the whole line of products are amazing. But this hairspray. Holds all day long. Use sparingly as it get very stiff</li>
            <li> I switched to this as my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; hairspray, while keeping my coveted (and hard to find) \\&quot;Spray and Play Harder\\&quot; hairspray for heavy-duty jobs.  Love the medium firm hold, the scent is non-perfumey and pleasant, and almost took off a star because the nozzle gets gummed up so quickly, as is the issue with really good hairsprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that the larger nozzle makes scraping off the gunk easier than with tiny spray heads, and I like the coverage it gives the 80% of the time it works perfectly.  As a note, if I remember to do a quick rinse and finger rub across the sprayer after each use, it never gets gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money, lasts a long time, excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is great!! I have baby fine hair, and this product works very well for me. I am a true believer in this. Your price is better also.</li>
            <li> i just love the big sexy hairspray its not sticky and will hold your hair in place for hours.&lt;br /&gt;does not make your head itch.</li>
            <li> Shipment and delivered as ordered,however, the product is not what I wanted and the nozzle causes the spay to come out in globs rather than spray or mist---even washing with hot water doesn&#x27;t make a difference!</li>
            <li> good if you want helmet head</li>
            <li> Wow, it really works! I have fine thinning hair that will not hold a curl. I look like I have twice as much hair and I can do just about anything with it. My hair is snow white and more than half the way to my waist and it will hold a curl. Simply amazing with the use of mouse, hairspray  and electric jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> Smells good and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipment and correct product</li>
            <li> I only use this hairspray! It will give your hair a firm hold, but is lightweight and won&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; feeling. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the hairspray, I got shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this so I tried it and love it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Makes my flat, fine hair look much fuller. I blow dry as fluffy and full as possible, spray, and what a difference in my hair. it really stays. Later when you want to put a brush through the &amp;#34;big fat hair&amp;#34; is still there.</li>
            <li> excellent, did what it promised, even holds my thick crazy hair in perfect position during these humid muggy summer months.  i could never find a spray that does this/  am thrilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Redken products, so I hate to say it, but I like this better than the product I was using.  I have very thick, but fine hair.  My hair is straight as could be and like trying to do something with corn silk...it doesn&#x27;t work well.  After styling my hair, I use this product to \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; it up a little bit and give it some life.  On the rare occasion that I curl my hair, I use this to help hold the curl and it does as good as anything I have found.  With longer hair, I like a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t spray it stiff!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but its very fine.  I have tried different products (changing shampoos, conditioners, mousse, and hairsprays - even other styling products).  But, this is the only product that gives my fine hair the texture it needs to do whatever I want it to and still look good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only hairspray I have used that never leaves my hair feeling greasy, and my hair actually holds a curl with this product.  It does not feel thick or tacky when you put it on.  Hair feels like it has thickness and stays light and bouncy all day (stays where you put it but is soft and controlled).  This product sprays evenly.  Sometimes you have to wipe off the spray nozzle with a warm washcloth to open it back up when it gets tacky (maybe 1 or 2 times a month if that).  If I use this hairspray everyday, I can get 1-3 months out of it (depending on if I curl my hair frequently).  On average I get 2 months out of it with my medium to long hair, and sometimes 3 months when my hair is shorter.  I love this product and will not try anything else again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ran out of this product and tried some alternatives in between getting my next bottle of big sexy hairspray, but all fall short (CHI hairspray, suave hairspray, herbal essence hairspray, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Shower&lt;br /&gt;2. any volumizing shampoo&lt;br /&gt;3. sleek and shine matrix conditioner (mainly applied to ends)&lt;br /&gt;4. towel dry&lt;br /&gt;5. any light and volumizing mousse - entire head&lt;br /&gt;6. blow dry&lt;br /&gt;7. quick all over spray with big sexy hairspray&lt;br /&gt;8. Style&lt;br /&gt;9. quick light spray to set</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray I have ever used. It holds really well, is pretty light, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I like hairspray that allows your hair to still move around and be &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34;. This hairspray is a bit stiff when you use it. Great for up-do&#x27;s and hair that you want to stay in place though.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray at a cheaper price than the salon will definitely be ordering via amazon for my future hair spray</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a soft and gentle hold that works...this hair spray is for you.  Also, a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s worth the extra bucks because it last a long time</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but when I use this spray after curling and under my roots, it really adds volume. it isn&#x27;t too heavy for my hair. This was my first time using it and I will be sure to use again.</li>
            <li> I was *not* a fan of hairspray, having relatively thin hair.  I&#x27;ve bought tons of high end different sprays, and felt that they were all too heavy for something that still didnt hold a curl in my hair.  I bought this because it was on sale at my salon - and I will never go back!  I can finally curl my hair, BIG AND SEXY.  Style stays all day long, tons of value, and my hair is not hard, crunchy, and sticky.  It smells great, and lasts forever.  I recommend this product to all!</li>
            <li> Non Sticky finish that holds your hair in place but allows you to comb your hair again without problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of hair spray for years. I have fine hair and you can spray it and put it into place.</li>
            <li> Not amazing or a must have but overall really good. It holds pretty well but not as good as other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used in the past. It also gives some hair a hard and darker color when applied sometimes making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray, it&#x27;s wonderful for adding volume and only takes a little to last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I find this hairspray is perfect for my hair. It lasts all day and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised and it arrived as indicated it would.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great Product! Loved this product</li>
            <li> Just what I had ordered at a great price.  Packaging was very nicely and carefully put together with box etc.</li>
            <li> Best spray around...very fine.</li>
            <li> I spray under my hair sections where I want volume, blow dry for 5-10 seconds, comb hair back, and WHA-LA!!! Superb volume in my hair!  When I go to sleep and wake up the next morning, I still have volume in my hair!  I&#x27;ve been using this spray for years and it has remained my favorite volumizer hair spray! Best of all, I used to always pay $20 plus tax, so I love that i can now get it cheaper here! :)</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray.  Holds well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Always tells me to get her more. It works, doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. Holds very well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray with awesome hold. I use it on my roots to tease my hair and keep it teased.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Super hold.  Does what it says it does.  I have short fine hair that requires some teasing and help to get body into it.  But once I get it where I want it I can use this and it does a great job at keeping the shape.  don&#x27;t try to style after application though because this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; product.  Don&#x27;t apply until you are sure you are happy with the style.</li>
            <li> This hairspray delivers volume and hold!!  With fine hair I need all the help I can get and this is probably one of the best brands I have used for volume and hold.  You can&#x27;t overdue it though because it is pretty strong, but its nothing you can&#x27;t comb out.  Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray for volumn and body. Is not sticky or heavy but holds style. Brushes out easily. I love this product and have used it for years. Great purchase .</li>
            <li> As I use it I find it holds well.  This product shipped quickly and was packaged well.  I would consider buying it again.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I was going through my old Amazon orders, and geez I bought this two years ago this month. It doesn&#x27;t even feel half empty, and it&#x27;s a fixture of my morning routine. I haven&#x27;t used a different hairspray since then, and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it. Does hairspray go bad? Because I&#x27;ll probably be using this one can forever. It even gets stains out mixed with some nail polish remover. Even if you bought this for the full price I&#x27;d say it was worth it because it lasts forever, I definitely am getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it.&lt;br /&gt;//&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve used, and this giant bottle has lasted me for over a year. Never makes my hair gross, holds well. Great stuff, definitely buy it for cheap on Amazon</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE AND IT LOOKS LIKE I AM UNABLE TO RETURN.  WHAT A RIP OFF!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!</li>
            <li> Only the Best Spray ! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love tis brand. Holds my styled hair firmly and even on rainy, damp or windy days. I reach for it automatically. Amazon&#x27;s price was less than at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I used sebastian shaper hairspray for many years in my career. But when this one came on the scene my prayers had been answered! I did weddings on call for many years and when I switched to this hairspray I could work my updos with better finesse. It doesn&#x27;t leave a build-up or residue. Just an all around nice product.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair volumizing hairspray.  I love this product.  I have fine hair and it holds it in place without my hair feeling like it been glued down.</li>
            <li> This product increases the body in my hair. it is a little stiff hold.</li>
            <li> Ive been wanting to try this hairspray for a while now, not bad but probably wont repurchase, not any better then the way cheaper brands I&#x27;ve boughten.</li>
            <li> This is the best aerosol Salon Hairspray in the industry. I use it, my daughter uses it with her curly curly hair.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price, but not what my wife wanted! So my daughter got it and loves it! This type of product cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this hairspray. It works well and holds well. I wash my hair every 3 days because it is very long and color-treated. I like that this hairspray provides great &amp;#34;buildable&amp;#34; hold without leaving my hair stiff and sticky. I love that I can comb through my hair or refresh my style without worry. I have tried so many other sprays, but none of them offer the hold and texture this spray does. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product in stores I read the reviews and they were all 4-5 star reviews, so I was like &amp;#34;Yeah! This will definitely work!&amp;#34; My hair is naturally almost spiraled, they&#x27;re like messy curls that are cute and everything, but I like to straighten my hair a lot. For about 6 months to a year I used this product almost everyday and it worked 30/100. I have a lot of layers so I always try to find hairspray that helps the ends from curling, but this product does not help with frizzing, curled ends, or really anything at all. About 70% of the hair will somewhat stay straight, but Suave doesn&#x27;t work for my hair either. It also makes your hair very very stiff and feels disgusting unless you brush it out, but then it makes your hair very greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Just what I wanted.  Saved 30% off retail!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use hairspray--the last one I bought is still mostly full after two years of owning it, so I don&#x27;t an extensive repertoire of products to balance this against. That being said, I did find an opportunity to use this a few days ago. I wore my hair pulled back in a high ponytail because my hair wasn&#x27;t cooperating and I use it to keep my hair in place. The scent was surprisingly nice for an aerosol hairspray. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it as perfume, but it didn&#x27;t make me gag like \\&quot;Aquanet\\&quot; or something like that would have. I am used to be extra-hold hairspray so I underestimated how much of this I would have to put on. After probably three spray downs my hair was held fairly well. I still had to use bobbypins on the sides though because this didn&#x27;t completely tame my flyaways, but for the most part it held nicely. My main praise for this hairspray was the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t look stiff, greasy, and crunchy after applying it. Even after running a fine toothed comb through my hair it still looked natural. I am so used to gels that hold the shape of whatever I do to my hair and will leave comb lines or bobbypin marks--but this didn&#x27;t do that at all. Infact, when I let my hair down later all I had to do was brush my hair out and it felt like I had never had hairspray in in the first place. Definitely lives up to the \\&quot;Spray &amp; Play\\&quot; branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 4/5 stars because it was unable to tame all of my flyaways. I know this wasn&#x27;t super-control hold xxxx, but when I use a hairspray I expect it to be able to hold back a piece of hair that weighs .000002 oz. Nevertheless, I was very impressed with how understated the spray looked on my hair. It didn&#x27;t look or feel like I was wearing any hairspray at all. I would definitely recommend this brand, but if you want more control I&#x27;d go for one that has a bit more hold.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would not have an overpowering scent and it does not.  I am very sensitive to scents and this one does not bother me at all.  It holds my hair well throughout the day so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good enough that I&#x27;d buy it again. It is a bit pricey though, so may stick to an previous favorite.</li>
            <li> The last hair spray that I used of this quality was available only in salons and high-end department stores.  As you can imagine, it was extremely expensive by comparison.  After spraying &amp;#34;Spray and Play&amp;#34;, you can run your fingers through you hair, finger toss and re-arrange your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the name.  Even little old ladies like this stuff!</li>
