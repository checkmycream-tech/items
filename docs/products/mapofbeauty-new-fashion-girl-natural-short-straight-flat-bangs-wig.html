            <li>Bought this for a cosplay, and I love this wig.</li>
            <li>Lovely color and length.</li>
            <li>i love this wig.a bargain price too.</li>
            <li>though I give one warning : It sheds very easily, but nothing but a quick sew won&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>I did have to trim the bangs - but that&#x27;s cool with me!</li>
            <li>Very nice wig, it fit my face even though I have a larger sized head.</li>
            <li>, this wig is very nice, the colour is pretty and has many different shades</li>
            <li>Gotta say this is my new favorite wig out of the twenty!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Well when I took of the hat I loved the way the curls bounced right back into place with just a touch of my wig brush.</li>
            <li>Looks decently natural, it&#x27;s most certainly worth the price!</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig for the upcoming comic con and I must say its absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>The bangs are a bit long and can be worn swept to the side or else a good trimming will do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to size for your own head and it&#x27;s quite loose if worn not tightened.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>it came in dark brown instead of light, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this wig!</li>
            <li>This is the first short wig I&#x27;ve ever bought (I usually tend to go for long-haired wigs) and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed!!</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I&#x27;ve purchased online</li>
            <li>It arrived 2 weeks earlier than I had expected which was great.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the pictures, and I am just so very please with this wig and</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really see them when it&#x27;s being worn.</li>
            <li>the pictures but not by much.</li>
            <li>SOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very layered none of the reviews I read really qued me into that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its a super soft wig and practically looks natural</li>
            <li>The hair coloring is exactly as pictured and looks quite natural.</li>
            <li>The fibers were a little more plastic-y than I thought they would be, but after going to a three day convention they wig still looks brand new!</li>
            <li>Overall it had better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>It did take long to come but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>First of All, I must point out that it arrived about a week earlier than claimed, which is always good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t as full as the picture, but that is expected.</li>
            <li>it is soft, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>However, you cannot move your hair around that much after, as the net will show.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>even thought it needed a little cutting its a super soft and great wig</li>
            <li>I use it for my Mako Mankanshoku cosplay because I&#x27;m a big cheap skate and finding a bowl cut brow wig is EXPENSIVE but this one was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The color is a little darker and it looks different on a real head versus a mannequin.</li>
            <li>My family, friends and co-workers thought I had cut my real hair which is dark brown and long.</li>

            <li> The bangs are too long, even for the style and a tad bit uneven</li>
            <li> well only a bit because the bangs kept hitting my fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I have a small face/head</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very hard to stick under this.</li>

            <li> The color is a little darker and it looks different on a real head versus a mannequin. Overall it had better quality than I expected. I used it for a cosplay during a convention.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this wig! I use it for my Mako Mankanshoku cosplay because I&#x27;m a big cheap skate and finding a bowl cut brow wig is EXPENSIVE but this one was reasonably priced. I don&#x27;t know why other reviews spoke about styling, I did not need to style the wig..well only a bit because the bangs kept hitting my fake lashes. Its a super soft wig and practically looks natural but I will admit it does have a shine to it. The wig has clips on the back to keep in place and comes with a wigcap. Gotta say this is my new favorite wig out of the twenty!</li>
            <li> Got this for a Roddy Pipper costume and it matched his hair perfect!</li>
            <li> a bit lumpy on my head</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ONE!!! It&#x27;s exactly what was described and fits wonderfully! I did have to trim the bangs - but that&#x27;s cool with me! The price was insanely reasonable and the fit and style is great! Would order this again!</li>
            <li> This is the first short wig I&#x27;ve ever bought (I usually tend to go for long-haired wigs) and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed!! The bangs are a bit long and can be worn swept to the side or else a good trimming will do. The hair coloring is exactly as pictured and looks quite natural. I would recommend this wig to anyone. :)</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels and how it fits perfectly on my head. I did wear it to church on Sunday and I had a hat on. Well when I took of the hat I loved the way the curls bounced right back into place with just a touch of my wig brush. The best wig I have ever purchased, and believe me I have a lot of them. So I ordered another one by Mapof this morning. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very nice wig, it fit my face even though I have a larger sized head. The fibers were a little more plastic-y than I thought they would be, but after going to a three day convention they wig still looks brand new! I also liked that the bangs were a bit longer so that I could cut and style them as I needed to on my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent  I like it  beautiful color thank you so much may be I ask for another one</li>
            <li> even thought it needed a little cutting its a super soft and great wig</li>
            <li> Looks decently natural, it&#x27;s most certainly worth the price! One of the better wigs, it did have kinks from shipping but you can&#x27;t really see them when it&#x27;s being worn. The bangs are too long, even for the style and a tad bit uneven but I think it&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s pretty easy to size for your own head and it&#x27;s quite loose if worn not tightened. Should fit everyone, should look nicely on everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. I love the color, shape, size and fitting. It&#x27;s cool and comfortable. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this wig. it is soft, and looks natural. it came in dark brown instead of light, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail yesterday. It looks &amp; feels nice but when I brushed it, the hair started to come out...</li>
            <li> Bangs are too short. Can someone tell me how you hook this on head ?</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing for the price. It did take long to come but it was worth the wait. My family, friends and co-workers thought I had cut my real hair which is dark brown and long. The color is beautiful..</li>
            <li> This seller is absolutely wonderful. This is my second wig from them. This wig was resaved much earlier then expected just like my other one from them and you cant beat the price. The wig is amazingly soft and it sheds much less then you expect, only if you brush it A LOT not like that matters because its also pretty thick. For me its might be a teeny tiny bit darker then the pictures but not by much. I have a small face/head so it was longer then expected but that isn&#x27;t a problem because it can always be trimmed if its to long for you. It looks exactly like the pictures, and I am just so very please with this wig and this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;This seller is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for the upcoming comic con and I must say its absolutely fantastic. This is the first wig I&#x27;ve purchased online and Im truly satisfied with it. The wig was the perfect length, perfect color. It arrived 2 weeks earlier than I had expected which was great. They also sent me a wigcap to go with it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT SOO MUCH. THANK YOU AGAIN! WILL BE PURCHASING FROM YOU ALL ASAP</li>
            <li> Bought this for a cosplay, and I love this wig. It is good quality, does not shed or anything like that. Lovely color and length.</li>
            <li> First of All, I must point out that it arrived about a week earlier than claimed, which is always good.&lt;br /&gt;So, this wig is very nice, the colour is pretty and has many different shades highlights.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t as full as the picture, but that is expected. It is a bit longer in the front than in the back which is a bit weird, but overall, it is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price- though I give one warning : It sheds very easily, but nothing but a quick sew won&#x27;t fix! The hair itself is also very nice quality. *again just wished it didnt shed*</li>
            <li> i love this wig.a bargain price too.</li>
            <li> the wig was good quality for the price. There was enough hair to cover the net enough so that it didn&#x27;t show. However, you cannot move your hair around that much after, as the net will show.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting 2 if you want a thicker wig</li>
            <li> i love it!!! sooooo good like real hair, looks like nature and the color is perfect. i could wear it every day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very layered none of the reviews I read really qued me into that.&lt;br /&gt;I have alot of hair it goes down to the middle of my back so it&#x27;s very hard to stick under this. it does come with a wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;I have to have my hair dresser help me trim it up because I need it for my uniform.</li>
