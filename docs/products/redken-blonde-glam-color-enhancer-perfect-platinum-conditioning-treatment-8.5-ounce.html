            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>Kind of looks psychedelic!  </li>
            <li>it to keep the gold out, good product does the job well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping when I go get  my roots done, she&#x27;ll use a permanent toner that will give me the platinum color I want, so I wont have to use this, but it&#x27;s good to have just in case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>This one is pretty awesome though.</li>
            <li>Redken is a strong brand, you can expect great products.</li>
            <li>It was kind of drying on my locks too.</li>
            <li>My color gets brassy so easy, and this has kept my color bright ans super shiny!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any results from the product at all; my hair should be perfect for it as it&#x27;s blonde and highlighted.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I wish it were cheaper, but I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>Even though they&#x27;ve changed the packaging and name, it&#x27;s still the same great product!  </li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I have found for my silver and white hair.</li>
            <li>I finally went gray after years of debating and this treatment is wonderful.</li>
            <li>the best for getting yellow out of bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you have a good purple shampoo, this may not be necessary, but if you just want to condition your hair and not shampoo, then this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and leaves your hair feeling super soft.  </li>
            <li>Happy to find it on amazon since i cannot find it locally!</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a good blonde conditioner, but nothing phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I used and loved the old pearl version.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it!!</li>
            <li>Not naturally of course lol.</li>
            <li>My hair feels better from the higher quality conditioning ingredients and the color is more natural looking, with all the highlights.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair products but this is definitely one that I love!</li>
            <li>I use it maybe once a week and think I will cut back as it&#x27;s making my hair look more gray than platinum, but it did cut the yellow so use it accordingly on your own color issue.</li>
            <li>I have very light blonde hair with lots of highlights throughout.</li>
            <li>when they had the one that was more of a reddish violet color with gold in it, I can&#x27;t remember the name because it&#x27;s been so long.  </li>
            <li>This product not only conditions my hair beautifully but stops my heavily foiled hair from &#x27;yellowing&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Works very well without giving too much purple hue and conditions very well also.  </li>
            <li>but it did nothing really for my color.</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair has been colored so much that it doesn&#x27;t want to bring it up or brighten it, who knows.</li>
            <li>but it really smoothes out and softens my bleached out hair</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>It really extends the life of my colour.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product previously when it was called Pure Pearl, and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use it because my hair is gray &amp; it takes the dullness out of my gray &amp; leaves my hair very soft!  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I like this as a nice, gentle way to get the brassy tones out of my hair, compared to Clairol Shimmering Lights which is a little too purple and runny, and also you have to be careful with light blonde hair with the Shimmering lights or it&#x27;ll stain your hair purple,</li>
            <li>works really well, and leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li>I may try a few more times being that its sitting in my shower.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend doing a coconut oil or rosemary oil conditioning treatment after tho, as it is pretty drying on pre bleached/lightened damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Does make my white hair a bit brighter, but really, lose the purple.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product as a conditioner for blonde hair AND it tones down blonde hair that has become brassy due to medication or hard water chemicals.</li>
            <li>It really makes it shine and tones down any yellow hues.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I did not buy this for a long time because of the price.  </li>

            <li> it turns after a few weeks after coloring.</li>
            <li> , 2 weeks past date promised.</li>
            <li> For some reason, those products are all discontinued, at least in the platinum version.  </li>

            <li> So sorry they no longer make this product, hard to find.</li>
            <li> ; for my color for in between root touch ups, and I hate to say it</li>

            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this conditioner and I love it! My color gets brassy so easy, and this has kept my color bright ans super shiny! I have well water which makes hair look dull and this really has done wonders for my hair. I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it!!</li>
            <li> My title for this review says it all.  I didn&#x27;t see any results from the product at all; my hair should be perfect for it as it&#x27;s blonde and highlighted.</li>
            <li> I like this as a nice, gentle way to get the brassy tones out of my hair, compared to Clairol Shimmering Lights which is a little too purple and runny, and also you have to be careful with light blonde hair with the Shimmering lights or it&#x27;ll stain your hair purple, this is not so with this product.  I miss when they had the one that was more of a reddish violet color with gold in it, I can&#x27;t remember the name because it&#x27;s been so long.  This one is pretty awesome though.</li>
            <li> I have very light blonde hair with lots of highlights throughout. Not naturally of course lol. Nonetheless, I purchased this to use here and there as a &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34; for my color for in between root touch ups, and I hate to say it but it did nothing really for my color. It was kind of drying on my locks too. I had high hopes. Maybe my hair has been colored so much that it doesn&#x27;t want to bring it up or brighten it, who knows. Oh well. I may try a few more times being that its sitting in my shower. I would definitely recommend doing a coconut oil or rosemary oil conditioning treatment after tho, as it is pretty drying on pre bleached/lightened damaged hair. Good luck!</li>
            <li> After a few back and forth emails from vendor ( who got a small tude) with me., hey, I&#x27;m the customer here!. I finally received my product. She says it was lost but the post date on the packaging was later than date to arrive., so who knows what happen there. But I did finally receive it. The product does make my hair softer and for a day will make it a softer champagne blonde then back to the honey colored it turns after a few weeks after coloring., it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; product but not worth arguing with the vendor over., she is quite rude.! So do your research and think twice before buying. And my advice to amazon is to knock her off their list!!  But I did finally get what I ordered along with a spill of the cap in the package., 2 weeks past date promised.</li>
            <li> I use it because my hair is gray &amp; it takes the dullness out of my gray &amp; leaves my hair very soft!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> works really well, and leaves my hair soft&lt;br /&gt;use it to keep the gold out, good product does the job well</li>
            <li> This is a great product as a conditioner for blonde hair AND it tones down blonde hair that has become brassy due to medication or hard water chemicals.</li>
            <li> This helps some with the brassy color blondes tend to get.  I wish it were cheaper, but I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product previously when it was called Pure Pearl, and love it.  Even though they&#x27;ve changed the packaging and name, it&#x27;s still the same great product!  Smells great, and leaves your hair feeling super soft.  Will definitely keep purchasing while I&#x27;m staying blonde!</li>
            <li> My hair was bleached and it came out sort of a cotton candy, baby blonde. I wanted platinum. My stylist used this to tone down the brightness and it seemed to help, so I bought it. I use it maybe once a week and think I will cut back as it&#x27;s making my hair look more gray than platinum, but it did cut the yellow so use it accordingly on your own color issue. I&#x27;m hoping when I go get  my roots done, she&#x27;ll use a permanent toner that will give me the platinum color I want, so I wont have to use this, but it&#x27;s good to have just in case.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have found for my silver and white hair. It really makes it shine and tones down any yellow hues. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair products but this is definitely one that I love! It brightens up my highlights a lot. It keeps the brassy tones away. I use it about two or three times a week.</li>
            <li> I am TOTALLY faithful to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Platinum Blonde Shampoo, so I don&#x27;t use Redken&#x27;s version (whatever it may be), but Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t have a purple conditioner to complement it. So I ordered this, and it does just what it should. Honestly, if you have a good purple shampoo, this may not be necessary, but if you just want to condition your hair and not shampoo, then this is a good solution. I used both after a brassy nightmare I had, but now I only need to use this intermittently. All in all, it&#x27;s a good blonde conditioner, but nothing phenomenal.  I gave it 5 stars because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Conditions well but no change in color...</li>
            <li> This is an updated version of Redken&#x27;s former \\&quot;Pearl\\&quot; violet conditioner.  Seems to work the same for me.  Brightenes up highlights and adds a cooler tone to the hair.  Works very well without giving too much purple hue and conditions very well also.  Happy to find it on amazon since i cannot find it locally!</li>
            <li> I used and loved the old pearl version.  This one is PURPLE!  Am afraid my hair will really turn purple, a very undesired side effect.  Does make my white hair a bit brighter, but really, lose the purple.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get another.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this for a long time because of the price.  There were similar products out there that did the job.  For some reason, those products are all discontinued, at least in the platinum version.  So, I went ahead.  This product is great.  My hair feels better from the higher quality conditioning ingredients and the color is more natural looking, with all the highlights.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality.  Redken is a strong brand, you can expect great products.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week on my hair when it getrs a bit brassy it works so well you can&#x27;t leave it on too long or you&#x27;ll have silvery purple hair! my only draw is I have very long thick hair so it doesn&#x27;t last long but it really smoothes out and softens my bleached out hair</li>
            <li> I finally went gray after years of debating and this treatment is wonderful. It takes away the yellow look and makes the gray shine.</li>
            <li> the best for getting yellow out of bleached hair.</li>
            <li> So sorry they no longer make this product, hard to find. Use it to help keep white hair white. Really works.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair too white.  Kind of looks psychedelic!  I prefer a toned down look.</li>
            <li> I use Redkin because of its reliability.  This product not only conditions my hair beautifully but stops my heavily foiled hair from &#x27;yellowing&#x27;.  It really extends the life of my colour.  I love this product.</li>
