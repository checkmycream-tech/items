            <li>Have been looking for a good chi for years!</li>
            <li>Worked great for about two weeks and then just stopped.</li>
            <li>CHI is a great product and that&#x27;s not what I received.  </li>
            <li>my hair is looking great.  </li>
            <li>Great straightner delivered in 3 days....</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>I hear that chi was a good brand</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>it just stopped working, even though i took good care of it and never dropped it.</li>
            <li>Chi is normally a good product and loved the way it did my hair</li>
            <li>I owned another Chi before this one and loved it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product and shipping speed</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the best hot irons on the market.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It moved through my hair easily while doing a great job with straightening.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and leaves my hair very silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>It works great for a low price I love my chi!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly amazon is the best.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a new CHI online and thought I was getting an awesome deal for paying $50 for a CHI.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good deal on a Chi you&#x27;d be better to buy from someone reputable.</li>
            <li>and I love using it.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much i am enjoying it :-0</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better than a Conair or Remington</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I wish I had know that I would not be able to change the degree of heat on this iron.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy from a dealer that is on the dealer locate list from the manufacture.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to get hotter and worked better</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered this one online thinking it was an authentic CHI product on sale.</li>
            <li>Glad.</li>
            <li>My mother has an off brand that she bought from Sally Beauty Supply and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li>I always thought of Amazon as a safe reputable company</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I am just not truly sure I received what I thought I was purchasing.</li>
            <li>I love my CHI  </li>
            <li>and we are both satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I really love this straightener.</li>
            <li>Grand daughters love this :)</li>
            <li>I have had this product for many years</li>
            <li>My mother has a CHI as well, but for some reason mine is hotter and works more efficiently.</li>
            <li>It works FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Stay away you will be better off.</li>
            <li>I had one that lasted more than 5 years until my son dropped it.</li>
            <li>I have this for almost  two years, love it ðŸ’›</li>
            <li>I will stick with Paul Mitchell:)</li>
            <li>I love it, and I don&#x27;t go a day without using it.</li>
            <li>Better off spending the money and getting the nicer model</li>
            <li>i absolutely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li>The best flat iron my wife has ever had, and does wonders for her hair</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m never without it!) and unpack it as the first thing when I get home so it will be good to go when I need</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than 8 years, and it&#x27;s still going strong with no end in sight.</li>
            <li>It was convenient and easy, and until this purchase, I was completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It was a good flat iron and it was a good price</li>
            <li>So much better than the cheap straighteners you can find at target, etc.</li>
            <li>I inspected this one from top to bottom comparing it to my original Chi that I bought probably 6-7 years ago.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use every single day and very good on hair.</li>
            <li>However, after 2 yrs still working just fine.</li>
            <li>I think this Chi will do fine.</li>
            <li>It takes me less than 10 minutes to do my hair now, and it comes out looking perfect and feeling like silk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get very hot, so I make sure to keep it out of reach of my children.</li>
            <li>This is good, though, because it has enough heat to do the job quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>The light wouldn&#x27;t turn on and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift years later still works great</li>
            <li>she loves it and easy to clean</li>
            <li>cheap components.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing is how quickly and easily my return was.</li>
            <li>I have been using the CHI for 10 years and my original one broke</li>
            <li>It just does not work as the original.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied this is not a fake.</li>
            <li>No where on the original Chi does it say it is ionic.</li>
            <li>Whether they want to admit it or not, most do need to hold the end of the iron while doing hair and while it straightens wonderfully</li>
            <li>However, the one I received in the mail is not at all like the original model I was replacing.</li>
            <li>the light blinks differently and the heat isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>came right off with the wipe of a hand!</li>
            <li>(They didn&#x27;t even come in a full Chi box).</li>
            <li>I would have loved to send it back for my money, but thinking it was a CHI</li>
            <li>Full refund, which made my day.</li>
            <li>She loved it...until it broke, 6 months later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a full refund and will search elsewhere.</li>
            <li>When testing it, it heated quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great deal if it&#x27;s real (which my original CHI was from this exact same product page 5 years ago).</li>
            <li>I was searching for this for a long time and so glad that i was able to find it here</li>
            <li>When plugged in it makes a fast clicking sound and then trips the circuit.</li>
            <li>Well worth the moeney.</li>
            <li>Definately worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is so worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is my third straightener of this kind in maybe 7 years.</li>
            <li>and when I flat iron my hair it is perfectly smooth, love it.</li>
            <li>This one is a lot lighter than the original one and it doesn&#x27;t heat up as much.</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li>I knew the price was too good to be true; what a waste.</li>
            <li>The straighteners work just fine, but don&#x27;t be fooled-these are not brand new.</li>
            <li>I do not like this iron as it already seems to be chipping on the sides after less than a year of use and with good care given.</li>
            <li>If the price seems too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li>IT WAS VERY GENTLE ON MY HAIR-</li>
            <li>They were very fast in their delivery.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I ordered something for amazon, and I will give it another chance.</li>
            <li>I purchased these irons and got a notice from Amazon that the actual Farouk company made them aware that the seller was not selling an authentic product.  </li>
            <li>They work ok, but definitely are not a Chi product.  </li>
            <li>At first I was worried that the heat might damage my hair, but that hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li>This was bought from Customer First through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it worked only once, but I wish it would have been better for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t seem that hot to me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mediocre at best, and broke.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>Not as hot as Chi from 5 years ago</li>
            <li>The light would just dim when it was turned off not turn all the way off.</li>
            <li>but it is too hot to hold.</li>
            <li>It does not straighten as fast or as well!</li>
            <li>casing on the original chi is heavy and heats up so that you can curl your hair very easily.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, but that doesn&#x27;t matter much when the product is trash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other irons that my friends own, and nothing compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to use my flat iron ONCE.  </li>
            <li>Well I am glad you asked about this product (Ceramic Flat Iron Gf1001 by CHI) that I purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>My friends have CHI flat irons and they work much better than my $20 Revlon model.  </li>
            <li>the item was a knock off, I sent it back and bought the real thing from the mall, and now I am in love with CHI</li>
            <li>it is light, when the others are more heavy.</li>
            <li>However, I got to keep them and they are better than my normal 15.00 flat irons   ;-)</li>
            <li>When the Chi flat iron first came out I purchased this model and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the iron does not get as hot as my older one.</li>
            <li>is to hold but the Chi Ceramic Flat Iron works better than most other flat irons I have used and and leaves my hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Still working great after having it a few years and using it daily!</li>
            <li>but it just seems so cheaply made compared to the last CHI I purchased 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>but they advertised it as the real thing.</li>
            <li>AND REALLY DID MAKE MY HAIR QUITE SHINY.</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>but the heat manages to fully straighten my curly hair very well.</li>
            <li>very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a much softer look.   </li>
            <li>I took that refund and went straight to ULTA and purchased a REAL CHI like I should have in the beginning.</li>
            <li>and I am very upset given the price.</li>
            <li>and this one doesnt seem like a real one.</li>
            <li>no the real CHI.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing</li>
            <li>The LED light is red (not clear)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I wondered how I was able to buy the product so much cheaper than other sites.</li>
            <li>Moral of the story is, buy the original product instead of wasting money on a product that will break soon after you buy it.</li>
            <li>I owned a real Farouk Chi straightener in high school that I bought at a salon and</li>
            <li>I have waited a long time to get a chi, just using the cheap ones until then.  </li>
            <li>Now the new one&#x27;s ceramic plates are chipping off and thus burning my hair!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>and it was the chepest here on this website and the exact same quality as the higher priced websites.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t even heat up very hot in the short time it worked.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>This one is strange because it heats up fine, but then literally starts to cool down during ONE pass of your hair.  </li>
            <li>This particular CHI was not as hot as the last one I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li>Other products are available that do what they say.</li>
            <li>The plates are chipping and now I need to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I suggest anyone who wants a real chi iron to do the same!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as heavy as the original, the red light blinks less rapidly, and it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the first one I owned.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that this was a fake, but I&#x27;ll tell you the packaging looked like a photocopy of the original CHI box and after only a few weeks the plates melted off of the iron and onto my hair - burning a nice chunk of my hair off with it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that I bought a knock-off last year until I started searching for a new CHI and read the reviews.</li>
            <li>never got hot enough to straighten the hair</li>
            <li>So, when my Chi died recently I got on Amazon to purchase one exactly like it.</li>
            <li>Flat iron worked fine until it was out of warranty period and developed internal break in power cord.  </li>
            <li>I went to the Farouk website to find an approved retailer near me and bought a real one for only a little more then what I paid for this one.</li>
            <li>The plastic around the on/off switch and light is a large platform (instead of a small step like one)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The flat iron is much lighter than a normal CHI</li>
            <li>And the on and off switch didn&#x27;t have a little step from the light.</li>
            <li>This obviously wasn&#x27;t a real Chi.</li>
            <li>So far I have not noticed any hair damage or breakage,</li>
            <li>Naturally I had already thrown out the box, etc.</li>
            <li>Vendor was completely unhelpful with my problem.</li>
            <li>Last time I spend that much money on something over the internet.  </li>
            <li>spend the extra dollar and get a real one at folica.com    </li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for a young adult.</li>
            <li>The price that I paid was far below anything I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>It has the word \\&quot;Caribbean\\&quot; printed on it near the cord (odd)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>on this one its some kind of thick plastic material that doesnt distribute the heat evenly enough to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>Also, the chi name has totally rubbed off the iron, something that has never happened to my older iron(4 years old) or those of my daughters.</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron really straightens and smooths hair.  </li>
            <li>I suspect this flat iron may not be an authentic Chi brand, but an imitation labeled as such?</li>
            <li>Before it broke it took twice as long to straighten my hair as the much cheaper Conair 2\\&quot; Professional that you can get at Target.  </li>
            <li>i had been using my moms same model chi straightener before it accidentally slammed against the counter top and stopped working a few months ago, and i just had to order the same chi model.</li>
            <li>but I really like my new (long lasting) \\&quot;soft\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>I was about to finish my hair and all of a sudden the little light went out</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron to replace an older 2\\&quot; chi that was still working.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in July and after barely any use and not even getting close to dropping it, it has just stopped working!</li>
            <li>It doesnt get real hot, and takes 2 times longer to do your hair than usual.</li>
            <li>I finally bought my Houston daughter another one, and she has reported no problems with it so far, and has had it for about a month.</li>
            <li>The only difference that I do not like is that it is a 35W instead of 40W like my old Chi.</li>
            <li>I can only hope the product wasn&#x27;t cheapened and will last as long as my first one.</li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacture directly to see if they could help and they said it would have to go back to the supplier.</li>
            <li>and it barely straightens my hair....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly thick hair, and this straightener is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually gets my hair straight in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>it doesnt pull your hair like other flat irons and it leaves your hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>I will stick with cheap flat irons from here on out, not worth the money if it only lasts a few months.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s probably better than a Conair or Remington</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I wish I had know that I would not be able to change the degree of heat on this iron.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you buy from a dealer that is on the dealer locate list from the manufacture.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to get hotter and worked better</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered this one online thinking it was an authentic CHI product on sale.</li>
            <li> Glad.</li>
            <li> My mother has an off brand that she bought from Sally Beauty Supply and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li> I always thought of Amazon as a safe reputable company</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I am just not truly sure I received what I thought I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love my CHI  </li>
            <li> and we are both satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I really love this straightener.</li>
            <li> Grand daughters love this :)</li>
            <li> I have had this product for many years</li>
            <li> My mother has a CHI as well, but for some reason mine is hotter and works more efficiently.</li>
            <li> It works FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Stay away you will be better off.</li>
            <li> I had one that lasted more than 5 years until my son dropped it.</li>
            <li> I have this for almost  two years, love it ðŸ’›</li>
            <li> I will stick with Paul Mitchell:)</li>
            <li> I love it, and I don&#x27;t go a day without using it.</li>
            <li> Better off spending the money and getting the nicer model</li>
            <li> i absolutely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> The best flat iron my wife has ever had, and does wonders for her hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m never without it!) and unpack it as the first thing when I get home so it will be good to go when I need</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than 8 years, and it&#x27;s still going strong with no end in sight.</li>
            <li> It was convenient and easy, and until this purchase, I was completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It was a good flat iron and it was a good price</li>
            <li> So much better than the cheap straighteners you can find at target, etc.</li>
            <li> I inspected this one from top to bottom comparing it to my original Chi that I bought probably 6-7 years ago.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use every single day and very good on hair.</li>
            <li> However, after 2 yrs still working just fine.</li>
            <li> I think this Chi will do fine.</li>
            <li> It takes me less than 10 minutes to do my hair now, and it comes out looking perfect and feeling like silk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get very hot, so I make sure to keep it out of reach of my children.</li>
            <li> This is good, though, because it has enough heat to do the job quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> The light wouldn&#x27;t turn on and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift years later still works great</li>
            <li> she loves it and easy to clean</li>
            <li> cheap components.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing is how quickly and easily my return was.</li>
            <li> I have been using the CHI for 10 years and my original one broke</li>
            <li> It just does not work as the original.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied this is not a fake.</li>
            <li> No where on the original Chi does it say it is ionic.</li>
            <li> Whether they want to admit it or not, most do need to hold the end of the iron while doing hair and while it straightens wonderfully</li>
            <li> However, the one I received in the mail is not at all like the original model I was replacing.</li>
            <li> the light blinks differently and the heat isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li> came right off with the wipe of a hand!</li>
            <li> (They didn&#x27;t even come in a full Chi box).</li>
            <li> I would have loved to send it back for my money, but thinking it was a CHI</li>
            <li> Full refund, which made my day.</li>
            <li> She loved it...until it broke, 6 months later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a full refund and will search elsewhere.</li>
            <li> When testing it, it heated quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great deal if it&#x27;s real (which my original CHI was from this exact same product page 5 years ago).</li>
            <li> I was searching for this for a long time and so glad that i was able to find it here</li>
            <li> When plugged in it makes a fast clicking sound and then trips the circuit.</li>
            <li> Well worth the moeney.</li>
            <li> Definately worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is so worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my third straightener of this kind in maybe 7 years.</li>
            <li> and when I flat iron my hair it is perfectly smooth, love it.</li>
            <li> This one is a lot lighter than the original one and it doesn&#x27;t heat up as much.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> I knew the price was too good to be true; what a waste.</li>
            <li> The straighteners work just fine, but don&#x27;t be fooled-these are not brand new.</li>
            <li> I do not like this iron as it already seems to be chipping on the sides after less than a year of use and with good care given.</li>
            <li> If the price seems too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY GENTLE ON MY HAIR-</li>
            <li> They were very fast in their delivery.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I ordered something for amazon, and I will give it another chance.</li>
            <li> I purchased these irons and got a notice from Amazon that the actual Farouk company made them aware that the seller was not selling an authentic product.  </li>
            <li> They work ok, but definitely are not a Chi product.  </li>
            <li> At first I was worried that the heat might damage my hair, but that hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li> This was bought from Customer First through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it worked only once, but I wish it would have been better for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t seem that hot to me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mediocre at best, and broke.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Not as hot as Chi from 5 years ago</li>
            <li> The light would just dim when it was turned off not turn all the way off.</li>
            <li> but it is too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> It does not straighten as fast or as well!</li>
            <li> casing on the original chi is heavy and heats up so that you can curl your hair very easily.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast, but that doesn&#x27;t matter much when the product is trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other irons that my friends own, and nothing compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to use my flat iron ONCE.  </li>
            <li> Well I am glad you asked about this product (Ceramic Flat Iron Gf1001 by CHI) that I purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> My friends have CHI flat irons and they work much better than my $20 Revlon model.  </li>
            <li> the item was a knock off, I sent it back and bought the real thing from the mall, and now I am in love with CHI</li>
            <li> it is light, when the others are more heavy.</li>
            <li> However, I got to keep them and they are better than my normal 15.00 flat irons   ;-)</li>
            <li> When the Chi flat iron first came out I purchased this model and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the iron does not get as hot as my older one.</li>
            <li> is to hold but the Chi Ceramic Flat Iron works better than most other flat irons I have used and and leaves my hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Still working great after having it a few years and using it daily!</li>
            <li> but it just seems so cheaply made compared to the last CHI I purchased 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> but they advertised it as the real thing.</li>
            <li> AND REALLY DID MAKE MY HAIR QUITE SHINY.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> but the heat manages to fully straighten my curly hair very well.</li>
            <li> very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a much softer look.   </li>
            <li> I took that refund and went straight to ULTA and purchased a REAL CHI like I should have in the beginning.</li>
            <li> and I am very upset given the price.</li>
            <li> and this one doesnt seem like a real one.</li>
            <li> no the real CHI.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing</li>
            <li> The LED light is red (not clear)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I wondered how I was able to buy the product so much cheaper than other sites.</li>
            <li> Moral of the story is, buy the original product instead of wasting money on a product that will break soon after you buy it.</li>
            <li> I owned a real Farouk Chi straightener in high school that I bought at a salon and</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to get a chi, just using the cheap ones until then.  </li>
            <li> Now the new one&#x27;s ceramic plates are chipping off and thus burning my hair!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> and it was the chepest here on this website and the exact same quality as the higher priced websites.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even heat up very hot in the short time it worked.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This one is strange because it heats up fine, but then literally starts to cool down during ONE pass of your hair.  </li>
            <li> This particular CHI was not as hot as the last one I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> Other products are available that do what they say.</li>
            <li> The plates are chipping and now I need to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I suggest anyone who wants a real chi iron to do the same!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy as the original, the red light blinks less rapidly, and it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the first one I owned.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that this was a fake, but I&#x27;ll tell you the packaging looked like a photocopy of the original CHI box and after only a few weeks the plates melted off of the iron and onto my hair - burning a nice chunk of my hair off with it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that I bought a knock-off last year until I started searching for a new CHI and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> never got hot enough to straighten the hair</li>
            <li> So, when my Chi died recently I got on Amazon to purchase one exactly like it.</li>
            <li> Flat iron worked fine until it was out of warranty period and developed internal break in power cord.  </li>
            <li> I went to the Farouk website to find an approved retailer near me and bought a real one for only a little more then what I paid for this one.</li>
            <li> The plastic around the on/off switch and light is a large platform (instead of a small step like one)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The flat iron is much lighter than a normal CHI</li>
            <li> And the on and off switch didn&#x27;t have a little step from the light.</li>
            <li> This obviously wasn&#x27;t a real Chi.</li>
            <li> So far I have not noticed any hair damage or breakage,</li>
            <li> Naturally I had already thrown out the box, etc.</li>
            <li> Vendor was completely unhelpful with my problem.</li>
            <li> Last time I spend that much money on something over the internet.  </li>
            <li> spend the extra dollar and get a real one at folica.com    </li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for a young adult.</li>
            <li> The price that I paid was far below anything I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> It has the word \\&quot;Caribbean\\&quot; printed on it near the cord (odd)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> on this one its some kind of thick plastic material that doesnt distribute the heat evenly enough to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the chi name has totally rubbed off the iron, something that has never happened to my older iron(4 years old) or those of my daughters.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron really straightens and smooths hair.  </li>
            <li> I suspect this flat iron may not be an authentic Chi brand, but an imitation labeled as such?</li>
            <li> Before it broke it took twice as long to straighten my hair as the much cheaper Conair 2\\&quot; Professional that you can get at Target.  </li>
            <li> i had been using my moms same model chi straightener before it accidentally slammed against the counter top and stopped working a few months ago, and i just had to order the same chi model.</li>
            <li> but I really like my new (long lasting) \\&quot;soft\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> I was about to finish my hair and all of a sudden the little light went out</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace an older 2\\&quot; chi that was still working.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in July and after barely any use and not even getting close to dropping it, it has just stopped working!</li>
            <li> It doesnt get real hot, and takes 2 times longer to do your hair than usual.</li>
            <li> I finally bought my Houston daughter another one, and she has reported no problems with it so far, and has had it for about a month.</li>
            <li> The only difference that I do not like is that it is a 35W instead of 40W like my old Chi.</li>
            <li> I can only hope the product wasn&#x27;t cheapened and will last as long as my first one.</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacture directly to see if they could help and they said it would have to go back to the supplier.</li>
            <li> and it barely straightens my hair....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick hair, and this straightener is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually gets my hair straight in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> it doesnt pull your hair like other flat irons and it leaves your hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> I will stick with cheap flat irons from here on out, not worth the money if it only lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> Trust me, if you have thick hair, this is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This has took the frizzes down to nothing in my hair and the straight last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that people are no longer honest and do not say that they are selling an imitation.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does not heat up therefore it takes double the amount of time to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if the actual device is a Chi flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> then we noticed the red chi logo was burgandi on her flat iron.</li>
            <li> the return period is over so for my next flat iron i wont be buying it from amazon</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron before and they would last 2 - 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my Revlon flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is small enough to pack for travel</li>
            <li> It now takes me twice as long to do my hair in the morning because I have to go over the same sctions multiple times.</li>
            <li> It weighs significantly less than my authentic (but broken)</li>
            <li> For Christmas I got both my daughters this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s lasting this long with the amount of use</li>
            <li> i will never stray away from chi flat irons.</li>
            <li> B000F1EXIE CHI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Style Flat Iron by Farouk - Black/ Gold]]</li>
            <li> I am now using a drug store flat iron that cost 18.99.  </li>
            <li> I bought a CHI Flat Iron and after three uses, literally 3</li>
            <li> i have used another Flat iron CHI.</li>
            <li> It doesnt get my ends as flat as it should.</li>
            <li> Therefore you have to wait a few minutes between each section of hair if you want it to be at its max heat potential..which is important if you have either thick or wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> this product does not leave my hair looking gross like other flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of CHI Flat Iron&#x27;s before and this last one that I ordered was NOT a real CHI!</li>
            <li> I had a REAL Chi for 6 years before I had any trouble with it (and the only trouble was the cord).</li>
            <li> Both have lasted as long as mine.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I just purchased a laptop computer (Lenovo) this past weekend and was too afraid to make a big purchase like this from Amazon because of what happened with this flat iron (which thank God was under $100).  </li>
            <li> And by reasonable, I mean about an hour.</li>
            <li> There was no response from the other end after several attempts.</li>
            <li> CHI and other Farouk Systems products are only sold through authorized salon retailers, and Amazon is not one of them.</li>
            <li> It does not straighten the hair well and let&#x27;s the hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> and she told me it was leaving her hair dry.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Although the product was listed as \\&quot;new,\\&quot; it is obvious that both straighteners were previously used.</li>
            <li> item is definitely not as good as the old Chi we had for the last 5-6 years!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second CHI in a little over a year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I only got to use this for a little over a week before the power started going out.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A REAL CHI.</li>
            <li> i flat iron my hair almost everyday and</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking, probably something wrong with this product jugding from price.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase anything from Todayz Dealz through Amazon.com or any other.</li>
            <li> but it seems that you aren&#x27;t any safer than any other company on the internet.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other brand  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> there is no heat setting, other than burning your hair...</li>
            <li> Be careful who you buy from!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Chi straighteners before and this one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the other ones.</li>
            <li> I am just hoping that the next time I order something it wont be so late.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a fake and it nothing like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I was worried when I got my new Chi due to all the reviews about the fake Chi&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> It worked for less than 2 weeks and then wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and have had it less than 6 months, the plates are chipping and it is turning black.</li>
            <li> The previous CHI I had purchased lasted for 2-3 years until it broke</li>
            <li> I SERIOUSLY don&#x27;t see what the fuss is about on this flat iron...</li>
            <li> my little sister used to use it and drop it all the time</li>
            <li> It stopped working a few weeks ago which is abnormal for any hair straightener,</li>
            <li> My daughter in Houston reported that hers didn&#x27;t work after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The iron arrived within a few days of my placing the order.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a genuine product.</li>
            <li> There were a few differences</li>
            <li> #34;Product is not a genuine Farouk Systems Inc item.&amp;#34; It would seem this product is a clone knock off.</li>
            <li> It was shipped immediately and arrived at my door a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste my money again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smooth at all, it pulls at your hair as you pull it through.</li>
            <li> I have another flat iron that&#x27;s even worse, so I opted to give this two stars.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I had my other Chi for about 3 years and figured it would be taking a crap on me pretty soon.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what happened</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Chi redid model</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;ve been sold a fake version, but either way this &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; is not worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to check for signs of fake products and return if necessary.</li>
            <li> Power cord, which should last indefinitely, is very poorly designed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind a couple of days late, but we are on june 2 and is still not here.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Disgusting that we spent so much money on this \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> Brand new  :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product and can&#x27;t believe that it is a real CHI.  </li>
            <li> it is frustrating</li>
            <li> That could have just been me, but that could have been poor knock-off design.</li>
            <li> Farouk refuses to send replacement cord at any cost so my wife now has a worthless $100 flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately you cannot return it, and there is no warranty.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product 4 months ago and it&#x27;s already broken!</li>
            <li> After using a Chi flatiron, it is difficult to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Sorry, no recommendation here.</li>
            <li> it was a fake until I returned it to Chi</li>
            <li> She started to noticed split ends and that it had a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> sad</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I made the mistake of buying this via Amazon and letting it sit in the box unopened for 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either this is a outright fake or the company who mfg&#x27;s it is using</li>
            <li> im sad to say it worked for about 3 minutes, then quit.</li>
            <li> I think this must be a fake</li>
            <li> i tought it is a fake one.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> This item didnt work after 8 months of use, it was expensive and really bad quality.</li>
            <li> and my iron went cold.  </li>
            <li> This item is fake, do not buy it!</li>
            <li> Fake chi!</li>
            <li> I am truly disappointed with this product that I have been using.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> A FAKE!!</li>
            <li> Well we noticed that it was FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will never buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever tried to use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> and it is terrible.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m guessing its just a change in the way to company is making the product, it seems to be the legit product but it just seems so cheaply made compared to the last CHI I purchased 5 years ago.  The plastic seems cheaper and flimsy and doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up as well.  HOWEVER the seller was excellent in delivery times and was great!</li>
            <li> I have been using the CHI for 10 years and my original one broke so I purchased this one...AND IT IS NOT THE SAME!!!! It just does not work as the original. It does not straighten the hair well and let&#x27;s the hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Hi I just want to say that I ordered my merchandise on may 17 and was told it would be here around the 25th I didn&#x27;t mind a couple of days late, but we are on june 2 and is still not here. I am just hoping that the next time I order something it wont be so late.  I am still gonna shop here again this is the first time I ordered something for amazon, and I will give it another chance.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 Chi straighteners from this website, and they originally only sent one. I had to email them again to have the second one sent. Although the product was listed as \\&quot;new,\\&quot; it is obvious that both straighteners were previously used. (They didn&#x27;t even come in a full Chi box). The straighteners work just fine, but don&#x27;t be fooled-these are not brand new.</li>
            <li> Great deal for price! At first I was thinking, probably something wrong with this product jugding from price. However, after 2 yrs still working just fine. You don&#x27;t have to use every single day and very good on hair.</li>
            <li> Bought a hair straightener 6 months ago. It stopped working a few weeks ago which is abnormal for any hair straightener, let alone one you use once a week. Contacted buyer and never got a response.</li>
            <li> This obviously wasn&#x27;t a real Chi. It worked for less than 2 weeks and then wouldn&#x27;t turn on. The light wouldn&#x27;t turn on and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. Very disappointed and will never buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I purchased these irons and got a notice from Amazon that the actual Farouk company made them aware that the seller was not selling an authentic product.  Kudos to Amazon.com for not only notifying me, but refunding ALL of my money.  They work ok, but definitely are not a Chi product.  However, I got to keep them and they are better than my normal 15.00 flat irons   ;-)</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and have had it less than 6 months, the plates are chipping and it is turning black. I had a REAL Chi for 6 years before I had any trouble with it (and the only trouble was the cord). I am truly disappointed with this product that I have been using. It is unfortunate that people are no longer honest and do not say that they are selling an imitation. I may have purchased it anyway even if it was a knock off but they advertised it as the real thing. If you are looking for a good deal on a Chi you&#x27;d be better to buy from someone reputable. This seller is not.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron my wife has ever had, and does wonders for her hair</li>
            <li> For Christmas I got both my daughters this flat iron.  My daughter in Houston reported that hers didn&#x27;t work after a few weeks.  The daughter living at home has reported no problems with hers.  I finally bought my Houston daughter another one, and she has reported no problems with it so far, and has had it for about a month. Wish we knew where to send a defective one!</li>
            <li> The iron arrived within a few days of my placing the order. It was in excellent condition and I love using it.  I would definintely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so sometimes it doesn not want to hold the style that I wish is to hold but the Chi Ceramic Flat Iron works better than most other flat irons I have used and and leaves my hair silky and smooth.  So far I have not noticed any hair damage or breakage, A BIG PLUS.</li>
            <li> I was searching for this for a long time and so glad that i was able to find it here thank you very much i am enjoying it :-0</li>
            <li> I purchased this CHI straightening iron to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for the last 7 or 8 years until I accently dropped it.  This is definitely a fake and it nothing like the real thing.  It looks like it but the quality isn&#x27;t the same- the light blinks differently and the heat isn&#x27;t as good.  It&#x27;s probably better than a Conair or Remington but it&#x27;s no comparison to an actual CHI</li>
            <li> Worked great for about two weeks and then just stopped. Naturally I had already thrown out the box, etc. so I guess I&#x27;m just out the money. I knew the price was too good to be true; what a waste.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in July and after barely any use and not even getting close to dropping it, it has just stopped working! I owned a real Farouk Chi straightener in high school that I bought at a salon and my little sister used to use it and drop it all the time and it still worked for years! This is definitely not a genuine product.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase anything from Todayz Dealz through Amazon.com or any other. They sell defective products!!!  I recently purchased a Farouk Chi hair straightener and almost got electricuted from it. When plugged in it makes a fast clicking sound and then trips the circuit. Company says they are no longer selling items on here and won&#x27;t replace my $70.00 hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS CHI 2 TIMES.  IT WAS VERY GENTLE ON MY HAIR- AND REALLY DID MAKE MY HAIR QUITE SHINY. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this for me when I was in college, and I have been using it since then. It&#x27;s been more than 8 years, and it&#x27;s still going strong with no end in sight. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s lasting this long with the amount of use it&#x27;s had! Its quality is unmatched. I&#x27;ve tried other irons that my friends own, and nothing compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get very hot, so I make sure to keep it out of reach of my children. This is good, though, because it has enough heat to do the job quickly and effectively. It heats up quickly, which is a definite plus. At first I was worried that the heat might damage my hair, but that hasn&#x27;t happened. I take it on trips (in my carry on so I&#x27;m never without it!) and unpack it as the first thing when I get home so it will be good to go when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has one, and so does my sister. Both have lasted as long as mine. I will definitely buy another one of these when (or IF!) mine ever bites the dust.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I had my other Chi for about 3 years and figured it would be taking a crap on me pretty soon.  This flat iron does not heat up therefore it takes double the amount of time to straighten my hair.  DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER.  Unfortunately you cannot return it, and there is no warranty.  I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> This is my second CHI in a little over a year. This second CHI no longer works after only a month. I think that you should only buy this product from a certified retailer.</li>
            <li> When I would turn on this iron it would start to give a burning smell, when I contacted the seller, they replaced it for me. Now the new one&#x27;s ceramic plates are chipping off and thus burning my hair! This item is fake, do not buy it! I went to the Farouk website to find an approved retailer near me and bought a real one for only a little more then what I paid for this one. I suggest anyone who wants a real chi iron to do the same!</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron. I wish I had know that I would not be able to change the degree of heat on this iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace an older 2\\&quot; chi that was still working. I noticed that the iron does not get as hot as my older one. Also, the chi name has totally rubbed off the iron, something that has never happened to my older iron(4 years old) or those of my daughters. The name &#x27;global beauty network&#x27; is also beginning to rub off the iron. I suspect this flat iron may not be an authentic Chi brand, but an imitation labeled as such? I wondered how I was able to buy the product so much cheaper than other sites.</li>
            <li> This product pulled my hair when I used it. Must be something with the design on the corners that catches on hair. Vendor was completely unhelpful with my problem. I regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I got my new Chi due to all the reviews about the fake Chi&#x27;s being sold. I inspected this one from top to bottom comparing it to my original Chi that I bought probably 6-7 years ago. There were a few differences but when I went to the Farouk website, those changes were visible on their website Chi&#x27;s so I&#x27;m satisfied this is not a fake. When testing it, it heated quickly. It moved through my hair easily while doing a great job with straightening. The only difference that I do not like is that it is a 35W instead of 40W like my old Chi. Also, when Amazon advertises that it is an ionic product it is misleading. No where on the original Chi does it say it is ionic. There is however, an ionic iron made by infraTECH by Chi. It is not this one.  I think this Chi will do fine. I can only hope the product wasn&#x27;t cheapened and will last as long as my first one. This was bought from Customer First through Amazon. They were very fast in their delivery.</li>
            <li> it did not work upon arrival. There was no response from the other end after several attempts. I contacted the manufacture directly to see if they could help and they said it would have to go back to the supplier. i have found out that there are several counterfeits out there. Just make sure you buy from a dealer that is on the dealer locate list from the manufacture.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Chi before and it seemed to get hotter and worked better but this does alright just seems to take a lot longer</li>
            <li> I was able to use my flat iron ONCE.  I was about to finish my hair and all of a sudden the little light went out and my iron went cold.  I am not sure what happened but it didn&#x27;t work any more.  I would have loved to send it back for my money, but thinking it was a CHI, I thought I didn&#x27;t need the box to send it back.       I don&#x27;t know why it worked only once, but I wish it would have been better for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my surprise when after two months of using this item and wondering why it performed so well the CHI label faded away, that&#x27;s correct it faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is counterfeiting CHI products, something must be done!&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted them several times and no response, Amazon protection program has not responded either.  What must a consumer do to get their claims answered?</li>
            <li> i brought this product awhile ago finally used it and it barely straightens my hair....i should have returned it along time ago...it also pulls your hair out...it didn&#x27;t seem that hot to me</li>
            <li> This Chi is excellent! It works perfectly and leaves my hair very silky and shiny. It is the best straightener I have owned to date!</li>
            <li> When I received the straightener, it didn&#x27;t even work.  Last time I spend that much money on something over the internet.  I didn&#x27;t even get my money back for the money that it cost me to send the straightener back.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 4 months ago and it&#x27;s already broken! do not buy! I should have know because it was the cheaper one.</li>
            <li> This item didnt work after 8 months of use, it was expensive and really bad quality. I hear that chi was a good brand but no. I lost my money.</li>
            <li> The previous CHI I had purchased lasted for 2-3 years until it broke and I ordered this one online thinking it was an authentic CHI product on sale. To my disappointment,the straightener broke only 2 months after the purchase. Moral of the story is, buy the original product instead of wasting money on a product that will break soon after you buy it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Flat iron worked fine until it was out of warranty period and developed internal break in power cord.  Farouk refuses to send replacement cord at any cost so my wife now has a worthless $100 flat iron.  Power cord, which should last indefinitely, is very poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Works great! Heats up really fast. Have been looking for a good chi for years! Glad. I finally found this one.</li>
            <li> Well I am glad you asked about this product (Ceramic Flat Iron Gf1001 by CHI) that I purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  I was very disappointed with this product and can&#x27;t believe that it is a real CHI.  CHI is a great product and that&#x27;s not what I received.  My mother has an off brand that she bought from Sally Beauty Supply and it works so much better.  I always thought of Amazon as a safe reputable company but it seems that you aren&#x27;t any safer than any other company on the internet.  I have done my Christmas shopping with Amazon for 2 years.  It was convenient and easy, and until this purchase, I was completely satisfied.  I have to be honest, I just purchased a laptop computer (Lenovo) this past weekend and was too afraid to make a big purchase like this from Amazon because of what happened with this flat iron (which thank God was under $100).  Who knows if I would have received a quality product or not.  Thank you for letting me share my frustration/opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela Brooks</li>
            <li> This product is not what i thought it was going to be. It doesnt get real hot, and takes 2 times longer to do your hair than usual.</li>
            <li> Bought this product 3 months ago the coating on the iron started pealing. I sent the product back to the factory per the instructions that came with it. The factory returned it with a note saying &amp;#34;Product is not a genuine Farouk Systems Inc item.&amp;#34; It would seem this product is a clone knock off. Need I say more? No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Fake chi! I got it for my girlfriend and the white letters came right off with the wipe of a hand! spend the extra dollar and get a real one at folica.com    casing on the original chi is heavy and heats up so that you can curl your hair very easily. on this one its some kind of thick plastic material that doesnt distribute the heat evenly enough to curl your hair. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the actual device is a Chi flat Iron.  I know it came in a CHI box but that is it.  Nothing else says CHI and I only had it for one month the words on the actual iron rubbed off in like a week.  I am just not truly sure I received what I thought I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> I do not like this iron as it already seems to be chipping on the sides after less than a year of use and with good care given.</li>
            <li> I love my CHI  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other brand  I have been using it for two years and it  is still in impecable condition....and best yet....my hair is looking great.  My daughter and I use it daily and we are both satisfied.  I wish all CHI products would come with an auto shut off system when the iron is not in motion for a set amount of time.  Other than that i absolutely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> After using a Chi flatiron, it is difficult to use anything else. Purchased as a gift for a young adult. She loved it.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best hot irons on the market. Well worth the moeney. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> the item was a knock off, I sent it back and bought the real thing from the mall, and now I am in love with CHI</li>
            <li> It works great for a low price I love my chi!!! I recommend this product highly amazon is the best. I looked every where and it was the chepest here on this website and the exact same quality as the higher priced websites.</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener. It takes me less than 10 minutes to do my hair now, and it comes out looking perfect and feeling like silk. Definately worth every penny. Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world.</li>
            <li> Grand daughters love this :)</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone! It is so worth the money. I have had this product for many years and when I flat iron my hair it is perfectly smooth, love it.</li>
            <li> It was a good flat iron and it was a good price but the cord came undone about 4 months after using it and I actually got an electrical shock from it, at which point my husband made me throw it out. I will stick with cheap flat irons from here on out, not worth the money if it only lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> This is the best CHI I&#x27;ve ever bought. My mother has a CHI as well, but for some reason mine is hotter and works more efficiently. Awesome product, great price. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast, but that doesn&#x27;t matter much when the product is trash. I can&#x27;t say for sure that this was a fake, but I&#x27;ll tell you the packaging looked like a photocopy of the original CHI box and after only a few weeks the plates melted off of the iron and onto my hair - burning a nice chunk of my hair off with it.</li>
            <li> I have another flat iron that&#x27;s even worse, so I opted to give this two stars.  Before it broke it took twice as long to straighten my hair as the much cheaper Conair 2\\&quot; Professional that you can get at Target.  That one broke too after about a year or so, but for $20 I can stomach replacing it every year or two.  I actually had went back to find a replacement Conair but they were sold out, so in desperation I purchased this one.  I SERIOUSLY don&#x27;t see what the fuss is about on this flat iron... it&#x27;s mediocre at best, and broke.  Sorry, no recommendation here.</li>
            <li> i had been using my moms same model chi straightener before it accidentally slammed against the counter top and stopped working a few months ago, and i just had to order the same chi model. It works FANTASTIC! it doesnt pull your hair like other flat irons and it leaves your hair shiny and straight. there is only one setting, off and on but the heat manages to fully straighten my curly hair very well. i flat iron my hair almost everyday and this product does not leave my hair looking gross like other flat irons. also it cuts the time of straightening it works so well. i will never stray away from chi flat irons. deffinitley reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever tried to use. Does not do what is advertised and when I tried to return it for a refund I was refused and I only had it for 1 week. Stay away you will be better off. Other products are available that do what they say.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I had hoped for. It was shipped immediately and arrived at my door a few days after ordering. Wonderful service!</li>
            <li> There are alot of knock offs out there and because the price was 1/2 the price of Chi straightners in Canada I wondered if this was a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; but NO WAY!! Great straightner delivered in 3 days....awesome product and awesome service!! Will definitely be ordering from them again!  [[ASIN:B000F1EXIE CHI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Style Flat Iron by Farouk - Black/ Gold]]</li>
            <li> Not as hot as Chi from 5 years ago but it does what it needs and cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> A FAKE!! I had no idea it was a fake until I returned it to Chi and they told me. It broke within a 8 months. . .</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A REAL CHI. I bought my girlfriend one and she told me it was leaving her hair dry. She started to noticed split ends and that it had a weird smell to it. Well we noticed that it was FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!! The plates were different color from the picture on the box then we noticed the red chi logo was burgandi on her flat iron. The light would just dim when it was turned off not turn all the way off. Next to the on and off switch it didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;LED&amp;#34; writing. And the on and off switch didn&#x27;t have a little step from the light. PLESE DO NOT BUY IT.  IF YOU DID BUY IT NOTIFY THEM SO YOU COULD GET A REFUND.</li>
            <li> I had one that lasted more than 5 years until my son dropped it. This one is a lot lighter than the original one and it doesn&#x27;t heat up as much. I will get one from the salon next time. I don&#x27;t want to waste my money again.</li>
            <li> I have this for almost  two years, love it ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’›</li>
            <li> This broke within 2 months of purchase. Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift years later still works great she loves it and easy to clean just don&#x27;t drop it since it&#x27;s ceramic</li>
            <li> CHI and other Farouk Systems products are only sold through authorized salon retailers, and Amazon is not one of them. (This also includes CHI products sold at places like Target.) The warranty will be INVALID, meaning there is no guarantee on this product should it break, etc. Many make this mistake and think they can buy CHI products and styling tools online, but they are WRONG. If the price seems too good to be true, it usually is. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> My CHI model GF 1001 didn&#x27;t even last one year! The plates are chipping and now I need to buy a new one. I wasn&#x27;t aware that I bought a knock-off last year until I started searching for a new CHI and read the reviews. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> i bought the chi back in April 2012, and in the beginning of Feb 2012 it just stopped working, even though i took good care of it and never dropped it. Chi is normally a good product and loved the way it did my hair but i guess amazon sold me a defected one. the return period is over so for my next flat iron i wont be buying it from amazon</li>
            <li> This is my third straightener of this kind in maybe 7 years. It heats up fast and is small enough to pack for travel</li>
            <li> I owned another Chi before this one and loved it. Bought this one thinking I would get the same result...I was WRONG.  This one is strange because it heats up fine, but then literally starts to cool down during ONE pass of your hair.  Therefore you have to wait a few minutes between each section of hair if you want it to be at its max heat potential..which is important if you have either thick or wavy/curly hair.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron before and they would last 2 - 3 years.  This one would not heat after 5 months.  I am now using a drug store flat iron that cost 18.99.  It works great.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> there is no heat setting, other than burning your hair...It&#x27;s not smooth at all, it pulls at your hair as you pull it through. very unimpressed. I will stick with Paul Mitchell:) I guess I got what i paid for with this.</li>
            <li> This flat iron really straightens and smooths hair.  The price that I paid was far below anything I&#x27;ve seen. Nothing else to add.</li>
            <li> Whether they want to admit it or not, most do need to hold the end of the iron while doing hair and while it straightens wonderfully it is frustrating b/c I am one of those people who feel the extra pressure on the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; end of the iron is needed but it is too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick hair, and this straightener is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually gets my hair straight in a reasonable amount of time. And by reasonable, I mean about an hour. Trust me, if you have thick hair, this is worth the buy. So much better than the cheap straighteners you can find at target, etc.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of CHI Flat Iron&#x27;s before and this last one that I ordered was NOT a real CHI! It does not straighten as fast or as well! It was a waste of money! Be careful who you buy from!</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to get a chi, just using the cheap ones until then.  This has took the frizzes down to nothing in my hair and the straight last a long time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted one for Christmas so I ordered one to try out.. I thought I would pass it on if I didn&#x27;t like it. I love it, and I don&#x27;t go a day without using it. My hair is dry,thick and wavey. It gives my hair a much softer look.   It took a couple of pratice runs but I really like my new (long lasting) \\&quot;soft\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Chi straighteners before and this one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the other ones. I was highly disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> never got hot enough to straighten the hair so I returned it. Better off spending the money and getting the nicer model</li>
            <li> Great product, the best</li>
            <li> Lost the warranty paper or else I would return. Only had product for two weeks and already broke. Brand new  :( sad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a CHI for years and finally, after 6 years of use, mine died. So I ordered a new CHI online and thought I was getting an awesome deal for paying $50 for a CHI. Wrong. The quality is just not there. It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not great. The flat iron is much lighter than a normal CHI so it felt really different in my hand when straightening my hair. That could have just been me, but that could have been poor knock-off design. Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I only got to use this for a little over a week before the power started going out. The LED would shut off like it was an electrical issue from the cable or something.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing is how quickly and easily my return was. Full refund, which made my day. I took that refund and went straight to ULTA and purchased a REAL CHI like I should have in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Its awesome! My hair is shiny, i feel like i just walked out of the salon! My ends dont looked fried!Best investment ever!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I made the mistake of buying this via Amazon and letting it sit in the box unopened for 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;When my daughter finally started using it, it lasted only two weeks!. 2 weeks?!?!&lt;br /&gt;This item is definitely not as good as the old Chi we had for the last 5-6 years!&lt;br /&gt;Either this is a outright fake or the company who mfg&#x27;s it is using cheap components.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor any buy it locally through Ulta or the like.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this online or from a non-authorized dealer. You will regret it!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate this -5 stars....I bought a CHI Flat Iron and after three uses, literally 3, it just stopped working....I contacted the seller and they NEVER RESPONDED to my messages whatsoever. I will never buy from this person again.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with it. Still working great after having it a few years and using it daily!</li>
            <li> im sad to say it worked for about 3 minutes, then quit. it didn&#x27;t even heat up very hot in the short time it worked. but it did look like it was a orginal chi.</li>
            <li> My friends have CHI flat irons and they work much better than my $20 Revlon model.  However, I got this and it is terrible.  I went back to my Revlon flat iron.  I think this must be a fake and I am very upset given the price.</li>
            <li> the quality of the product was above my expectations. i have used another Flat iron CHI. and this one doesnt seem like a real one. it is light, when the others are more heavy. also it has dust, and seem used. i tought it is a fake one. no the real CHI.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and shipping speed</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She loved it...until it broke, 6 months later. Disgusting that we spent so much money on this \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; product. Once again, you pay for the name, and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> When the Chi flat iron first came out I purchased this model and it was fantastic. So, when my Chi died recently I got on Amazon to purchase one exactly like it. However, the one I received in the mail is not at all like the original model I was replacing. It&#x27;s not as heavy as the original, the red light blinks less rapidly, and it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the first one I owned. It now takes me twice as long to do my hair in the morning because I have to go over the same sctions multiple times. I&#x27;m not sure if Chi redid model or if I&#x27;ve been sold a fake version, but either way this &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; is not worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moQA5J99YI5ES8]]Proof of a fake:&lt;br /&gt;- The LED light is red (not clear)&lt;br /&gt;- The safety warnings are on a sticker (not engraved on the inside of the iron)&lt;br /&gt;- It has the word \\&quot;Caribbean\\&quot; printed on it near the cord (odd)&lt;br /&gt;- It weighs significantly less than my authentic (but broken) CHI&lt;br /&gt;- The plastic around the on/off switch and light is a large platform (instead of a small step like one)&lt;br /&gt;- It has \\&quot;Farouk Systems USA Made in USA\\&quot; and \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; engraved in the plastic handles (which CHI does not do)&lt;br /&gt;- It does not have a quality assurance sticker on it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal if it&#x27;s real (which my original CHI was from this exact same product page 5 years ago). Just be prepared to check for signs of fake products and return if necessary. I&#x27;m getting a full refund and will search elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This particular CHI was not as hot as the last one I purchased years ago. It doesnt get my ends as flat as it should. So I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
