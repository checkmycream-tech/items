            <li>love.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, but when buying shampoo in this quantity, it MUST come with a pump for the bottle....</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never recommended a product for me before, but he said that I&#x27;d love this.  </li>
            <li>Heavenly, light fragrance!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the matching conditioner from Davines.  </li>
            <li>Like many readers, I tried to picture what actor might portray the Harry Bosch that Michael Connelly created, not a Bosch that Hollywood would re-create</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite Davines product.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this for my color treated hair many years ago</li>
            <li>(BTW, I love the conditioner much better than the</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect magical results and do consider buying the conditioner.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll likely find this shampoo to be a great product for you, too!</li>
            <li>Wonderful shampoo that you can use daily.  </li>
            <li>It seems to help a bit with the static, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like it would work well for many hair types.</li>
            <li>I TRIED ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND LOVED IT, BUT I MUST NOT HAVE OREDERED THE RIGHT THING.</li>
            <li>really hope more episodes will be made  - soon !!</li>
            <li>My hair stays clean for days afterwards!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I have fine, somewhat greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>It does a fine job cleaning hair.</li>
            <li>smells fabulous, makes my hair shiny, silky and strong.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner, while indicating something to do with tomato -- don&#x27;t get scared off by that -- it smells so good, and makes your hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Best Shampoo, ever -- hands down!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos, but this one is by far the best line.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy, medium length hair that I get highlighted and this product works perfectly for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying various shampoos throughout the years, and most have been okay.  </li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because my hair looks fantastic for the first 10 hours after wash, but then thereafter it just starts to look greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It helps retain the color and overall health of my hair even over many years of using just this one shampoo!</li>
            <li>, the supporting characters -all feel right !</li>
            <li>This product not only smells amazing</li>
            <li>Very simple design of the products, but the most important thing it&#x27;s not the butte</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of shampoos, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>love the smell and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nou Nou for about a month, and it&#x27;s the first time I can actually say I really love a shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to out myself right now: I dye my hair, and have been doing it for years.  </li>
            <li>He was right.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try them for the first time because of their natural ingredients and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair with some loose waves on top layers.</li>
            <li>Mother Nature gave me dishwater blonde hair, which was obviously a mistake, since my skin is much more suited to a nice auburn.      </li>
            <li>Tried at my hair salon, this lovely shampoo is light, creamy, and has a soft, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been struggling to find an effective shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair either greasy or dry.  </li>
            <li>I have very, very straight and silky hair</li>
            <li>;) )</li>
            <li>Even better, it helps keep my red from fading.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased both Davine&#x27;s Illuminating shampoo and conditioner and have been pleased with both.  </li>
            <li>Recently introduced to this shampoo and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Worked great on my long, colored coarse hair!</li>
            <li>My blonde hair is highlighted and fine.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and I received it extremely fast (within a 2-3 days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally fine, flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li>And, it smells like live roses!  </li>
            <li>I found these products to leave my hair gently cleansed but with body and a new feel of almost virgin-like hair.  </li>
            <li>this time.&lt;br /&gt;the roots of my hair used to get oily fast, but ever since I switched to this shampoo, my hair stayed fresh all day with enough moisture for drier ends.</li>
            <li>and I only just recently (end of October 2013) had to purchase more.</li>
            <li>The masks, conditions and shampoos are high quality products.</li>
            <li>My hair is normal,</li>
            <li>blow dried and flat ironed almost every day, but this shampoo (plus the matching conditioner) leaves my hair soft and clean without stripping the color, and my hair looks and feels healthy despite all the bleach and heat it&#x27;s received.  </li>
            <li>Even on my short pixie hair, mind you that I have fine European hair</li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser says my hair is healthier since I&#x27;ve been using this product, and she&#x27;s pretty picky about these things (and entirely capable of making me change shampoos if she&#x27;s not happy with what I&#x27;m using, as has happened many times).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but it&#x27;s too nourishing for my hair, making it look flat and greasy by the end of the day (and normally I go every other day just fine).</li>
            <li>I used to buy them from Beauty Supply and finally found it in Amazon much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very thin,but will be a re-order.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>agree with those that were pleasantly surprised by the choice of Titus Welliver as Harry.  </li>
            <li>The long lasting fresh scent is also a PLUS.</li>
            <li>But, again, it cleans your long hair very well anyways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This volume really requires a pump and since its such a specific one, I don&#x27;t think I can order again online.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use a small amount and to apply a second time - both are TRUE!</li>
            <li>As most other reviewers wrote, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather --probably because it lacks those harsh chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like this shampoo and have stuck with it for a very long time compare to my older shampoos.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this/these products if you have hair that requires a little extra moisture but not too much</li>
            <li>(otherwise your hair looks greasy or won&#x27;t style due to too much moisturizing-type products) and</li>
            <li>size is well worth the money considering the small bottles go for $20-25 and are only 8 ounces.</li>
            <li>and I agree that if you have long hair, it is kind of difficult to work it through your hair.</li>

            <li> My hair is silky soft but doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> I just blow dry and flat iron daily.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love with Davines product. Very simple design of the products, but the most important thing it&#x27;s not the butte but what&#x27;s in it. I tried so many things from Davines and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. I used to buy them from Beauty Supply and finally found it in Amazon much cheaper. The masks, conditions and shampoos are high quality products.</li>
            <li> I have what I like to call \\&quot;independent\\&quot; hair - some days it&#x27;s curly, some days it&#x27;s flat, sometimes it&#x27;s in between.  I&#x27;ve been using henna and hair die for years now (going on a decade!) and I&#x27;ve been struggling to find an effective shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair either greasy or dry.  Due to the damage inflicted by dying, I also like to avoid blow-drying and other chemical treatments.    This shampoo is PERFECT for me.  I wash, and that&#x27;s it.  I brush my damaged and fussy hair, and then leave the house (yes, with wet hair).  It dries looking shiny and soft, it feels wonderful, and since I&#x27;ve been using this product I get compliments on my hair.  I don&#x27;t even have to use the conditioner!    The price is a bit steep, so when I&#x27;m out of money for the month I end up using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Almond soap that I use for the rest of me in the shower, but I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.  I would, though, suggest getting the smaller quantity unless you&#x27;ve tried it before.  After all, what works for one type of hair can be completely wrong for another, and if this doesn&#x27;t work for you you&#x27;ll end up with months of shampoo that you don&#x27;t use.    (Hey, if you don&#x27;t like it, contact me!  I&#x27;ll buy it from you at a discounted price so you don&#x27;t loose ALL of your money ;) )</li>
            <li> love this product...  smells fabulous, makes my hair shiny, silky and strong.  love.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for color treated hair,I also have fine hair.The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very thin,but will be a re-order.I also use the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, but when buying shampoo in this quantity, it MUST come with a pump for the bottle....that is the least the company should do for the price of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair has been bleached and dyed numerous times, and it&#x27;s blow dried and flat ironed almost every day, but this shampoo (plus the matching conditioner) leaves my hair soft and clean without stripping the color, and my hair looks and feels healthy despite all the bleach and heat it&#x27;s received.  Even my hair dresser says my hair is healthier since I&#x27;ve been using this product, and she&#x27;s pretty picky about these things (and entirely capable of making me change shampoos if she&#x27;s not happy with what I&#x27;m using, as has happened many times).  I&#x27;ve tried lots of shampoos, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to out myself right now: I dye my hair, and have been doing it for years.  Mother Nature gave me dishwater blonde hair, which was obviously a mistake, since my skin is much more suited to a nice auburn.      I&#x27;ve been trying various shampoos throughout the years, and most have been okay.  When my salon started carrying this, my colourist recommended it to me.  He&#x27;s never recommended a product for me before, but he said that I&#x27;d love this.  He was right.  This shampoo and its matching conditioner ([[ASIN:B000V193RY Davines Conditioner, NouNou Illluminating with Tomato Extract for Colour Treated Hair]]) are perfect for my hair.  They leave my hair feeling great and easy to manage.  Even better, it helps keep my red from fading.  When my salon stopped carrying this, my colourist gave me the address of another nearby salon where he knew they had it.  Then I discovered that I could buy it here, and for a much better price than the salon!</li>
            <li> My salon uses the Davines line of products. My stylist washes my hair with Nou Nou and conditions it with Nou Nou as well. My hair always looks great after my visit, and the Nou Nou has a nice light smell that lingers for the rest of the day. My hair stays clean for days afterwards! But the product is way too expensive for what it is. Not a miracle product, just a darn good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and the Nounou hair mask also by Davines. I have long, coarse hair which is colored.  The shampoo leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  It&#x27;s a great value</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t packaged good a quarter of it spilled out. Have bought this product before, but at target and loved it. The coloring was different as well as the smell. Wonder if shampoo can go bad. Think I will stick to buying it a Target.</li>
            <li> Just like the conditioner it&#x27;s an amazing product. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos, but this one is by far the best line. I add 25% water to my shampoo to cut down on the buildup- which gives me an extra no-wash day. It smells great and makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shampoo I have ever used! Cleans so well and does not weigh hair down at all. Heavenly, light fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 bottles of 8 oz already, so i decided to pick up a larger bottle this time.&lt;br /&gt;the roots of my hair used to get oily fast, but ever since I switched to this shampoo, my hair stayed fresh all day with enough moisture for drier ends. In addition, I put a small dab of dry powder for 2nd day hair and (3rd day hair if needed). The long lasting fresh scent is also a PLUS. Love it. My only complain is the expensive price. $5-7 cheaper would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the matching conditioner from Davines.  I have fine, somewhat greasy hair.  This shampoo leaves my hair looking extremely healthy and smelling great.  I can usually go at least two or three days without having to wash it after using this product.  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I wish it came with the pump or at least offered an opportunity to add one to purchase. This volume really requires a pump and since its such a specific one, I don&#x27;t think I can order again online.</li>
            <li> It is a great shampoo. Leaves you hair shiny. Doesn&#x27;t dry out you hair. Still give you body and volume.</li>
            <li> First my only complaint - It was too short an episode !  I would have loved a pilot of 1 1/2 to 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with those that were pleasantly surprised by the choice of Titus Welliver as Harry.  He nailed it !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a fan of Harry Bosch since The Black Echo, followed by The Black Ice.  Like many readers, I tried to picture what actor might portray the Harry Bosch that Michael Connelly created, not a Bosch that Hollywood would re-create (See Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher) . Back in the 90&#x27;s I thought of Fred Ward or Robert Forster. Now in 2014, Titus Welliver IS Harry Bosch !&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue, the jazz background, the mementos in Harry&#x27;s home, the supporting characters -all feel right !&lt;br /&gt;I really hope more episodes will be made  - soon !!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. It makes my hair so silky and shiny without being greasy. I have thick, wavy, medium length hair that I get highlighted and this product works perfectly for my hair. My hairdresser recommended it to me almost a year ago and I&#x27;ve never went back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;This size is well worth the money considering the small bottles go for $20-25 and are only 8 ounces. This bottle lasts way longer than the smaller bottles which is a big plus! The seller shipped this product the same day as I ordered and I received it extremely fast (within a 2-3 days and I did not pay for expedited shipping). I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo, ever -- hands down!  Smells amazing, and makes your hair feel great!  The conditioner, while indicating something to do with tomato -- don&#x27;t get scared off by that -- it smells so good, and makes your hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I wanted my hair to look and feel the way it does when I leave a salon- just like what the other sellers had mentioned. My hair is normal, wavy- I don&#x27;t dye it or put product in it. I just blow dry and flat iron daily. I gave this 3 stars because my hair looks fantastic for the first 10 hours after wash, but then thereafter it just starts to look greasy. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but it&#x27;s too nourishing for my hair, making it look flat and greasy by the end of the day (and normally I go every other day just fine). I&#x27;m going to try to alternate with another shampoo in hopes of restoring the body and fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite Davines product. It does a fine job cleaning hair. Sort of has a man&#x27;s product scent</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical that this shampoo would work...other stuff you buy at the grocery store that claims to protect your color never really seemed to work that well.  I am happy to say that my brown hair stays that way...i do still have to watch out for color changes due to the sun though.</li>
            <li> This product not only smells amazing but it does wonders for your hair. I have very, very straight and silky hair but this product has actually given texture and body to it. AND you only have to use a little bit each time you wash your hair so this bottle should last you a very longtime even if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased both Davine&#x27;s Illuminating shampoo and conditioner and have been pleased with both.  I decided to try them for the first time because of their natural ingredients and have been pleased with the results.  My blonde hair is highlighted and fine.  I found these products to leave my hair gently cleansed but with body and a new feel of almost virgin-like hair.  I will be ordering them again.  You only need a small amount so the products will last a long time.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Recently introduced to this shampoo and my hair has never looked better.  When using together with the NouNou conditioner i have no more friz, and kinks.  My hair actually stays cleaner longer!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Worked great on my long, colored coarse hair! Works best when followed by the NouNou conditioner. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this for my color treated hair many years ago and I keep coming back to it. It helps retain the color and overall health of my hair even over many years of using just this one shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have used Davines products for a little over 2 yrs now. I have fine hair with some loose waves on top layers. I have gone from down-to-waist highlighted hair to pixie short and my hair is color treated now. As most other reviewers wrote, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather --probably because it lacks those harsh chemical ingredients. But it does the job and cleans regardless. It takes some time to get used to it and I agree that if you have long hair, it is kind of difficult to work it through your hair. But, again, it cleans your long hair very well anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally feel that it does nourish my hair, but I won&#x27;t suggest using this without the matching conditioner. Even on my short pixie hair, mind you that I have fine European hair, I would apply some conditioner, otherwise my hair will be a little stiff. (BTW, I love the conditioner much better than the shampoo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I found out that after a few months of using it, I need to switch to another shampoo (I alternate Melu and Nounou) to avoid itchy scalp. I am not sure why it happens, but when I switch the itchiness goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this shampoo and have stuck with it for a very long time compare to my older shampoos. Just don&#x27;t expect magical results and do consider buying the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I Love this shampoo!! The instructions say to use a small amount and to apply a second time - both are TRUE! I purchased the 8.75 oz container in December last year and I only just recently (end of October 2013) had to purchase more. I wash my hair 3-4x peer week and use the shampoo as recommended on the bottle. I use it with the Davines Nounou Moisturizing Repair Mask and my hair always feels healthily and smells great! I highly recommend trying this/these products if you have hair that requires a little extra moisture but not too much (otherwise your hair looks greasy or won&#x27;t style due to too much moisturizing-type products) and if your hair is color treated like mine is then you&#x27;ll likely find this shampoo to be a great product for you, too!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for colored hair.  It is costly, but you only need to use a very small amount.  It lasts a long time.  I will definitely buy it again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Tried at my hair salon, this lovely shampoo is light, creamy, and has a soft, natural fragrance. My hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo that you can use daily.  And, it smells like live roses!  A beautiful product.  Should ship with a pump, however.</li>
            <li> I have extremely difficult hair. It&#x27;s naturally fine, flat and lifeless. I dye it regularly and had a wave done last year. So it&#x27;s also damaged. It can look decent one day then terrible the next, even if I do nothing different. Whenever I find a product I like, it works for a few days then doesn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;work&#x27; after that. My scalp is oily, but my hair is really dry and static-y in the winter. It&#x27;s a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nou Nou for about a month, and it&#x27;s the first time I can actually say I really love a shampoo! My hair is silky soft but doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or greasy. It seems to help a bit with the static, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and the natural ingredients. It seems like it would work well for many hair types. As another reviewer suggested, I use a build-up remover once a week.</li>
            <li> I TRIED ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND LOVED IT, BUT I MUST NOT HAVE OREDERED THE RIGHT THING. THIS IS NOT THE SAME.</li>
