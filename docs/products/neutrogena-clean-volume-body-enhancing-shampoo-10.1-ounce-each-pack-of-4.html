            <li> I have used this product for years.  I love it!  It gives fine, limp hair more volume.  It does not dull the shine or weigh the hair down, as most other such products do.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena regular shampoo and use it once a week to remove conditioner build-up or chlorine. This version leaves the hair fuller and gives volume but still has that clean, shiny effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell as well. Men and women both can use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time this morning...Ill be using it again...it really did add volume...my hair looks and feels so much better!!</li>
            <li> I like all Neutrogena products and this is no exception. Very light fragrance. Rinses very clean. Perfect. (I&#x27;m a guy)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo, and you need only a little each time you use it. Give it a try.....</li>
            <li> I was crestfallen when this was not longer sold at Bed, Bath and Beyond, the last place we found it in a store. i have been using it for 10+ years, and hate the process of finding another shampoo that cleans as well as this one. Unfortunately, it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and it has become so hard to find.  Though the price was higher than I would expect to pay in a store, I was thrilled to find it available.  Very happy with prompt shipping and great packaging.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for fine hair</li>
            <li> Not what I expected :(</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN AND CLEANS EFFECTIVELEY.</li>
            <li> Discovered this shampoo at a hotel and had to have it. I have fine hair that can get oily and I get a great thorough wash from this shampoo.</li>
            <li> No not really. I was suppose to get a 4 pack but only got 1 bottle :(</li>
            <li> Does take away all that build up and leaves your hair squeaky clean.  I like to use it twice a month and if I am doing special updo&#x27;s often I might use it every week.  The conditioner is also great.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this off and on for years and occasionally I also do.  It is mild, adds a bit of volume.</li>
            <li> As described, product met all expectations.  Quick shipping.  Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> After submitting a disappointing review of my purchase experience with Echo Drugs, I was contacted within hours by a senior representative of the company who apologized for their mistake.

            <li> Wonderful shampoo, especially as I am sensitive to ingredients and fragrances. Leaves hair squeaky clean with lots of hair volume.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this on the recommendation of my cat&#x27;s breeder to use as a pet shampoo.  Worked beautifully and left their fur soft, glossy, and tangle free.</li>
            <li> wish i could find the conditioner.  really like this shampoo -- doesn&#x27;t weight hair down and smells great.  found it at a hotel and have been buying it ever since.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued!</li>
